I welcome Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins, assistant professor of social policy in UCD, and thank him for making himself available to meet the committee.  The committee is engaged with the Parliamentary Budget Office on its excellent report on tax expenditures and has also held meetings with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to discuss the issues raised.  Following on from that, the committee has issued a request for information to the Department and to the Revenue Commissioners seeking a number of summary tables of information on tax expenditures.  Today we wish to discuss a number of issues with Dr. Collins, including the importance of monitoring trends in tax expenditures and the best approach to carrying out parliamentary scrutiny of tax expenditures.</p><p>Before we hear Dr. Collins's opening statement, I wish to draw his attention to the position of privilege which applies to witnesses and to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded that under long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Collins to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to make a presentation on this topic.  I am an economist based at the school of social policy, social work and social justice at University College Dublin.  I was also a member of the 2008-2009 Commission on Taxation, and within the commission I chaired the subgroup which examined tax expenditure.  As a researcher, I am also part of an international research group focused on the links between taxation and social policy and within that, I focus on the often hidden role of the state in using the taxation system to encourage and support certain activities among individuals and corporates via tax expenditure.</p> <p>  I warmly welcome the committee&rsquo;s decision to give attention to the issue of tax expenditure.  Public policy analysis and discussions are often very limited when it comes to taxation issues, a focus which undermines the comprehensiveness and relevance of those considerations.  In particular, they can be overly focused on income taxation and as such ignore the other channels via which individuals, households and companies contribute to the State, most particularly via indirect taxes.  Similarly, they can often focus on the taxes and social insurance payments collected and ignore those which the State explicitly decides not to collect via tax expenditure.  Given that, it would be useful for the committee to consider the taxation side of the budget to be approximately &euro;80 billion to &euro;85 billion a year, comprising the taxes collected and taxes not collected due to the provision of various tax expenditures.  While we have good projections, within the most recent budgetary documentation from October 2018, of the expected tax to be collected, which will be approximately &euro;70.77 billion this year, we have less insight into the overall cost of the taxation that will not be collected as a result of the provision of tax expenditure.  However, given past history and the annual estimates from the Revenue Commissioners, this is likely to be in the order of &euro;10 billion to &euro;15 billion per annum.</p> <p>  Overall, given the importance of that revenue to support the running of the State, and the redistribution of resources, it is remarkable how little attention the policy-making system gives to the nature and stability of the overall taxation system.  Within that, as tax expenditure represents a large part of the system, the current focus of the committee is most welcome.  I sincerely hope that such a focus will become a recurring part of its work in the years and decades ahead.</p> <p>  Contributions to the committee from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and the recent report on tax expenditures from the Parliamentary Budget Office, mentioned by the Acting Chairman, have highlighted that there is some disagreement regarding what to count and what is and what is not a tax expenditure.  This was an issue the Commission on Taxation grappled with when it was established in 2008, and we resolved it by proposing the adoption of the OECD taxation definition, which was the first recommendation of the commission on the topic of tax expenditure.</p> <p>  That definition states that a tax expenditure is "a transfer of public resources that is achieved by reducing tax obligations with respect to a benchmark tax, rather than by direct expenditure".  There are many measures in the taxation system which technically reduce tax liabilities but are functional as part of the basic operation of the system, for example, inter-company transfers, transfers of maintenance payments between former spouses and methods to facilitate the interaction of individuals and companies with other taxation systems in other states.  These are technically tax relieving measures but they are in effect administrative measures which allow the tax system to function effectively.  Aside from these, where measures are adopted or provided to allow individuals and-or companies to reduce the tax bills below that which they would otherwise pay, this is a tax expenditure.  Therefore, simply put, a tax expenditure is a measure adopted as part of a budget or finance Bill which reduces the amount of tax that would be collected from individuals and firms with the intention of supporting certain activities, encouraging certain actions and-or assisting certain needs.</p><p>In all cases such measures are discretionary.  In other words it is up to policy makers to decide if these are worthwhile measures, both to introduce and to retain, as they have recurring annual costs.  Almost everybody would welcome a reduction in their total taxation contribution, but such discretionary reductions come at a cost to the overall tax take and shift the cost of supporting public services and redistributive policies onto those who do not benefit from these tax breaks.  It is important to ask if the provision of such tax relieving measures is in the broader interest of all taxpayers and of society in general.  It will always be in the benefit of the recipient, but that is not the question that those of us interested in, or involved with, public policy should be asking.</p><p> On the costs and scale of tax expenditure, there are a number of ways of assessing the cost of a tax expenditure.  The most intuitive is to estimate the immediate reduction in revenue to the State associated with the introduction of the measure, known as the revenue forgone method.  This is generally estimated by comparing the revenue expected under the current structure versus the revenue expected when the tax expenditure is in place.  In general, this assumes no change in the behaviour of individuals or firms and as such can give an exaggerated estimate of the cost of an expenditure.  However, it remains the most straightforward and most common international way of estimating tax expenditure costs.  One could spend a long time exploring the minutiae of possible behavioural change and possible long-term benefits and-or costs of a particular tax expenditure measure, but I would suggest sticking with the established revenue forgone method and noting that the costs it provides may somewhat exaggerate the final cost.</p><p> The information available to this select committee, and to Irish society in general, regarding tax expenditure measures has increased dramatically over the last decade.  When the Commission on Taxation commenced its work there was limited information on the annual costs but this has transformed following the work of the commission, revisions to the scale of information on tax expenditures published by the Revenue Commissioners, annual reports from the Department of Finance and requirements at European level that all countries report on the nature and scale of the tax resources they decide not to collect each year via tax expenditure.  As such, there is a new opportunity for committees such as this to engage with what was heretofore an inaccessible area of budgetary policy and resource allocation.</p><p> The most recent list of tax expenditures from the Revenue Commissioners lists a total of 120 tax-relieving measures.  Of these, I would classify approximately 106 measures as discretionary and the total cost of these measures in revenue forgone is &euro;21.4 billion per annum.  In many cases these measures are generally regarded as worthwhile and many do not need review, such as tax credits for individuals, couples, PAYE and self-employed workers.  Others are discretionary but have long-standing policy support, such as tax relief on child benefit payments, nursing home expenses and rent-a-room income, while others are discretionary and can be argued for and against, such as mortgage interest relief, and income tax reduction measures for high income foreign executives.</p><p> I would encourage the select committee to engage as follows with this issue.  It should request that the Department of Finance finalise a list of tax expenditure measures which are not part of the baseline, that is, the technical functioning of the tax system, and that it provides a report with the cost of these measures, in revenue forgone terms, to the select committee each year.  It should request that the Revenue Commissioners publish their annual tax expenditure cost data in a format that aligns with the list established by the Department of Finance.  This is likely to require the Revenue Commissioners to classify the tax-relieving measures they report upon into groups, including discretionary tax expenditures, benchmark tax-relieving measures, tax credits and allowances.  Third, and given the scale of resources involved, the select committee should review this list and the changes to its costs on an annual basis.  Even if all the discretionary tax expenditure measures are worthwhile, it is of merit for a committee like this, on behalf of the Oireachtas, to have oversight of the nature and distribution of these resources.</p><p> The select committee should engage each year with the Department of Finance following the publication of the various reviews of tax expenditure as part of the material which accompanies the annual budget.  Likewise, the committee should engage with other researchers who have examined tax expenditure issues.  For example, over the past two years Professor Gerry Hughes and I have undertaken a detailed examination of the costs, distribution and policy options around the large amount of recurring annual tax expenditure granted to support private pension savings.</p><p> The committee should select a theme each year and review the merits of each of the tax expenditure measures currently in existence under that theme.  Approaching the list of items in this way will make them more accessible and the exploration more intuitive.  The Commission on Taxation adopted the following categories to its assessment, and I suggest the committee should take a similar approach: children, housing, health, philanthropy, enterprise including farming, employment, savings and investments, and others.  In addition to this list, I would add capital allowances as an area deserving of particular focus given the resources involved.</p><p> The committee should also review the case made in the budget and Finance Bills, and in associated documentation, for the introduction of each new tax expenditure.  Both the Commission on Taxation and the Department of Finance have provided a useful set of criteria to assess the appropriateness of new measures and it would be appropriate for a committee such as this to consider if the measures as proposed and designed adhere to these criteria.</p><p> The decision of the select committee to focus on this issue is most welcome.  As mentioned by the Commission on Taxation, the OECD and others, resources allocated to tax expenditure are equivalent to resources allocated to direct expenditure.  Given that, there is a long overdue need for detailed Oireachtas oversight of these decisions.  Indeed, it was a recommendation of the Commission on Taxation and I hope the committee embraces the opportunity to provide greater insight and democratic oversight of this area of public policy.</p></speech>

The amounts allocated on tax expenditure are generally between 10% and 20%.  Is this the norm internationally?</p></speech>

It often boils down to quite technical decisions as to what we do and do not count as part of the overall suite of tax expenditure.  In my experience, I would say the Irish figures are medium to high relative to other countries.  We are similar to other countries in not asking questions about whether we should retain them or not.  It is interesting to look at the evolution of policies in other countries over time, which have given more focus to analysing the scale of these expenditures and made decisions as to whether to retain them, adapt them or continue them.  I would say we are at around mid-table or a bit above.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#D00400"><p>Dr. Collins made a number of recommendations and we will certainly look at them.  One of them is to request the Department of Finance to finalise a list of tax expenditure measures which are not part of the baseline.  We understand the Department is doing that and has almost completed it, which might be something for Dr. Collins to take away from this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#D00500"><p>This would be helpful to the committee.  One of the challenges is that the Revenue Commissioners produce a large amount of information.  It would help this committee if it could have what might be accepted as a comprehensive list of discretionary tax expenditures and then get a recurring list from the Department of Finance.  One of my other suggestions is to then encourage the Revenue Commissioners to produce their data in a way that aligns to the typology established by the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  In the work we did for the report of the Commission on Taxation, we started with no list and we had to compile a list of all the tax-relieving measures.  Within that, we had to disaggregate what we felt was in the baseline and what was discretionary tax expenditure, after which we got to a set of items that we reviewed.</p><p>We were very clear in saying, and I would encourage the committee to reflect on this, that if it is the case that a baseline set of tax measures is established, in other words, we take the view that certain measures are there as the norm to facilitate the functioning of the tax system, this is a list we should review.  There can be debates and arguments about that as well.  However, it would be good to start with a list and then a committee like this one can return to review it in time.  That would be a significant step forward.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#E00200"><p>I welcome Dr. Collins and thank him for his very informative briefing.  There is a good bit of work taking place in the academic sphere on this subject, which is one I have considered very important since I first examined a finance Bill.  During that era - the early 1990s - nobody paid the slightest attention to costing many tax expenditures.  There has been considerable debate recently about climate mitigation measures and taking a tax and dividend approach.  Should there be a rigorous costing of such an approach?</p> <p>  The figure of &euro;21.4 billion is astonishing.  Will Dr. Collins break that down?  In its paper, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated the figure at around &euro;5 billion plus.  Dr. Collins said in respect of the last group of reliefs, including mortgage interest relief and so forth, that these are discretionary and arguments can be made for and against them.  Will he break the figure down into discretionary measures we take for granted such as personal tax credits and other measures such as capital allowances?  We received the Department of Finance's review of a number of expenditures on the day after the budget, which is very unsatisfactory.  Should every tax expenditure have a sunset clause and be reviewed?  In other words, should there be a timeframe for every measure so that we know that at some stage it will be the subject of a rigorous review?  </p> <p>  On the international front, our colleagues at the Parliamentary Budget Office did some work on questions we had relating to the UK.  About this time last year, I raised the issue with the Taoiseach.  He cited a long list of simple discretionary expenditures and asked me whether I wanted to withdraw them as they were critical to families.  He did not really address the core point, however.  When I did that, I noticed that countries like France and Italy seem to have spectacular tax expenditures.  One might be talking about 10% of GDP.  The UK seems to be ahead of the game when it comes to this compared to our performance.  I mentioned sunset clauses.  Should they all have sunset clauses and be rigorously assessed by this committee and the D&aacute;il?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#E00300"><p>I will see if I can remember all those questions as I work through them.  I agree with Deputy Broughan regarding finance Bills, which are very much the focus for tax expenditures.  Sometimes they are mentioned on budget day but really the detail for these measures appears in finance Bills either as new tax expenditures or as extensions to tax expenditures.  It is very welcome that a committee like this is in place as it provides an opportunity over time to examine and reflect on those decisions.  As members are well aware, the budgetary process tends be very rapid.  It is great to have a space such as this to allow some reflection on that.  As easily as we are happy to create tax expenditures, we should be able to take them away if that is the case.  Clearly, it is more difficult to take things away, particularly when people benefit from them but, nonetheless, we should be able to do so.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's point about the potential for new measures, the ideal is that we would reflect on those before we adopt them.  In other words, we would align them to the criteria set by the Commission on Taxation.  Suggestions made by the commission heavily influenced the criteria subsequently put together by the Department of Finance.  I note a very good summary of all that in the document produced recently by the Parliamentary Budget Office.  We should be thinking about the potential costs of any measure and its likely effectiveness.  The reality is that when we introduce a tax expenditure, there is an inherent inequity in it in that we are reducing the tax that one individual or company is paying relative to equivalent individuals who are not in a position to avail of that tax break.  If we are doing that, we need to be pretty clear that it is worthwhile.  That brings us to back to the question of whether the overall benefits to society are greater than the costs.  Those questions need to be asked.</p> <p>  At times, one can argue that if there is insufficient time to ask those questions in the run-up to a budget, and I accept these things can happen quite rapidly at times, there is no reason we cannot return to them shortly afterwards as the schemes are up and running and begin to analyse whether they work or are worth continuing.  In that sense, I agree that we should always have a sunset clause on every tax expenditure.  Indeed, that was the recommendation of the Commission on Taxation.  Even if it is the most brilliant tax expenditure in the world that makes perfect sense, we should still review it to be sure that is the case.  Therefore, as well as having a sunset clause, we should have a built-in mechanism for a review of all of these tax expenditures on a recurring basis.</p> <p>  I would be happy if the Acting Chairman would allow me to come back to the committee with a more comprehensive answer to the Deputy's request to break down the tax expenditure.  I will explain the figure of &euro;21.4 billion.  I would regard that as all items that are discretionary.  Perhaps the least discretionary element might be personal tax credits for PAYE workers or the self-employed but they are discretionary because we can change them at budget time, even if it is generally upwards.  We could decide to alter them dramatically, which would be a major step to take.  They are discretionary but, as the Deputy mentioned, they may be slightly less discretionary than the ones that are a little more controversial that one might think of as having full discretion.  I am very happy to come back to the committee and provide a more comprehensive breakdown if I am permitted to do so.  </p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's final comments, when we look at other countries, we can see that making comparisons across countries is very difficult.  The OECD attempted to do this when it produced a report in 2010 that made some comparisons.  A subsequent paper by Mary Walsh and me, who are both members of the Commission on Taxation, slotted Ireland into that comparison to see where we were.  The great difficulty with taking the headline figures from France, Germany or other countries involves what they count and how they count it.  That can provide quite misleading comparative figures.  It comes back to a problem for our tax systems, which is that these tax expenditures have appeared and grown over time and as they grow, we have not watched them sufficiently to see whether they work and understand the distributive aspects of them and the appropriateness or otherwise of their erosion of fairness, which is ultimately the structure and what they do. </p></speech>

Is it ever the case that a tax relieving measure is simply forgotten and is gathering dust because nobody has interrogated it and it is costing the Exchequer?</p></speech>

In a sense, that is a classic insight in terms of things being introduced and just falling into place.</p><p>The secretariat to that commission did some very hard work.  It had to go through the Acts passed by the Oireachtas introducing those tax expenditures to gather up the list of them and then gather the estimated costs if they were ever mentioned.  That is why I stated earlier that we have come on in leaps and bounds.  By and large, we now have a comprehensive list which puts a committee like this in a very strong position to think about tax expenditures.  The next step after making a list is looking at it and thinking about it.  I would encourage the committee to begin to engage with that.</p><p> To come back to the gender budgeting point, there is no reason we could not think about some of the other objectives of tax expenditures.  I am coming to the end of a piece of work looking at the gendered aspects of pension tax breaks.  When it is finished, I will be happy to pass it on to the committee.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that he welcomes our focus on this.  It is an area about which everyone needs to think more.  I wish there was more media attention on it.</p> <p>  There is major debate in respect of direct expenditures in the budget.  There is almost no debate about the massive amount of money that could be used for other things but is accounted for by tax expenditures, many of which could arguably be described in layman's terms as tax loopholes.  It is controversial, but some of them certainly are.  Whatever we may think about some of these expenditures they should at the very least be scrutinised and they are not.  I will go as far as to say it is a hidden economy on which nobody is focusing.  Due to the fact that it is shrouded in technical language, people do not pay much attention to it or understand it.  While I am here, I call on the media to scrutinise this area and pay the same attention to it that I hope the committee will.  There is a lot of really important stuff here.  I welcome Dr. Collins' initial comments.</p> <p>  I have a few questions about establishing the scale and extent of tax expenditures.  Dr. Collins stated that some &euro;21 billion could arguably be described as discretionary.  That is a major amount and needs to be scrutinised.  I hope this committee will do so.  I wonder if the figure is greater than that.  I am not an accountant like Dr. Collins.  He can provide a more expert opinion on this.  In the corporate tax area, I showed a table in the last committee meeting that was provided by Mr. Seamus Coffey, based on Revenue figures in his report on corporate taxation.  In 2015, the last year for which figures were available when he produced his report, pre-tax gross profits were  &euro;144 billion.  By the time allowances and deductions were allowed for the taxable profit came down to about &euro;70 billion.  The actual tax collected was about &euro;7 billion.  On a straight calculation that means the figure of 12.5% is a total fantasy.  There is no 12.5% corporate tax rate.  Similarly, on a straight-line basis, there were about &euro;77 billion worth of corporate tax reliefs, credits, deductions and allowances, which is a lot more than &euro;21 billion.</p> <p>  I would like Dr. Collins to outline his understanding of that.  The explanation we got on the previous occasion was that some of those are just part of the tax base.  Dr. Collins referred to that in his introduction.  They are part of the administration of the tax system and are not really discretionary tax expenditures.  I have to question how that distinction is made.</p> <p>  Dr. Collins referred to intra-group transactions as an example of things that are administrative and not really discretionary.  In comparing the Revenue table for 2016 with that for 2015, I see that tax relief for intra-group transactions jumped from &euro;2.9 billion to &euro;9 billion.  That is not administrative.  Something else is going on when tax relief for intra-group transactions goes from &euro;2.9 billion to &euro;9 billion in one year.  My guess is it has something to do with the big IT companies moving royalties on intellectual property around.  It is not just administrative.  It is actually a huge loophole, at least potentially, and it needs to be scrutinised.  I would like Dr. Collins to comment on that.  Does he think that corporate area is one we need to heavily scrutinise?  From my observations and certain allegations that have been made to me by people in the film industry for example, which we talked about last week, it seems costs are being massively inflated in certain circumstances in order to benefit from tax reliefs.  To what extent are we checking that those are legitimate?  Expenditures and allowances need to be heavily scrutinised.  However the practices have been followed for years.  As such it is felt that we do not need to look at them, only at the ones introduced in the past few budgets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#F00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will see if I can pick all of those up.  I agree with what he said about the dramatic difference between the focus on direct expenditure and the focus on the hidden expenditure involved in the decision not to collect taxes.  I have long been of the view that committees like this need to exist to look at those issues.  It would be a significant step forward if a clear Department of Finance report and a clear Revenue Commissioners report were produced on a recurring basis so that people such as the committee members were free to ask questions about the use of those resources on behalf of those who elect them to this institution.  Clearly, there are always alternatives.  The Deputy's point about a hidden economy is fair, and there is certainly an opportunity to cast more light on that.  I hope that opportunity is grasped.</p> <p>  I will address the Deputy's final point before I get to his core point.  When one engages with accountants and others involved in the administration of tax expenditures, whether they are big corporate reliefs or quite small ones like film relief - in fact, film relief is too small - it is argued that we do not want to place an administrative burden on the recipients of these tax expenditures.  As such, as little information as possible is collected.  My personal response is to compare that to the rather extensive forms people must complete in order to get social welfare entitlements, which are much smaller amounts of money.  Members such as Deputy Boyd Barrett are more than familiar with that through their constituency work.  Whatever tax expenditure is at issue, there is really no reason not to collect proper and detailed information.  The more information we get the better we will be able to assess their effectiveness and value for money.  In that sense it is important to revisit existing tax expenditures that continue to roll on as well as thinking about new ones.  As well as sunset clauses, we need to think about recurring reviews.</p><p>This committee has another clear role, which is to look at that whole topic.  I mentioned issues around the stability of the taxation system in my opening comments and one would think the very short-term behaviour of the corporate sector is skewing the stability of the Irish tax system now.  While that tends to give us quite positive figures in the short term, if it were to invert or reverse in whatever way, it could cause us very significant problems.  It is a strategic threat to the overall budgetary structure, the structure of the taxation system, and the economy.</p><p> I am a member of the National Competitiveness Council and one of the points I make regularly to my colleagues on that council is the potential for Ireland to have a very severe paper recession where some strange set of decisions made in a corporate boardroom might have enormous knock-on ramifications for the Irish economy and all the various metrics we use for it.  There is a real danger there and that whole issue is problematic.</p><p> Over the last year or so, I was quite struck in that context by the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, which, for the first time since I have been looking at taxation issues in the Irish economy, got to the bottom of how much tax has been paid by corporates.  It may not have been in its remit to begin to think  in minute detail about the way in which corporates behave, which is a point I want to come back to.  Nonetheless the office provided a very important report the year before last, comprising a chapter in its annual report, which went through the actual or the effective tax rates that corporates were paying.  When we look at Irish business, which was illustrated very clearly in its report, by and large, the vast majority of firms, many of which are very small in any event, are paying in or around 12.5% tax, as one would expect, and have neither the resources nor the ability to avail of whatever evasion measures, tax management measures or whatever that are there.  There is a very small number of very large corporate firms which are using the system in such a way that they pay a surprisingly low tax contribution, if any at all.  In fact, some of them were paying negatively - in other words, they were getting refunds and the tax system was paying them.</p><p> I thought that was an eye-opening insight into that whole area.  It shone a light on the fact that probably in corporate tax terms there is a small handful of firms which are playing the system and giving us all some quite skewed outcomes.  In many cases, these are large international firms and the Deputy was right to point out that there are remarkable differences between the incomes that they initially receive and the final income that is available to be taxed.  That, of course, brings us back to the very interconnected international context that these firms operate in.  When one stands back from that, we would be far more upset as a country about those issues and the behaviour of those corporates if we were on the other end of the spectrum.  In a sense, we are getting some unexpectedly large tax resources currently out of it.  It is welcome that the Department of Finance and others have come around to acknowledge that in the last couple of months.  Clearly, if we are, others are not.  That has become a challenge among our European colleagues and others as well.  We are, in a sensible way, moving internationally towards a restructuring of the way in which corporates are allowed to behave.  To a great degree, countries and legislators write those rules and we need to know an awful lot more.  If there is a hidden economy in Ireland, that is probably the big part of it with huge flows in and out of the State, often to the disadvantage not so much of us, because we seem to be getting some taxation revenue from it, but for other countries which are losing out.  Whether they are developing world countries in the extreme context or some of our fellow developed world countries, maybe EU member states or fellow OECD member states, there is an issue there which I would expect will have to be resolved over the next couple of years and will probably have an impact on the level of tax revenue that we continue to collect as a country.</p></speech>

Does he believe that as part of proper scrutiny that there needs to be a comparison done on that?  Let us take two examples that we looked at recently.  The research and development tax credit is up to &euro;700 million a year.  It is nearly &euro;1 billion and has jumped significantly.  That is overwhelmingly going to benefit that same small group of multinationals we are talking about.  They are the ones that benefit most from it.  In order to assess whether that is good use of public money, one of the things one would need to do is to ask what would happen if we took &euro;700 million and invested it in public universities for research purposes which would generate a better impact for Irish society, economy, research and development and innovation.  To me that is a no-brainer.  If we put &euro;700 million into our universities, it would be far better than giving &euro;700 million to Apple, Google and Facebook in terms of the impact on stimulating our own economy and a more sustainable economy.  That is just my view.  Would Dr. Collins agree that is one of the things we need to look at?</p> <p>  Similarly, in respect of the film industry, section 481 in its existence involved approximately &euro;1.7 billion going to the film industry, comprising between &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million a year between the various sources.  There were claims that there were 17,000 jobs in the Irish film sector but when this was scrutinised and challenged, it came down to a figure of 2,000.  One could add to that that the film industry got &euro;1.7 billion over ten years but where is the infrastructure?  What does the State own for the &euro;1.7 billion forgone?  We do not own any studios.  We have absolutely nothing.  We have hardly any jobs and hardly any infrastructure.  What exactly did we get for our money?</p> <p>  Some people will say we got a number of films made, and let them put that argument.  A useful way to establish whether that was good or bad expenditure, would be to ask the following question.  What would have happened if instead we had invested that money in building public studios and employed people directly to make films?  If we did it that way, would there be a greater benefit?</p> <p>  Those are just two examples I can think of.  Does Dr. Collins believe that in general we need to look at those sorts of comparisons in order to assess the effectiveness and the usefulness of tax expenditures?</p></speech>

On the tax and dividend on carbon tax, we asked the Department of Finance to look for an initial analysis of the effect.  The latest evidence on that is showing clear progressiveness in that lower income people benefit.  That is very clear and is backed up by decades of research by Sue Scott and others showing the same.  In all the research I have seen, it seems it is transferring from the wealthy to the poorer in our society.</p> <p>  I remember Dr. Collins's time on the tax commission and the really good work it did.  As I recall, in the depths of the crash, 2009 to 2011, one of the changes put in was a significant scaling back on all the tax expenditures that were available, particularly the property ones.</p><p>It particularly applied to tax expenditure breaks availed of by the wealthiest and, if I recall correctly, there was the introduction of income limits and so on that cut out the flagrant abuse of tax expenditures to favour the very wealthy in our society.  Is that a fair assessment of what happened in that difficult period with tax expenditures?</p><p> There was a recommendation or a proposal at the time that was agreed by Government to standard rate the pension tax expenditure break.  That is probably still one of the biggest of these discretionary tax breaks, along with that for mortgages.  I understand that never happened.  Has Dr. Collins any history as to why that was the case?  I recall that being agreed by Government but I could be incorrect.</p><p> I am interested in Dr. Collins' work and concentration on the area of pensions contributions.  His report, which he cited in his opening statement, suggested that the median beneficiary or user of a pension tax break is in the ninth decile.  It is heavily skewed towards those on higher incomes.  I would be very interested to get a copy of the analysis Dr. Collins did on gender because I am sure that will show a similar skewing.  It would be timely for this committee to get a copy of that report when it comes in.</p><p> We have a large volume of tax expenditure on pensions and, last March, the Government agreed a new system for planning and managing the State pension system.  In the context of strand 4 of the research work, it was stated that the Government would look at how to incentivise and support defined benefit contributions and so on.  I do not recall, in the context of that announcement or at that time, any commitment to reviewing the tax expenditures for pension contributions.  Was Dr. Collins approached or engaged in respect of that matter?  Has he looked at that process?  Measures will be introduced in the next two or three years whereby one would have to opt out of a defined benefit pension.  Surely that provides a moment for us to consider reform, review, removal, or certainly adjustment of the tax breaks we give on pension contributions given that, from the analysis that Dr. Collins cites, this is not progressive and may be gender biased.  Are there any developments in that regard?  If the committee is looking for a recommendation in the upcoming budget, does Dr. Collins think we could use that analysis to make a suggestion to the Minister for Finance that he does something to change that pension contribution tax break?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#H00200"><p>I will pick up on the points that Deputy Boyd Barrett made first.  The bottom line in every examination of tax expenditure, and one of the first recommendations of the Commission on Taxation in that area, is to say that direct expenditure is always the better route. We should always go the direct expenditure route because it is clear and can be seen.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned earlier, we look at that in a clearer way because, in a sense, we record it in a clearer way.  It is always the better route.</p> <p>  One has to make an argument as to why one will do something via the tax system rather than via direct expenditure.  The economic crisis of the past few years has come to help with that a little because, prior to the crisis, the view was that nobody notices when something is done through tax expenditure and that, to a degree, it does not count.  In a sense, one is deciding not to collect tax so it was not being counted as spending.  It was the equivalent of spending but it was not being counted.  The economic recession and various changes across all European countries and the various fiscal rules at European level have brought all countries, including Ireland, to a point whereby we need to count everything, whether we are doing it through spending or tax expenditure.  That is helpful in bringing greater clarity.</p> <p>  It is fair to say that not all European countries are there yet, given some of the earlier comments on what constitutes tax expenditure and so on.  Ireland has come on in leaps and bounds and can continue to do that.</p> <p>  My colleagues in UCD would love me to state that we should take all the research and development tax money that we could possibly bring in.  To be dispassionate about it, if the research and development tax credit makes sense, then we should have a report to show us that it makes sense.  It has been continually tweaked since it was introduced.  There are some strange structures to it whereby corporates get refunds of unused credits and so on.  There is certainly potential for change within that.  It is an expensive tax relief which is continuing to grow.  There is what we economists refer to as deadweight within it.  In other words, there are things that are happening, or it is being claimed are happening because of the research and development tax credit, which would probably happen in any event.  It is interesting to begin to analyse those.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation estimates deadweight as something of the order of 75% to 80% within the whole area of enterprise support.  It is a very small additional gain there and the question is whether it is worthwhile or not.  It would be good to see some potential for that.</p> <p>  For a committee such as this, it is interesting to look at that as an area which did not exist a few years ago and now costs &euro;700 million per annum.  Maybe that is money well spent, maybe it is not, but it would be useful to have a coherent answer to that.</p> <p>  The argument for film relief has for a long time been based around the employment it creates.  I am not familiar with the precise details of the figures but if it is the case that employment is far less than expected, or far more precarious than it might be, or whatever it is, that should throw up questions.  Again, it comes back to the point that we should be continuing to revisit tax expenditure measures every couple of years.  That is why I felt there might be merit in the committee approaching something like this thematically every so often whereby it picks a theme and goes to it and comes back a couple of years later.  That would give an opportunity to gather the information in the interim and to engage with it in that way.</p> <p>  It will be interesting to see where it goes with the carbon tax.  The evidence is that expenditure on fuel, etc., is a much greater component of the expenditure of lower income households and therefore a carbon tax is likely to hit them harder.  As Ms Sue Scott has shown for a long time, there are good mechanisms in place whereby we can address that and offset some of those costs.  There are issues if we are going to take further steps in that area.  We are more likely to do that through the direct expenditure route, through welfare payments or some other mechanism, but there are choices to be made by the committee members and others on that.</p> <p>  Deputy &Eacute;amon Ryan was right to state that, in tandem with the economic recession, the collapse of Exchequer finances and the Commission on Taxation report all happening at the same time, some very welcome changes were made.  Many of the property reliefs, as we continue to see in many cases, were in place to allow people to minimise their tax bills rather than necessarily to provide assets in any serious way for the State.  Those were abolished.  When the commission sat, it did not directly review them because they no longer existed but it decided to look at them anyway, mainly to make the point in the commission's report that this is something we should not be doing via the tax system.  Supporting the development of property in whatever way is not an appropriate thing to do.  To a great degree, Ireland has written the textbook as to how not to do property supports via the tax system.  It remains a concern that it is often the default answer to this day when we think about how to respond to shortages in this or that.  The default answer is to do it via the taxation system and, to a great degree, we have, as a country, proven that we cannot do that.</p><p>To their credit, Alan Barrett and others at the ESRI did one of the most straightforward economic reports I have seen for a very long time over the past couple of years.  In very simple terms that showed this is not a good thing to do and that using the tax system in whatever way to support property development simply does not work out.  That does not stop people proposing it, but it is important to have that evidence.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned a very sensible development during that period where a high earner's restriction was introduced.  That put a minimum effective tax rate the person must pay when above a particular threshold.  That continues to exist.  It is still relatively generous compared with what a PAYE worker would pay on the same income, but at least it stopped people moving to a point where they were able to shelter the entirety or most of their income from tax, which had been the case and grew out of the experience Deputy Broughan mentioned earlier where, over a very short period, a whole suite of tax expenditure measures came in and then they started to be managed and used in that way.  That continues to exist and is very helpful.</p><p> Its structure is interesting.  For example, not every tax expenditure is subject to be counted for how much people are using to write against their tax so pensions, which the Deputy mentioned, are not.  It is an interesting question as to why there should not be an overall calculation of how much income a person was allowed to offset in whatever way through various tax expenditures.</p><p> On the pensions tax breaks, I am very happy to provide to the committee any of the research on that already in existence or as it continues to come out.</p><p> The Deputy is right that the Government proposed in the 2009 national rescue plan for the State-----</p></speech>

In effect that plan was all about adjustments or finding money.  It indicated that &euro;750 million would be taken out of the overall tax supports that were going into the pension sector.  However, it indicated the Government and the subsequent Government were open to finding alternative routes to do that.  The history of that is interesting in itself.  Instead of the tax rates being standardised, a levy was put on pension funds.  In effect existing pension savers and those who were already retired paid for it, rather than changing the flow of funds and the tax relief from it into pensions.  That was subsequently phased out.  It remains a very large area of tax expenditure.  It is quite skewed when one considers the relief.  The overall cost would be about &euro;2.4 billion to the State.  Within that one could identify about &euro;1.2 billion that could easily be changed.  Technically everything could be changed, but certainly it has easily changeable elements, including the rate of tax relief which would be the largest part of that.</p> <p>  That issue remains in play.  The research that Gerry Hughes and I have done indicated that the middle beneficiary is in the ninth decile, with 50% above that and 50% below that, which is quite stark.  I am really not aware of any public policy measures that allocate resources in that way.  That study also showed that the amounts of contributions people were putting into their pensions were quite small, which throws up effectiveness questions.  We are encouraging people to save and have quite expensive mechanisms in place to assist them to save, but actually the vast majority of people are saving very little and therefore it will not significantly boost their income in retirement.  That throws up interesting issues.  It certainly plays into the current set of reforms about auto-enrolment and the reform of the pension system.</p> <p>  The current structure of that reform is a bit awkward, in that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is designing the new auto-enrolment scheme, but not really talking about costs, which I believe are a key area because that is really the remit of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department of Finance recently completed a consultation on the reform of the tax rates on pensions.  I was one of a number of people who contributed to that.  When one stands back from this, if the auto-enrolment scheme proceeds as planned, the State will incur large additional costs associated with that.  The plan is for the State to top up contributions in effect by one third.  For every &euro;3 a person puts in the State will put in an extra &euro;1.  It is something of that nature and has not been finalised yet.</p> <p>  Clearly doing that will cost the State a lot of money in direct expenditure.  I estimate the cost at &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million per annum.  If the State is going to do that, unless we change the tax expenditure side of it, that is a large amount of additional resources the State will need to find on a recurring annual basis.  That would also increase as the population ages if we assume the auto-enrolment system operates successfully.  I do not believe that is sustainable.  Therefore I expect that over the next year and a bit, we will have to engage with the reform of that tax break for pension contributions.  Of course, that is provided at the marginal rate of tax.  A lower-income earner gets it at 20% and a higher-income earner gets it at 40%.  That in itself is an inequity.  As Gerry Hughes and I have shown, there is not much saving in merging them to a midway rate.  In order to save money for the State which might be used in some other way in that sector, we should move to standardising it.</p></speech>

That is still the get-out clause for many very wealthy people.  As I understand it, they lump some massive payments into a pension in order to reduce income tax at certain stages in their career.  When is the Department of Finance expected to report on the consultation on the tax expenditure side of that pension reform in which Dr. Collins is engaged?  That switch must come within the next year.  It seems to make more sense politically that the proposal for a State top-up should coincide with changing the tax expenditure rules.  There is obvious equity in switching from one to the other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#J00500"><p>There are some contributions which are relatively recent, from that period we talked about earlier, for overall pension contributions, but nonetheless it remains quite generous.  The pension contributions for higher-income earners are not counted as part of the overall limit on the use of tax breaks.  They are very generous pension contribution limits as people move towards retirement age.  They tend to be percentages of income and it will be a much higher nominal figure for those with very high incomes.</p> <p>  There are also limits on the overall size of people's pension pots.</p><p>They are quite generous relative to the experience of most people and relative to what the vast majority of individuals would even contemplate in terms of pension saving and pension provision.  I am not aware of the precise timing of the Department of Finance consultation.  It is clear we are in a period where pension issues are changing which, therefore, is relevant in terms of this pension tax expenditure.  Taking the current tax expenditure structure for pensions that is in place and simultaneously the proposal for auto-enrolment and a top-up, at first glance the auto-enrolment proposal is a straw-man proposal in that it only sketches out the proposal and the detail will follow.  The initial proposal would suggest that the top-up or support from the State for auto-enrolment payments would be proportionally smaller than the tax relief that is available through the existing tax relief system.  I would not have thought that inequity is sustainable or acceptable.  It would seem to me that one way or the other, if the intention is to retain the tax relief support in tandem with the auto-enrolment support, they would have to be of the same scale in terms of support.  It certainly would not be possible for them to be inequitable.  </p><p> We then come to the very obvious question, which the Deputy was right to ask, as to whether one system with a State top-up as opposed to two systems might be the better route.  I would expect some strong push-back from the pensions industry on this issue.  As Gerry Hughes and I show in our report, by a long way, the participants in pension savings are earners at the higher tax rate, even when compared relative to the structure of employees across the two income tax rates.  One would expect some push-back in regard to the proposals.  There is an inevitability of some significant change in this area one way or the other over the next year.  The Deputy is right that these are very large resources that the State is allocating in this way and so there are interesting questions arising, stretching to whether, as in the case of countries like New Zealand, we should just get rid of the entire structure and provide a boost to the universal social pension.  There are many options and they involve very large amounts of resources and the livelihoods of large proportions of our population not only now but in the decades to come.  This is a key tax expenditure area which will certainly to be to the fore over the next year.</p></speech>

How does Ireland compare internationally in terms of the scale and revenue foregone from tax expenditures?  Are we better than average or broadly in line with other similar countries?</p> <p>  Dr. Collins has already responded to questions from Deputy Eamon Ryan on how to assess if money is being well spent.  When it comes to tax expenditures, because it is tax forgone rather than tax collected we have a slightly different perception of that money and a different relationship with it.  When we collect revenue and expend it on behalf of the State we scrutinise that spend closely but we tend to forget about tax expenditures because it is money that was never collected in the first instance.  How do we assess if this money is well spent and what type of criteria should be applied in that regard?  For example, should we examine job creation as a result of tax expenditure or spin-off industries that result from it and so on?  What criteria should we use to assess if money is well spent?  </p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, Dr. Collins mentioned that some of the research and development might have happened with or without a particular tax credit or tax expenditure.  How do we prevent abuse of this generous offering from Government?  For example, how do we encourage research and development that would not happen ordinarily without this particular assistance and at the same time ensure it is not used to fund research that would have happened without it?  How do we close off that loophole?</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that Ireland sits mid-table in terms of other countries.  There is, however, a real challenge in the way in which we define and count tax expenditures across countries.  There is no coherent and consistent system, although the OECD has tried, and continues to try, to achieve that.  We are, therefore, challenged in terms of a coherent or concrete answer to that question.  The most useful comparison is to view the revenue forgone cost that we have available, of which we have more and more these days, as a proportion of the overall tax take.  By and large, organisations like the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners would be a little uncomfortable with individuals like me and, perhaps, members of the committee, calculating the entirety of the cost and forming the view that overall they amount to X.  I note the Parliamentary Budget Office did that in its report as well.  To be honest, I do not see anything wrong with that.  The argument against it is that if we were to abolish all these tax breaks overnight all of that money would not come in, which is a fair and correct argument, but nonetheless it gives us an insight into the scale of the tax write-offs that are in place currently in the system.  I would encourage the Deputy and others to feel free to put those numbers together because it gives us a scale of the cost.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019020500002#K00400"><p>When one compares it relative to the overall tax take, it is a significant figure and a significant area.  In my examination of the increase in expenditure in the period running up to the economic crash, as set out in various documents published in that regard, I added into that the increase in tax expenditure over that period and, of course, it was one of the biggest areas of expenditure that had grown over the period.  We do not consider tax expenditures because it is not revenue that is flowing in and therefore it is less visible.  I think monitoring in this regard has improved a lot.  It is useful that a committee like this exists and has the opportunity to focus on this area.  To be honest, other than this committee, that focus will not happen.  As an institution, the committee has an important role in this area.  It is a big area of budgetary policy and, therefore, I would think, a big area of budgetary oversight.</p> <p>  In terms of tax expenditures to review, a couple come to mind.  As I mentioned in my earlier responses, the issues of the pension tax expenditures are pretty clear.  Even if we were not in the midst of pension changes, there are interesting questions around the appropriateness or effectiveness of those measures given the scale of moneys involved.  The special assignee relief programme, SARP, is a tax expenditure aimed at foreign executives based in Ireland on incomes of more than &euro;75,000 per annum.  Beyond &euro;75,000 they get a reduction in tax.  It is very much the highest earners resident in the State to whom we are giving this tax relief.  Generally, these are employees of profitable international companies.  This is an attractive incentive and I am sure the recipients are delighted to receive it, as would anybody who was in a position to receive it, but I would question whether all of these individuals would leave Ireland or not be replaced by similar or equivalent people if that support was not in place.  We should question that support, in particular because there has been little take-up of it.  </p> <p>  On the work of the Commission on Taxation, we did not focus on the system of capital allowances that are in place, which is an interesting area for tax expenditure.  It might be an area the committee could ask the Department of Finance and others to review.  It strikes me there are two issues with regard to capital allowances.</p><p>It may seem strange that there are capital allowances associated with appreciating assets.  There is logic in having capital allowances for assets that depreciate over time such as furniture, IT equipment and so on.  However, we also give capital allowances for assets that increase in value over time or are likely to so do such as some property assets or office blocks.  We have never considered why there should be a capital allowance for an appreciating asset.  It may be that accountants have considered the matter in quite a narrow way such that it has not been considered in terms of broader public policy.</p><p> On capital allowances more broadly, the Revenue Commissioners annually estimate the losses companies or individuals are able to carry forward.  In effect, one can write off past losses against future income.  At the extreme end, some of the banking institutions which lost such vast sums of money that the State had to rescue them are unlikely to pay tax on their profits for quite some time to come, irrespective of how profitable they are, because of their accumulated losses.  There is a very interesting public policy issue as to whether we should facilitate that practice for individuals and corporates indefinitely or at all.  That policy could be changed.  Individuals who have lost money through share investments, for example, can also indefinitely write off the losses against subsequent profits.  There is an interesting question as to why they may do so indefinitely, rather than over a fixed period such as five years, for example.  Why does it happen at all?  My observations of corporates which clearly are the big beneficiaries of this allowance indicate that they expect the law to change at some point.  They probably do not want it to change because that would decrease their profits and increase the taxes they pay.  We need to understand why that structure should be retained as we do not currently have that understanding.</p><p> The research and development tax credit was mentioned.  As with any enterprise support the State provides, its dead weight aspect, namely, supporting things that would have happened anyway, is generally unavoidable.  We can think about ways of minimising it, but it is more than likely to happen.  International research literature on enterprise supports estimates a high proportion of dead weight.  Such supports are in place only to reap the benefits of the proportion above dead weight which is triggered by the measure.  We must continually revisit these tax expenditures, particularly the very expensive ones, to see if they are still operating as intended and offering value for money because, as members are aware, many other things could be done in society with those resources.</p></speech>

I am of the opinion that there is.  How do we scrutinise such allowances to prevent abuse?  I refer to company cars and supposed business trips which confer a very significant benefit on the traveller.  Is it in the public interest for a businessperson to stay in a five star rather than a three star hotel?  We need to drill down into the detail of reliefs and claims to ascertain whether the measures are being abused or the public interest is being served and the policy objective met.</p> <p>  Dr. Collins referred to assets.  Assets may be valued in a particular way that suits the tax objectives of a corporation.  I have seen company books which indicate that assets were valued at a certain level in one year and that in the next their value jumped or reduced.  That has very convenient consequences for the company in terms of its tax liabilities.  Is there significant potential for abuse in that area?  I do not know the number of reliefs available, but it is substantial.  How do we dig into the detail to get to the nitty gritty of whether these measures are justified, beneficial or effective?  </p> <p>  I ask Dr. Collins to elaborate further on the issue of what is in the base and what is discretionary.  I am curious about that matter because estimates of tax expenditures range from &euro;5 billion.  Dr. Collins referred to a figure of &euro;21 billion.  I asked about the &euro;70 billion worth of allowances and deductions under the corporate heading alone.  How do we ascertain what should reasonably be in the base?  Given the paucity of information on these matters and the fact that the area has not been focused on, nearly everything needs to be looked at.  We can then consider whether it is fair to put something into the base or if it needs further scrutiny.</p></speech>

The rules of the Revenue Commissioners for benefit-in-kind should detect small-scale abuses.  Perhaps the Deputy should ask Revenue how rigorously it reviews benefit-in-kind claims.  However, clearly there are bigger issues in the corporate area.  The Deputy referred to the ability of corporates to change the valuation of assets, which can dramatically alter transaction values or trigger paper losses or profits, for example.  There are significant questions about accountancy practices in that regard which are very detached from the real world and real world activities.  The Irish tax take and consequently the budget are very exposed to such practices because of our dependence on a very small number of companies which largely operate in that way.  Much of the unexpected windfall corporate tax income collected here in the past couple of years probably resulted from the OECD base erosion and profit shifting process and the fact that it is no longer acceptable for a company to be based on various Caribbean islands.  Ireland has been one of the beneficiaries of that policy and collected significant tax revenue as a result.  However, it is quite precarious, rather than sustainable income for the tax system.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about what is included in the base, the easiest answer is that we need to start with a list of what is included in it and the question of what is a tax expenditure.  It would be useful to have a full list.  The report of the Commission on Taxation provides a good starting point in that regard.  One could also revisit the list of the Department of Finance.</p><p>The challenge then is to continue to revisit that because we can begin to think whether it is appropriate or not to have various assumed automatic tax reducing measures that we have as baseline measures.  We can revisit those to see if they are appropriate or not.  Having a base and a recurring list would really help this committee.  To be honest, I would probably start big with some of the big ones.  I would start with the big themes and work from there.  There is a real contribution to be made by having a regular recurring process of looking at and examining this whole area of tax expenditure.</p></speech>

Essentially, we are signing up to the Minamata Convention.  The convention addresses all aspects of the use of mercury throughout its life cycle.  The convention sets out a range of measures banning mercury mining and so on.  We have signed up to the convention as a result of having enacted a series of EU legislative requirements, which are in fact more stringent than the Minamata Convention.  We have put in place protections that go beyond what was required by the convention.  Now that those have been implemented, we are in a position to sign.  The regulations we signed into being in December provide an import ban on metallic mercury, a ban on mercury production, the regulation of industries that use mercury in their processes, the regulation and safe storage and treatment of mercury, and regulations on the use and environmentally sound management of dental amalgam used in the production of silver fillings.</p> <p>  The convention has been ratified by 102 countries, including 22 member states of the European Union.  In general terms, mercury is not a major problem in Ireland.  We have extremely low levels of identified presence in air and water as well as in fish.  We do not have a significant problem in this area.</p> <p>  In terms of the implementation of the convention and the mercury regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency will be the competent authority with responsibility for monitoring.  The Revenue Commissioners will have a role in terms of trade.  Local authorities will have a role in the safe handling, storage and sound disposal of mercury waste.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority will have a role in ensuring the dental amalgam used by Irish dentists complies with EU standards.  The Dental Council of Ireland will ensure the dental sector is aware of its obligations.</p><p> That is the basic picture.</p></speech>

I refer to possible historical or legacy issues.  The regulations to replace the previous mercury regulations are good.  I refer to the ban on metallic mercury imports and certain compounds, the regulation of industry, the use of environmentally sound management of dental amalgams, etc., and the regulation of safe storage.  We must support all this and we should certainly give this proposal a fair wind, but could the Minister address the issue of mercury waste that may be in the environment and that is legacy material?  Are there any concerns about this, perhaps from the EPA's or the Department's point of view?</p></speech>

I do not have the precise details, but the levels are extremely low.  Mercury is a hazardous waste, so the procedures for its safe disposal are set out in the same terms as found in the hazardous waste directive, which states that producers of waste shall comply with the guidance provided by the EPA and are subject to inspection by the agency and local authorities, with those who fail to comply with those regulations being guilty of an offence.  On the consumer front, some business and household electrical items - for example, compact fluorescent lights, CFLs - contain small amounts of mercury.  These items, when finished with, can be brought either to one's local recycling centre free of charge or to a retailer if the consumer purchases an equivalent product.  We therefore have robust processes for monitoring any environmental impact and managing the waste as produced.  The sale of things like thermometers was banned in 2009 but, as Deputy Stanley said, there may still be residue in consumers' hands.</p></speech>

The world has changed a lot.  When I was a kid we used to play with mercury in our science class in school.  The Minister will remember the same, I am sure.  May I ask a related question?  This was agreed in 2013, and I am very much supportive of the measures, but here we are five years later and, if I read rightly, 22 other countries of the European Union 28 have already signed it and introduced the regulations.  One of my concerns is the reason for this delay.  We are not in disagreement on this area.  As the Minister said, our levels of mercury poisoning in the water and the air are accurately described by the EPA as being very low, and there are no huge cost or other implications of this, only a &euro;50,000 implementation fine.  However, I have a general concern that the Minister's Department may not have sufficient resources to cope with the whole variety of undertakings for which it has responsibility, and I am taking this as an example.  Is there a reason for this five-year delay?  Are we one of the last EU countries to sign the regulations and approve the convention?</p> <p>  More generally, now that he has been in his current position for seven months or whatever, is the Minister, within his Department or with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, of the view that his Department has the necessary scale to carry out the whole variety of functions it has at the speed and with the urgency we need?</p></speech>

Yes, stakeholder consultation seemed to be involved.  I know from experience that the drafting of statutory instruments can get into many delays.  This does not necessarily reflect a lack of ability in Departments, but there tends to be a bit of a logjam in draftsmen's offices, which has dogged every Government of which I have ever been a party, and I am sure the same is the case with Deputy Ryan.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's wider question, I am really bottoming out the issues regarding our responsibilities.  We have very significant co-ordinating responsibilities, and the Deputy is aware of my belief that it is really important for Departments that have a co-ordinating role to bite to a degree with the President's teeth.  It is really important I get a cross-Government commitment, overseen from the Taoiseach's office, to have the momentum to deliver.  I am not saying we need a whole army of people but we need a willingness on the part of decision-makers elsewhere to get on board with what we are trying to achieve and our obligations and ambitions.  I think the Deputy himself has often articulated that sectors will not have a future unless it is designed to be robust in a decarbonised world.</p> <p>  Any Department will always welcome more resources in various policy areas, but we are working very hard to try to produce a coherent plan in the first quarter of this year that will embrace all areas.  Then we will work hard to drive other Departments to implement their share and to see that we implement ours.  I do not think I can say I have a case for more resources and go knocking on Deputy Donohoe's or anyone else's door at this stage.  We must try to make the thing work.  If at the end of 12 months the committee calls me back here and some of the obstacles that have delayed us are resources, I will certainly look at those.</p></speech>

I had not realised that the European regulations were only drafted in 2017.  That is the timeframe one would expect.</p> <p>  May I ask one last question?  Moving away from the quantum of resources, the Minister's Department is also unusual in that many of the environmental responsibilities are divided up between the former Ministry in the Custom House - that is, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government - and his current Department.  It is sometimes hard to understand the dividing line as to why certain environmental issues are contained within the Minister's Department and others are still contained in the Custom House.  Has this transition worked, to his mind, or is the Minister finding it hard to know himself where the line of responsibility is when it comes to environmental management?</p></speech>

On one side, the climate action, waste and energy elements are natural bedfellows because they are about better use of resources, so I think that is correct.  On the other side, I have much of the digital technology, broadcasting and post communications element.  Again, there is a certain coherence here.  They are very disparate elements but there are huge challenges in those areas.  Digital safety is a good example.  There is responsibility in six Departments for it.  Rather than trying to consolidate a great number of Departments, we must learn to work across Departments.  In the case of digital safety, there is a cross-Government plan.  It was endorsed and launched by the Taoiseach.</p><p>The Taoiseach is accountable for the delivery of the project to a certain degree, although the Department of Education and Skills is the lead entity.  That is the way we work.  One cannot continually restructure Departments because one sees that an element of coherence may not be fully there.  Although my Department is disparate in its range, there is a coherence and my job is to ensure that we make things work.</p></speech>

Mercury is a very stable and hard-wearing compound when mixed with other metals, which is why it was used.  There is no risk of leakage or seepage from fillings.  The issue is the manufacture and managed storage waste of the materials where they are generated.  My understanding is that the dental sector is migrating away from the use of mercury fillings.  At EU level, there is talk, which is at an early stage, of regulatory changes to get rid of such fillings altogether.</p></speech>

In relation to Brexit, the Government remains firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom is to ratify the withdrawal agreement, as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government.  The European Council has made it clear that it stands by the withdrawal agreement and that it is not for renegotiation.  The agreement, with its backstop provisions, is the only agreement on the table that provides the essential legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in any circumstances and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  As a Government, our focus remains on securing ratification of the withdrawal agreement but we must also continue to implement our preparations for a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>  On 19 December, the Government published its Brexit contingency action plan, setting out its approach for dealing with a no-deal Brexit.  Intensive work relating to the action plan continues across Government on a daily basis.  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade to the greatest extent possible.</p> <p>  My Department is working within the whole-of-Government approach and co-ordinating closely with its agencies which are developing and implementing plans and measures to protect our economy.  I recently met with the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the deputy governor of the Central Bank on these matters.  All are engaging closely in the overall whole-of-Government preparations and are confident that they have put appropriate contingency plans in place to do everything possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>  However, it is not possible to eliminate all risk in a no-deal situation.  Any Brexit will be negative, and a no-deal most of all.  Not all issues are within Ireland&rsquo;s direct control.  This is not,  I should emphasise, to avoid responsibility but to be frank and open.  This is an exercise about the limitation of different degrees of damage.  The Government is working actively at EU level and the EU will be taking a number of unilateral, limited and temporary measures in areas such as air transport, for example.  However, it is important not to pretend that there can be what some in the UK are calling a "managed no-deal".  No such thing exists and, from the EU perspective, we need to be very careful not to put at risk the benefits of the withdrawal agreement and, in particular, the transitional arrangements and the backstop.</p><p> Last week, following discussion with Government, I issued an initial assessment of the economic and fiscal impact of a no-deal Brexit.  The new analysis is based on an initial application of the latest UK estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which is the UK equivalent of the ESRI.  Brexit, in whatever form, is an historic challenge for Ireland, and the implications for our economy will be disproportionate relative to those for the rest of the EU.  While my Department's central economic and budgetary planning scenario remains an orderly exit based on the UK leaving with a transition arrangement in place, the risk of a disorderly Brexit has increased in recent weeks.  In a disorderly exit scenario, while in aggregate terms the economy would be likely to continue expanding, the pace of growth would be significantly lower than is currently expected.  My Department's initial assessment suggests that the level of economic activity would be approximately 4.25 percentage points lower than our existing trajectory over the medium term and approximately 6 percentage points lower than in a no-Brexit scenario.  The reduction in the pace of growth would have negative spillovers to the public finances and the labour market.  The headline deficit could deteriorate by nearly a percentage point of national income in the short term.  As for the labour market, the unemployment rate would increase by an estimated 2 percentage points relative to budget 2019 projections.  As earlier research from the Department of Finance has shown, the most adverse impacts of Brexit are likely to be felt in the agrifood and indigenous manufacturing sectors.  The more comprehensive assessment by the Department of Finance and the ESRI will be published later this quarter.  This output will be incorporated into the stability programme update, due in April.</p><p> I recognise that these estimates may not capture the full impact and that the figures could be conservative; indeed, the impact in certain exposed sectors and regions could be worse than the average.  Nevertheless, quantifying the impact is important to help Government to understand the possible macroeconomic implications and to design the appropriate policy response.  Of course, it is important to point out that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit in a robust economic position, with the highest national income growth in Europe and record employment levels.  In addition, exports, job creation, inflation and public debt indicators are all strong.  This strong performance will provide a better and stable platform for the external challenges that lie ahead.  We have already taken many actions, many of which are supported by long-term planning through the national development plan and the national planning framework.</p><p> On financial services, my Department has been working closely with the Central Bank on planning for Brexit.  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability.  It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure they have contingency plans in place for the end of March and are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit with as little disruption for consumers as possible.  As for financial services, the Department and the Central Bank have stressed that responsibility for contingency planning remains with individual firms.</p><p> On the basis of its ongoing work, the Central Bank has been able to provide assurance that while some level of market disruption is inevitable, the financial system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand a hard Brexit and that the most material "cliff-edge" financial stability risks arising from Brexit may have been largely mitigated.  In this context, the contingency preparations announced by the European Commission last November mitigate the immediate risks arising from potential loss of access to UK-based market infrastructure - the central clearing counterparties mechanism, which is used to clear derivatives - and for Ireland specifically, access to a central securities depository allows for the settlement of Irish equities and exchange-traded funds.</p><p>On CSD, I am proposing legislation in the Government general scheme to support the Commission decision.  As far as consumers are concerned, the most important issue for them arises where the UK or Gibraltar-based insurance firms do not have adequate contingency plans in place.  While most insurance firms and intermediaries providing services from the UK and Gibraltar have taken appropriate action, contract continuity still remains a risk where firms have not taken adequate action.  The legislation I am proposing as part of the Government omnibus Bill will allow for the run-off of policies in place at the time of Brexit over a three-year period, eliminating the most material risk for customers of insurance firms.<br/><br/>The Department of Finance has been working closely with the Revenue Commissioners on Brexit since the referendum.  While the Department is responsible for overall policy, Revenue is an independent body responsible for implementing that policy in a fair and efficient manner.  Revenue is on the front line in terms of our preparations for Brexit and facilitating efficient movement of legitimate trade post-Brexit to the greatest extent possible.  I know that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners attended this committee on 24 January and outlined the work and scale of the challenge of the very significant increase that can be expected in traders who will have to deal with customs formalities for the first time, leading to an estimated tenfold increase in customs declarations, the complexity of issues relating to the landbridge and the challenge for Government agencies, including Revenue, in putting the necessary arrangements in place.  The Chairman outlined to the committee the very significant programme of work and he made reference to ICT, staffing and outreach to business, all of which is being done through either trade representative bodies, events or seminars.  A no-deal Brexit will be a serious challenge for our traders.  I am, however, satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have been working very hard and will continue to work hard to ensure they are prepared to facilitate the efficient movement of legitimate trade to the maximum extent possible in a no-deal scenario.<br/><br/><b></b>In terms of legislation, the draft omnibus Bill, known officially as the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill 2019, was published on 24 January.  It calls out particular areas that need to be addressed urgently.  Part 6 refers to legislative amendments proposed for income tax, capital tax, corporation tax and stamp duty legislation to ensure continuity for business and citizens in regard to current access to certain taxation reliefs.  Part 7 deals with implementation of the European Commission&rsquo;s equivalence decision under the central securities depositories, CSD, regulation.  Part 8 includes legislative measures for a temporary run-off regime.  I look forward to working with all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure the necessary legislation is in place before 29 March.<br/><br/>Turning to the second item on the agenda, the launch earlier this month by Commissioner Moscovici of a Commission communication entitled, Towards a more efficient and democratic decision making in EU tax policy.  This communication sets out a roadmap which aims to start a debate around changing the system of voting for tax files from unanimity to qualified majority voting, QMV.  At this point, we should reflect on what has been achieved on tax issues at EU level.  Since 2015, there have been 21 different measures, an average of more than one initiative every three months.  This is evidence of progress being made.  The Commission roadmap identifies the passerelle clause as being the most feasible option for moving away from unanimity.  This provides that the European Council could unanimously decide to move an entire policy area or part of a policy area from unanimity voting to QMV.  The support of the European Parliament, as well as national parliaments, including D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, would also be required.  This is a highly sensitive suggestion for many member states, including Ireland, as any move to change the voting method used for tax files would reduce member states' sovereignty.  Given the large volume of important agreements reached at EU level on tax issues, I do not see the need for, or merits of, any proposals to move away from the requirement for unanimity.</p><p>Regrettably, the United Kingdom leaving the European Union means that some things will change.  Planning for this change has taken place on a whole-of-Government basis.  No future relationship between the EU and UK will be as good as the <i>status quo</i>.  Membership of the Single Market and customs union is a core element of our economic strategy.  That will not change.  Ireland will remain an active and enthusiastic member of the EU.  The Government is committed to working with the European Commission and our EU partners to ensure the closest possible relationship between the EU and UK.<br/><br/>In terms of taxation the same principles apply.  It is our view that the way to achieve the best results and tangible progress is to have all member states working together for the benefit of the whole European Union.  I thank the Chairman and look forward to questions from members.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept that in reality the impact may be far worse and more adverse for Ireland than he has set out?  The Minister acknowledged that the figures may be conservative.  One thing that is very difficult to quantify in any economic model is the whole issue of sentiment and confidence.  In a disorderly Brexit scenario, is it the case that there is a likelihood of investment decisions being stalled and confidence being damaged?  The Minister acknowledged that there could be regional variations.  Areas that are heavily dependent on agrifood and indigenous manufacturing, for example, are likely to be far more adversely affected than Dublin.  Does the Minister accept that the impact of a disorderly scenario could be worse and perhaps significantly worse than the economic model has predicted?</p></speech>

When I was publishing these forecasts last week I emphasised that they were all based on economic forecasts drawing on information from the UK.  There are two specific issues that we cannot take account of, the first of which is the second round effects on consumer and investor confidence, to which Deputy McGrath alluded.  As against that, one positive that we cannot take account of - there are a few positives in this situation - is the possible effect of any mitigants or offsetting measures that we would be able to agree with the European Commission in light of a disorderly event.  When outlining the figures last week, I indicated that because some of them are based on information that is based on constantly evolving estimates, I will view them as the minimum effects on the economy.  I want to be open about that.  In particular, I have acknowledged in statements I have made elsewhere that the impact of a disorderly Brexit could be significantly different at sectoral and regional level from the average impact on the country.  I am pleased to repeat that point today.</p></speech>

As we move forward, I will use further information and models that emerge from the UK to update the forecasts again when I provide the stability programme update in April.  To make a final point, if the Deputy is asking me to forecast the effect of a recession in the UK on the Irish economy, we have ample experience of those kinds of economic events in economic history and forecasting.</p><p>The event whose effects I am being asked to predict is something that has not happened before.  To see an economy of the scale and interconnectivity of the UK leave something like the EU is unique.  As such, at each point, I have acknowledged the caveats we have built into our forecast.  If they evolve, the first point at which they will evolve will be in April.  Of course, I will update the Oireachtas in the stability programme update.  </p></speech>

That would be in the stability programme update, which is normally made available to us in draft form around mid-April.  Of course, 29 March will have passed by that stage and to some extent, we might know where we stand.  Can the Minister clarify what we will see next on the economic side by way of forecasting and projections?  When will we see this?</p></speech>

There is engagement.  The Commission is here at the moment and is discussing how we would implement and deal with different scenarios that could develop in the future.  It is important for me to be clear that in any of those discussions, we are not engaging in or planning for the implementation of infrastructure on our Border.  I think Deputy Pearse Doherty asked me that question the last time I appeared before the committee and that answer has not changed.  If the events of the past number of weeks have shown us anything, they have shown us the need for a legally operable backstop and that continues to be the basis of the engagement we are having.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I have said, were a disorderly event to take place, we would then have to engage in a period of negotiation and engagement with the Commission and the UK regarding how that would be delivered.  As I make this statement to the committee, I wish to put it in a logical context.  This is the very reason we negotiated for a backstop and a withdrawal treaty in the first place.</p><p>Our objective remains unchanged so it is only logical that if, for reasons beyond our control, the backstop was no longer to be operable, we would have to engage in a lot of work with the Commission and the UK regarding how that would be delivered.</p></speech>

In April 2017, the Cabinet signed off on a tender of &euro;983 million for the build cost of the national children's hospital.  It would appear that, at some point around June 2018, the statutory board set up with responsibility for delivering the hospital learned that the cost would be higher than agreed.  Over time, it learned the cost would be significantly higher.  It appears the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Minister for Health were not informed of that until late August 2018 and that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who is in charge of the purse strings, learned of it in November 2018.  While I accept the Minister's statement that this is what happened, for most people it sounds incredible that, several months after knowledge of these cost overruns emerged, the Minister with responsibility for the public purse had not learned about it.  That is extraordinary.  Can the Minister explain how that came to pass?</p></speech>

That led to a lot of engagement within the board and with the Department of Health and HSE on the issue.  That engagement took place, as the Minister for Health has confirmed, from the end of August through September and October and in early November I became aware of the issue and its scale.  From that point until the middle of December, I had a significant amount of engagement on the issue to try to understand why this had happened and the options available to Government.  A decision that I recommended was then taken in Cabinet on this matter in the middle of December.</p></speech>

This was what he was doing throughout that period.  If I had been aware of it at an earlier point, I would have asked him to take the actions he was undertaking during that time.  I became heavily engaged with the Minister and the Department for Health as soon as I became aware of the issue and the nature of it.</p></speech>

The Minister introduced a budget last October with no knowledge of an overrun of the order of &euro;450 million, while his Cabinet colleague, sitting at the same table, knew an awful lot about it at that stage.</p></speech>

I was then in the position of asking whether we should go ahead with the project or not.  As I look back at how this developed, the fact that we had such an independent governance structure engaged in trying to resolve this issue provided a buffer between me and the Department of Health on the matter.  I still would have faced the challenge of how to go ahead with this project if I had the figures earlier.</p></speech>

I would be furious, if I was sitting in his seat, that it took months to be told of this overrun.</p><p>Perhaps the full scale of it was not known in June or July but it was serious enough to be brought to the attention of the Department of Health, the Minister, and the HSE in August.   Issues are flagged all the time and Ministers are told something is an emerging issue but that the full scale and scope of it is not known.  In regard to the cost of the national children's hospital, the Minister is telling us that nobody flagged with him or with any official in his Department that it was an emerging issue.  That is unbelievable.</p></speech>

Is that right?  I am trying to pick up on the timeline Deputy Michael McGrath set out.

In my meeting with Mr. Quinn, my official who is on the board and who leads the Office of Government Procurement and whose name has been mentioned elsewhere, he informed me that from the summer onwards, he could see this matter being dealt by the board of the children's hospital.</p><p>He could see that engagement was taking place between the Department of Health and the HSE on the board.  He judged that his responsibilities as a member of the board were being discharged fully.  In all of the engagement I have had with him over the last number of years, I have found him to be a superb professional on procurement policy who I know will have taken his responsibilities on the board very seriously.</p></speech>

It raises the question as to how Government managed this system of expenditure on the children's hospital.  It shows up many weaknesses.</p></speech>

The board is an agency that was associated with the Government Departments in question and Mr. Quinn could see heavy engagement under way between the Department of Health, the HSE and the board of which he was a member.  All of that engagement was taking place and on its conclusion, I was then informed of this issue.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned Mr. Quinn, who was the chief procurement officer in the Department of Public Expenditure Reform.  Mr. Quinn served time on the board but was also chairperson of the finance committee.  The Minister stated previously that he was on the board in a personal capacity.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Putting the answer to that question in context, Mr. Quinn was a member of the board at the point at which it interrogated the evolving issue of an overspend and projected increase in costs of the national children's hospital.  He was engaged with the issue and he could see the engagement that was taking place between the board, the Department of Health and the children's hospital.  He judged - I support him in this based on the engagement I have had with him - that he was discharging his responsibilities in that area because he could see engagement both on the board and with the Department of Health and HSE.</p></speech>

From the discussion I had with Mr. Quinn it appears that engagement on this issue, at least at board level, happened throughout the summer, leading to communication at the end of August. </p></speech>

There is also the issue of how Deputy Donohoe has performed as the Minister in charge of the Department sanctioning this project.  Deputy Donohoe is the line Minister for the Department that sanctions this project.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I will spell out what that means in order to deal with my responsibility in this, which I want to deal with centrally.  A Department outlines a project it wants to carry out and it makes a recommendation to me on the project if it is above a certain scale.  I ultimately have to supply that sanction to that Department.  If the project is above &euro;100 million it has to go to Cabinet in its entirety.</p></speech>

It would appear that happened in this case.  What is the Minister's responsibility in terms of monitoring a project afterwards?  We have a huge overrun of close to &euro;500 million and it could increase.  It appears the Minister was completely kept in the dark.  It seems he did not have his hands on the tiller of this project at all.</p></speech>

First I wish to address my responsibility in relation to individual projects, particularly those above a certain scale.  They are tracked by the different teams in my Department that shadow each Vote.  I fully accept my responsibility for the use of taxpayers' money for this or any other project.  That is why the decision I ultimately made on this project was a very difficult one.  As I became engaged in this issue the available choices concerning the project's future were very profound.  I was aware that the decision to make more funding available, on which Deputy Doherty is now questioning me, would raise questions about the future of the project and how it has been managed.  This project was rare in that it had a separate governance structure in the form of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The reason for that body was the number of other children's hospitals involved in this project, as the Deputy knows.  To be clear, regardless of what point of the process I am involved in, responsibility for the use of taxpayers' money is mine.</p></speech>

I am trying to determine what the Minister's specific responsibility was.  He mentioned that he had a responsibility to track this project.  I understand that monthly reports were supposed to be made on this project.  The Minister had a responsibility to track this project but his chief procurement officer knew that there was an overrun months in advance and did not tell him or the Department.  I am not sure if the Minister's tracking flagged that, however the tracking takes place.  Deputy Donohoe's colleague, the Minister for Health, was aware of this.  He did not tell him and obviously did not tell the Department of Finance.  Did the Minister for Finance's tracking process pick that up?  The Department of Health was informed of it but obviously the Department of Finance and its tracking process were not.  Can the Minister explain how a project costing close to &euro;2 billion is tracked?  What is reported?  What information does the Minister receive?  What does he have to alert the Cabinet to?  How come the Minister's tracking did not pick any of this up for months, despite having one of the most senior officials in the Department as chairperson of the finance committee and the Minister for Health and the Department of Health all having knowledge of an overrun?</p></speech>

If I was the Minister for Finance, I would be absolutely seething.  Let us go back to the point in November when the Minister became aware of this.  Several weeks before that, one of the key issues he was dealing with was the budget.  One of the key issues in the budget was Department of Health expenditure and the supplementary budget, which was not known to the Minister for Health or the Minister for Finance until the days running up to the budget.  There were intense discussions between Departments and, I am sure, Ministers on the supplementary budget and the budget for 2019.  The Department of Health knew of an overrun, as did the Minister for Health although he may not have been able to quantify it, but the Minister for Finance was kept completely in the dark and walked into the D&aacute;il and presented a budget.  Next week, he will have to tell us which projects will not go ahead due to an overrun that some people were aware of.</p></speech>

I believe we will be able to do that.</p> <p>  In regard to the information that was available to me, when I became aware of this issue - I outlined the timing to Deputy McGrath, which the Minister for Health has confirmed - I became very heavily involved.

Regardless of the colleague involved, my attitude on this issue would be the same.  A very serious issue has developed and it meant that both the Minister for Health and I were left with very difficult choices.</p><p>It is something that there have already been clear learnings from but this is also a project that will be transformative for children's healthcare in our country, which the Deputy is not doubting.</p></speech>

The reality, however, is that there was awareness of this matter.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform cannot sit here and say it is okay for a Minister to be aware of a serious overrun on the major capital project of our time and not inform the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the line Minister, particularly in the middle of a budgetary process when he is bringing forward Estimates for expenditure for the following year.  I am sure the Minister would not want the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, or any other Minister to believe it is okay not to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform an overrun of hundreds of millions of euro in his or her Department of which he or she is aware but which may not be fully quantified.  He would not want to set as an example for Ministers that they can simply quantify the overrun and, once that work has been finished, bring up the matter in a routine meeting with officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That would simply not be acceptable.  I understand the difficult position the Minister is in, given that this involves his party colleague, but this is completely unacceptable.  We have a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a reason.  We will deal with this in more detail because we have asked the Secretary General of the Department to come before us.  We need to ensure there are robust procedures in place for tracking public expenditure.  We all thought that those procedures were in place.  Is the Minister really sending out a message to line Ministers that if they are aware of a substantial overrun in a project, it does not really matter if they do not inform the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform or the relevant officials for a number of months?</p></speech>

What is very challenging about this situation is that we manage and are responsible for hundreds of projects across the country that are delivered in the way we intended and on budget.  A significant issue has developed with this flagship project.  When the work of PwC has been completed, it will clearly be the subject of learnings regarding what needs to be done differently for a project of this scale in the future.</p></speech>

We have asked questions on Brexit on numerous occasions but let us park the point that we all want to see the withdrawal agreement ratified and agree that is the best option to mitigate against Brexit.  However, there is concern that the withdrawal agreement may not be the end product and we will have a disorderly Brexit.  The Minister spoke about the impact on the State and gave figures which will be updated in April.  He spoke of potentially more severe sectoral and regional impacts.  The regions in question have been identified as the north west and south east.  My county of Donegal in particular would be severely hit in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  We need to start having a frank discussion.  In the absence of physical infrastructure on the Border and in the context of a disorderly Brexit, is the Minister suggesting there will be no checks?</p></speech>

I want to be clear about that.  In the event of a disorderly Brexit occurring, because the UK will become a third country, there will be checks in place for goods that are coming from the United Kingdom into Ireland.</p></speech>

In that case, given the shared objective of the Commission, the UK and Ireland of having no infrastructure on the Border to deal with this issue, we will have to have engagement with the Commission to see how the movement of goods would then be managed.</p></speech>

The Government is very clear that there will be checks coming into Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort or wherever from Britain but coming from the North into the State, whether it is into Donegal or elsewhere are there literally no checks or will the checks happen somewhere else?  I am trying to figure that out.  I understand and I 100% support the line that there can be no physical infrastructure on the Border but what does that mean and how will the Commission facilitate that?</p></speech>

To go back to what I have said, as the Deputy has just acknowledged, the whole reason we want a backstop in the first place is to avoid being in a scenario of having a risk to movement of goods on our Ireland.  If we are in a situation of a disorderly Brexit and we do not have a backstop, trade offs and choices will need to be made on how that issue will be dealt with.  However, I am afraid that at this point I cannot confirm to the Deputy what they will be because we will have to engage and work with the British Government and the European Commission.  What I can say at this point is that we want to be in a situation where we have as low friction movement as is possible in the context of a disorderly Brexit taking place but for now we will have to restate the process that we will have to engage in with the Commission and the UK on how we would achieve that.</p></speech>

I note the impact that a hard Brexit would have and I know that further financial work is being done by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Department.  The Minister says that tax revenues would be lower and expenditure would rise and he says he is looking at the potential that the growth rates in 2019 could go to 2.7% from an estimated 4.2%, which is a reduction of 1.5% and a reduction of 0.85% from 3.6% in 2020.  Can the Minister quantify the difference between what he believes the reduction in taxes and the increases in spending would be?  What areas would that impact on?  Can the Minister couple his answer on that with what would happen in the event of a hard Brexit?  I read reports at the weekend that the European Commission might be looking at making supports available in the event of a hard Brexit so the Minister might comment on that area.</p></speech>

For example, our social supports and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection spending programmes might be affected.  The other area of spending would be related to the kind of mitigants and changes we are putting in place to help our economy cope with the consequences of a disorderly Brexit.  The most immediate effect we would face on the budgetary side would be what would happen from a tax flow perspective.  Within a tax flow perspective it would be taxes that are most associated with consumption such as VAT.</p> <p>  On what kind of engagement we have had with the Commission, much of it is on the different revenue, customs and transport issues we need to engage with it on.  We are having preliminary discussions with it and they are preliminary in the sense that many of those discussions have to wait for the conclusion of Brexit and to see what type of Brexit actually happens to see what kinds of supports might be needed and facilitated from a state aid point of view.</p></speech>

Everyone in Ireland thinks that we need to have the children's hospital.  Sight of that may have been lost.  People are right to question the sheer scale of the spending.  What work has the Minister been able to do in his Department to quantify what he expects the final cost of the children's hospital to be?  What cost has been incurred on the underground works?  My understanding was that, in 2016, the hospital group went out to tender with a split tender for the underground works and the overground works.  The underground works had a detailed design and the overground works were preliminary.  The underground works have preceded the overground works.  What will be in place will be groundbreaking.  It has been looked at for decades.  More than 300 rooms will deal with children from around the country.  Does the Minister have an idea what the final cost will be?  If not, when does he anticipate that he will have that?  What cost has been incurred on the underground works to date and how does that relate to taxpayers' money?  Does he have an idea of the timeframe for it to be in place and operational?</p></speech>

They outlined a figure of &euro;1.4 billion, with different contingencies that could increase the figure.  Those figures have been shared with us and we believe that they reflect the different issues that could develop in the hospital.  I believe the target date for the hospital opening is between 2022 and 2023.

The reasons for that transcend the discussion we are having about economics or trade policy.</p><p>I know the consequences of doing that would stretch all over our island and deeply affect the stability and peace that we have.  It is for those reasons that the Government continues to be clear in its objective.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Pearse Doherty, the Minister indicated there would have to be engagement with the European Commission.  Customs is obviously a European competence.  If, in those engagements, the European Commission took the view that the only way to meet the requirement to protect the Single Market would be to have border checks on the North-South Border, is the Minister clear that the Government would tell the European Commission that it would not impose any checks and there would be no hardening of borders?</p></speech>

As I said in an interview earlier in the week, in that kind of scenario we would have to engage in a further negotiation, to which there would be three parties, namely, Ireland, the European Commission and the United Kingdom, on how the consequences of a disorderly Brexit would be managed on our island.  I cannot give the Deputy a clear answer on what would be the outcome of that negotiation because in a disorderly Brexit scenario the consequences and challenges for the UK and Ireland would be great and trade-offs would be created regarding how we deal with the situation.</p></speech>

As I said, we will not be part of putting in place hard infrastructure on our island on the Border between North and South, nor is that our objective.  The Commission, to which the Deputy referred, has been at the forefront of trying to avoid that happening.  The challenge it would face would be in dealing with the consequences of a disorderly Brexit scenario for the protection of the integrity of the Single Market, to which it also has a strong commitment.  We would then need to have an engagement with the Commission on how we can maintain the commitment we have to the Single Market, while avoiding infrastructure on the Border between North and South.</p></speech>

Can the Minister understand why nurses would feel that is a pretty accurate description of the Government's use of the Brexit card?</p></speech>

If members of the nursing unions and nurses - I always say I have the height of respect for the work nurses do - feel that Brexit will affect their prospects, that is also the case with many others.  Brexit will decisively shape decisions that this Government and future Governments will have to take.</p></speech>

Is the Government not making a very serious mistake in trying to hold the hard line that it will not be able to hold because of the weight of public support behind the nurses?</p></speech>

I understand how popular their cause is at the moment because of the care they give and the professionalism they show at all times.  While the Deputy is able to talk about the nurses in isolation, I am not.  If a move is made in one part of our Civil Service and public service, every other part of our Civil Service and public service will expect the same.  That is why we can only move forward in a way that is consistent with the overall wage agreement that we have and which I am trying to protect.  A change for one public servant would become something expected by all.</p></speech>

As public support goes from passive to being active on Saturday, the Government will feel the weight of pressure to concede in favour of the workers.  Other workers see that these issues are related; I do not see them as unrelated.  Other workers also feel they need a pay rise and that their pay is not keeping up with cost-of-living increases, in particular the cost of accommodation.  Will the Government not ultimately be forced to make a significant offer and, for example, sit down and talk about pay, which the non-offer of negotiations last night did not even include?</p></speech>

I have much experience of how these issues have developed in the past.  I have always seen a way for them to be resolved.  I expect the same will happen here.</p> <p>  I know this is not a concern for the Deputy because he wants to see all public servants have their wages increased; he and I have debated this previously.  The challenge we will face is what the financial consequences of this will be and whether we will be able to have another collective wage agreement.  The Deputy and others have championed the cause of wage restoration.  Through this agreement, which I am trying to protect, anybody who is on a salary of up to &euro;35,000 is now earning more than they were in 2008 and anybody on a salary of up to &euro;50,000 will now have their wages fully restored by the end of 2019.  That is the kind of change the Deputy and others have championed and sought, and that is what this wage agreement is delivering.  Therefore, he can understand why I am so eager to protect it.</p> <p>  If there is a change now for nurses, every other group not getting the same change will then feel the need to take action against the Government to make that happen.  When the public sector wage bill is between a quarter and a third of total expenditure and given the Department we are talking about, the consequences of that for how we look after our national finances are enormous.</p></speech>

Just before Christmas the Government agreed to pay off junior Anglo Irish Bank bondholders, who were supposedly burned, to the same amount it would cost to pay the total nurses' claim.  The Government obviously has no interest in getting the Apple tax money.  The Government is making choices and those choices are not to pay public servants, nurses, etc.,what they deserve and need to survive and what most people feel they should be paid but instead it is to protect the interest of the 1% in this country.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows it is not open to me to spend it because he understands what would happen in the event of our losing the case.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to say payment was made to those bondholders after everyone higher up the creditor hierarchy was also paid.  He also will be familiar with the successful efforts to try to get money back in respect of the different issues we had to deal with in the context of the collapse of our banking sector.  He is aware of all this, but I know these charges-----</p></speech>

Of course, across the same period no depositor lost any money either.  I am sure the Deputy would have been concerned if during the crisis period, people who had money in banks, ordinary depositors, had lost money as well.  In every one of these cases what the Deputy is referring to is once-off amounts of money that, ultimately, he is saying should be used to fund ongoing wages.  We have been down that path before, and look how it turned out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019020500002#Y00500"><p>That brings me to my final question because the Minister knows I am not just in favour of these once-off amounts being used in this way.  I am in favour of, for example, increasing the amount of revenue we bring in through corporation tax, increasing income tax on high earners etc.  That is ongoing revenue.  I note that the Minister and the Government are now very concerned about issues of sovereignty.  I can understand this in the context of how these dynamics will play out post Brexit.  I am concerned about issues of sovereignty as I interpret the word to mean the right of elected bodies here to decide on matters that happen here.  However, why is the Government's concern about sovereignty only ever expressed whenever we are talking about the potential for an increased need for taxation on big business?  The Government was never concerned about sovereignty when it came to the fiscal treaty, of which the Minister was in favour, which clearly involved a restriction of sovereignty and a transfer of powers away from the national Parliament here to the European Commission?  The Government was not concerned about sovereignty when it came to the Maastricht treaty, of which I presume the Minister was also in favour.  The Government was not concerned about sovereignty when it came to the troika programme.  Why are sovereignty and the green jersey only ever rolled out whenever it is possible that big business and multinationals will be faced with increased corporation tax, as opposed to when demands for increased austerity, restrictions on public service spending and so on are made by the European Commission or when structural changes in this regard are made through the likes of the fiscal treaty?</p></speech>

I hear them being raised as live issues in respect of climate change, for example.  I would not for a moment make the case that they are just confined to issues of big business.  I think the reason one hears sovereignty talked about the most regarding taxation is that it is such an important part of our economic sovereignty.</p></speech>

I am just repeating a key answer to the Senator's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019020500002#Z00900"><p>The Minister has taken pay off the table, though.  Nurses build up time in lieu because they cannot get out of work on time as there is not sufficient staffing for them to be released.  As they end up having a number of hours each and every week that they cannot take, they are working for free.  They are therefore subsidising the health service above and beyond their 39 hours.  This is surely connected to the issue of pay and links into the recruitment and retention crisis we are trying to address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019020500002#Z01000"><p>The Senator is correct that the number of hours people work or do not work of course feeds into the effect that pay policy can have on anyone.  As for the assertion she made about recruitment and retention and her description of it as a crisis, I go back to the learnings and conclusions of the Public Service Pay Commission's report, which I accept and which stated we do not have a generalised recruitment and retention difficulty.  The report acknowledged, however, that we do have challenges within some sectors and some hospitals.  This is why I have accepted the recommendations on specific allowances.</p></speech>

People have lost confidence in those, including the Minister, who are managing the procurement process and continue using the procurement model that has led us to so many failures.  These failures include the situation we faced with Carillion, which the committee examined; the national broadband plan; and JobPath, which will be discussed in the D&aacute;il later this evening and in respect of which we have spent approximately &euro;100 million on engaging private companies.  We never saw the contracts that allowed JobPath to bring back thousands of vulnerable jobseekers again and again and get repaid for doing so, each job costing citizens over &euro;3,000.  It is because of all these issues together that I certainly do not have confidence in the procurement processes.  I wonder how much more is happening beyond what we have had sight of and how much more money is being wasted.  We compare this with the procurement rules for the smaller community organisations, the rural affairs organisations and the local authorities, which cannot buy a packet of biscuits without going through a rigid procurement process.</p><p>As the person with whom the buck stops, what would the Minister do differently about the national children's hospital if it was 18 or 12 months ago?  Will he change the procurement models in use as they are not serving us?</p></speech>

Where we may differ is I do not think she envisages any role for the private sector in delivering projects, but I do.  The tendering process we have used, which has worked a lot of the time for schools, primary care centres and road projects, involves the State tendering for the best value and then using its resources to deliver projects.  While I accept and acknowledge the great difficulty with this phase of the national children's hospital, I can point to many other projects delivered through use of the private sector that have worked.</p> <p>  For me one of the key learnings arising from the national children's hospital is that we need to be more aware that if we set project prices at a particular point in the economic cycle, as we complete the actual tendering process, perhaps after several years there can be a very big variance between what we thought it would cost and what it ends up costing.  The degree of cost inflation in this project will have consequences for other projects in the future.</p></speech>

They go in with a much lower price, knowing they can do so because there do not seem to be sufficient management structures, and then continually add to that figure.  Are we not leaving ourselves open to a challenge?  Others who have tendered at another price could come back and point out that their tender prices were much lower than the one the State has ended up paying.  Would that not present a legal problem?</p></speech>

Value has two different elements, namely, price and the quality of the work done.  If it turned out, when procurement processes are reviewed, that an organisation made a project available to a company that was not the cheapest bidder, questions would be raised about whether we could have secured the project at a lower price.  For that reason, if a firm offers a lower tender price for a project the probability is that it will secure that project.  However, when Departments are making final decisions on matters they take account of other factors apart from the exact price.</p></speech>

I take his point about value and price.  We all know the difference between the two.  There do not appear to be any controls in place.  That is one of the biggest problems.  The other problem is that companies can offer any price that they want, ensure it is the lowest price, and then add on whatever other costs they want afterwards.</p></speech>

Of course we spend little time debating projects that communities need and which are delivered on time and on budget.  I understand why those projects do not get the kind of scrutiny a project with this kind of difficulty deservedly does.  I do not believe we have a situation of mass waste on our different projects.  Those involved in making decisions on projects tend to want to find the most effective use of taxpayers' money.</p><p>However we are now finding that the cost inflation in some of our largest projects is higher than was anticipated when the decision to go ahead with them was made.</p></speech>

I do not think that the capacity to deliver the projects, or the will to deliver them with real value for money, is there.  I refer to JobPath.  The Minister may have been involved in that, or perhaps the Taoiseach was.  The Taoiseach was the Minister in charge at the time.  I raised JobPath and the waste of money involved in it with him before he was Taoiseach.  The Local Employment Service Network, LESN, is publicly funded.  The State contracts private companies and pays them &euro;100 million.  We will be examining that further in another forum.</p> <p>  We are here to discuss Brexit.  On that topic, has the Government formally requested the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund?  We all agree on one thing.  As the Minister said, we are in very exceptional circumstances.  The fund could be used to address some of the problems companies will face.</p></speech>

She has had wide-ranging discussions with the Commission about the various kinds of supports that might be needed.</p></speech>

Whether there is a hard or soft Brexit, I am concerned about the gap between 29 March and the point when funding will be available on the necessary scale, particularly in the regions which may face a downturn, as the Minister noted.  I am afraid that during that gap many businesses will go to the wall.  That is why I think we should be front-loading some of these schemes.  I refer to schemes that small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, can access without much bureaucracy.  There is a fear that while some loans and supports are available, they are not available on the scale that we need.  Moreover, the derogations from the state aid rules need to be maximised at this stage.  Regardless of what kind of Brexit we end up with, front-loading those projects would help to mitigate some of the consequences.</p></speech>

The Commission's intention is to support Ireland in the various challenges we could face.  In regard to what we will do for SMEs, we will do all we can to provide support and help to different parts of our economy in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  I do not want to understate just how challenging and disruptive that will be.  Any Brexit scenario we could face will be different from the <i>status quo</i>.  The Government, with support from Europe, will provide help and support.</p><p>It will still be very different from today.</p></speech>

It appears to me from listening to the exchanges here that the Department of Health was the bad apple in this barrel.  It has a history of overruns.  It cannot live within its budget year to year.  It seems to have contaminated that process and the communications systems between the board, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not so much the procurement process.  People in responsible positions seem to have failed to carry out their full duty to report the expected measure of overspend.  I imagine these are not junior officials but senior officials within the Civil Service who should be more aware of the budgetary and political consequences.  There was a failure of communication within the Minister's Department and I heard clearly what the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, said today about reporting and such.</p> <p>  The clarification sought by Senator Kieran O'Donnell was about the final cost.  The Minister said that it was &euro;1.4 billion but may go beyond that.  A figure of &euro;1.7 billion was mentioned, and another of &euro;2 billion.  Are the groundworks included in the &euro;1.4 billion?</p></speech>

This was a failure of the management not just of the budget but of a plan and tendering process.  Nobody seems to have been held accountable about who did not report to a person or Department.  I am reflecting what was said at the meeting here.  It arose in June, the Minister introduced the budget in October and people began to learn of the overrun towards the end of last year.  It is shocking and I know that we often do not acknowledge the projects that come in on time, but when we get it wrong, we get it spectacularly wrong.</p></speech>

I can appreciate the sensitivity and the Minister not wanting to announce to the wider world what is the worst and best case scenario.  I presume the Department is preparing figures for a worst case scenario rather than the central scenario.  It is not just looking at what will happen if everything goes reasonably okay.</p></speech>

I could understand it if the Department had many iterations of what was ongoing and that it might not necessarily want to share figures for a "nuclear fallout" or worst case scenario.  The Minister is saying the most likely scenario affects the creation of approximately 50,000 jobs and that there would be more people on the live register, etc.</p></speech>

I appreciate that nobody else has covered it, but we have been considering it as a committee.  Most members have highlighted it both here and in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  I appreciate the independence of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister took the relevant Bill on Committee Stage, but the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, took the final part of the debate on Report Stage.  He mentioned that when the tax strategy group reported, it would bring clarity to the matter.  Would it not be better for the Minister to ask the Revenue Commissioners to consider holding off on implementation of the change on 1 March until the report is published?</p></speech>

Therefore, I cannot ask them to do something in how they interpret the law.  It is all part and parcel of recognising that they are independent and evaluate tax law as they see fit.  I have had much contact about this matter and the Senator is aware of its origins.  The Revenue Commissioners have formed a view that the application of VAT in the sector was straining, with more products included than they felt was appropriate.  I am reviewing the position because I have received correspondence on it.</p></speech>

I accept that this affects a broad range of products and that not everything is as good as other products.  Quite often it is elderly people or those who are genuinely very unwell with chronic illnesses who buy some food supplements to help with whatever conditions they have.  Their prices will increase by almost one quarter if a VAT rate of 23% is applied to them.  It will have a significant impact on some people, often those who are not terribly well and do not have sufficient income.  I appreciate that not all food supplements are amazing, but many have beneficial qualities; therefore, if people do not take them, they could end up using the health service, costing us &euro;700 or &euro;800 per day or whatever the daily rate is.  There might be a false economy as we might only receive a little in VAT.  I have highlighted the independence of the Revenue Commissioners and take on board the fact that the Minister is carrying out a review.  It might be false economy for the State to gain a little in VAT when half of the people might no longer buy the products and they later become sick and have to go to doctors to claim other and more expensive products.  We should bear this in mind.</p> <p>  There is the matter of taxation.</p><p>I will attend the OECD next week on behalf of the committee.  The Minister has done a great deal of work with the OECD on addressing global concerns about the loss of tax revenues from various companies.  Unfortunately, we have a certain reputation.  Like the Minister, I defend Ireland and point out that we are not seeking the &euro;13 billion, given that it was not earned here and does not belong to us.  When the Minister meets other finance Ministers and, presumably, is sometimes accused of collecting revenues greater than he is entitled to, what is his line?</p></speech>

It depends on what kind of finance Minister one is talking to and from where he or she comes.  Finance Ministers from exporting economies tend to understand our point quickly.</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that, given the veto possessed by Ireland and other countries, the proposal will not proceed any further and is dead in the water?</p></speech>

I am the chair of a school board that sometimes considers building an extension and looks at various prices.  I understand building inflation and initial guesstimates, but we are talking about a cost that started at &euro;600 million or &euro;650 million nearly tripling.  Some people say it might even hit &euro;2 billion.  We are not far off tripling the initial cost now, which is a significant increase on what is the largest project in the State.  It will be the most expensive hospital ever built per room.  The State owned the land, so did not even have to buy any.  Has the Minister any indication as to why a project that was supposed to cost &euro;650 million not that long ago will now not give the Exchequer much change back out of &euro;2 billion?  It cannot all be building inflation.  Building inflation in Dublin is not anything remotely like that, and I was even surprised when I heard that the rate was 4% to 6%.  A sum of &euro;500,000 will be spent on a more in-depth costing, but there must be an initial figure.  The Minister stated that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has done all of the work that he would have asked him to do had he told him in the first place.  He has done a great deal of work and examined all of the issues.  What has he found?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019020500002#GG00600"><p>There are three factors that I am clear on that have contributed to the issue facing us, the first of which is the general effect of cost inflation.  Cost inflation has grown at a quicker pace than was anticipated when the original figures for the project were identified.  Second, a number of specialised forms of work need to be done and have, in turn, become even more expensive, for example, electrical engineering.  Third, as the project was being moved forward, the clinical standards and design of the hospital began to evolve, which had an effect on the cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019020500002#GG00700"><p>Was none of those reasons, including clinical standards, anticipated?  Hospitals are built all over the world all of the time.  I am sure that this hospital will be best practice - it would want to be at this price - but surely many of those reasons should have been anticipated by the quantity surveyors and architects, officials in the Department of Health or people involved in the project team.  I do not expect the Minister, with two Departments to run, to look over plans and go through everything on a line-by-line basis, but were there not processes in place that could have anticipated these developments before someone even said the project would cost &euro;650 million?  Perhaps if these figures were examined earlier, the project might have gone to a different site.  I am not saying it should do so, particularly at this stage, but perhaps someone would have said that &euro;2 billion was far too much and suggested doing something else in a different way on a greenfield site where building would not have to be done in an inner city, built-up area.  Why was some of this not anticipated?</p></speech>

If a rate of cost inflation shifts even a little in a given year, the compound effect of that over four to five years has a significant effect on the project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019020500002#HH00200"><p>It would have some effect, but no one looking at this proposal would expect the projected cost to almost triple.  The Minister is a fair person, and if he were sitting here and I were sitting there, he would challenge me on how the cost tripled.</p></speech>

All of the individuals who have been working on this project are competent and professional and have been dedicated to trying to deliver it.  There were issues with the project's initial estimate and how the higher cost was shared.  As I became aware of this issue in the timings that I indicated to the committee, I met many of the individuals involved.  They are very skilled professionals.  However, the cost of this project and how that cost was shared are issues of grave concern to me.</p></speech>

It was in hindsight, but is the Minister concerned that it was pitched low - contractors sometimes do that, although I am not saying that &euro;650 million was the contractor's figure - so that people would think they could live with that amount?  Should it always have been &euro;1.4 billion or &euro;1.6 billion?  Why was it so low?  Although we can kick that question off to the PwC report, there must have been some initial sense.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is busy trying to run the Department of Health, but this is the largest project in the State and will undoubtedly outlive all of us.  Was the figure lowballed at &euro;650 million to get the project over the line in the public's view?  No one would have agreed to build the most expensive hospital in the world.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, would not have said that.</p></speech>

I also do not believe it was lowballed to influence the choice of site.  However, it is clear in retrospect that the initial figure was too low versus the cost we have now.  When the &euro;650 million figure was identified, which would have been in 2012 or 2013, it was based on expectations of what would happen with cost inflation and in delivering the project.  It is obvious now that there has been significant change in all of those costs.</p></speech>

My concern is that, if the machinery of the State got this so wrong, it might end up being &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion.  How can we say with any certainty that the new figures are right if all of the previous figures so far have been proved so wrong?</p> <p>  I will take 30 seconds to raise one other issue.  I have mentioned to the Minister the major issue with staff recruitment and retention, especially in the greater Dublin area.  The pay of public servants, in particular, is not rising at the same rate as in companies such as Facebook, Google, eBay and PayPal.  It is great that people in those companies are earning as much as they are, but they are driving up the cost of everything for many other people.  The Minister needs to examine this issue.  In schools all over Dublin, probably including the Minister's constituency, teachers are travelling-----</p></speech>

It is difficult to get people if they have to travel two or three hours per day each way.  That is not conducive to good teaching, good nursing, good policing or whatever.  This matter must be examined.  If we could drive down the cost of housing and make it more affordable, perhaps they would not need the same rate of pay.  At the moment, though, we are facing a challenge.</p></speech>

That is why we have created the Land Development Agency and why we are seeking to make progress in the provision of affordable housing.</p> <p>  On the point about higher costs, I do not believe we will approach the figures the Senator mentioned.  The main reason for that is that we are now clear about the exact tendered price rather than the anticipated price.  We are now debating prices after the tendering process is complete for key parts of the hospital.  For those reasons I do not believe we will be looking at the kind of changes the Senator has suggested.</p></speech>

Some figures mentioned as possible price tags for the children's hospital include &euro;950 million and &euro;1.4 billion.  Has there been a tendering process all along which led to all of those increases?  Was there a main contract in the first instance which was supplemented by invoices from the main contractor?  Will tendering processes continue until the end of project?</p></speech>

From what we have read in the papers it seems that BAM won the tender bid because it bid &euro;130 million lower than the next lowest offer.

The public can be fully assured that it is not just extras that is driving the cost of this towards &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

If a withdrawal treaty is implemented and has a backstop contained in it, we know that if the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU does not allow the movement of goods between Northern Ireland into Ireland, it is very likely that the backstop will be operational.  In that case, there will be regulatory alignment between the North and the South, which will entail the free movement of goods.  If we do not have an agreement and a disorderly environment prevails, the movement of that truck will have to be determined by processes agreed between the European Commission, the UK and Ireland.</p></speech>

In the absence of that, there would have to be an agreement in place to cover how access would be managed and the circumstances under which it would happen.  One of the key issues, on which I know the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has been engaging, is that a key principle of European aviation is that any air carrier wishing to operate in the single aviation market has to have a majority ownership of EU nationals.  Time is being allowed to international airlines to restructure to ensure that the access they currently have across the EU is maintained for a period.</p></speech>

We have heard that 600 extra staff are being taken on by the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners to help deal with Brexit.  I am sure that many of those companies, whether the manufacturing companies which have their own storage facilities or an independent storage company that warehouses goods on their behalf, whether coming to or going out of Ireland, will get full support from the Revenue Commissioners and customs officers on what they have to do to meet requirements.

There are two things happening specifically.  The Revenue Commissioners are either organising seminars or are engaging with representative bodies in different sectors of the economy, explaining to those bodies the kinds of requirements necessary to deal with a third country.  To be clear, even though the Revenue Commissioners will be able to give a lot of support and advice on the situation in the event of a disorderly Brexit, it will involve change for individual companies and will affect their costs bases and how they supply goods.</p><p>At this point, what the Revenue Commissioners can do is indicate to people the change that is likely to happen and give them enough time to plan for it.  There will be change, however.</p></speech>

This has implications for the health budget, the whole capital programme, other budgets and the competence of the State to deliver large-scale capital projects.  I was prompted to ask a question when the Minister outlined the three main reasons for the overrun, namely, general cost inflation in construction, a lack of understanding around the technology costs such as cabling and changing clinical standards.  Those seem to be the three main reasons for the cost overrun.  If one talks to people around town who are involved in large-scale capital construction projects, they say the main reason was that the State sought an initial cost estimate before the detailed design drawings had been done.  They say it was a political imperative that pushed the process and it was to get political kudos by showing the Government was delivering and acting quickly.  We did not get our ducks in a row.  We got a costing based on planning drawings rather than detailed construction drawings.  That is one of the reasons for the massive overrun.  The eventual contract winner, BAM Ireland, had the State over a barrel because the deal was done before we knew what we were getting into.  When I ask people around town with real expertise in capital construction, quantity surveying and other areas, that is what they tell me.  They do not say anything about changing clinical standards.  They say that for political reasons the State pushed the bidding process in the wrong way and that is why we are in trouble.  Does the Minister wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

The other interpretation of the Deputy's comments is that the reason the State was trying to build this hospital quickly was that this particular project had been the subject of much debate and discussion for a long time.  One of the benefits of the PwC review that is under way is that it may offer further views and insights on this issue.  However, the three reasons I have outlined to the committee are the factors that had the biggest effect on this project.</p></speech>

It is not as if cabling technology or hospital technology are changing that quickly.  The bidder was able to bid without the final design.  While there are other issues, for example, a difficult site, I am told the main reason for the overrun is that there was a political imperative to be seen to be announcing good things and this pushed us to sign a contract before we had the detailed designs.  That is what people around town are telling me.</p></speech>

What I can comment on is the work I have done to date in trying to understand the key reasons this project is costing more than had been anticipated.  I have outlined those reasons.  It occurred to me, as the Deputy outlined what he is hearing elsewhere, that such comments may in part be driven by the fact that the design and specification of the project heightened as it went on and, in turn, that created some of the cost difficulty we are now dealing with.</p></speech>

As I said, I am going on anecdotal evidence from people I trust in Dublin who are involved in this area.  I am just reporting back to the Minister what is being said to me.  It would be very useful to get a very detailed analysis, possibly as part of the PwC report.</p><p>I would love to be able to get that level of detail on the various stages of the bidding process and the stages at which the design was when the bidding took place in order that I can check if my friends are correct.</p></speech>

I heard the point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan on the overrun.  There is no doubt that construction inflation would have been factored into costs.  Every project has construction inflation factored into it.  Inflation has exceeded what was expected.  Will the Minister outline what rate of inflation was factored in for the project and what has materialised?</p><p>On upgrades or enhancements to the hospital project, all of those would have been sanctioned at a point in time.  One cannot decide to build a road and then turn it into a dual carriageway without having sanction from the Department.  None of this explains this whopper of an overrun - &euro;500 million - that just materialised because these increases would have had to be factored in and those estimates of the additional inflation would have been known.  If I am building a four bedroom house and I decide to make it an eight bedroom house, I will factor in the costs at that point.  It is not as if I would decide to turn it into an eight bedroom house and the cost will be the same.  I do not understand how this overrun happened.</p><p>A number of major projects are due to be rolled out in the next few years.  I have a clear view that the Minister was asleep at the wheel on this and took a hands-off approach.  The fact that the Minister for Health did not even bother to lift the phone or speak to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the corridor to say the national children's hospital had bust the bank and was running &euro;500 million over budget or did not have his officials inform the Minister's officials in a routine meeting is bizarre stuff.  It shows complete incompetence at Government level and a<i>laissez-faire</i>attitude to the public purse and spending.  It is clear that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was not over this issue and was not keeping a running look at what was happening, given that so many people in his Department and other Departments were aware of this and he was kept completely in the dark.</p><p>How can the Minister satisfy this committee that this will not happen with other projects and that there are robust procedures in place for projects such as MetroLink and we will not see another overrun of a couple of hundred million euro in a couple of months or years?  We had come out of this type of approach taken in the old Fianna F&aacute;il era, no harm to it, in terms of the back of the envelope stuff.  This was all supposed to be a thing of the past and a relic of our history.  This is why the International Monetary Fund, IMF, suggested that the Minister have a tracking monitor within his Department to monitor capital projects.  It is why there are robust rules in place for reporting to Cabinet on projects costing more than &euro;100 million.  The Minister was completely asleep.  How can he instil any confidence in us that he has got to grips with this issue?  It appears the Cabinet is dysfunctional.  I am sure the Minister and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, talk.  I am sure they chat and meet each other in the corridor, at Cabinet meetings and at different events.  Did the Minister for Health raise the issue with the Minister personally after the Minister's officials were told by the Minister for Health's officials and then contacted the Minister?  Did they ever have a conversation about this issue?  It is bizarre that there has been such an overrun and the two Ministers responsible did not have a conversation to relay that information directly, but allowed their officials to bring it up in a routine meeting.</p></speech>

The Deputy will make his mind up on my stewardship or management of public money.  I make the point again that we have multiple other projects across the State that are smaller than this but cumulatively far bigger in value that come in on budget and are delivered in the way the country wants.</p><p>Clearly, we have a flagship project here that involved a lot of complexity in cost.  I have acknowledged that there are clear learnings from it regarding how information was shared and the consequences that it posed for me but if one looks at the many projects we have delivered, procurement processes worked well and good projects were delivered.  This is clearly a project in terms of the scale of money and its importance and we must look at what went wrong and what could be done differently for other comparable projects.</p></speech>

I have responsibility for how the taxpayers' money is spent.  Regardless of the different governance questions or the different boards, I accept responsibility for how the public's money is spent.  That is why I am doing two things.  The first is that I will look at other comparable projects that we have of this size from a tendering and governance point of view to see whether there are any learnings that are transferable.  Second, I have been involved intensively in this phase of the project since early November and I have been looking at what is the right thing to do.  In addition to accepting responsibility for where we stand, I also accept responsibility for all of the other projects that happen in the way the public wants but I understand the reason scrutiny is happening on this project.</p></speech>

The reason for that is we are referring to many costs that have now been tendered.  As to whether I believe it will go above the larger figures that have been quoted at the Committee of Public Accounts and elsewhere, at this point I do not, but clearly as we look at how this project is going to be managed moving forward, I need to ensure that it does not happen.</p></speech>

There has been a continuous effort to try to centralise tax sovereignty and remove our tax decision powers from us as a sovereign state.  That is ongoing.  The Minister made that point in respect of the passerelle clause.  Is it his position that we would be told of any such proposal to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting on taxation matters?  Is he crystal clear that it is not an issue for discussion and that our tax sovereignty will remain as it is, and whatever about other member states trying to pool that sovereignty, Ireland will stand firm on the issue?</p></speech>

There are two issues.  The first is that I do not believe it would get to the point in which we would have conversations about a veto on this issue.  The reason for that is I know many other countries share our concerns.  The protections that we have, such as through the Lisbon treaty, or all of the debates that I have been involved in on this issue, means that I will not agree to anything that will undermine our ability to set our tax policy in key areas.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that it will be resisted, and rightly so.</p> <p>  We have had many discussions about the BEPS process, the Minister will be aware that last week the OECD issued a policy note on the inclusive framework addressing tax challenges in the digital economy.  For the first time it has talked about the allocation of taxing rights.  That is a significant move from the OECD in respect of the BEPS process.  It is in the chapter on the proposed way forward where it suggests a pay-where-you-earn scenario, as opposed to where the physical infrastructure is and where the employees are.  That would be a significant issue for Ireland given the number of companies that are taxed here.  If we had a pay-as-you-earn scenario, the State's revenue would be significantly reduced.  What is Ireland's position on the proposal?  Is it the case that Ireland will resist that?  Does it not flag up as well the vulnerability of some of our taxation positions if this were to take place, given the heavy reliance on a number of companies, regardless of whether they remain here, in the future?  There would be a significant reduction in taxation accrued from them.</p></speech>

However, many other countries within the OECD have a similar concern and many other companies involved in this process also have concerns regarding their global business models and how they would be able to internationalise their businesses.  I accept that there is a particular section within the report that would be definitely a challenge for us but, on the other hand, there are other proposals in the OECD report that offer a basis for engagement as well.  We have a long road ahead of us now in the OECD process to try to see whether we can get to a similar place as we did on BEPS.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to insurance companies, some of which have contingency planning, but there are issues with others who have not done that in the UK and Malta.  In the context of Brexit, what does that mean for a consumer who might be listening to the debate?  If I was watching the committee proceedings, I would not understand what it means.  Does it mean my insurance policy could come to an end on 29 March?  What does it mean in practice for those companies that have not done the proper contingency planning and that are located in Malta or the UK and are passporting into Ireland?  Will that information be publicly available to consumers who may be considering renewing their policies at this point in time?</p></speech>

However, in the Brexit omnibus Bill that we are bringing forward, we have a section allowing a three-year window within which products that have been made available from those two jurisdictions would still be operable here in Ireland.</p><p>My message to consumers who may have those products is when our legislation is passed, there will be a three-year window during which their current rights and protections will be maintained, but people need to be aware that after the three-year window there may be choices they have to make to ensure their home or business continues to be insured in the future.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister might consider that because it will have major implications for the businesses involved and for the individuals who rely on such supplements.  I hope he can come to a speedy and positive conclusion on it.</p> <p>  On nurses' pay, I wish to highlight that psychiatric nurses are not doing overtime.  The psychiatric service is pushed to the pin of its collar to deliver the type of services on demand required by people who turn up to avail of them.  I have no doubt that the ban on overtime is going to affect that cohort of patients in a very negative way, just as much as those who have had operations cancelled and so on.  After this there will be a significant buildup of issues to be dealt with in the context of patients and patient safety.  All of us have been in and out of hospitals as patients or as visitors.  This situation has gone on for a long number of years; it has not just happened now.  Nurses are under serious pressure on wards and it is caused by lack of appropriate ratios of nurses to patients.  I believe that some intervention has to be made by the Minister or by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  The Minister has said that at some stage a point will be found to resolve the issues.  That is a fact, but engaging with the nurses and talking about pay is part of that.  I understand that I can say that and the Minister has a wider agenda to look after with a balance to be achieved, but at some stage this is going to give.  There is public opinion behind the nurses and there is the determination of the nurses to see this through because it affects so many of them.</p><p>All I can do is encourage the Minister and the Minister for Health to acknowledge the differences in the hospitals and the differences in terms of the nurses and what they have to go through on a daily basis and to respond accordingly.</p></speech>

I do not expect, or want, the Minister to respond now because it is a detailed technical tax-related issue but I ask that following examination of the diagram by him and his officials, his officials would come back to the committee to tell us how this particular type of special purpose vehicle, SPV, works, including where it does and does not govern and how it governs.

As members will have seen from the general scheme, the Bill covers a number of areas which is why there are three company law sections in the Department represented here today.</p> <p>  The general scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill gives effect to two of the 14 measures published in November 2017 in the document entitled, Measures to Enhance Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework - Ireland combatting &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo;&rsquo;.  The two measures contained in this Bill are to establish the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, as an agency that is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law and to implement recommendations of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, on corporate governance.  The general scheme also incorporates some additional provisions.  It implements recommendations of the CLRG on shares and share capital and introduces some new transparency measures with respect to companies, the conduct of liquidations and the Register of Companies.  </p> <p>  The establishment of the ODCE as an agency is dealt with in part 2 of the general scheme.  As mentioned already, the Government decided in late 2017 to establish the ODCE as an agency with a commission-type structure and distinct from the Department.  Accordingly, the general scheme provides for establishment of the ODCE as an agency, to be named the corporate enforcement authority.  The commission structure is modelled on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC and, therefore, many of the provisions are inspired by provisions in the legislation that established the CCPC.  In some cases, the recent legislation establishing the Data Protection Commission has also served as a precedent. </p> <p>  The new authority will have between one and three commissioners, one to be chairperson, and each will be appointed by the Minister following a recruitment process conducted by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  This structure and flexibility is intended to allow the authority to adapt if its workload expands significantly or if it needs to organise its work into discrete areas or functions.  Another feature of the scheme with respect to the authority&rsquo;s autonomy is that it provides that the authority will be able to determine itself the skills, levels and numbers of staff it will need to conduct its work, subject to overall budgetary sanction and approval. </p> <p>  All of the current functions of the ODCE will be carried over to the new authority.  These include encouraging compliance with the Companies Act 2014, investigations of suspected offences and non-compliance with the Act, prosecution of summary offences, referring indictable offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the exercise of certain supervisory functions with respect to liquidators and receivers.  The scheme also includes savers for any work under way at the time of the transfer from the ODCE to the authority. </p> <p>  The Government also decided in 2017 to better equip the new authority to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  While the current range of powers of the ODCE will be carried over to the new authority, some new investigative tools have been identified and added.  The first of these is a development of the current power of search and entry at head 46.  The intention here is to meet the changes arising from technological advances and to allow the authority to get a search warrant that enables it to search for electronic records that a company may hold on a server that is remote from the company or to be able to use its own equipment, where the equipment of the company is a little slow or old.  This is new ground and, if feasible, this power will be of interest to other investigative bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  For this reason, and to ensure that it is workable, robust and includes appropriate safeguards, the Department will be developing this provision in consultation with the Offices of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel as well as the Department of Justice and Equality. </p> <p>  Another new tool is the provision in head 45 on the admissibility of written statements.  This is a statutory exemption from the hearsay rule, allowing the courts to consider written statements as evidence in certain circumstances.  This is modelled on a provision in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act.</p><p>Alongside these provisions in the general scheme, the Department is working with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to giving the new authority a power under the forthcoming communications (retention of data) Bill to apply directly to the courts to retain specified telecommunication records for an investigation. </p><p> The general scheme also introduces new measures with respect to liquidations that are designed to enhance the authority&rsquo;s powers.  Part 5 introduces a new ground for the authority, or others, to apply to the courts for an order restricting a person&rsquo;s ability to act as a company director.  In particular, it enables the authority to apply for a restriction order where a director of a company has failed to meet certain requirements in the course of that company becoming insolvent.  This is intended to address the situation where a director does not conduct an orderly winding up of a company.  A consequence of this can be that creditors, including employees, cannot get paid from the company&rsquo;s remaining resources or, in some cases, cannot access the State&rsquo;s insolvency fund.  This is based on a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group on the protection of employees and unsecured creditors.  The general scheme also provides a power for the authority to request that a person acting as a liquidator provide evidence to the authority that he or she is qualified to act as a liquidator in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.</p><p> The general scheme gives effect to recommendations included in two reports of the Company Law Review Group, namely, its reports on corporate governance and on shares and share capital, both published in 2014.  These provisions are encompassed in Parts 3 and 4 of the general scheme and most may be categorised as technical in that they address omissions, provide clarifications or rectify perceived anomalies.  As a rule, they arise from the large consolidation and modernisation project that took place between 2012 and 2014 and resulted in the Companies Act 2014.</p><p> Part 3 is concerned with shares and share capital.  These heads are intended to rectify some perceived anomalies regarding share capital following the reform of company law in 2014.  They reinstate provisions or clarifications from the now repealed Companies Acts 1963 to 2013 concerning the use of a company&rsquo;s share premium account, the payment of commission to investors in a share issue of a public limited company, PLC, and the law concerning the share management of unlimited companies.  In other cases, they are clarifications of the existing law.</p><p> Part 4 is intended to clarify certain corporate governance and other issues affecting the administration of company meetings.  Their purpose is to address anomalies and unforeseen consequences and to reaffirm the overall policy approach to the legislation.  As mentioned earlier, the provisions on restriction orders for directors are based on a third report of the Company Law Review Group.</p><p> The general scheme takes the opportunity to introduce some measures that are designed to improve corporate transparency.  The first of these is head 42, which is concerned with the frequency at which liquidators must submit their reports to the Companies Registration Office.  At present, only periods of six months or longer may be prescribed.  However, a gap can arise where there is less than six months between an interim report and the final report which is supplied at the conclusion of a liquidation.  Head 42 will facilitate the submission of interim reports more frequently, where necessary, to address such a gap.</p><p> Head 43 introduces a requirement for directors of Irish registered companies to provide their personal public service number, PPSN, to the Companies Registration Office.  This information will not be publicly available but it will enable the Companies Registration Office to verify the accuracy of information supplied to it on foot of the statutory obligations in the Companies Act 2014.  As well as supporting accuracy, this is intended to address the situation where one person uses different versions of his or her name on various company returns in order to appear as more than one person or to avoid the prohibition on holding more than 25 directorships at any one time.</p><p> Finally, head 47 proposes the deletion of an exemption from the rule that companies include the names of their directors on their company letterhead and correspondence.  This exemption was introduced in 1963, when the change of director required a new print run of stationery every time in order to comply.  In light of technological advances, this exemption from transparency requirements is no longer considered justified.</p><p> I am happy to take questions now.</p></speech>

I will start with a question related to the first paragraph on page 2 of the presentation.  Ms Greene said that the scheme also includes savers for work already under way at the time of the transfer from the ODCE to the authority.  I ask her to explain that statement.  I presume it means that work already under way will be transferred across.</p><p>Yes, cases or investigations already commenced will be transferred because the transfer will happen overnight.  Proceedings might have been issued in the name of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and it is important they would not fall on the basis of a technicality such as that.</p></speech>

Why is it that for an agency to function properly it must be transferred out of a Department?  Why are Departments not capable of managing agencies?  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has been a failed entity to date - an appallingly failed entity bordering on negligence.  Leaving that aside, why is it always necessary to move an entity out of a Department for it to function properly?  Are the Departments incapable of allowing entities to operate within them?</p></speech>

As an office of the Department it is a section of the Department and it forms part of the pool of the resources that are available to the Department.  When an entity is separate and autonomous it has much more control over its resources.  For example, if the ODCE wanted to recruit IT staff that request would be one of a number of requests to the Department's human resources section.  If the priorities of the Department as a whole are such that resources have to be put into a different area then the ODCE request may be lower down on the list of priorities.  As a standalone entity it has more control over its own resources because it does not form part of the pool of the Department as a whole.</p></speech>

We are transferring the office to an agency to enhance its autonomy.  One of the shortcomings identified by the judge was that in terms of staffing and skills the office, at that time, did not have the necessary depth of experience in criminal investigations.  There is a specialised skillset required within the agency.  It will need to have greater autonomy to recruit those specialised resources and also to retain them.  As stated by Ms Greene, currently the mobility structure is such that people can move into the office and out into the Department.  The staff of the ODCE, when fully established as an agency, will be dedicated resources for that agency.  It is about increasing the agency's ability to recruit and retain staff and enhancing its resources beyond what is currently available to it.  The agency will have greater control over the deployment of its resources and so it will be flexible enough to restructure itself to cope with, for example, a significant increase in caseload, as occurred in the office in 2008.  There will also be a dedicated and specialised career path within the agency.  Also, as an agency of the Department, it will have sanction to replace staff on a like-for-like basis.  It will have the ability, subject to the consent of the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Public Expenditure and Reform, to appoint its own staff and determine their grades.</p></speech>

How do we know that this legislation will be compatible with the aims and objectives of ensuring there will be no repeat of the mistakes made in the FitzPatrick trial, taking into account Judge Aylmer's findings in regard to the failures of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in terms of its administration, prosecutorial role and governance and the exposure during the trial of statement and witness tampering?  How do we know this particular legislation will underpin and ensure the office will not repeat those mistakes in light of the fact that nobody has had sight of Mr. Drennan's report and, therefore, cannot act on it?</p></speech>

The account that was published outlines the findings of Judge Aylmer.  Judge Aylmer's ruling in itself is extremely clear.  He has identified the investigative shortcomings.  In essence, the most significant shortcoming was around the collection of evidence.  It led to some of the judge's findings around contamination of witness statements.  Those were procedural issues as opposed to a weakness in the legislation.  Judge Aylmer did not find any deficiencies in the legislative process.  However, it is clear that procedures needed to be changed and they have been changed to ensure a Garda takes the lead in the collection of evidence from witnesses.  The staff of the office have undergone specialised training in witness statements.  The Bill builds on the reforms in the collection of evidence by promoting the ongoing, very close working relationship that the office has with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  Another issue was that the office lacked the depth of experience in criminal investigations which led to some of the shortcomings in the collection of evidence.  This pointed to the need for specialist recruitment.  The lack of forensic accountant capability at the time for the scale of the multiple investigations being undertaken was another issue.  The report also pointed to the lack of inhouse digital expertise.  Those reforms have been addressed.  The office will continue to evolve and its skills needs will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  As outlined earlier, the office, as an agency, will have enhanced powers to recruit and retain staff.  This speaks to some of the skills and staffing deficiencies.</p> <p>  A key finding was that the office was not equipped to undertake multiple complex investigations in parallel.  This will be addressed by the new structure.  The structure as set out in the Bill is a commissioner-type structure.  This provides the flexibility for the organisation to change its working structures and relationships to cope with an increase in workload.  On the lack of digital capability that existed at the time, the office has recruited a digital forensic specialist and forensic accountants and it has built a new digital infrastructure.  Even though legislative deficiencies were not identified, we have considered some of the enhanced powers that the agency may need, one of which, as outlined by my colleague in the opening statement, is enhanced powers of search and entry for information stored digitally.  We are evolving the Bill to enhance the capacity of the office.  We are addressing the skills issues and the collection of evidence issues in the Bill.</p></speech>

The Deputy may recall that Mr. Drennan's report was given under section 955 of the current legislation.  That has been slightly changed in the heads of this Bill.  The other confidentiality provisions in section 956 will be carried over now because the investigation has to be protected and all of that.  However, section 955 is slightly changed now in that the chairperson of the new authority will be accountable to a committee such as this one and if the committee asks for information where it is not clear whether it can be disclosed, there is a new provision to go to the High Court and a judge will decide if it can be given to the committee.</p></speech>

I believe it has a very strong track record.  To put this into context, there were a number of investigations in parallel and there was only one where adverse shortcomings were identified.  The office has a good track record in terms of prosecutions.  It has a number of high profile prosecutions.  There was a lot of activity as well.  From 2007 to 2018, more than 1,860 directors were restricted and more than 240 directors were disqualified.</p> <p>  It must be remembered also that the ODCE undertakes a very proportionate approach to company law enforcement in order to free up time in the courts and free up businesses' time where serious breaches of company law are not in question.  It undertakes a proportionate regime where it offers advice.  It issues directions if the breaches are not very serious.  It then moves on to a prosecution or a voluntary undertaking, which has been an activity since 2015, again to free up time in the courts.  It has a very good track record in terms of the high profile cases. There are four I could refer to since 2014; I have the details of those available.  It is also doing ongoing advocacy work, and it undertakes a good deal of work in restrictions and disqualifications as well.</p></speech>

I am not trying to put her on the spot but as Deputy Kelleher said, following the collapse of the Sean FitzPatrick trial, Judge Aylmer was scathing of the role of the ODCE in respect of various issues including shredding of documents, witness coaching and so on.  Since that trial collapsed, has there been any change in personnel in the ODCE that would make Ms Collins state it is now fit for purpose?  I believe, as I am sure do many people, that was a damning indictment from Judge Aylmer.  If there have not been any changes in personnel since that trial collapsed, why would Ms Collins believe the ODCE is fit for purpose now?</p></speech>

To address the Chairman's specific question, we have had quite a number of changes in staff personnel.  The current director came in in 2012.  A huge amount of reform has taken place in the ODCE in recent years.  Speaking to the specialist recruitment, eight forensic accountants were recruited of whom seven are in place now in addition to two enforcement portfolio managers, two enforcement lawyers and a digital forensic specialist.  These are the new specialist cohort of staff to complement the existing staff within the office and bring a wealth of new skills.  There has been two very specific cohorts of training in the area of witness statements.</p> <p>  It is fully accepted that the standard of investigation was below par with the particular investigation to which we are referring.  The deficiencies were addressed in the skills available to the office and the depth of experience available.  Those issues have been addressed as well as the training in the collection of witness statements.  In addition to the new staff, procedural reform has taken place in that every witness taking statement will be led by a garda.  That is critical for the standards required for a criminal investigation.  It is something that should have happened previously but that is happening now.</p></speech>

The idea is to give flexibility.  One of the criticisms in Judge Aylmer's judgment was that the ODCE was not equipped to take on board a number of big cases at the same time.  If that arose for it again, it would be able to have an additional one or two commissioners to work with the chairperson.</p><p>We could have one commissioner over one particular investigation separate from the rest of the work of the body.</p></speech>

A lot of it requires a great deal more consideration and engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality because there may be consequences throughout the criminal justice system.  They have not been brought to the Government as of yet and perhaps they will in due course.  As I mentioned earlier, two other reviews are looking at this area with a certain amount of overlap.</p><p>The Company Law Review Group is very much working on this area, and the review group on anti-fraud and anti-corruption touches on many of these areas.  Issues may arise from these that will require new provisions to be inserted into the Bill.</p></speech>

I was my party's justice spokesperson and I remember at the time a key contribution was made by Remy Farrell, a senior counsel.  He was heavily critical and stated it had never been a better time for white-collar crime.  He referred to the dramatic under-resourcing of a range of agencies, including the ODCE that had one accountant at the time, which was shocking, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Garda computer crime investigation unit.  It was a mockery when we consider our State was brought down and made bankrupt by the reckless behaviour of people in the white-collar sector.  It astounding that in 2014, six years after the State collapsed, we had completely under-resourced the agencies responsible for ensuring proper regulatory oversight of the various business sectors.  One of the strong recommendations of Remy Farrell and others at the time was the need for one agency under one roof where all of these matters would be dealt with.  This is why I need a very strong understanding of why the Department is proceeding in this direction and not with the Law Reform's Commission's recommendation for a corporate crime agency.</p></speech>

The heads of the Bill had already circulated within the Government with a view to being approved, which they were on 4 December, so the recommendations came a little late to get a very comprehensive review.  The Law Reform Commission began by recommending that we carry on with the proposal the Government had issued the year before to establish the ODCE as a separate agency.  The Deputy is correct that the Law Reform Commission also spoke about a national crime agency, but that would deal with much wider issues than just company law and it needs a bit of thought.  This is one of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission that is being considered by the review group on anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures, so it has not been rejected but is being looked at.  The review group involves a range of stakeholders, including the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda, the Central Bank, the Department, the ODCE and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  It is due to make recommendations at the end of June.</p></speech>

Does Ms Greene foresee the corporate enforcement authority coming under the umbrella of a corporate crime agency and being subsumed into a wider agency at some stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-05a.500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sabha Greene" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019020500002#U00500"><p>That will be a matter for the Government to decide in due course.  In the meantime, something that comes out very clearly from the Law Reform Commission is the need for strong co-ordination and co-operation between all of the various bodies.  The heads include information exchange provisions on a statutory level.  There are existing memorandums of understanding and these will have to be redone because it will be a new authority.  We are trying to give it statutory support to ensure there is a clear-cut exchange of information and co-ordination, working on what exists.</p><p>In some ways, that is more important than them all being under one umbrella.  The Irish model has been to create bodies which specialise in a particular area of law.  It does not matter whether the crime is committed by an individual or a corporation, or on a small or grand scale, because the body has expertise in that area of law.  For example, we have the Health and Safety Authority and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  That is how we have been doing it and, to some extent, it has worked.  The recommendation of the LRC addresses crimes committed on a big scale by a large corporation.  One may not realise the offence is a big deal when one begins an investigation of what one considers likely to be a small fraud.  There are questions regarding the stage at which the investigation is escalated to another body.  These issues must be teased out in considering the recommendations.  It would be a change from our current model of enforcement.</p></speech>

I will not read them out as Ms Greene is familiar with them.  Does she agree with its assessment?  Are those six powers essential?  I acknowledge her point that the heads of the Bill were published before the report.  However, if she considers those powers essential, is she willing to make further amendments to the legislation to incorporate the points made?</p></speech>

One of the recommendations relates to a regulatory enforcement agreement but that is not appropriate to the ODCE because it is not a regulator.  It does not have a connection with the companies in respect of which it enforces company law.  For example, in the case of the Commission for Energy Regulation there is a licensing or regulatory relationship between the companies and the regulator.  There are powers other than those six in the regulatory toolkit, such as the deferred prosecution agreement.  As the Senator probably appreciates, those are matters for the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, because one would want a centralised approach in that regard.  If the powers in the heads of the Bill need some addition or finessing in order to better incorporate the LRC recommendations and the Government is of the view that such changes are required, then, of course, we will make them.</p></speech>

Memorandums of understanding are in place with some bodies.  It shares a significant amount of information with the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and those organisations have a very close working relationship.  This can be done in Ireland due to our small scale.  Large corporate crime agencies in certain other countries such as the United Kingdom operate on a far bigger scale and tackle very serious cases of wrongoing, whereas we work collaboratively within the existing structures and speciality streams.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that they highlighted that, ultimately, the Minister and the Government may need to reflect on that.  In their considerable collective experience, do they consider it likely that there would be resistance within the ODCE or the Department to a cross-departmental umbrella organisation which would ensure all of the various elements are working together?  I cannot over-emphasise that this State was bankrupted because of the utter recklessness of people we trusted in very important positions, as all present would agree.  We must not allow that to happen again, particularly in light of the damage that would be caused our international reputation as a location for investment.  The trial of Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick was referenced earlier by Deputy Kelleher.  Would the witnesses be resistant to or supportive of the concept of an umbrella agency?</p></speech>

It is a relatively recent recommendation.  Until now, the emphasis has been on ensuring that the various areas of expertise work as closely together as possible while developing their areas of expertise.  My only concern would be that if one has a big agency, one may risk losing speciality expertise because there is a limited pool of resources.  I am not aware of any resistance to the concept.  People are openly considering it.  One thing we know from putting together this general scheme is that clarity on one's mandate is very important from an enforcement point of view.  One needs to know exactly what it is one is meant to be going after.  Different offences bring different challenges and, therefore, different levels of expertise.  It needs far more thought but I am not aware of any opposition to it at this stage.</p></speech>

As it stands, the ODCE has a limited ability to impose administrative sanctions on the director of a company found culpable of an audit offence.  It does not have such powers outside those circumstances.  It is more focused on prosecution through the courts.  The question of administrative sanctions involves broader constitutional implications for the wider criminal justice system.  It is being looked at more broadly.</p></speech>
