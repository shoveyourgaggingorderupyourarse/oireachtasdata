I begin by welcoming witnesses and members to the meeting.  While Covid-19 restrictions are receding, and while it is open to members and witnesses to attend meetings in person, I ask that they continue to use face coverings.  When addressing the committee, face coverings can be removed.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.</p> <p>  This morning, we engage with the officials from National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to examine the national broadband plan, NBP, expenditure and related matters in the context of the 2020 appropriation accounts, Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications.  The meeting will be suspended for an hour at 12.30 p.m.  When we resume at 1.30 p.m., we will engage with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, to examine the national broadband plan expenditure and related matters further.</p> <p>  NBI has been advised that the committee may wish to examine the following matters related to expenditure on the national broadband plan during the course of the engagement: the impact of the pandemic on delivery; NBI's financial structures; the current progress and timelines; subcontracting arrangements; lease and rental of infrastructure from other companies; and penalty clauses in the contract.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from NBI: Mr. Peter Hendrick, CEO, Mr. T.J. Malone, chief executive officer of deployment, Ms Tara Collins, chief marketing officer, Mr. Barry Kelly, chief financial officer and Ms Jenny Fisher, chief legal officer.  They are all very welcome.  When we begin to engage, I will ask those who are attending remotely to mute themselves when not contributing, so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those who are in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or are switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation for anything they say in the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witness' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or of a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The CEO, Mr. Hendrick, is very welcome.  As is detailed in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes.  I know he has a longer statement, which has been circulated to members.  I ask that he keep within that timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#A00600"><p>I will.  I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation to discuss the national broadband plan today.  I am the CEO of National Broadband Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. T.J. Malone, who is CEO of NBI Deployment and who leads the team that is building the NBI network.  In addition, we have senior management teams: Ms Tara Collins, who is responsible for marketing communications; Mr. Barry Kelly from finance; and Ms Jenny Fisher on governance and who is the interface with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The team and I know from our work with other Oireachtas committees that it can be challenging to convey the size, scale, and complexity of the NBP from a boardroom setting.  Therefore, we have instigated a programme of field trips to show first-hand how the NBI network is being deployed.  The sessions have been widely recognised as informative and helpful.  For this reason, there remains an open invitation to all committee members to experience the work of our teams out in the field.</p> <p>  As CEO of NBI, I remain incredibly proud of the work our team is delivering, particularly against the backdrop of turbulent conditions caused by Covid-19.  NBI has been operating for 25 months, 23 of which have been under the shadow of the pandemic.  I believe that, despite the extreme and turbulent conditions faced throughout the project to date, the work of our team provides a platform that gives us confidence to deliver the project on time and on budget.  Our team has now scaled, with construction active across all 26 counties and more than 1,200 people hired, onboarded and working on the project.  That includes our specialist subcontractors, the likes of Integro, Indigo, KN Group, Secto, Actavo and TLI.  We are also working with infrastructure operators such as Open Eir and Enet.  I acknowledge all of the hard work that has been done by everybody involved to date, as well as the collective commitment to bring high-speed broadband to those who need it most.</p> <p>  Across the project, we have already made major achievements.  More than 298,000 premises have been surveyed, of which in excess of 252,000 have been designed or are in detail design.  These activities are vital precursors to the main build and they are continuing at pace.  More than 54,500 premises are currently able to place their order via their preferred retail service provider.  There are in excess of 154,000 premises that have been constructed or are under construction.  For context, the original plan would have seen us at approximately 180,000 premises under construction at this stage in the programme.  We have now awarded contracts to our build partners for more than 195,000 premises, which includes network build due for completion in first half of 2023.  A total of 475 broadband connection points, including schools, have been installed by NBI.  We have also increased our minimum speed from 150 Mbps to in excess of 500 Mbps, as well as offering 1 Gb and now 2 Gb products.  We recently announced that we are delivering high-speed broadband infrastructure to six islands off the coast of Donegal and Mayo, two of which were completed in January.  More than 50 retail service providers have already signed up to sell services on the NBI network, ensuring an increased range of products, all being offered at competitive prices for consumers.</p> <p>  As I have just mentioned, in excess of 154,000 premises either have been constructed or are under construction.  We believe this metric is the leading indicator for delivering the programme.  For context, the equivalent figure this time last year was approximately 19,000.  Therefore, it can be seen how this is ramping up and how it will directly feed into premises passed and connection numbers in time.  Additionally, we are implementing a series of initiatives that lend confidence to the delivery of the 2022 programme and beyond, including, but not limited to, the fact we have contracted with Eir to increase the volume of pole replacement and duct insulation, which commenced on 1 October 2021.</p> <p>  Turning to other matters, I can appreciate some recent media attention on the shareholder structure of NBI may have concerned members of the committee.  We endeavoured to clarify these matters in a transparent and open way at an Oireachtas joint committee two weeks ago.  We welcome the opportunity to attend today to provide further clarifications.  Consequently, I would like to clarify the following points.  The ownership structure remains as it was at the signing of the contract.  The shareholders of NBI Infrastructure DAC and NBI Deployment DAC are Metallah Limited and the Minister, who holds a special share with certain consent rights in respect of NBI Infrastructure DAC and NBI Deployment DAC.  The shareholder of Metallah Limited is Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited.  Above Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited, there are holding companies and investment vehicles into which the various investors have invested at different levels.  This structure would not be unusual in the context of a major infrastructure project with a series of international investors.  David McCourt, via voting rights in each tier of the company's structure, retains control of NBI.</p> <p>  On the potential for bringing in new investors to the project, I would clarify the following.  As the risk profile of the project evolves, it is likely that some of our early stage investors, who helped to turn NBI from an idea into reality at a point when there was still much unquantifiable risk in the project, will be replaced with investors who specialise in long-term investments.  This has always been the plan and is the reason that mechanisms for change of ownership are allowed in the contract, subject to approval from the Department, as is standard practice in such long-term contracts.</p><p> The corporate structure as it is today or into the future will not change NBI&rsquo;s contractual commitments or collective goal, delivering the infrastructure that will radically transform the country&rsquo;s broadband landscape.  Any new investors will be required to step into the proportional share of the shareholders' funding commitments.  The shift to new investors, who will bring this long-term capital, will not cost the people of Ireland or the State any additional money and will not impact on the day-to-day operations of the business.</p></speech>

His script is available to members, and they have read the rest of it.</p> <p>  The lead speaker this morning is Deputy O'Connor.  He has swapped with Deputy Devlin.  Deputy O'Connor has 15 minutes and the other speakers will each have ten.  I will give the Deputy a reminder after 12 minutes.  We will break for ten minutes at 11 a.m. approximately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00300"><p>I welcome the representatives from NBI and thank them for appearing before the committee.  For the purposes of full disclosure, I have met all of them previously through the other Oireachtas committee.  I was also on one of the field trips.  I found it was helpful to go and see the work being done.  It helped me develop a better understanding of what NBI is doing.  However, the job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to scrutinise the financial aspects of these deals.</p> <p>  How does NBI make a profit?  I ask Mr. Hendrick to keep an eye on the time because it is precious.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00400"><p>NBI&rsquo;s profit ultimately comes from the revenue we generate from the network -  the take-up of customers connecting to the network.  We are a wholesale operator.  We sell services to retail operators, which many consumers know in terms of their broadband, television or voice services.  It is the connection of those end users whether it is homes or businesses, including farms, and the revenue we generate from those retail operators that connect those homes, where we generate our revenue and ultimately our profit.  The profitability of the network is dependent on our operations costs versus the revenue we take in.  The objective of this subsidy is entirely about building the infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00500"><p>Is it correct that NBI and its shareholders are not making any profit from approximately &euro;2.6 billion in public money approved under EU state aid rules or is it part of the overall set-up of the organisation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00600"><p>It is entirely funded towards the build of the project; it is not about shareholder return.  The subsidy goes to specific categories, what we call permitted expenditure, which is all about the building of the network and the infrastructure that we are delivering in the national broadband plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00700"><p>Is Mr. Hendrick in a position to outline how much it costs NBI on average to install broadband in a home?  How many homes are in the intervention areas?  I think it is approximately 500,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00800"><p>When the contract became effective in January 2020, there were 537,000 premises.  Today there are 554,000 premises.  Even though the number of premises is going up, there is no additional subsidy allocated.  We are still required to deliver the project within that subsidy envelope.  On average, we estimate it is just over &euro;2,000 to pass a home.  Obviously, there is a subsidy associated.  That is just building the infrastructure putting the cable on the poles or under the ground to pass the home.  Then there is a cost in connecting homes.  The cost in connecting homes can be an average of &euro;2,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00900"><p>That is interesting.  I thank Mr. Hendrick.  A very good investigation was carried out into the NBI deal by <i>The Currency</i>.  I give the people there credit for the work they have done.  One of the issues they raised is that when this was originally proposed, approximately &euro;220 million was promised in equity to NBI by shareholders, which, I think, has turned into about &euro;100 million in debt.  Why were the original promises by investors not honoured?  Can Mr. Hendrick give the committee any details on that matter?</p></speech>

So, that is the contract.  However, between the company and the shareholders there is a commitment of &euro;223 million to support our working capital requirements.  In terms of equity and shareholder loans, from a corporate finance perspective, they are viewed as being one and the same.  That would be very typical of infrastructure projects, including State-funded infrastructure projects in terms of putting in money between equity and shareholder loans.</p></speech>

In December 2021, our shareholders invested an additional &euro;20 million and the expectation is that there will be additional funds drawn down in Q4 of 2022.</p></speech>

It is about the building of the network.  Up to the end of December, we had received &euro;177 million in subsidy.  We can only claim that subsidy on achievement of milestones.  When we achieve those milestones, that gets referenced against specific permitted expenditure.  The permitted expenditure needs to have been audited and verified.  All the invoices, largely to do with our build contractors' materials we are buying and infrastructure that we are building out, making ready or repairing, are assessed and verified by our own financial team.  Our internal auditors do an assessment of that, as do our external auditors.  Equally, the Department has its own advisers, EY, who assess all those invoices.  When all of that is done and all the verification on the permitted expenditure is done, when we have achieved a milestone, there is an independent certifier that certifies we have achieved the milestone and all the permitted expenditure is signed off and applicable to the subsidies we receive.  There is quite a diligent independent assurance process around all our subsidy receipts.</p></speech>

That is why I am asking the question.  It is interesting that we do not have an answer to it yet.  I will be interested to see the answer.</p> <p>  Originally, more than 600,000 homes were to be connected prior to the creation of the current entity, NBI.  There was an agreed reduction for that to happen.  I want to make sure that I have my figures correct.  The original target set down by Government was approximately 927,000 homes being installed.  NBI currently has a contract for 542,000 homes.  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

The definition of high-speed broadband then was anything above 30 Mbps.  Any premises with less than that speed was deemed to be in the intervention or amber area.  The overall number in that category was 900,000.  As the programme of procurement and bidding continued, the Department continually engaged with the industry concerning activity around the construction of commercial networks.  In 2016, Eir announced it was going to complete 300,000 premises, predominantly in townland areas, by replacing its old copper-based network with one based on fibre.  Ultimately, that network would deliver more than the 30 Mbps speed to those homes.  In the final consultation run by the Department in quarter 4 of 2019, the final assessment for the overall number of premises at that stage was 537,000.</p></speech>

Is that a concern for NBI?</p></speech>

We looked at this aspect of alternative technologies in 2018 and 2019.  We explored where the market for low-orbit satellite technology was going and that for 5G.  Considering the future-proofing of fibre technology, it was intended originally that we would have launched with 150 Mbps.  The benchmark in urban areas became 500 Mbps.  In this context, it is important to remember that the purpose of the NBP is to provide equality in broadband access across the country between urban and rural areas.  In urban areas, 500 Mbps is now the minimum benchmark product.  We moved our product to that standard.  The network we have built and are building supports speeds of up to 10 Gbps being delivered to homes, without replacing any equipment.  We can undertake a software upgrade to bring that speed up to 25 Gbps, which will involve replacing a small box in homes and that can be posted out.  The fibre technology itself, the capacity we are building into the fibre network and the way we are designing and engineering that network will support many hundreds of Gbps of capacity way into the future.  We have looked at this over a horizon beyond 25 years.</p></speech>

What impact has the pandemic had on NBI's roll-out of broadband?  How much has it slowed it down?  Has any analysis been done concerning set targets that have not been met during the last two years?  I am not trying to damage any of the work NBI is doing, but it would be interesting for us to get an idea of what type of a knock-on impact Covid-19 has had on the roll-out.</p></speech>

We talk about surveys happening on the ground in respect of testing poles and testing duct to ensure it is clear to install cable.  We were significantly behind in doing surveys, but we have now recovered in that area.  We have put more surveyors into the field and we are ahead now.  It is the same with designs, where we had a challenge in getting designers onto the programme.  We have now put more designers into the programme and we are now ahead there as well.  Equally, we are ahead with the connections.  We have more contractors trying to get more homes connected.</p> <p>  The building programme is, of course, the most significant part of the challenge.  We have more than 1,000 people actually building the network.  Concerning the issue of the impact of Covid-19 and close contacts, we have teams of between four and six people.  Therefore, if one person contracts Covid-19, that has a significant impact on the programme.  What we are doing to recover in that regard is that we are increasing the number of make-ready activities happening.  Eir has increased its volumes since October.  The intent is that it will double the capacity in respect of the number of poles it will replace annually.  Eir will also increase the amount of underground duct it is going to install from 1,500 km to 2,500 km annually.</p> <p>  Regarding the background, we had originally planned to deliver this project with two contractors.  We now have four contractors on the ground, and we are also looking to bring additional contractors on board to increase our activity and the volume of completions annually.  To give some context concerning where we stand today, in the first two months of this year we will be installing enough cable every month to get from here to Paris.  Those figures will increase as the number of contractors working on the project and the number of builds increase.  If it may be helpful, Mr. Malone can give more detail or answer further questions.</p></speech>

We must provide specific evidence of what those delays are.  Regarding the details in respect of surveys, design and engagement with contractors, our own auditors have been reviewing all the data we get back.  We verify what is a delay not of NBI's making.  We verify what is, in circumstances of relief, related to Covid-19, and then what delays are not related to a relief context.  In the case where relief applies, we get time extensions.  We do not get financial compensation.  Our imperative, therefore, is to increase the volume of activity to try to catch up on those delays.  We do not, however, get compensated in this regard.  Our milestones stay as they are, and we must deliver the network to achieve subsidies.</p></speech>

I would like to go through this detail.  It was well covered in a D&aacute;il debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on 27 January.  I am sure Mr. Hendrick has had sight of that.  In responding to my questions, it was interesting - and I am sure it is okay for me to quote the Official Record - that the Minister of State said that, &quot;There has been an impact from Covid-19&quot;.  The Minister of State acknowledged that context, but said it was &quot;not the entire story&quot;.  He continued by saying: &quot;Part of the problem is the contractor's fault.  Part of the delay comes simply from the natural things&quot;.  He went on to say, though:</p> <blockquote> 	I would expect that at least a portion of the delays are the fault of NBI.  It may believe it is the fault of its subcontractors and may try to attribute blame, but that does not excuse it because it is not in a position to abdicate its responsibility. </blockquote> <p>Mr. Hendrick has acknowledged that.  The Minister of State continued his response by saying NBI &quot;must take responsibility, even in a situation where it has delegated authority for some of its functions&quot;.  What does Mr. Hendrick think the Minister of State meant when he said that &quot;a portion of the delays are the fault of NBI&quot;?  Will he outline that to me?</p></speech>

The original plan was to allow for a mobilisation period.  Part of the reason the delay penalties would not start until 1 February 2022 was to allow for that mobilisation period.  It was intended to allow for lessons to be learned from activity on the ground, bearing in mind that much of this infrastructure has never been built in these areas before.  Infrastructure has not been built in some of these locations in more than 20 years.  Therefore, as we are building out the network, we are learning ways to do things more efficiently.  Ultimately, we must support anything we put forward as a delay with evidence.  We are going through that process with the Department now in respect of the 2022 programme.</p></speech>

I will give an example.</p><p>Across the country there are 1.4 million poles.  We have to test all of these poles to see which ones need to be replaced.  We make an assumption of how many poles need to be replaced based on evidence from the past.  Take Eir's 300k network.  When it was building the 300k network, it replaced faulty poles.  We made an assumption of what that percentage was through engagement with Eir.  As we start to roll out across more rural parts of the network, we start to see different percentages.  This means we have to reassess the volumes we put forward for the programme for the year ahead.  We can never understand what these issues are until we have gone down and tested the infrastructure on the ground.  We will never know how many blockages we have per kilometre in terms of putting cables into ducts without doing detailed surveys.</p></speech>

During this period of time, have we had delays in getting them to contractors?  Absolutely, because we would have expected to have had the surveys and designs done earlier in the project than we initially got them done.  In the earlier stage there were delays in getting stuff to Eir because we had not had the designs ready to give to it. There was then a knock-on effect with the contractors.  In the earlier stages we were behind in the surveys and the designs.</p></speech>

We have forward procured for the next three years all of the fibre and equipment required to build out the network.  Our suppliers are holding stock for six months in advance but we have secured our pricing for the next three years.  With our subcontractors we have continuous procurement activity.

This may be unfair so I will give Mr. Hendrick an opportunity to answer it.  That phrase sat aside, I read about the way in which some of the vehicles were put together quite quickly at the time the contract was being signed and in the period immediately prior to it.

The key thing for us on that is that we do not get stale and we are not too far ahead.</p><p>We are fine from the point of view of contractors.  In regard to construction on the ground, we break it into two parts.  There is what we call the passive construction, which is building the fibre, cleaning the manholes, the blockages and so forth.  We currently have four contractors employed on that part of the project and another contractor has just been added to the framework through the Department.  We have gone through the process with the Department.  It is quite a lengthy process.  That is done now and we are in the middle of a process of trying to add another three to the framework in order that as we ramp and build, we can add them into the mix as well.  </p></speech>

We directly employ about 300 people with NBI and there are direct contractors working on this, so it is roughly 1,200 at this stage and ramping up.  We see that probably topping out at around 1,800 to 2,000 contractors at our peak.</p></speech>

We are probably the third largest county behind Cork and Galway in terms of the need for high-speed broadband as more than 36,758 premises are covered in the NDP deployment plan.  People express frustration about how it is being rolled out around the deployment areas where a number of premises are caught between different timelines associated with it and that is causing huge frustration.  There may be premises across the road from one in a separate deployment area that has a date related to 2025 or 2026 whereas across the road the premises is ready to preorder and go live.  That is causing huge difficulty.  For us, as public representatives it is very difficult to explain that.  Is NBI doing anything to alleviate that type of concern?  It is causing a huge difficulty.</p></speech>

If you bring it back to how we have 554,000 premises to cover in 26 counties, we have now commenced construction in all 26 counties.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill said, we have broken it into 227 different deployment areas or local exchanges and each of those is done on how far light can go down the fibre-optic cable, that is the limit as to how far we can drive it, in that particular area.  We have build them around that design and demographic.  There always will be an end to one deployment area and a start to another.  The ideal for anybody, from a commercial point of view to go in and build a county, would be to go in and stay in that county, just complete that county as fast as possible and move on to the next one.  From that perspective there would not be the long wait but to be fair to the people of Ireland, we have to bring in the 26 counties at the same time.  In order to do this and to use the resource we have to spread it across the country.  I acknowledge it is frustrating for a person on one road to be available for connection now while it might be a year or two before the next one is.  We will come contiguously as soon as we possibly can.  It has to spread to 26 counties as otherwise some of the counties will be-----</p></speech>

I ask that in some instances, the design and the project team surrounding the surveys would look at townlands and deployment areas within townlands and try to minimise that level of confusion for some people who are not aware of it.</p></speech>

In regard to the importance of getting surveys and engineering designs complete in County Mayo.  Mr. Malone mentioned that Eir has now become part of the roll-out <i>per se</i>in terms of the use of its infrastructure.  Will Mr. Malone outline what agreements are in place and how that will support the national roll-out?</p></speech>

If you think about the existing infrastructure, there are 1.4 million poles.  When we started the project we assumed there would be about 22,500 poles per annum that we would need to repair or replace.</p></speech>

Most of the urban areas probably have infrastructure that already is fit for purposes.  However in the new areas we are going into, we have doubled Eir's capacity.  Over a space of nine months they are going from just over 22,000 poles to more than 44,000 poles per annum.  Even with that capacity, we have to spread it across all 26 counties.  If we wanted to go faster, if we want to get this ultimately done faster, there are a couple of things we need.  We need to have more poles replaced, which means more subcontractors which means more poling trucks, which is plant and machinery, to do all of the make-ready work first, before we ever come along to put the cable on the poles or under the ground.  The survey and design is obviously the prerequisite of that.  That is what we are feeding out to Eir in terms of the make-ready.  There is a capacity restraint in terms of the number of poling trucks and resources available to do all of that work.  To be fair, we have agreed with Eir, we have contracted with it to increase its capacity.  We are spreading that capacity across all 26 counties and are trying to do it on an equal basis.</p></speech>

The only way I can articulate my point is by giving a practical example and that is the village of Ballyhooly, in north County Cork.</p><p>Typical of every small village throughout the country, it is quite literally being split down the middle in that part of it is to be provided with broadband through the national broadband plan and the other part is to be provided for by the market.  In the case of Ballyhooly, there is a housing estate that quite literally is being split down the middle in this regard.  While we accept that the market is providing and that there is an entity called NBI, as public representatives who spend a lot of our time advocating on issues such as access to broadband, particularly in the current climate of remote working, we find it hard to understand why there is not a greater degree of interoperability or connectivity between NBI and the private operators to solve problems and ensure provision of services to people in villages.  It is extremely frustrating.  </p><p> Can Mr. Hendrick provide any reassurance to public representatives like me that people in Ballyhooly and every village like it throughout the country who want to get connected and have a right to be connected will be guaranteed access, that they will not be denied access in the times we live in?</p></speech>

For anybody who does not have access to 30 Mbps today that will be addressed under the national broadband plan.  While that commitment was made, probably, ahead of most other European member nations, Europe is following suit.  The intent is to deliver future-proofed infrastructure across Europe.  If somebody has 30 Mbps or between 30 Mbps and 100 Mbps, he or she is obviously on a commercial operator's network, whether Eir, SIRO or another provider.  I would expect - we are seeing this in terms of the announcements that are being made by commercial operators - that there will be a transition to future-proof networks, those being fibre.  Over the past six months, there have been a number of announcements by SIRO and Eir in terms of their continued roll-out of fibre networks.  The expectation is that by 2026, over 95% of homes will be connected on fibre-based networks.</p></speech>

When the national broadband plan was rolled out there was an expectation - Mr. Hendrick can tell me if it is not a legitimate expectation - that there would be a more timely intervention in those areas where there are serious gaps.  I refer again to Ballyhooly, because as far as I am concerned it is a ground zero for every village of a similar type.  There was an expectation that there would be a realisation of the commercial realities, but also a realisation of the corporate social responsibility of ensuring that where there were gaps, right down to micro-level, NBI would be the responsible partner in ensuring that where public representatives like me make representations through our broadband officers in the local authorities or directly to NBI, there would be an understanding of that dynamic and there would be moves to fast-track or, at least, recognise the fact that there are households wherein there are two parents working remotely and a post-primary or third level student who are quite literally taking turns using the broadband such is the lack of capability.</p> <p>  Mr. Hendrick speaks about an offering by NBI of minimum speeds of 100 Mbps, a 1G product and a new 2G product.  Is NBI guaranteeing those speeds or is it, as set out in the small print, "up to" those speeds.  There is a big difference between "up to 1G" and actually guaranteeing 1G.  The term "up to" could mean anything up to that level.  Those are the issues that we are trying to deal with here and that, as public representatives, we are trying to navigate.  We are quite literally reflecting back to NBI what we are hearing on the ground from countless numbers of citizens in the types of villages mentioned, who are deeply frustrated that there is no intervention that appears to be serving them.  </p> <p>  Mr. Hendrick is telling me about something that is going to happen in the future, the future is now as far as those people are concerned.  The pandemic has fast-tracked remote working and they want results now.  What can I tell the people of Ballyhooly arising from my engagement with the witnesses today that would give them some hope that there will be an intervention to meet their needs and they will get a service?</p></speech>

It is not an "up to" service.  ComReg has dealt with this in recent times.  It is applying penalties where operators say they are delivering a speed or an up to speed that they are not achieving.  Consumers are very frustrated that they are not achieving the speeds they are supposed to be getting and are paying for.  In our network, we are guaranteeing the service and we are testing all of the retail operators to ensure they are meeting those metrics.  There are consequences to them not achieving those metrics.  It is something that we absolutely stand over and have contractual obligations to deliver on with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></speech>

As I have only ten minutes and a number of questions to ask, I will try to keep my questions brief and I would appreciate brief replies.</p> <p>  The two big issues are the ability to deliver and the financial stability.  In his opening statement, Mr. Hendrick made the point that as the risk profile of the project evolves it is likely that some of the early-stage investors who helped to turn the NBI from an idea into a reality at a point when there was a lot of unquantifiable risk in the project will be replaced with investors who specialise in long-term investments.  The early-stage investors obviously were never in it for the long term.  Were they just named partners?  The build-out is not a particularly lengthy contract.  Have investors dropped out?  Is there concern about finance?  Is there stability in terms of finance?  If NBI is paying high interest rates on loans that tends to suggest this is high risk.  Have investors that NBI expected to remain with the project pulled out and, if so, who are they?</p></speech>

It is the opposite.  The risks now are quantifiable.  There is no question around technology and demand of high-speed broadband.  The measurable risks around construction are clear.  We are active in all 26 counties.  The opposite applies.  We are at a stage now-----</p></speech>

When we look at encroachment, we estimate a potential overbuild of 31,000 premises by Eir in the NBP area.  Ultimately, the overall number of premises in the NBP area has gone up.  There may be cost savings in terms of building out or not passing some of the homes, but we find that although commercial operators may have passed a home, it is a question of whether they can actually afford to connect it.  Are they asking the consumer to spend thousands of euro to get the connection from wherever-----</p></speech>

One covers what are effectively build assumptions.  Within the financial model we would have agreed with the Minister at the outset as part of the contract, there were assumptions made about the remediation of ducts, poles etc., as Mr. Hendrick mentioned.  To the extent that those assumptions are wrong, the contingency pot is eaten into.  However, to the extent there are savings against that, they get clawed back 100% by the Minister.  There are assumptions in respect of rates paid to Eir.  ComReg obviously sets the rates for Eir.  To the extent they change, the pot is eaten into up to the cap.  If it goes above that, NBI swallows the excess.  However, to the extent there are savings &mdash; ComReg has recently spoken about the potential to reduce some of the costs &mdash; 100% goes back to the Minister.  The third pot relates to connections.  As we connect up to 550,000-odd premises over the next 25 years, some will be in more easy to access areas and some will be in more difficult to access areas.  The average costs will vary from premises to premises.  Where there are more expensive connections, we can draw from the pot up to a certain cap.  Similarly, where costs are below the average, we will put money back into the pot.</p> <p>  On the previous point, the subsidy is capped at &euro;2.1 billion, plus the &euro;500 million contingency, and it is up to NBI to bear any costs on top of that.</p></speech>

There is a concept under the contract where we have to understand the impact of that encroachment.  We would have to say what the cost is to NBI, where we may have lost revenue or we may have to incur additional costs.  When one thinks about how we will be covering more than 90% of the land mass of Ireland, if we will be passing those premises anyway to reach the ones very far down the road that the commercial operator might not want to get to, there will probably be very little cost difference to us.  The incremental cost of passing that operator is very small.</p></speech>

Thereafter, we can make assumptions.  Obviously, the further out one goes, it is harder to make those assumptions.  The financial model that we agreed with the Minister includes assumed inflation within it, as well as a contingency for inflation and other assumptions.  The model is set up to include a number of different layers of contingency, whether it is &euro;500 million contingent pot, assumptions around inflation and also some buffer equity that we have included, as Mr. Hendrick mentioned.  Investors have guaranteed up to &euro;223 million of equity, which is above and beyond what we foresee having to draw down, but it is available.  We feel comfortable that there is lots of capacity to absorb any sort of bumps in the road, whether from Covid or inflation.</p></speech>

In many cases, we are connecting homes that other commercial operators may have said that they had infrastructure close by to connect to, but they are not connecting.  What we are finding is that these premises are not getting connected.  Therefore, we are not duplicating infrastructure and we are not looking to seek compensation against encroachment at this time.</p></speech>

We would intend to utilise most, if not all, of those poles.  Where there are gaps in the network, we will add additional poles.  We originally thought that there would be a 10% requirement for new poles, approximately.  As we are getting on the ground now and out there surveying, we do not think we will need as many new poles as initially envisaged.  It is too early to say exactly what the number will be.  Originally, we would have thought it would be a little over 100,000, but what we are seeing is a bit less than that.</p></speech>

I know some people have already touched on our existing system from Eir, and I would like to as well.  I am in Cork North-Central and we have a huge number of areas that will not receive an NBI service until 2026.  I have one area where the pole is physically on the person's property, but Eir is not allowed to connect because the property is in the amber area.  What engagement has there been with other operators where there are properties in very close proximity to the boundary?  For instance, in this case, they are connecting a house 200 yds down the road, but they are not connecting the house that is closer to the pole than the one down the road.  What engagement has there been with the other providers on this issue?</p></speech>

There are two reasons, potentially, that the provider is not making its service available.  One is the cost of the connection may be too high and the second is it might have capacity or connectivity issues in being able to serve those homes.</p></speech>

On cost, the property it has connected is at a far greater distance than the property on which the pole is situated.  In other words, the pole is situated at the entrance to the farmyard, but Eir will not connect the farmhouse.  Yet, it can run the cable 200 yd down the road to connect another house.  The argument consistently coming back to us from Eir is that because the property is in the amber area, it is not prepared to connect.  We have quite a number of cases like this, where we think a significant number of properties could be immediately connected, if there was engagement between NBI and the other suppliers.</p></speech>

That is one side of it in respect of what is happening around encroachment.  We are saying that commercial infrastructure is available to connect a home but the cost of connecting is too high.</p> <p>  Part of our obligation under this contract is to ensure future-proofing of the service and the network for 25 years and beyond.  Notwithstanding that we have that obligation, and we are building the network to meet that contractual obligation and the demand for the future, we are engaging.  We have a request for proposal, RFP, in the market at present, for which we have already received the first round of responses for a number of wholesale operators, where we could leverage their network and service.  What is critical is that they connect with the speeds deemed under the national broadband plan, with the service level agreements that go with it, and the future-proofing requirements we need to give certainty to these homes when they get connected.</p> <p>  It is something we have under way and are keeping the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications informed of.  We gave it an update two weeks ago and we said we would give our next updates at the end of March and the end of June.  It is something we are looking at and it does make sense, where it is available.  The whole premise of the NBP is to use infrastructure where it is available, but it does not take away from the fact we have to deliver the service, and the benchmarked minimum speeds, with service level agreements, SLAs, and future-proofing.   </p></speech>

As Mr. Malone described, the 154,000 premises we have under construction today are largely coming out from some of those central points.  On the number we will assess, our team is currently doing that through a process, with a number of operators, where we are sharing them, in other words, these are the premises, what technology the operators can serve and whether they can meet the future demands of high-speed broadband over the next 25 years-----</p></speech>

I expect it will be in multiple areas, again, testing what the product and service looks like, the distance from the central point to where the infrastructure is, the service level agreements and the future-proofing.  There are quite a number of parts.  We have to ensure, and this is certainly the focus for the network we are building, that this will be here for future generations.  We have to make sure the same applies, even if we look at alternative technologies or networks.</p></speech>

I will move on to another issue.  It relates to the workforce and the availability of people to carry out the work that needs to be carried out.  Is NBI facing challenges in that area at present, in view of the fact that the whole construction industry is going at full speed and many other areas are having difficulties in getting people for jobs that are available?  In looking at that over the next 12 months, has NBI set out the number of people that are required, in addition to setting out the number of people who are currently available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. T.J.

We are definitely acutely aware of the marketplace, where we are in the market at present and that the level of unemployment is dropping at all times.  We have gone out to all our contractors over the past six or eight months and looked at what availability of resources they would have in the event we want to up our production levels, number one and number two, if an accelerated programme was feasible for us down the road.  We have got that detail back.</p> <p>  In addition, to try to circumvent this and get ahead, which is no different than what we did in the procurement of materials, where we forward bought for three years and increased the stockholding at any one time, we have added another subcontractor in recent weeks and months to the panel we can choose from.  That particular contractor has strong links into European countries that are possibly coming off the back of some of these projects so there is more availability of labour.  We are looking at adding three more contractors to that panel at present.  Again, one of those also has international links.  We are constantly looking at that.  The existing contractors are telling us they will be able to ramp up to meet the demands but, in order to be sure of it, we are being prudent by adding additional contractors to the list.</p></speech>

Why does NBI now believe that these contractors can deliver within the time period?</p></speech>

It has been down to the operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  We just could not physically get out there or could not estimate what would hit us from that perspective.  From an actual manpower point of view, we believe the contractors have sufficient capacity on the ground.  We are also seeing that at present.</p> <p>  As Mr. Hendrick said, the level of fibre we are rolling out at present is enough to go from here to Paris on a monthly basis and that has been so for the past three months.  We stepped that up, as Eir has stepped up its area.  Part of it is the poling capacity.  If there is an area in poling capacity, that is probably our tightest pinch because that takes more time to ramp up as specialised machinery is involved that needs to be brought into the country and manufactured.  That is why, when we carried out an agreement with Eir on 1 October, it was based on an incremental step between 1 October this year to 1 January next year, in different phases, which gave Eir time to seek people and machinery.   </p></speech>

Eir is working through that itself.  It replaced the poles on our behalf as part of the Eir make-ready work.  The machinery for that is specialised and there are long delivery times for it.  It is either brought it in from abroad, if it is already there, or it is manufactured.</p></speech>

On 1 October, we agreed with Eir to increase our capacity to just more than double.  We had initially contracted with it for 22,500 poles per annum.  To catch up and get ahead of ourselves, we have contracted to double that capacity.  Although we are only just more than six months behind, we want to double it to give ourselves a chance to build contingency back into the programme.  We are virtually doubling the capacity that Eir originally committed to, from 22,000 or 24,000 poles per annum, to just shy of 50,000 poles.</p></speech>

I refer to the cost of providing the scheme.  Adding together the State subsidy and the private finance and dividing that by 540,000 or 550,000 gives a figure of approximately &euro;12,000.  Is that correct?  I am talking about the actual cost of the scheme.  In other words, the average cost for a premise in the orange intervention area to be connected, in the context of the overall scheme, is in the region of &euro;12,000 per premises.</p></speech>

We know this.  We have been over it for the past five or six years.  We now know there are two sums of money - one is the State or taxpayer subsidy of &euro;2.6 billion or &euro;2.7 billion and the other is private sector investment of approximately 9% or 10% of that figure.  What has NBI calculated is the cost per premises in terms of the overall cost of the scheme?  That is what will count.</p></speech>

To build the network and pass the homes, it is approximately &euro;2,000 to pass the homes.  To connect the homes, it is approximately &euro;1,000.  Those are the primary functions of the subsidy.  The third bucket where the subsidy comes in is the rental of infrastructure, namely, renting the poles and ducts of Eir's infrastructure.</p></speech>

Therefore, we want to remove them from the map.  We have removed premises from the map, but we go through a process of analysing, first, if they are guaranteed to get a service and if it is going to be a cost saving on the project by not building.  There are premises that we have removed from the map, but it is a small number.  We are not seeking encroachment compensation for those premises.</p></speech>

In response to a question earlier on the cost of the infrastructure, my understanding is that the Eir infrastructure is currently owned by French investors, if it has not been flipped again.  Mr. Hendrick knows that it has been flipped a number of times over the years since it was privatised in 1999.  NBI is renting poles and ducting from Eir.  How much per pole is being paid per annum?

It would be fair to say they were not in good shape.  A lot of poles had to be replaced.  Mr. Hendrick outlined the programme of what will be done per year.

The M0s are largely associated with a lot of the mobilisation activities, onboarding of retail operators, setting up the test lab, getting data centres, and getting all the infrastructure up and running in order to be able to start serving and engaging with the retail operators.  They are predominantly the M0 milestones.</p> <p>  The M1s then are the designs after we have done the surveys.  We must have done a complete survey of each deployment area.  We must also have designed it from a physical network perspective.  We must further have built in all of our assumptions around how many trees need to be trimmed, how many poles need to be replaced, and how many kilometres of underground duct needs to be installed.  Once the Department has audited that activity, it gives us an approval to proceed, ATP.  Effectively, we then issue that ATP to the independent certifier and, including on the M0 milestones, the independent certifier does an audit on all of our achievements to ensure that we have met the achievements.</p></speech>

We have a list of all the different deployment areas within that county, and the various stages from the survey to design to build commencement and build completion.  In the case of Mayo, by the end of next year, we will have around 80% of the survey completed.  We will be well on the way at that stage.  By the end of 2023, we will have 34% of the builds, all the premises, commenced.  By the end of 2024 we will have 52% commenced, and by the end of 2025 we will have about 77% of the builds commenced within the county.  For builds completed, by the end of 2025 we will have between 49% and 50% of the entire county completed and about 73% completed by the end of 2026 and the remainder will be done in the balance of that timeframe.</p></speech>

Over 25 years of the project, all of the other costs - the bid costs we spoke about, the advisory costs the Deputy asked about, all the operating costs, as well as the balance of the capital expenditure - have to be covered by NBI through either shareholder investment or through revenue generated to the extent that if there is not sufficient revenue generated, that risk stays with NBI.</p></speech>

He said that 12% is not unusual.  It is very high.  When this scheme was being devised, loans were being offered at interest rates of 0.25% and 0.5% by the European Investment Bank, EIB, and other sources, and here the State is tied into a contract where 12% interest is being paid out.  That is highly unusual.  It does not sit right with me for some reason.  It does not seem like a good way to be doing business.  I also notice that it is compound interest, which means that in a period of just under six years, that will double because there is an accumulator on it being compound interest.  That in itself would seem like an excessive sum.  I looked at some other infrastructure projects that were coming at 3.2% and 3.4% interest.  Here we are with 12% compound interest.  This has the potential to become a much larger sum.  Does Mr. Kelly not find that unusual?</p></speech>

If one thinks about paying one's mortgage at 2% or 3%, they are secured loans.  It is very important to differentiate between an unsecured shareholder loan and a secured bank loan.  If a person goes to the bank and gives security and he or she does not pay it back, the bank will enforce that security to get its money.  Here, we have shareholders who invested their money where there is no security.</p></speech>

I take it that is unsecured.  In reality, the State has ponied up for between &euro;2.6 billion and &euro;2.7 billion.  We know that.  I do not have time to go into it now but previous questions and commitments regarding milestones turned out to be very different in terms of penalties.  Assurances other Deputies and I got on the floor of the D&aacute;il got in 2018 and 2019 were about the risk.  Mr. Kelly mentioned the risk in response to a number of the Deputies.  He and Mr. Hendrick leaned on this a lot.  I would contend that where the State has put up funding in excess of &euro;2.6 billion, in reality there is very little risk.</p></speech>

Another remedial plan is coming.  Covid-19 was the reason given.  I understand, as will committee members, that that would cause some disruption in the real world.  Telecommunications is one of the areas that continued right throughout that period.  It was exempt.  That is the first thing I will say to Mr. Hendrick.  The next is that the third plan was 115,000 in year one.  Then its status was revised downwards to 60,000.  We await plan No. 3.</p><p>From what I have seen with regard to milestones, targets and penalties, I imagine the investors are very happy.  They must be rubbing their hands together.  Very few investors would be able to find a project as lucrative as this underwritten by a state whose finances are reasonably healthy.</p></speech>

I apologise for being delayed.  If I repeat some questions, I hope I will be forgiven because I did not hear them all.  I listened to the opening statements and a few things struck me.  To allude to something the Cathaoirleach was just saying, at the outset of this there was much criticism and much debate as to whether the State should get involved in this at all when the private sector was not.  That was clear.  There needed to be some sort of mechanism to roll out broadband, particularly for rural Ireland.  I will get to urban heartlands shortly.  If this had not been done, where would we be now in the absence of this framework?  I know it is hard to ponder that but, realistically, where would be if this was not in place?</p></speech>

To put this into context, the homes we are talking about today receive speeds of less than 30 Mbps.  People in urban areas of the country benefit from a benchmark product with a speed of 500 Mbps.  In 2016 or 2017, the gap was not significant.  We were talking about tens of megabits per second.  We are now talking about hundreds.  The demand for those hundreds of megabits per second is only increasing.  One of the benefits we have in our job is that we see the impact our work has on businesses, homes and schools every day.  That is what drives us every day to get out there and build this network.  We know this is more important now than it was two years ago.</p></speech>

Mr. Hendrick also referred to 1,200 people hired.  How many of those are direct employees of NBI?</p></speech>

I just wanted to get a rough total of the number working on it.  In his statement, Mr. Hendrick also mentioned NBI's co-operation and work with Eir and Enet.  I commend him on his work for the islands.  That is important.  We are talking about rural Ireland and you cannot get much more remote than the islands.  That work is essential because it will have benefits in terms of people returning to the islands and repopulating them and in sustaining communities.  That is very welcome.  However, there are also black spots in urban areas.  Colleagues from across the House will know of black spots in towns, villages and cities in the areas they represent.  There are several in my own area.  I am not seeing the sense of urgency Mr. Hendrick has spoken about with regard to connections in those area.  How are those issues going to be resolved?  It seems that dealing with issues in urban areas would be simpler given that the services are practically outside people's doors.  These providers, Eir, Enet and others, give commitments to connect these premises but it never happens.  We are talking about years, long before 2020.  People are losing faith.  Ultimately, that is the engine of the economy.  We need to ensure that there is good connectivity across cities and counties.  What is going to happen there?</p></speech>

With regard to specific urban areas in which we may not have infrastructure when passing or where connection will be quite expensive, we have to consider value for money.  As part of the request for proposals, RFP, we are running at the moment, a number of bidders have given us solutions.  We will engage with them over the coming months and will look at practical solutions, including the use of alternative networks, products and services to connect those homes.  It is really critical that we make sure that, once these premises are connected, there will not be another digital divide and that the service they get will meet demand for the next 25 years.  Working with those suppliers is critical.  We have a team dedicated to and focused on that work over the coming months.</p></speech>

How do we liaise with NBI to highlight those black spots?  As I have said, there are plenty of them.</p></speech>

As we are out surveying, we see the gaps between where we have contiguous network builds and where we have to go off on a certain route because there is a house isolated on its own, which is very expensive to do.  We have already identified the premises.  When end users go to our website and put in their Eircode postcode, they will get a date based on their deployment area.  In parallel, we are looking at one-off houses and buildings in urban areas that are just not contiguous in terms of build.  We will have to put them into a different programme.  They might get done earlier as a result of that programme.</p></speech>

That is probably the bigger issue.  As a representative of an urban area, the existence of black spots is a big issue.  I hope that NBI is aware of them all but, in case it is not, there needs to be a way for Members to feed in for various different reasons.  I am talking about the construction of new homes and certain streets that seem to have been bypassed for the high-speed fibre roll-out.  We need a way to inform NBI to ensure these are included in a work programme and that the works are ultimately done.  I am still not quite clear on the timelines.  I acknowledge that the timeline for each will be different because they are so sporadic but it is a matter of how they are going to be addressed and ensuring they are addressed.  Mr. Hendrick said these premises may be done earlier than the projected date.  I hope that is the case.</p></speech>

If they are in an urban area, we are looking at the most economical solution to connect them.</p><p>For homes that are being constructed at the moment or that do not have 30 Mbps when the commercial operator said they would, we will get the GeoDirectory update every quarter where new homes come onto the map.  Alternatively, they can write to NBI or the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  Deputies and Senators can come to NBI or the Department and we will assess with the Department whether those premises should be in the intervention area or not. </p></speech>

We have subcontracted with the same contractors who are doing the builds a maintenance and connection group.  We have the facilities and the people to support the network and we have to meet high SLAs in terms of the contract, equivalent to what one would expect to see in an urban-based telecoms network.</p></speech>

When we talk about the 30% of control, it includes the category of voting rights.  That is the mechanism through which Granahan McCourt controls NBI.  The other thing that is important to point out is that the contract has protections so if there is a change in David McCourt's voting or ownership interest, there is no <i>de minimis</i>threshold.  Any change would require ministerial consent.  It is separate from and in addition to the 30%.  Similarly, if there was any change in shareholding at the Metalla level - that is the holding company Mr. Hendrick described - that would require ministerial consent.  The 30% figure relates to the other shareholding interests.</p></speech>

That is the figure for premises constructed and built to walk off.  When our contractors are finished and walk off site for built connections, the target is 60,000.  We believe we will have 47,000 completed by the end of February.  We are nearly halfway through February so we are tidying those up and doing the final bits and pieces.  That would be 47,000 and the additional 13,000 will be finalised and under construction by the end of March.</p></speech>

It was just a matter of finalising and finishing the smaller pieces that were left to be done, albeit those small pieces stopped homes being categorised as being constructed or passed.  The end of February and March will involve finishing out those bits and pieces.  That is where a major jump will be seen, as is the case from the end of January to the end of February, which brought the target to 47,000.</p></speech>

We can do so because we get certainty at least 12 weeks in advance of when the construction will finish.  When Mr. Malone&rsquo;s team finishes on site and the 60,000 premises are constructed, we then have to inform industry, which is the retail operators and we give them a notification period where they can go and sell to consumers.  At that point they can give consumers exact dates on when we will install but the installations do not happen for anything between two and four weeks after that.  The definition under the contract is that is when they are contractually passed, even though the construction and all the work will have been done by the end of March.</p></speech>

In advance of completing the build we take pre-orders for the three months in advance of completion.  We have measured Cavan, Carrigaline and areas like that and we are seeing take-up of above 30% and growing.  There is a demand but equally there are consumers who may be in contract with an existing operator and so they may be coming to the end of a contract.  As we build across all Twenty-six Counties and as more retailers are actively selling, we are noticing that retailers are starting to migrate their customers onto our network, even if they are in contract, because they see the opportunity to get them on board with this fibre network.  To keep that customer for the long term they have to migrate them while they are already in a contract.</p></speech>

We would assume we will get to an overall take-up of approximately 85%.  Originally, when we looked at historical data cross Europe, and we were not comparing against fibre networks because at the time there was not a significant level of them being built, we assumed that it could be up to eight years after work was completed in a deployment area before that threshold of 85% take-up would be reached.  We are seeing that the demand for high-speed broadband is greater, that the capacity requirements are greater and that Eir is committed to switching off the copper network, notwithstanding other retailers in the market that have TV or mobile services that are driving their customers onto this network.  The achievement of 85% should happen significantly faster.  If I go by Eir&rsquo;s switch off of copper, Eir has committed that it wants to switch off that copper network within five years of NBI finishing in a deployment area.  That brings the period down from eight years to maybe five years after completing in a deployment area.</p></speech>

We said earlier that we will not fully know until we go out and complete all the surveys and designs.  It is only when we have the low-level designs completed for the entire amount that we will know.  With the high level we are seeing at the moment we would envisage somewhere between 90,000 km and 98,000 km in the construction of the network itself.  When the additional fibre that will be required to do the connections over the next 25 years is added in, we would say there will be somewhere around 140,000 km to 145,000 km.  It will only be over the next year to year and a half-----</p></speech>

We have a number of different working groups with the Department whereby it interrogates the information we are giving to them to make sure they have the assurances they require.</p></speech>

It is a broad target.  If delivery is on the lower end of that scale or if other targets need to be amended, are our guests satisfied that, whatever the circumstances, they will be in a position to convince the Department to recalibrate the milestones?</p></speech>

We must always demonstrate whether it is the result of something within our control or outside our control.  The important thing is that we do not get paid until we actually deliver the milestones so we still have to go through the test strategy with the independent certifier, demonstrate how the network has been delivered and confirm that we have all the financial evidence in place before we receive any of the subsidies.  The subsidies are only paid when we deliver.</p></speech>

The shareholders in NBI today are the same shareholders and partners David McCourt has had with Granahan McCourt in other entities, Enet being one.  They are not unknown entities.  It was not a rush to get out.  They have an investment cycle, which is typically anywhere between three and seven years.  Oak Hill is a typical private equity investment fund that has an investment cycle of three to seven years.  It wants to bring in the remaining long-term partner now because we are at a point where the technology and demand for high-speed broadband is clear and the construction is clear.</p></speech>

It seemed to me an obvious project with a State-backed contract for a major commercial opportunity.  It was underpinned, as the Chairman said, very strongly.  It did not have a high risk profile.  That is as may be.  That is a difference of opinion and that is okay; we are allowed to have that.</p></speech>

There was not a view on long-term future-proofing for 25 years.  What happened was that when we got through to the pre-qualification stage, when we had SIRO, Eir and what is NBI, all three bidders said fibre was the long-term future for the network.  I do not have this information; it is for the Department to say.  Where was that range?  Where were all three bidders?  A bid was not received from SIRO, which involved ESB and Vodafone.  My understanding was that the cost of the make-ready would have been significantly greater in terms of building the infrastructure and renting on the electricity infrastructure.  Obviously, Eir put in a bid along with ourselves and then decided to exit the process.  Again, it was down to risk and shareholder return.  That was the reason it decided not to go forward.</p></speech>

We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Ken Cleary, principal officer in the environment climate and communications Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask those who are attending remotely to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind people to have their mobile phones on silent or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, for the benefit of this afternoon's witnesses, I wish to explain the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references a witness may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation that they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything that they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse his privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that is not abused.  Therefore, if a witness&rsquo;s statement is essentially pharmacy to in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply.</p> <p>  Members are again reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government for the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or in official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  We are joined by Mr. Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, and I now call on him for his opening statement.</p></speech>

This represented just under 50% of the &euro;106.8 million that was available for spending under the subhead in 2020, the majority of which was earmarked for the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  A note to the account states that the underspend of &euro;53.6 million was due to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the original expected roll-out of the broadband plan.  Delays in the planned roll-out continued in 2021.  This was reflected in the annual target set for the cumulative number of premises able to avail of the broadband service.  As indicated in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2021, the target set initially was that 102,000 premises would be able to avail of service by December 2021.  This target was revised down during the year to a total of 60,000 premises.</p> <p>  As we heard this morning, the total number of premises within the implementation area passed by the end of 2021 was just over half of that level.  The target indicated in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2022 is to have a total of 130,000 premises able to avail of the broadband service by December of this year.  The 2020 outturn in relation to the broadband plan expenditure was &euro;51.4 million.  This included payments to the main contractor, amounting to &euro;42.5 million and payments for advisory services related to the contract, totalling &euro;8.9 million.  The projected total cost of payments to the main contractor, as at 31 December 2020, was &euro;2.764 billion of which an estimated &euro;2.72 billion was outstanding at the year end.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#Z00500"><p>I thank the Chair.  The national broadband plan is a transformational national project that is unparalleled and is unique in terms of its ambition, scale and complexity.  It will deliver high-speed and affordable broadband initially to 550,000 homes, schools and business premises in Ireland.  Over the 25 years of the contract, it is expected to serve over 600,000 premises.  In line with the Government commitment, this will ensure that 100% of premises in rural Ireland, including those in the hardest to reach places, will have a broadband service that is in line with the rest of country.  This will be done as part of a single programme over seven years, and it will be delivered within the budget of &euro;2.6 billion.</p> <p>  2020 was the first year of the NBP contract. It saw a significant level of mobilisation activity by National Broadband Ireland, including the recruitment of personnel, procurement of materials and contractors, installation of equipment and exchanges and building IT systems to support the network.  Surveys and designs were progressed to inform the build programme, resulting in the first homes being connected to the new fibre network in January 2021 in County Cork.  Over the course of 2021, the project continued to build momentum.  By the end of last month, almost 296,000 premises were surveyed, build works were under way in almost 120,000 premises and a further 34,500 premises were passed.  Some 54,500 premises could order or preorder a service, while 469 broadband connection points, BCPs, including 200 primary schools, have been connected by NBI to date, with many of the public BCPs now supporting remote working.</p> <p>  Well over 1,000 people, all of them in Irish companies, are employed in the project.  There have been delays to the roll-out programme compared to the targets set in the contract.  Like many other construction projects, the NBP has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The specific challenges for the project due to Covid and the mitigations put in place by NBI are set out in the briefing note that has been provided to the committee.</p> <p>  Reuse of the existing rural network, comprising about 1.5 million poles and 10,000 km of duct to lay the NBP fibre network is a condition of state aid and makes sense from a value-for-money and sustainability perspective.  While it was anticipated that elements of the rural network would need to be mediated or upgraded, the extent of the remediation required, particularly the underground network, is greater than was envisaged when the contract was signed.  Both Eir and NBI are addressing these issues, including the introduction by Eir at the end of last year of rapid response teams to support the timely remediation of network issues as they are identified.  Eir has also increased the volume of poles and ducts to be provided under the make-ready programme, which is a positive development.</p> <p>  Given the reliance on the Eir network, ongoing close collaboration between NBI and Eir is essential to the successful delivery of the project.  Additional resources have been brought into NBI and its subcontractors.  Local authority licensing issues have been substantially revolved, following intensive engagement between the Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, working with NBI.  The contract makes provision for dealing with delays to delivery of the network and provides for circumstances where subsidy will be permanently withheld where milestones have not been met.  Where there are unprecedented events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI can seek what is termed "relief" under the contract and additional time to meet contract milestones without facing deductions to their subsidy payments due from the Department.</p><p>In circumstances where such relief is permitted, no sanctions would apply.  In other circumstances, the contract provides that sanctioned provisions relating to delays in the delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of contract year 2, which is from 1 February this year.  Sanctions will be applied as appropriate and will be calculated and imposed in line with the contract.  This places a significant pressure and incentive on NBI to speed up the delivery of milestones missed.  Due to delays in rolling out the network, NBI as a commercial company is also losing out on critical revenues from customers it should have connected by now.</p><p> Regarding the ownership and financial structures of NBI, the ownership structure of NBI remains the device in the contract awarded by the Department.  The Minister has rights of consent under the contract in respect of changes in ownership or control and NBI must notify the Minister in advance of any such event arising.  There have been no notifications of changes to ownership or control to date.</p><p> The social, economic and environmental benefits of the national broadband plan cannot be overstated.  As each home, school and business is connected, the benefits of the plan will be experienced in the daily lives of people across the country.  Without the national broadband plan, the market would not deliver broadband to all citizens in all parts of the country.  My Department is fully seized of the transformational nature and benefits of the national broadband plan and we are fully committed to driving the project forward.  We are also fully seized of the scale of the investment the Government is making in this project and the necessity of ensuring value for money throughout.  Robust governance for a project of this nature, scale and cost is paramount.  There is a skilled and resourced multidisciplinary team in the Department implementing the protections and provisions drafting into the contract.  The national broadband plan is supplemented by external legal, financial and technical advisers on network build and service metrics, project costs, procurement of materials and subcontractors.  Corporate governance requirements are being overseen by the Department.  My Department is engaging with NBI to finalise its roll-out plan for 2022.  This plan will be completed by the end of March and relevant details can be provided to the committee at that stage.  I look forward to assisting committee members in any questions they may have.</p></speech>

It is good to see them again.  There are a few things I would like to cover.  We had a good discussion this morning with NBI and Deputies were able to ask questions about delivery.  We now know there is a small number of connections relative to the number of passings, which is less than it might have been.  We have heard about that.  How is the Department going to hedge bets on the delivery challenge?  There is a delivery challenge at the moment, some of which is understandably down to Covid-19.  Mr. Griffin said that in his statement but the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, went further in the D&aacute;il and acknowledged that some of the delay, in his view, is because of NBI.  NBI discussed that this morning as well with regard to difficulties bedding in and so on.  What is Mr. Griffin's understanding of the source of delay beyond Covid-19?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.629" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#AA00300"><p>I will not go back over the Covid-19 issues because they are well covered in the letter I provided the committee on 17 January.  I did not hear the session with NBI this morning but I understand that it covered that to a significant extent as well.  The Covid-19 impacts were very significant.  One of the challenges was that when the engineers went out to do the build on the ground they were seeing things that could not have been anticipated at the time that the contract was being put together, such as in the condition of the underground network.  That has led to the challenges in addressing the deficiencies as identified, engaging with Eir to have them remedied and ensuring proper governance arrangements for all that work to be pulled together.  As I said, good progress has been made with Eir in additional poles and duct being rehabilitated under the programme.  That is a positive.  It is important that both parties remain engaged to make sure that any wrinkles in the "make ready" programme are identified, escalated and addressed and that there is an appropriate governance and oversight mechanism in place to make sure that is as smooth as possible.  When building on an existing network with somewhere in the region of 99 km to 146 km of fibre cable, depending on whether you are talking about premises passed or premises connected, and 10,000 km to 15,000 km of duct to be reused, you will come across those difficulties.</p></speech>

I regard it as a double-edged balance and it would be useful to go through it in that way.  What is the source?  If the project was underestimated to that scale, to what is that attributable?  Is it because of the quality of the design?  Who oversaw that?  What is the source of that underestimation?</p></speech>

That is fine and that is built in.  In reality, you only get a sense when starting to do the work on the ground as to the extent of the difficulties or challenges within the network that have to be addressed.</p></speech>

Was there a difficulty with the design of the random sampling exercise?  I am curious about how far divergent it appears to be.  We are talking about real delays in the design, both the high-level design and, as we discussed this morning, the low-level design, that are at variance with the assessment that had been done.  I am asking what that is attributable to.  Why would someone do a random sampling exercise that was so at variance with the overall outcome?</p></speech>

It is a random sample.  The sample is sized and designed appropriately in accordance with what would have been best practice insofar as the design work was concerned.  When you go out on the ground and are installing, surveying, designing, you come across things that would not have been anticipated at that stage.</p></speech>

There is clearly the opportunity to change shareholders.  I note, in his statement, Mr. Griffin states that the Minister has the right of consent under the contract in respect of changes of ownership.  That is something we discussed with NBI this morning.  Are there circumstances in which the Department would not give consent?  Has the Department considered the scenario in which new investors may not be forthcoming?  They are two different questions but they are linked.</p></speech>

The Minister has a call over investors who may want to come in.  There would be determinations around whether they are a suitable investor.  There are various controls and mechanism that would be applied there.  I might ask Mr. Mulligan to deal with some of the specifics around that.</p></speech>

An unsuitable third party is broadly defined.  Obviously, somebody who might have been involved in criminality or something like that would not be a suitable third party.  The Minister would clearly veto any such change of ownership that involved those sort of parties.  The contract is around are they a suitable or unsuitable third party.</p></speech>

The current standard connection charge is &euro;100.  NBI will charge Vodafone, Eir, Regional Broadband or any of the 50 operators that are selling.  The retail operators, therefore, cannot charge the homeowner &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000 or &euro;4,000 to connect a home, which can happen in a commercial sector.  NBI is subvented to do that in rural Ireland.  That is why this is non-commercial.  In the majority of homes, it will cost a significant amount to put in underground ducting and new poles to a farm yard 300 yd from the road.  All that sort of thing is subsidised so that the consumer will get connection.</p></speech>

That is fine.  I thank Mr. Mulligan.</p> <p>  I have one final question.  Returning to the financial stability piece, the reason we are interested in it is because it is such a change in ownership and financial structure potentially.  From the Department's perspective, does it have any guarantee?  This is why I am asking about the implications of investors not coming in.  What happens if it does not work?  What happens if the company is not financially sustainable?  Where is the State in that then?</p></speech>

National Broadband Ireland, over 25 years, is expected to be profitable.  In the event that it is not profitable, like any contract or any public private partnership, PPP, the contract allows for the Minister to step in or to terminate.  There was also, back in the day, Carillion, for example, as the Deputy will remember, with the schools.  In the end, the State sometimes, in extraordinary circumstances, may have to step in.  We do not envisage that here, but in all commercial contracts the State has with third parties you make for these provisions - that there are termination events, step-in rates and all that sort of standard stuff.</p></speech>

That is where "step in" means.  Your first port of call is to try and sort it out without terminating it if the business seems to be going off track.  That is the first port of call, and then you can step out if the business recovers.  In the worst case scenario, if you have to terminate, in the event of a termination the Minister has the option to either take over the assets or the business or both, so it all comes back to the State.</p></speech>

I thank them for their work to date on a hugely important project.  Certainly, robust governance of a project of this scale is of huge importance.  We have seen in another project costs spiral and timelines being pushed out.  It is great to have the Department here to engage with the committee on this important matter.</p> <p>  My first question is in regards to the Department's key performance indicators that are contained within the contract and how these were monitored in 2020 and 2021.  Can Mr. Griffin indicate whether NBI has met all these key performance indicators?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#BB05200"><p>I will make a couple of points on that.  First of all, the Department sets out key performance indicators, KPIs.  There are KPIs around deployment, design, which was mentioned by Deputy Carroll MacNeill, premises passed, deployment areas completed, broadband connection points connected and connections made.</p><p>Getting into the operations phase, minimum download and upload speeds, wholesale products and prices, time to connect, operational response times, network outages and time to repair faults form a comprehensive suite of performance indicators.  They are monitored on an ongoing basis by the team in the Department.</p></speech>

Has NBI delivered on both build and survey to date?</p></speech>

We had expected that by the end of contract year two, by 1 February, that 60,000 premises would be passed under the interim remedial plan, as the Deputy will have seen in the documentation submitted.  Approximately 34,500 premises have been passed.  Pre-orders can be made at more than 50,000 premises.  When one looks at it in stark terms, there is a problem and we have not reached where we need to be.  There are reasons for that.</p></speech>

What course of action was originally agreed as per the contract?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.710" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#CC00500"><p>There are extensive governance arrangements in place.  Mr. Mulligan, Mr. Neary, Ms Leeson and other members of the team are constantly engaged with NBI.  There are generally no surprises with deviations in figures.  There are 17 groups in place that look at a whole range of things, meet weekly with NBI, and look at what issues have arisen and how blockers are being fixed.  NBI is obliged by the contract to formally notify us of delays.  There was constant engagement through 2020 and 2021.  The Deputy asked me about targets for premises surveyed.  This is an indicator for the potential for significant progress during 2022 and 2023.  By the end of quarter 1, 56% of premises in the State will have been surveyed and approximately 47% of the premises will have been designed.  Approximately 50% of the BCPs will be installed - that is 42% of schools and 95% of public points.</p></speech>

I understand the rationale for this is that it is expected that the first year or two of the contract is about mobilisation.  There is a focus on that.  At the end of contract year two, there is a delay to the milestone payment.  Once that milestone is hit, there is a recalculation to determine the extent of the payment allowable.  If it continues to be unmet for a period, one adjusts the net and says what the payment is.</p></speech>

We have paid what is deemed permitted expenditure under the contract.  It is not a case of NBI submitting a bill and the Department paying it.  There is substantial due diligence to make sure that an assessment is made of every item that it submits to us to determine whether that is permitted expenditure.</p></speech>

In 2021, we were more than &euro;50 million behind the projected spend on the project.  NBI has not made the milestone and, therefore, the subsidy has not been paid out.  Penalties will potentially arise this year and onwards if NBI does not recover on existing milestones and meet future ones.  That kicks in from this year onwards.  Other operational KPIs include BCPs around the country that may be out of service for a few hours when they should not be.  NBI suffers penalties for that and we have imposed penalties on it for those across the country in the past 12 months.  Some 6,500 premises are connected.  Thousands more should be connected.  NBI is losing revenue daily because it is delayed.  Those are the penalties.</p></speech>

We see that additional payments were made to NBI.  The Department's team is supplemented by external legal, financial and technical advisers.  To what extent is the Department reliant on additional experts to measure work carried out by NBI?  We previously talked about KPMG and EY.  More than &euro;42 million has been spent to date on external contractors.  Will Mr. Griffin explain why that is the case?  What will that spend look like over the next 25 years of the project?  Is that part of the &euro;2.7 billion for the original contract?</p></speech>

I will try to answer as comprehensively as I can.  When one looks at any major infrastructure project, whether roads, public transport or water, there is reliance on external contractors.  That is a given.  As the Accounting Officer responsible for a budget of &euro;2.6 billion, I need to make sure that we have a team in place to do serious due diligence on expenditure and the performance of the contractor, checking whether deployment milestones have been hit, premises have been passed and connections have been made.  It also needs to check that the claims for permitted expenditure and subsidy as set out in the contract are given the required level of oversight.  We have approximately 30 departmental staff.</p></speech>

Some &euro;9 million has been spent on technical advisory services from Analysys Mason and &euro;8 million has been spent on current legal advice.  Are these once-off payments or will this continue over the duration of the contract?</p></speech>

When it is averaged out, I would deem it to be the level of investment that we require to make sure that we have a fit for purpose contract and design, and that the complexity of this, which I have set out in my opening statement, was addressed as part of the procurement process.  Now that we are post-procurement, that due diligence is being applied.  If the Deputy is asking if we will spend to the same extent as we spent in the past, my priority is to ensure that we have controls in place in the Department-----</p></speech>

We have technical advisers, policy advisers, governance experts and legal experts.  We are building a team.  Over time, I expect more of the effort to fall back into the Department, with less reliance on external consultants.  It is important to say that the telecommunications sector is different from roads and water.</p><p>In the roads sector there is Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which has 293 staff.  Several thousand extra staff are involved in build, operations and asset renewals.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has a local authority system beneath it so it has a huge infrastructure supporting something similar to what we run out of the Department with 30 fantastic people on our team and 20 to 25-plus consultants.  We bring in the consultants to do particular things for us, so that is not necessarily a standing function within the Department.  There are particular pieces of work we call for - for example, legal advice from William Fry, commercial advice from EY and technical advice from Analysys Mason - to supplement the work done by the team.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#DD00200"><p>It is a nice segue that we are talking about the reliance on external advice.  If I understood Mr. Griffin correctly, he is talking about 25 consultants assigned to the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  I submitted a parliamentary question for written answer on 19 January of this year asking how much the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was spending on external consultancy services.  The figure I got back was &euro;14.3 million, of which &euro;10.1 million, approximately, was being spent on external services for this very project.</p> <p>  If I break that down further - and the reply is a matter of public record - Analysys Mason received &euro;3.9 million, EY business advisory services received &euro;5.3 million and William Fry legal advisory services received &euro;846,000.  That adds up to approximately &euro;10.1 million.  Is it possible to give a further breakdown of the spend between the three entities I have just mentioned?</p> <p>  The reason I ask the question is that I perceive that in latter years Government Departments have been hollowed out and there is an increased dependency on external advice.  None of us are against the idea of external advice.  It needs to be procured if and when a certain skill set or a specific project needs to be delivered.  That is understood.  However, &euro;10.1 million seems to me to be an extraordinary figure.</p> <p>  What were EY's business advisory services, for example?  The consultancy, the PQ reply states, is for financial and commercial advisory services, but it amounts to &euro;5.3 million, which is not an insignificant amount of money.  Is it possible to provide the committee with a further breakdown of that cost in terms of, to use the vernacular phrase, billable hours?  What is the Department getting for &euro;5.3 million?  What is it getting from Analysys Mason for &euro;3.9 million and what is it getting from William Fry for &euro;846,000 so far?  That is only for 2021.  It would be very useful if this committee had a further understanding of just how much money is being spent on consultancy services, not only for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - officials from that Department are here today - but for every Department of State, for that matter.</p></speech>

To follow on from the conversation with Deputy Dillon, we have been tasked with overseeing the successful delivery of a once-in-a-lifetime project that is hugely complex and that will cost the State a maximum subsidy of &euro;2.6 billion and then a bit for VAT.  It would be utterly irresponsible of me if I did not ensure we had the expertise of the brilliant people I have working with us in the Department and external consultants.</p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned Analysys Mason.  I will get Mr. Nearly and Mr. Mulligan to come in on this because they deal with the teams every day.  Analysys Mason has been with us for a while.  We went to tender and it came back to us.  It provides services in development of the contract, technical solutions, evaluation, support in respect of the State aid, reference officer evaluation, project cost, model, compliance and robustness evaluation, mapping and monitoring of the intervention area, input to State aid issues and a whole range of work being done now, because we are in the active build and deployment phase, on supporting the overseeing of that.</p> <p>  I hope, with the passage of time, that more of that work will come back into the Department because Mr. Mulligan has lots of experience in the telecoms sector, as does Mr. Neary.  Ms Leeson is our governance expert and Ms Carrigan is a chartered accountant.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in is project sponsor.  They have huge experience, but the reason Departments employ consultants is that, in the long run, there are occasions when they need to flex up and flex down in terms of the experience and capacity of a particular type needed in the organisation.  I would hope, as this project enters a more mature phase and as we move beyond deployment, that the need for the extent of external expertise we have in place at the moment would diminish.</p> <p>  I go back to the point I made to Deputy Dillon.  In the telecoms sector we do not have the core agency such as exists in the likes of Irish Water, housing agencies, the local government system or Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  That simply was not there and available to us so we had to build that team.  The risk for me, to be brutally honest with the Deputy, is that I would come before the Committee of Public Accounts and be accused of not having the right people in place to oversee a &euro;2.6 billion contract.</p></speech>

What I would like is a deeper understanding of the breakdown of these costs.  We need that for every single line Department that relies on external services and consultancy.  I am not sure we have a deep understanding of that.  Certainly, I speak for myself in that regard.  The question then, and Mr. Griffin can fold this all into the reply in two minutes, is do I take it from his reply that the Department will continue to require the services of external consultants for this?  If the answer to that is "Yes", which I think it is, for how long more will it require them?  It has spent &euro;10.1 million so far.  What does Mr. Griffin anticipate the future spend will be on external services for the lifetime of this project?</p></speech>

It is not the only overhead, obviously.  There will be responsibilities that will entail thereafter.  If the Deputy wants me to put a figure on it for the next 25 years, I absolutely cannot do that at this point in time.<br/><br/>The other thing we need to consider is how the system more broadly manages big projects like this.  One of the options for us is the <i>status quo</i>with a function in-house with less external support.  That builds on the work EY did for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

I think we all appreciate that there is a reliance on external services.  We have all acknowledged that.  I am merely asking at this juncture - I think Mr. Griffin was about to defer to his colleagues on the matter - about the breakdown of costs and to have sight of the breakdown of those costs.  If I could come away in the short time I have with some understanding of that and a commitment that the Department will write to the committee in that regard, I would be grateful for that.</p></speech>

We wrote to the committee on 17 January with a breakdown, but I will give the Deputy an update because that correspondence covered a particular period.  I will give the Deputy a detailed update and an update on what work is being done by the consultants now that we have moved into a build rather than a procurement phase.  I am happy to do that.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Neary want to come in?</p></speech>

In particular, we have advice from Analysys Mason on the oversight of the build.  We would have sourced from Analysys Mason people with over 30 years experience in building large-scale infrastructural projects in the telecoms space.  That is not replicable in the Civil Service.  We are reliant on those experts to scrutinise and oversee the plans from NBI.  For example, if it is looking to re-baseline its project plans and seek relief, we are reliant on those experts to give us advice and say that is an appropriate level of relief and the level of productivity it should be able to extract from the market, etc.  On the build, that is just one section of the technical advice.  Within that, we procure from Analysys Mason on-site inspections of quality of workmanship on the build works that have been completed.  We have carried out a number of site visits.  This involves relevant experts who would be able to inspect the quality of workmanship.  We have done this in areas that have been in part completed and fully completed so we can see how progress is being administered by NBI so we are not just reliant on reports.  We go out and have experts taking photographic evidence and interviewing people on site.  Those are the type of activities that Analysys Mason carries out for us on the build.</p> <p>  In tandem with that, we also have-----</p></speech>

As is the case with all contracts, there are a number of areas where there might be disputes or potential disputes where we try to avoid disputes.  Both parties get their legal advice on that so we defer to William Fry the odd time for advice where somebody might have a certain interpretation of a clause in a contract.  There may be complaints by other operators in the industry about what NBI is doing and they might come to us looking for information around the contract.  Judicial review proceedings from another operator are ongoing and this is something where we get legal advice.  We get state aid advice generally and commercial law advice where, again, there might be issues around a subsidy payment such as whether it should be this or that.  We get legal advice on those sort of things.</p></speech>

We were told this morning that some of the original investors' early stage investors who helped turn NBI from an idea into a reality at a point where there was a degree of unquantifiable risk in the project will be replaced with investors who specialise in long-term investments.  Most of us understood that the majority of these investors were in it for the long haul, but we can see some of the investors are using loans that are relatively short term at very high interest rates.  Who out of the people who formally invested in the project to begin with have dropped out?  Has a large investor dropped out?</p></speech>

Our understanding is that as the network moves into a build phase albeit that we have a concern about the number of premises passed and the relatively small number of premises connected, there is a stream of work going on in terms of service design and so on, which gives us that confidence regarding 2022 and future years.

It is there to be drawn upon if it is required.  NBI made it clear to us and, I believe, the committee that it has no intention at the moment of seeking that encroachment.  NBI also made it fairly clear that it think around 31,000 premises may be passed but we are not clear if they will actually get a connection so it is a bit difficult to say whether 31,000, 20,000 or 10,000 premises will get a fibre connection from a commercial operator.  That is the difficulty we have.  You would have to analyse every home to see whether it would actually get a connection from a commercial operator.  That is something we have not done but I think it has done it.</p></speech>

These premises are not in a block of 10,000 premises and 5,000 premises there.  They are in ones, twos and threes in urban and suburban areas.  It is not like an entire cohort of the intervention area can be removed.</p></speech>

Analysys Mason did a piece of work on metropolitan area networks.  There was a lack of transparency regarding the people who ultimately were on the retail end.

There was much controversy around this at the time about the lack of the tender being really tested by virtue of the fact that there was really only one tender in the end.  People entered into at the early stages but did not proceed to tender.</p> <p>  Looking at an academic paper by Gary Healy, Donal Palcic and Eoin Reeves, the &euro;5,500 that we are discussing to effectively pass each house and premises is, by a distance, more expensive and while we are not probably talking like with like, it is still costing substantially more than the experience in other European jurisdictions.  Has the Department looked at that issue in retrospect on the value-for-money side?</p></speech>

In the first instance, this project is fairly unique in that the State is providing for the connection costs.  We are not aware that in many other jurisdictions that this is being funded.  That is an important consideration.  By virtue of the fact that the State is funding this, it provides a far greater opportunity for people in rural Ireland who do not have this service to get access to it at a reasonable price.</p> <p>  My second point is that the figure of &euro;5,000 is the top-level cost.  The average figure would be well below that.</p></speech>

What is the 25-year cost of operating a hospital, taking into account any revenue?  When one is benchmarking to other countries, what is probably not taken into account is what those other countries modelled.  Did they model five years or 25 years?  Have they taken into account that connection cost and a fibre-to-home network that is going to be future-proofed for 40-years?  It is a very difficult number to benchmark.  Peter Hendrick said earlier that the average costs to pass a premises is approximately &euro;2,000 and the average cost to connect around &euro;3,000.  Those are the capital costs that we are funding over the lifetime of the project.  The revenue model over time will dictate how much the average costs will be and that will be the unknown as to what will happen over the 25 years.</p></speech>

I raised an issue this morning where Eir and other operators are providing services that are very close to the areas that are designated as amber.  They are then not prepared to go into the amber area because they are saying that they are being restricted and that there has been very little engagement with them in trying to deal with the boundary areas.  I represent Cork North-Central and I am coming across this problem where one house has a connection but houses within a very close proximity are not being connected, even though we are being advised by Eir that there is capacity but the company is not prepared to touch a house that is within an amber area.  We went through this this morning and I am not quite satisfied with the answer I am getting on this.  I believe a great number of houses could be connected.</p></speech>

They can certainly deliver services in the amber area and there is no prohibition on them from doing that.  It is a decision for any company as to whether they want to deliver or it is commercially viable for them to deliver services in the amber area, which I state as a point of clarification.  Without looking at the particular circumstances, I cannot speculate as to why these operators are not connecting those particular homes.</p></speech>

I have had a number of these incidents.  The standard reply that they are getting from the employees of Eir is to contact their local politician who will sort it out.  We are getting on directly to Eir, which is saying that this is in the amber area and it is not prepared to connect, even though it does have capacity.  Eir is saying that because the broadband scheme is costing over &euro;5,000 per house in real terms, it feels that it is not getting anything on its contribution to connect up properties that are technically in the amber area and are the responsibility of NBI.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the lack of engagement that is going on between the providers in dealing with properties on what is the boundary area.  I have an example of another estate, for instance, where over 120 houses have been connected to broadband and the houses that are only just across the road but which are not in the estate are all being refused a connection.  In fact, some of the new houses that are across the road are also being refused the connection by Eir, even though fewer than ten houses are involved.  The company will not engage or connect because these houses, which on the other side of the road from the estate, are in the amber area.</p></speech>

That is where Mr. Neary and his team do a significant, in-depth analysis of every housing estate, road and boreen in the country to establish whether something is commercial or not and this is done in consultation with the industry.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in that this is an issue and is one across every county and townland in Ireland.  The response from Eir, and not just Eir but from any commercial operator, is that there are instances where it is simply non-commercial for them to connect-----</p></speech>

That engagement has happened.  If it is amber that is because the industry told us that it was non-commercial and that they could not make money by connecting those promises.  That meant going that extra 100 or 200 yd.  In some instances, when we investigate these, it can be as simple as being 100 yd but we have to dig across a road.  To dig across a road-----</p></speech>

That would require engineers to look at every single case to see whether it is actually a capacity point back at the exchange or whether a new pole is required that would require a licence, will that pole get planning permission, has ducting to be put in, is a private way leave required etc.  There are many reasons that in the case of a customer who may look commercial to the ordinary person, the commercial operator may come back to us, as the operators have done, to say there are a number of reasons they cannot actually bring the fibre that extra 100 yd.  I have no doubt but that there are instances where it probably could happen.  As Mr. Neary said, if that is the case, then the commercial operator should connect them.</p></speech>

We are looking, for instance, at a case where the Deputy is being told that this is because it is in an amber area, notwithstanding the proximity of a commercial pole, fibre and all of the rest.</p><p>If that operator makes a commercial determination that it wants to do this, it can absolutely do that and there is nothing in how we decide the contract that would prevent it from doing it.</p></speech>

We have had meetings with not just Eir but also SIRO, Virgin Media and many other operators to ask them whether they can connect a given Eircode postcode.  In the vast majority of cases, the operator comes back with reasons it cannot and will not make the connection.  It is happening all the time.</p></speech>

We have connected 200 schools.  Because of Covid, many people now work from home.

All towns and villages have high-speed broadband, whether from Eir, SIRO, Virgin Media or whatever.  For towns and villages, therefore, the broadband connectivity is there and it is a matter of getting the right building.  That is where the local authority and the broadband officer, be it in Cork, Kerry, Limerick or wherever, come in.  They are there to facilitate local people.  If they identify a building that would be appropriate for a broadband or digital hub, they should talk to these people in the first instance, and then apply for grants through the local authority under the town and village renewal scheme-----</p></speech>

I am advised by Cork County Council that it has spent all the money it has received and it is not prepared to engage further in respect of providing additional hubs.  A large part of this area will not get broadband until 2026 and nothing is being done by the local authority or the Departments to try to fast-track some connectivity to the area.</p></speech>

In summary terms, there can be a withholding of the subsidy, and when the milestone is met, there is a recalculation of that milestone subsidy to see whether reductions should be made, having regard to any relief to which the contractor might be entitled under the contract.  There are also performance credits whereby, if certain operational requirements are not met, there can be a deduction or a withholding of subsidy.  The description of the remedial planning process will probably give a good understanding of exactly what we are doing in terms of due diligence on this.</p></speech>

It clearly was both last year and the year before, when Covid hit it hard, so it notified us of the delay.  It might say whether it is delayed by three months, six months or, in the current instance, about 12 months.  If Covid had not been a factor, a significant penalty would probably apply for missed milestones this year, but Covid has been pretty prevalent.  That has been a unique situation for all of us and the contract allows for that.</p> <p>  To return to why we have so many advisers, engineers and whatnot, we have to make a determination independently of NBI, given it will naturally push for the maximum relief possible under the contract in respect of Covid.  Our job is to scrutinise that, get the engineers on the patch and say whether it was NBI's or Covid's fault it was delayed.  It is a difficult determination to make because Covid impacts on everything, from top to bottom of a project, and wreaked havoc in the early parts of last year and this year.  We are turning over every rock to see whether there is a systemic problem within NBI that explains the delay.  If we determine the delay of, say, one, two or three months was down to NBI's project management because it got the plans wrong, we will apply penalties beginning in February this year for every milestone it misses.  In the case of any milestones that have been achieved up to now, no penalties have been applied because they did not apply for the first two years.</p> <p>  For the next-----</p></speech>

What is the milestone for the number of premises passed by the end of this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.811" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#GG02100"><p>There is a target number of premises passed for each milestone and the aggregate number for the end of the year has yet to be determined.  Earlier today, Mr. Malone from NBI indicated he expects between 100,000 and 130,000 premises to have been constructed.  "Constructed" is different from "passed", as we all understand.  A household being &ldquo;passed&rdquo; is what allows it to order a broadband service.  We do not yet have a number for that from NBI in respect of the end of the year.  We are still scrutinising that because our job is to challenge whether that is the best the operator can do.  We want it to go faster and do more, and my engineers are scrutinising whether that is a credible number and whether we can get the operator to go faster.  That is what we are going through at the moment and in March, we will have a number that, as Mr. Griffin said, we will share with the committee once we are satisfied it is the maximum number it can achieve by the end of the year given the conditions it is working under.</p> <p>  Within that, there are a number of milestones.  There are milestones for all the deployment areas in Louth and Cavan.  Every deployment area has a milestone attached to it.  That is why this year, there could be 15 or 20 milestones we are checking along the way to see whether the operator will achieve them.  There are 227 deployment areas.  That figure has to be multiplied by the number of milestones and there is also a milestone for designs.</p> <p>  For 25 years, including from day one, there are penalties for the key performance indicators, KPIs, that apply.  It is supposed to be a 24-7, 365 service, with some limited time for upgrades to systems and so on.</p><p>However, if NBI goes outside the contract, penalties will apply.  For example, the contract might allow for systems to be fixed between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m, and if it goes beyond that, we will penalise NBI because customers should not have any downtime on the service.  That is what is unique about the broadband network.  Unlike commercial operators-----</p></speech>

For clarity, although I would need to check the transcript, I think I was very clear that I was asking for the figures in respect of properties passed as opposed to properties constructed or any other figures.  The initial target for the end of this year was 180,000.  Today, we are being given potential figures of between 100,000 and 130,000, which seems like a huge variation that has not been fully explained.  My sense of it, which I think is shared by the people who are waiting anxiously to have broadband provision passing their properties, is that NBI appears to be quite confident that any recalculation of targets or milestones will be explainable and, in so far as it is explainable, NBI is satisfied the penalties will not apply.  Do the witnesses think that confidence is misplaced?</p></speech>

A figure was presented to the Department by NBI as part of the interim remedial plan, which was 60,000 by the end of January 2022.  Leaving aside what was provided for in the contract initially, we now know the figure was 34,454 at the end of January.  We are all over that like a rash in terms of the assessment as to whether that target stands up against the root cause analysis and whether there is an entitlement to relief by the contractor.  That is very much in play and there is a huge amount of due diligence being done.</p> <p>  Similarly, before we accept a figure from NBI for 2022, we will do a very detailed assessment ourselves to determine whether it is credible and realistic.  If we sign up both parties to an updated interim remedial plan for 2022 and if those figures are not achieved rolling forward, then penalties will apply against the targets.  From my perspective, there is a level of assurance when we look at the number of premises surveyed, the designs done and the premises at construction.  There is a degree of momentum now that gives us a greater level of assurance.  However, we will look at things very closely and do our own assessment on whatever figure NBI provides to us.  As we said to Deputy Catherine Murphy, we expect that work to be completed by the end of March and we will share it with the committee.</p></speech>

If there are properties that were included in the original NBI contract but which have subsequently been serviced by Eir or another provider, is it the case that NBI can either continue to service them, in which case it will be paid as per the original contract, or it can seek compensation for that?  Am I correct in my overview?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  We had an interesting opportunity to engage with representatives of NBI earlier today.  I have a question regarding the interaction between NBI and the Department.  An issue I raised with NBI was around the knock-on impacts of the Covid pandemic on the original roll-out plan.  Is the Department confident the roll-out will be on target towards the end of this year?</p> <p>  I also want to address the matter of construction inflation.  In every sector, we have seen enormous rises in the cost of construction,  including in respect of labour inputs.  I am aware a fixed agreement is in place regarding the costs for installation.  Does the Department have any concerns about renegotiating that agreement when it expires?  When will the agreement expire?</p></speech>

As of now, we absolutely are of the view the project will be delivered within that.  In fact, NBI is on record at the Oireachtas joint committee meeting last September saying there is no question but that it will be delivered within that time period.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Mulligan to come in on what we are seeing in the construction sector market, including the cost of labour and materials.  One of the mitigations NBI would say is quite effective is that it now has a broad panel of contractors to do work on the ground.  It has pre-procured a lot of the materials and has put in place certain steps to deal with the potential for construction inflation, which we are seeing in other sectors because of demand generally, supply constraints on international markets and so on.  As a general point, Mr. Mulligan might comment on whether we are aware of anything that is of significant concern in that regard at this point.</p></speech>

They have come below the target and saved money on those procurements, which, again, we oversaw.  They have come under budget on materials so far and have good stock for the next two or three years of fibre cable, brackets, poles and everything else.</p><p> On the labour market front, they have a framework with pretty much every major contractor in the State, be it KN Circet, Secto, Actavo, Gaeltec or TLI Group.  They have contracts with Vodafone, Enet and Eir.  They have a very broad scale of contractors up and down the country in every county.  There are currently 1,200 and there will be up to 1,800 by the end of next year and the year after working on the programme.</p><p> There will be pressure points in the market generally on construction.  NBI was, I suppose, ahead of the game to be able to secure contracts and it has secured five seven-year contracts with which it can go to market.  I share its confidence that it should not have a problem.</p></speech>

I am a rural Deputy and I grew up and live in a rural area.  We are living in an intervention area and as it stands, the contractors are working in my region.  A point must be made and I did so on the site visit.  When it comes to telecommunications and access to broadband, phone coverage can be a major problem.  Something I would like to see incorporated in some degree or fashion, now that we are well into the process of rolling out the NBP, is looking at this matter, particularly for those homes that may be waiting until the end of 2026 to be connected.  That is a huge amount of time, a potential four-year wait for people to receive broadband to their homes and getting that direct connection for which the State is paying a very significant amount through State aid.</p> <p>  That point must be made and the Department must take it under consideration.  It must decide if there is scope to work with NBI to try to deliver some degree of value for taxpayers who will not see the benefit of this intervention for up to and over four years.  Is that something that could be considered?  From discussions I have had with people with some degree of expertise in the area, it seems this issue could be solved for well under &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

Much work has been done over the past few years through the mobile phone and broadband task force.  One of the other areas for which our Department is responsible with ComReg is the release of spectrum.  Much work has been done over the past few years to release spectrum, particularly in the bands that are very useful for rural areas and where there is a topography requiring particular types of spectrum.</p></speech>

On the release of spectrum, throughout the pandemic the Minister has temporarily released spectrum to alleviate congestion on mobile phone systems, particularly in rural areas.  It has had a significant impact on the quality and performance of mobile networks outside urban areas.  That was an emergency measure brought in by the Minister to help the phone networks deal with the major uptake in services in rural areas during the pandemic.  The release of spectrum is clearly key to ensuring mobile phone services are delivered appropriately across the country.  The regulator is very much in tune with releasing the largest blocks of spectrum shortly-----</p></speech>

On the national broadband plan, with the roll-out of fixed broadband services to homes, it will enable Wi-Fi within a house and we expect this can be used by a mobile phone user for mobile phone calls.  The plan will dramatically increase the availability of indoor coverage for mobile phone users in rural areas.  It will be a benefit.</p></speech>

The point I am making, just to be crystal clear, is that many houses, taking in tens of thousands of residences in Ireland, will not get any direct broadband connection until 2026.  One might assume this is probably because they are in the most difficult to reach areas and the likelihood, as witnesses are well aware, is that those areas are probably the most problematic when it comes to phone reception as well because of topography challenges.</p> <p>  I have a good example from Germany, where the German Government negotiated the contract before the rolling out of 5G that all areas had to be covered with sufficient 3G services at the time.  It was quite a prudent move.  It is clearly a much larger country with a much denser population so there would not be the same overhead costs in doing that.  There have been other countries looking at the same process.  I am not being critical but I just want to bring the matter to the fore because it is important.  It is not something we often hear about but there are many people out there who are completely cut off.  This project is costing billions of euro, and it would be a very small aspect of it to look to accelerate this over the course of the next while.</p> <p>  I compliment the Department.  This has not been an easy process for it, and we all know and accept that.  I do not want to be overcritical.  I have been on-site to see the work NBI is doing.  It is an enormous task and I do not underestimate the challenges faced by everybody.  I appreciate everybody answering my questions.  Will Mr. Neary make himself available to have a quick discussion later on about some constituency matters?</p></speech>

Figures of approximately &euro;2,000 per connection have been indicated but there is a cost of servicing the overall project of &euro;2.6 billion in State aid and there is also &euro;270 million of investment.  Figures this morning indicate almost 30% take-up.  We might assume the take-up reaches 40%.  If all 540,000 premises and homes take it up, it would work out at &euro;5,000 per house or premises.  If 40% take it up, we are looking at almost &euro;12,000 per household connection.  The charge to the household or premises is &euro;100.  I understand there is deployment and mobilisation etc. to be done in the first year.  In the first year there was less than &euro;100,000 brought in.  Do the witnesses have concerns about that?  There is an overall cost to what we are doing.  I agree with subvention and I understand the process cannot be done commercially.  I support the idea of a national broadband plan but the cost of this at 40% take-up from homes passed is working out at almost &euro;12,000 per household.</p></speech>

The highest figure of which I have heard in that regard is &euro;270 million.  For the first seven months, that is, up to July 2020, there was no representative on the board.

One of the questions we have tried to tease out several times relates to the reason for going with this model when the contribution from the private investor is so small, at just over 9% of the contribution by the taxpayer, which accounts for in excess of 90%.  Why would the Department go with this?  We have learned that the investors are getting 12% compound interest, which, of course, can accumulate significantly, doubling in nearly six years, for example.  The only answer we have been given on the few occasions the matter has been raised is this issue of risk.  In the context of risk, I understand there are supposed to milestones and all that and there are three tiers of those.  This is a project underpinned by the State.  The State has ponied up the money.  It is there.  From the point of view of an investor, investing in this and getting 12% annual return compound interest on an investment underwritten by the State is a sure bet.  If you were a gambler looking at this, it has to be the best investment in town.  People try to play the stock market but this has to be one of the surest bets around.</p></speech>

We did look at a large number of models.  The Chairman is familiar with this from his time on the committee concerned with telecoms.  We looked at full State ownership, a joint venture, the concession type and the gap-funded model.  All of that was done pre-2016.  A Government decision was taken in 2016 that this was the best model that was available.  There were reasons for that, such as the significant reuse of existing private sector infrastructure.  The commercial sector will share the construction and demand risk, and there is significant such risk in the early stages of this project.  The commercial sector will drive economies of scale.  If a strong contract is put in place, which we have done, that will give the State the necessary protections and the State can claw back unused subsidy and share in any excess profits.  That was agreed by the Government in 2016.  We did a project reappraisal in 2018 when we were down to a single bidder.   All the documentation relating to that is in the public domain.  There is &euro;175 million that has been put in by the investors.  That money is at risk.  It does command a rate of return.  That would be expected in respect of any investment in a project of this nature.  We looked at the rates of return that were under consideration when the contract was being finalised.  We did benchmarks internationally, using KPMG, our contact in this regard, and the internal rate of return, IRR, and the interest rate referred to by the Chairman were absolutely typical for projects of this nature where there is significant demand-side risk and an uncertain market.  The Chairman referred to the level of uptake so far.  We are comfortable enough that we are heading in the right direction but there is significant demand uncertainty.  If this was such a sure bet, the uncertainty-----</p></speech>

The Secretary General continued:</p> <blockquote> 	Having expressed our concerns on a number of occasions at this stage in relation to the affordability and value for money of the proposed contract for the National Broadband Plan, I wish to re-emphasise one further time this Department's fundamental concerns in relation to the unprecedented risk that the State is being asked to bear in the event that the current NBP contract is recommended for approval by Government.<br /><br />Any decision to approve the current contract and commit funding of up to &euro;3 billion to this project over 25 years represents a major 'leap of faith' on the part of the Government ...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />we [the Department] do not believe this CBA justifies the use of scarce public funds ... </blockquote> <p>Was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform wrong in that regard?

First, concern around value for money does not only sit within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As the Accounting Officer under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, I am and must be concerned about value for money and the management of public moneys that flow through the Vote of my Department.  All those aspects were considered.</p> <p>  Second, the State could have sat back and decided not to invest in allocating funding to provide high-speed broadband to every premises in rural Ireland.  That was a choice.  We manage risk in the Department.  We have a risk management policy and a risk appetite statement, and we understand the boundaries within which we should operate.  The key aspect of this context is that it is not about avoiding risk, but about understanding the impact of risk on what we are trying to do and whether those risks are being managed.  In the context of all the work we have done and the protections we have built into the contract, we are satisfied that the risk is manageable.  </p></speech>

I refer to the benefits of this project as perceived in 2017 and 2018.  This project is, ultimately, all about these benefits.  We talk about the costs <i>ad nauseam</i>, but there are also huge benefits for every citizen, home and family from the rolling out of high-speed broadband.</p></speech>

Pre-pandemic, nobody thought that people would be working from home.  In its review, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was very conservative in that regard, and rightly so, and decided to not assume that anybody would be working from home or to include that aspect as part of the benefits to be derived from this project.  After the last two years, however, we all now know that everybody is working from home and many people will continue to be hybrid workers in future.  I refer to the benefits of this development in respect of reduced travel and lower carbon emissions, and all those aspects.  When we look at them now with the benefit of hindsight, they are far greater than were ever envisaged.</p></speech>

The improved wireless signal and improved broadband means that many people who could not work from home a few years ago can do so now.  This is the case even before the NBP is rolled out to their areas.  They have worked from home quite successfully.</p></speech>

We are the people who run constituency offices.  We understand full well the significance of the NBP.  We also understand the deficit which exists in respect of the provision of the broadband service.  I think that is self-evident, and I do not think we need to be reminded of it.  I am, however, concerned about the standard of replies that my office receives when contact is made via the dedicated email address for representations to NBI.  I would like to see a greater degree of transparency regarding the number of representations made through that email channel and how many of those representations from the offices of Deputies and Senators are actually resolved.  I refer to a broadband connection ultimately being made.</p> <p>  Whether we like it or not, and whatever about the commercial considerations and the costs, the fact remains that an expectation was created that a service would be rolled out.  The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased or fast-tracked that expectation.  I think we would all agree on that point.  Therefore, a demand and an expectation exist for these services, which I think is a legitimate one.  I refer to people in particular circumstances of which we are all aware, whether down dale or up glen, where there is an expectation of being able to work remotely.  Sometimes there is a perception that people in rural Ireland have particular types of jobs and fulfil particular types of functions.</p><p>I want to remind everyone that the people in rural Ireland are the people with PhDs, MBAs, masters, and they are working remotely across pharma and academia, and that needs to be understood.  They need the access; that is the bottom line.  They are professional people living in these communities and they have a legitimate expectation.  If there is one thing arising from today it is that the quality of engagement with Oireachtas Members should improve such that we can expect legitimately that, when we make representations on behalf of these very people whom I am talking about and there is some sort of priority give to that.  Very often we are the door of last resort for these people because they have tried every other option, given they are more than capable of engaging with the commercial providers themselves and they have done so, but they are coming to us because they have no other place to go.  They have a legitimate expectation of us that we would interface with representatives at <i>nbi.ie </i>and they would then expect, and we would expect, that we would receive some sort of a return, and a deliverable.  The deliverable in this case is a connection ultimately. <br/><br/>That is why I was concerned by the amber map from day one. I do not profess to be an expert in; I am a layman in all of this, not a financial wizard.  I have no technical knowledge in respect of networks or telephony, but I do know what the needs of my constituents are.  I do not see how, in this day and age, there is not some blend of service that could be provided that is a solution for each household.  I do not think there is anything that is insurmountable by way of a solution for every household given the paradigm shift that has taken place.  That is where people like are coming from, quite simply.  We need to get information back to this committee in respect of how many representations have been received by Oireachtas Members and how many of those have been resolved whereby a connection is made.  We need some qualitative and quantitative analysis of those representations in terms of whether they are succeeding through our interventions.<br/><br/>My second point relates to the BCPs.  How many BCPs are up and running and live as we speak?</p></speech>

If not we will take it up with NBI to make sure it is responding in a timely fashion to the concerns raised by Deputies.</p></speech>

I would like Mr. Griffin to go away from this meeting understanding that there is a little village in north County Cork called Ballyhooly, and I deliberately use the example of Ballyhooly because he will remember that name.  There is a new estate in Ballyhooly called Lios Ard, peopled by the professionals I am talking about from all walks of life, and one half of the village can get broadband and the half other cannot.  This is why I am frustrated by this amber mapping.  We all bought into it and now it seems that this amber map has become such an arbitrary tool that we are going to end up with a situation where there will be those people who will have and those who will not all because of a mapping exercise, ultimately.  I do not know what can be done about that.  The question is: what can I tell the people in Lios Ard, Ballyhooly, tomorrow morning?  They are representative of thousands of people throughout this State.  What hope can I give them tomorrow morning that they are going to be guaranteed a connection?  That is the bottom line.  That is ultimately what people want to hear.</p></speech>

There is a number of commercial providers in that area today, and one in particular.  If there are circumstances where the map information we have is incorrect, we will look at that and engage with that operator.  We are happy to do that for the Deputy.</p></speech>

Is there anything within the work those consultants are doing that could be done by augmenting the Department?  If so, has an application for resources been made?  I know this is very different from TII and I accept all that it deals with much larger construction projects.  Will Mr. Griffin give us an idea of what the oversight cost is, in regard to the staffing side within the Department?  Is that different from what was anticipated?  Is there a risk register for missed milestones or issues that were not anticipated?  If so, what kind of issues are identified on that register?  Are there any concerns that aspects of this contract cannot be fulfilled?</p> <p>  Finally, I refer to the ownership.  I asked this of NBI representatives earlier.  I am struggling to get a clear picture of who actually owns National Broadband Ireland.  The contract itself states it is determined by voting rights.  That in itself is determined by who holds the investment or who is entitled to the necessary percentage of dividends, but the threshold is 30%.  Oak Hill owns approximately 49% and NBI owns 51%.  Who is the actual owner of NBI?  I am not at all clear about who owns it.  The issue is further confused by the investors coming in and out but let us leave that aside.  I would like to get clarity as to the beneficial owner.</p></speech>

We have sanction to increase the staff number in the NBP team over the course of this year.  For example, on Mr. Neary's side as the chief technology officer, we are putting in place two senior people at a level below him who will have the capacity to absorb some of the work that perhaps has been undertaken by Analysys Mason.  We have assigned an additional principal officer to the area as well.  We are actually looking at that on an ongoing basis to make sure that we are making best use of the money available to us.</p> <p>   With regard to the risk register, there were risks identified in the project right from the very start and worked through as part of the competitive dialogue process identified when the contract was being submitted to Government for consideration.  Risks are actively managed on a daily basis on the project.  I spoke earlier about the various groups that are in place in terms of governance and the contract liaison board that Mr. Mulligan leads on between the Department and NBI where risk issues, dependencies and, all of that are teased out on a regular basis.  There is an active risk register within the Department that is being worked through.  The usual stuff is impact probability and stuff being moved off and addressed or being elevated as a risk consideration where that risk is more evident at a particular point in time.</p></speech>

On the piece around ownership, I refer to the point I made at the outset that the Minister signed a contract with NBII DAC, 100% owned by Metallah Limited, 100% owned by Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited, of which 50.9% is owned by Granahan McCourt Fund Limited and 49.1% by Tel.IE Broadband Sari, which is the Oak Hill piece.  I am not sure what exactly the Deputy is looking for or how many levels she would like to go up.  There are other investors.

That is within the &euro;2.1 billion in the first instance.  In all contracts, one assumes some level of inflation over 25 years.  The &euro;500 million contingency has catered for unanticipated events such as added inflation.  The &euro;2.6 billion is capped.  On the risk to the consortium and the investors, if there is hyperinflation for longer than we think, the consortium is at risk for that and would have to put in more funding to make up any shortfalls over and above the &euro;175 million.</p></speech>

The level of subsidy we paid out over the past couple of years, at &euro;177 million, would have been absorbed by the design and the build of the network, mobilisation costs, payment of contracts, payment for materials, managed service payments, which would have tied in Enet who provide a service to the NBI, purchase of stock and purchase of equipment.

There are controls and protections in place in the contract to manage all of that.</p></speech>

There is close collaboration, which is essential given that we are relying on the network to deliver.   The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in and I met the chair and CEO of both companies.  We will do that again very shortly.

I am pleased to be accompanied today by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, who has responsibility, as the Chairman outlined, for special education, and by officials from my Department.</p> <p>  I will begin with a brief overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2022.  These Estimates set out the approved allocations for the Department that include funding for all of the services normally provided or supported by it.  An allocation is included to meet ongoing costs associated with the safe operation of our schools in a Covid-related environment.  A significant capital allocation is also included. </p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 26 provides for a net allocation of &euro;8.964 billion representing a gross allocation of &euro;9.283 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of some &euro;0.32 billion, which is an increase of some &euro;322 million on the original 2021 gross expenditure allocations.  This includes &euro;138 million of financial supports for Covid-related measures.  Other such funding will be made available from the Government&rsquo;s central Covid contingency reserve as required during the year, based on the latest public health advice available.  Excluding the Covid-related funding, this represents almost half a billion of an increase in 2022 for permanent expenditure measures. </p> <p>  As the committee members will recall, a significant proportion of the funding allocated to Vote 26 will be expended on gross pay and pensions with sums amounting to over &euro;7 billion included in the Vote for these purposes.  This represents some 80% of the expenditure allocation.  Some 96,700 public servants and 44,500 public service pensioners are paid out of these funds.  Other significant expenditure areas include capital infrastructure, school transport, capitation grants to schools and grants to other organisations and agencies. </p> <p>  In budget 2022, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I secured a significant allocation for primary, post-primary and special needs education, including important measures such as securing funding for the recruitment of almost 3,200 new teachers and special needs assistants - the largest ever expansion of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity In Schools, DEIS, programme to tackle disadvantage and achieving the historically low 24:1 staffing schedule at primary level. </p> <p>  An additional allocation of &euro;18 million was secured for the DEIS programme which will equate to a full year allocation of &euro;32 million.  This will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools and result in an increase of over 20% in funding for the programme.  Continuing to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government, funding will be provided for an additional 350 teachers, which is inclusive of the DEIS staffing improvement, to reduce school staffing schedules by one point for all primary schools.</p><p>Continuing to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government, funding will be provided for an additional 350 teachers, which is inclusive of the DEIS staffing improvement, to reduce school staffing schedules by one point for all primary schools.  This Government is continuing to invest in special education.  In 2022, over &euro;2 billion in funding will be provided, representing more than a quarter of the Department&rsquo;s entire current expenditure budget.  Almost 1,200 additional special needs assistant, SNA, posts will be allocated, bringing the total number of SNAs in our schools to over 19,000 in 2022.  This will support the roll-out of the new school inclusion model and will ensure that students with additional needs get the right supports at the right time, as well as supporting the new special class places.  An additional 980 special education teacher posts will be provided.  These will cover both mainstream classes in new and expanding schools and the opening of new special classes.  These investment measures under budget 2022 will be hugely important in tackling disadvantage and supporting children and young people with special educational needs in our education system.  The budget also included a number of other initiatives including once-off funding of &euro;20 million to be provided for books, audio books and other reading materials to increase the literacy tools and supports available to children in our schools.  Additional capitation funding was allocated to voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, to rectify historical inconsistencies in capitation funding at post-primary level.  Additional guidance teacher supports and release days for school leaders will be maintained, while &euro;30 million has been allocated to increase investment in the school transport scheme. </p><p> Significant funding has been provided to schools since 2020 to help them address the challenges posed by Covid-19.  This funding sustained school reopenings by providing for the replacement of teachers and non-teaching staff unable to attend for work due to Covid-19, additional release days for principals and deputy principals at primary level, and enhanced cleaning regimes, PPE equipment and well-being supports.  These Revised Estimates continue those supports into 2022 with some &euro;138 million being allocated.  As before, it is available to meet substitution and supervision costs, cleaning costs, sanitiser and PPE.  I am acutely conscious of the impact that Covid-19 has had on our most vulnerable students.  Late last year we announced details of the Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, programme, which is providing additional supports and teaching to those most negatively impacted throughout the pandemic.  This programme commenced last October and will continue into 2022. </p><p> I will conclude with reference to the Department&rsquo;s ongoing capital investment programme.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025.  This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans to deliver high-quality building projects, with a focus on sustainability for school communities across Ireland.  Capital planning and budgeting is undertaken on a multi-annual basis.  The allocation of &euro;792 million for 2022 will facilitate a continued strong roll-out of school building projects and other measures including the &euro;20 million capital grant for literacy resources to be paid to schools this year, along with funding of &euro;65 million for the approval of 497 projects under the 2022 summer works scheme to improve and upgrade existing school buildings.  </p><p> This is just a flavour of the issues that are reflected in these Estimates and I hope I have been of assistance to the committee.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are happy to address any queries members may have.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.972" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#B00300"><p>I will ask these questions together and try to be as efficient as I can.  I am not sure which subhead this would fall into, possibly A10, but possibly A4 as well.  I will start with leaving certificate students.  As the Minister knows, I disagree with the decision she took regarding the approach and many students were disappointed.  My question is focused on budgetary matters.  Students have regularly raised the anxiety, pressure, concerns and uncertainty that have been there.  Will the Department consider a package for increased guidance counsellor support and in particular, a helpline for leaving certificate students, between now and the end of the school year?  My second question relates to Covid-19 funding.  While it is positive that as a society, Covid-19 perhaps poses less of a threat than it has in the past, we cannot pretend that it is not still a huge challenge to schools.  Just today I was speaking to a teacher who advised that out of a staff of 40, there were 12 teachers out, as well as three SNAs, a principal and a vice-principal.  Schools are still under savage pressure.  We still need to tackle issues around filtration and long-term ventilation.  It is remarkable in that context that there is no Covid-19 capital funding this year.  Will the Minister ensure that the Covid-19 funding will continue into 2023?  In particular, will she ensure that the helpline for school leaders is continued and indeed enhanced?</p> <p>  The Minister also announced things in the budget that I was very much in agreement with and supportive of, as well as some areas where I thought there was a shortfall.  One that I welcomed was the  investment in DEIS of &euro;18 million, bringing the full year allocation to &euro;32 million.  This was something that I, and others, welcomed.  I have raised with the Ministers that several schools throughout the State, including in my own constituency, the Togher schools and St. Maries of the Isle.  Schools are now at the stage where workforce planning needs to happen.  They need to know soon.  What is the timescale for the roll-out of DEIS?  How many schools are going to benefit?  Will the Minister tell us that?  She will also know that I am keen to inform the criteria to be constructive and if possible I would be grateful for an opportunity to meet with the officials.</p> <p>  My final question is under subheads A8 and A10.  School secretaries have been fighting for fairness and equal pay for years.  They are vital to keeping our schools going, particularly during Covid-19.  In October 2020 the T&aacute;naiste committed to the regularising of employment terms and conditions and pension rights of school secretaries.  However, they have been kept in limbo.  Progress is really slow.  They feel let down.  They feel the Department is not listening.  It is very wrong that school secretaries are expected to sign on when school buildings are closed.  It puts them in an insecure position during school holidays.  </p> <p>  The Minister will say the matter is before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, but will she tell me whether it is her policy that secretaries should sign on during the summer?  That is what Department officials are arguing.  That is their position at this moment in time.  I do not agree with that and I hope the Minister does not either.  </p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that there were requests, for example, in regard to grade inflation and I have given a strong commitment in terms of the class of 2022 competing with the class of 2021.  It will be kept at the same level in terms of additional accommodations or adjustments being made to papers, which was a very clear request and I have ensured that this is happening.  Students have received that commitment very positively.  As for the accredited grades aspect, I was very clear that we went through every possible permutation of it and we are not in a position to provide it this year similar to providing it last year, as one student in four does not have the necessary data.  To be fair, there was enormous engagement from everybody around the table including from the students themselves.  The students and their leadership have acknowledged the difficulties in regard to that.</p> <p>  In regard to guidance counsellors, I am very pleased to say that I am very appreciative of the value and the importance of the work carried out by the guidance counsellors.  I am very pleased to say that in the budget, we made provision that there would be more than 100 additional guidance counsellor posts provided for.  That is something I am hugely committed to going forward. </p> <p>  As for the Covid-19 measures in our schools to which the Deputy referred, more than &euro;860 million in Covid-19 measures has been provided for our schools over the period of Covid-19 and in this year, &euro;138 million for 2022 has been put in place.  Again I will be very clear, similar to last year we had a provision in the budget and then, as always, there is the Covid-19 contingency fund.  This year again that Covid-19 contingency fund is available to us.  Subject to public health advice, which we have always followed in our schools, if there is an additional requirement for measures in our schools at any point, they will be put in place.  I am very pleased to say that we continue all of the infection prevention and control measures in our schools at this point, despite the fact that in many other sectors of society they have moved on.  We keep them in place and it is subject to review by 28 February 2022. </p> <p>  In regard to DEIS, I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing interest in DEIS.  There is great interest in the enhancement of the DEIS programme.  Since becoming Minister, I have been extremely supportive of the DEIS programme.  I know the value of it and the benefit it will be to schools when we are in a position to include as many as we possibly can in it.  We have, as the Deputy is aware, a budget of &euro;18 million this year, growing to &euro;32 million next year.  This is a substantial budget which will allow us to maximise the number of schools that for the first time will be included in the DEIS programme.  We are currently finalising the model.  It is my intention that everything will be in place and sufficient advance notice will be given to schools in order that it will be fully implemented by September 2022, the new school year.</p><p> I wish to be very clear on school secretaries and caretakers.  That matter is before the WRC.  The Deputy will appreciate that significant progress has been made via the WRC.  Very many people at this meeting, me included, have personal experience of the value and the importance placed on the work of school secretaries and caretakers.  The Deputy will be aware that we have now offered to move school secretaries onto a scale aligned with clerical officer grade III-----</p></speech>

I asked that question of the number of DEIS schools.  Perhaps we could get a general idea of how many schools will benefit.  Again, it is not acceptable that the Department's negotiating position is that secretaries should have to sign on.  That is the position, that is a fact and that should not be the way.  I ask the Minister to instruct her officials not to adopt that position but, rather, to ensure that secretaries get paid over the summer.</p></speech>

We have made significant progress.  I will allow the process via the WRC to continue such that all the issues that are brought to the table will be satisfactorily addressed for the benefit of everybody around the table.  I have shown commitment to that.  Up to this point we have made significant progress, and I am very confident we can make even more progress.</p></speech>

My contribution will be on the same themes.  We are anxious that an assessment be ongoing within the Department of the damage that has been done to the educational experience of children and young people.  Covid is still having a massive effect and influence on children's and young people's day-to-day educational experience.  I would not want the Department to assume that the catch-up fund that has been introduced will be enough.  Clearly, young people are still having difficulty in their young school lives.  They are wearing masks from third class up, as per the public health advice, and at second level.  The windows are open and teachers are continually absent.  Even though that might not be reported on as much as it was in January, it is still a day-to-day reality.  I would like to get a sense from the Minister of the continuing work the Department is doing to assess that damage that is being done, understanding all the while that it is absolutely important that schools remain open and that public health advice is followed.  In that regard, does the Minister have a sense as to when the mask mandate, particularly in primary schools, may be lifted?</p> <p>  I am interested in what the Minister had to say about school secretaries.  That matter should absolutely have been resolved by now and the Department should have been much more to the fore in getting it resolved.  I am conscious of the SNAs and their campaign to have the minimum necessary qualifications to become SNAs increased.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about school books.  The Minister will know that I keep raising this issue because progress on it is very much achievable.  Far too many parents in our school communities have discussions about money.  Voluntary contributions are still a real part of school life.  Management bodies say that if voluntary contributions were to be banned, there would be a &euro;45 million hole in the day-to-day running needs of schools.  We could just fill that and not have the need for voluntary contributions.  As a politician, I am now already in the post-Covid restrictions era, getting communications from local schools that are holding fundraisers.  They want support from their local Deputy to take out an advertisement and so on.  I find it pathetic that schools must continually hold fundraisers for their running costs.  It is appalling.  It is ridiculous.  We have to recast our brains totally as to what the normal function of a school is.  Parents' associations are fundraising bodies.  Principals are chasing money all the time.  It is all about fundraising, money, asking parents for book money, etc.  Given all that, I ask about a long-term vision for schools to be self-funded from the Department rather than having to ask parents for money or to have fundraising-type dynamics in school communities.  That is just exhausting.  If parents do not have the money, they feel as if they cannot engage fully in the school community.  If they cannot pay the bills, are they going to go to school fundraiser?  Unlikely.</p> <p>  I am sorry; I appreciate that my time is almost up.  My main point is about school books.  Parents in Northern Ireland do not pay for their children's school books.  In fairness, the Minister has rolled out a scheme that benefits approximately 101 schools.  The number went from 52 originally to 101.  Does she have a vision, or is there a vision in her Department, to roll that out to every primary school and secondary school over time?  I believe it would cost &euro;20 million at primary level and &euro;20 million at secondary level.  That could change the whole dynamic such that principals are not chasing after parents for book money, parents are not running around trying to get books and the conversation becomes less about money and more about education.  If they can do it in the North of Ireland, I am pretty sure we could do it here too.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Covid contingency moneys are also available.  I reiterate that we continue the infection prevention and control measures in our schools.  They are operating very well.  I know they have been lifted in other jurisdictions but we are keeping them in place.  If there is a requirement for us to draw further on the Covid contingency fund, we will certainly do so.</p> <p>  As for masks, a clear commitment has been given that by 28 February there will be a full review of all the public health measures in our schools, particularly in respect of masks.  It is my understanding that NPHET will meet on 17 February and there will be further work in that regard, but 28 February is the date to which we have committed.</p> <p>  I wish to be very clear on the issues the Deputy raised around school books.  I wish to be fair.  I know the Deputy has a particular interest in this and has advocated very strongly on the matter.  We have made available funding of &euro;17.2 million to our schools for the book rental scheme.  More than 98% of our primary schools are availing of that.  As the Deputy correctly stated, 102 schools are availing of the free book pilot scheme.  I am very committed to that.  The context in which we are having this discussion is that everything is a budgetary consideration.  I appreciate that.  I understand the Deputy's bona fides in that the measures he outlines would help to tackle disadvantage and inequality.  We are tackling that ambitiously and in a variety of stages, primarily through DEIS, which was a significant package to resource this year - &euro;18 million rising to &euro;32 million.  As a result, here are a number of strands to how we are facing issues of disadvantage.  Specifically, as I said, considerable funding is already available to the school books rental scheme.  We have rolled out the pilot.  I am interested in advancing that and I will give it my fullest attention.</p></speech>

Suffice to say, first of all, that SNAs are critical to children with additional needs.  We know that and we have increased the number of SNAs by 81% since 2011.  By the end of this year, we will have more than 19,000.  A review of the SNA scheme was carried out by the National Council for Special Education in 2018.  It said we really needed training for SNAs, so we set up a UCD course with places for 3,500 students and SNAs to pursue the course over a period of three years.  There is a ten-month module and they cover a lot of different subjects.  It is important to stress, though, that the calibre of an SNA is not directly affected by the qualifications he or she has.  In fact, many of them are already highly qualified, as it turns out, but we are open to reviewing the matter.  I know there is a claim lodged with the WRC.  The Department is engaging with that and will probably do so further through the national pay agreement.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's question about masks, did mask-wearing have the result the Department of Education had hoped for?</p><p>How many teachers are out with Covid each day?  Is it as big an issue as it was in January?  I know it has tapered off considerably, but schools still have issues trying to get substitutes.</p><p> I very much welcome the additional funding for school libraries.  The program for Government commits to increasing the number of school libraries.  Where are we with the roll-out and extension of school libraries?

It has been a source of reassurance to everyone in the education sector that we have very closely followed the public health advice.  That was not just in respect of one single measure but in respect of a host of infection prevention control measures as recommended.  That includes mask wearing, enhanced cleaning, PPP, hand sanitiser and even down to the use of pods and bubbles in primary schools, social distancing, staggered breaks enhanced supervision and all the innovative ways that schools have adopted to living with Covid.  Public health advice is that we should continue with mask wearing.  We will be following through on the commitment that by 28 February all of that will be reviewed.  It is a combination of all the measures that we have had in schools that have-----</p></speech>

Will everything be taken into account in the review?  I know that my own kids hope to be able to get back to mixing with the entire class rather than with the five or six in their pod.  Children do not understand.  They think if society is coming back to normal, then the classroom should come back to normal as well.</p></speech>

I appreciate how difficult it has been for everyone in the education sector.  The delivery of education has been entirely reimagined.  All those mitigation measures have allowed us to return to in-person teaching and learning.  We learned from the experience of the pandemic that children benefit most from being there and receiving their education in person.  It has been difficult for them, but they have adapted resiliently and superbly.  Like everybody in wider society, they are looking forward a time where we do not have to enforce these measures.  Everything will be reviewed by 28 February and we will follow what the public health advice is at that time.</p> <p>  Regarding substitution, we have been very fortunate that there has been such goodwill from the HEIs and our student teachers have been a remarkable resource to us.  Retired teachers have returned to the classroom.  Restrictions were lifted for teachers who were on job share or career breaks and people have been permitted to move between different schools.  All those measures have helped considerably to meet the challenge of staffing within our schools.</p> <p>  Regarding libraries, we are very supportive of all measures to enhance literacy in our schools.  I was very pleased that in this year's budget we secured &euro;20 million to ensure we meet schools' needs for reading books, audiobooks and Braille books to promote the love of reading, the joy of language and the joy of words, and to inculcate that into our students.  We are rolling that out into our schools.  The Chairman is correct that there is a strong commitment in the program for Government to literacy and the promotion of reading.  I think this will be a very positive step forward in that regard.</p></speech>

The job specification of school secretaries has changed dramatically over the years.  They are now almost as important as the school principal because they run the school side-by-side with the principal.  They now have enormous responsibilities compared with what they had in the past.  I encourage the Minister and her Department to do whatever they can to sort out their problem because they are a very important cog in the operation of schools.  I believe the Minister recognises that.  I know there is much work going on in the background with the WRC.  It is good that everybody is at the table.  I encourage the Department to expedite the matter.</p> <p>  We have had an enormous increase in our population, not only in cities but throughout the country.  School places, particularly secondary school places, are becoming a problem.  Students often need to travel 20 km or 30 km to get to a secondary school which is unacceptable.  In Wexford town, the schools are bursting at the seams and it is a big issue.  What work is the Department doing to look at predictions for population increases?  There will be an enormous financial demand for school buildings in coming years and the Minister will be looking for an increase in budget.  Other Departments will also be looking for increases in their budgets and there will be serious competition between Departments.  Education for children is paramount.  What work is going on to prepare for the increasing population?  </p></speech>

I have worked with school secretaries and caretakers.  I know the enormous value that is added to a school by the work of the support staff.  The issue with school secretaries has been ongoing for years.  I am pleased to say that in the last year and a half we have made significant progress through the WRC.  We have offered to move school secretaries to a scale aligned with clerical officer grade 3.  There are other outstanding issues as mentioned earlier.  However, I assure the Chairman of the commitment of the Department to resolve any of the outstanding issues and we will do that through the WRC.</p> <p>  The Chairman made a very relevant point on planning for future building.  We have a very significant capital budget a &euro;4.4 billion in place for 2021 to 2025.  For this year alone, the building programme budget comes to &euro;792 million.  GIS is allowing us to do geographical studies looking at the population projections and future needs of an area.  We engage with local authorities on the ground on future building projects and the demographics that may well arise in particular areas.  There is also engagement on the ground with the patron bodies, which is very important.  I am very conscious of the need for forward planning and I am also very conscious of the need to have a budget that will back up the demands that will be placed on the Department for that.  A budget of &euro;4.4 billion between now and 2025 is a significant budget to meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p></speech>

St. Aidan's Primary School in Enniscorthy has over 900 pupils.  It has a principal and a teaching vice principal which is not acceptable in this day and age.  Secondary schools with 300 or 400 pupils will have a principal and one or two walking principals.</p><p>There should be parity and all schools should be treated the same because there is as much work in primary schools as in secondary schools.</p><p> On primary schools, I seek the Minister's commitment on an issue about which the Minister's Department Is very much aware.  I have never spoken about this at any meeting.  It is the issue with Cushinstown National School in County Wexford.  The patron, the Bishop of Ferns, has put in a school manager there.  I am aware that the Minister's Department is doing absolutely fantastic work there with the school manager.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to make sure that her Department would give every help and assistance to the diocesan office and to the new school manager, Mr. John Roche, with the issues in the school.  I have been dealing with this issue with the parents.  It is a huge concern for parents and a huge issue for pupils.  No primary school should have to go through this.  It is having an effect on the mental well-being of many parents and pupils.  We are dealing with very young children, where there are issues within the staff. I do not want the Minister to comment on it but I ask that she give a commitment that every resource in her Department will be put to assist the school manager there.  Perhaps the Minister could give me a commitment that she will keep an eye on that for me.</p></speech>

The effect of the past two years has been huge in respect of students with special educational needs.  Has the Minister of State's section in the Department been doing a review on the effects on special needs children and what lessons can be learned from that?  At the start of the pandemic in 2020, the special education schools were closed and very few resources were available education-wise or for tuition for children with special educational needs.  Will a full review be carried out specifically concentrating on special education?  We have all learned lessons whereby we do not want to see children who require special education being left the way they were during this pandemic.  If it does hit again in future years, and hopefully it will not, will the Department have had a review done and lessons learned in order that where mistakes were made, they will not be made again? </p></speech>

I completely concur.  Obviously, the pandemic was extremely difficult for all children but particularly for those with additional needs.</p> <p>  On contingency planning, as far as I am aware, the Department is part of the Government task force and there will be work done in that context.  The Chairman is quite right that the impact of school closures on children with additional needs was really disastrous.  They were not in a position to learn adequately remotely and they needed it to be in person.  I will outline some of the schemes that we put in place.  We put together the supplementary scheme back at Easter, at a cost of about &euro;10 million.  We expanded the summer provision to double the funding to &euro;40 million, and we also had a huge increase this year for eligibility.  The Ministry, Deputy Foley, also mentioned the Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, programme valued at &euro;52.6 million.  This will help a lot of these children to catch up.  Obviously, there was going to be a clear risk of regression for these children.  I have also announced the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, the EPSEN Act, which is the statutory legislation underpinning all special education.  That legislation is now 17 years old and some parts of that Act have not commenced at all.  We are setting up a steering group and an advisory group and we hope to go to a public consultation very shortly on that to get views in relation to tit so we can, as the Chairman has said, take those learnings from what has occurred over the past two years.  If we have another situation in the future, and please God we will not, then we can make sure that these children with additional needs are catered for.</p> <p>  We must bear in mind also that the Government did put the needs of children who had additional needs first and foremost in terms of going back to school, above and beyond anybody else.  The children who have some sort of additional needs only take up about 20% of the entire schoolgoing cohort anyway, so we should not be unable to do that for them in the future.</p></speech>

I will come back in also with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  Does the Minister have an update on the publication of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, report on the review of the senior cycle syllabus?  As the Minister is aware, we are doing our own work on this, and before our committee finalises its own report on the review of the leaving certificate, we would like to be able to bring the NCCA into the committee.  We cannot bring them in, however, until the Minister publishes the report.  Will the Minister please give the committee an update on where we are on that?</p></speech>

This report has really been five years in the making.  It is a substantial body of work and I am currently reviewing that.  I am entirely committed to senior cycle reform and to the senior cycle review.  I believe that we are all very clear that we need an education system that meets the needs of every child and every young person and which provides them with their own unique pathway forward.  When we speak of senior cycle review, we are referring to transition year, the senior leaving certificate applied programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate established, as it is called.  It is quite significant.  I am giving it absolute priority.  It demands a significant response from me and I will be in a position to do that in the not-too-distant future, and as quickly as I possibly can.  I am committed to that.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late as I was at another committee meeting.</p> <p>  To follow up on the work of the committee in relation to leaving certificate reform, some members disagreed and other members agreed on recent decisions but all of that being said I believe that we uniformly agree that leaving certificate reform is entirely necessary in whatever shape or form that takes.  We need to start that conversation soon.  I am very pleased to hear from the Minister, Deputy Foley, that the process shall begin shortly and as soon as possible.  This is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on a few themes that the Chairman has already started.  I echo the compliments that have been paid to the Minister, Deputy Foley, for the comprehensive work the Department and she have done in relation to a school in Swords.  Last week during D&aacute;il questions, the Chairman touched upon it also, which is the fulfilment of and renewal of the capital plan, and the impacts this will have on communities, especially growing communities.  There are acute pressures, as I am sure the Minister will understand, in my constituency which is one of the fastest growing in the country.  On that basis, I recall that in 2008 a total of 80 children showed up to school with their bags, books and uniforms, but there were no school places.  Thankfully, the Department was able to resolve that issue fairly quickly, but it took six weeks for temporary accommodation to be delivered.</p><p>I do not believe that any of us wants to go back to that scenario.</p><p> The expanded brief of the Department in terms of liaising with other bodies such as local authorities and the Department of Social Protection, among others, is essential if we are to keep on top of the demands.  There are acute pressures throughout the country but I can speak only for my constituency, particularly Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords and Balbriggan.  In other communities, steps are being taken to ensure there is capacity available.  The renewed capital plan, which sets out the ambition of the Minister for Education and her Department, is very important, as is the opportunity for the committee to go through it.  Will the Minister provide further information on the advancement of the next capital programme?</p><p> The other issues I wish to raise relate to the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, in particular the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which I welcome.  The committee has discussed the review a number of times.  It is incredibly important that we complete that work.  As far as I am concerned, the biggest issue we have all had in this area over the years has been that parts of the EPSEN Act were never commenced.  Is the Minister proposing to engage with the NGOs and various groups that are key to the delivery of services for children with different additional educational needs?</p><p> On the recruitment of further special needs assistants, we have an ongoing commitment to increase the number of SNAs year on year.  All Members of the House welcome that position because it is entirely necessary.  Will that commitment continue?  Will there be a review within the Department of the SNA allocation model given that it is two years old now to ensure it is operating as desired and designed?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Deputy was in attendance when I mentioned the EPSEN Act earlier.  I have launched a review of the Act, which is not before time as it is 17 years since the Act was first published in 2004.  Parts of the Act were never commenced and there were good reasons for that at the time.  One was related to funding.  I believe commencement of each section of the Act was costed at &euro;225 million or thereabouts.  However, the Act did put the National Council for Special Education on a statutory footing, which was a good thing, and provided for the membership of the NCSE.  We now have increased investment to &euro;2 billion, which was not available at that time.</p> <p>  We have also changed our approach, moving from a diagnosis-led approach to a more needs-based approach.  That must be taken into account.  The current process involves setting up the steering group, which will include representatives of the Department, advocacy groups and the National Council for Special Education.  I also have an advisory group, which is more of a fit for advocacy groups and NGOs.  We want to hear from everybody through the consultation we will have after that.  We expect the consultation to take around three months.  I do not want it to be open-ended because it might never be completed otherwise.  The bottom line for me and, I am sure, the Minister, Deputy Foley, is to ensure we implement the Act in full and that it is reflective of the views of children with additional needs and what they fight for and face, bearing in mind that it should be streamlined with the approach of the Department.</p> <p>  We have an additional 1,165 SNAs available from January of this year.  That SNA reallocation will take place.  The Deputy is correct that it has been two years and it was stopped as a result of Covid.  We are hoping to focus on schools for which the SNA allocation was frozen during that period and which may have been disadvantaged.  We are aware of that and the National Council for Special Education is working very closely with schools on exceptional reviews and all of those matters through the SENOs.  As I said earlier, we will have more than 19,000 SNAs by the end of this year.  It is imperative that schools have an adequate facility.  We will be reviewing this over the next few weeks.</p></speech>

I conducted a survey with primary and secondary school principals for the purpose of looking into supports for children with additional educational needs.  I have not quite finalised the survey but I intend to give it the Minister of State for information purposes.  In conjunction with everything that was happening with Covid and the difficulties around access to education, the survey may suggest or recommend some tweaks.  This is why I suggest that maybe it is timely to have a top-down look at that model given the interruption to its introduction and ongoing recruitment.</p></speech>

A focus is being placed on the leaving certificate, which is hugely important, but, as I said, our breadth of vision is wider than that.  We are looking at all aspects of senior cycle.  We are looking at transition year, leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate vocational programme LCVP, and the leaving certificate established.  I make it abundantly clear that the Department of Education is committed to delivering the reform that is necessary and ensuring we have a system that best meets the needs of children and young people in our care.</p> <p>  I appreciate Deputy Farrell's positive remarks on recent developments in Swords.  As I said, we have a significant breadth of vision and a significant budget to support our building programme.  Investment of &euro;4.4 billion has been provided for 2021 to 2025 as part of a five-year rolling plan.  For this year alone, there is an envelope of &euro;792 million.  This will ensure that 250 school accommodation projects that are currently on site will be completed this year.  Over the course of the five-year plan, an average of between 150 and 200 buildings will be provided each year.  We are very conscious of the need for planning ahead.</p> <p>  Deputy Farrell was correct to refer to having the widest possible consultation on the ground.  It is important that the local authorities and patrons are part of our discussions so that we are ahead when it comes to planning for the whole issue of school building provision for our students and staff.</p></speech>

The committee on children in the previous D&aacute;il did significant work on childhood obesity.  One of the recommendations that flowed from the report we produced was on the importance of healthy eating and, specifically, the subject of home economics and its importance in the senior cycle.  We recommended more involvement outside of the sphere of home economics, taking in other subjects or classes in the curriculum to promote healthy eating.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Is there a programme in the Department looking at that in the context of the Minister's proposed leaving certificate reform and secondary school examinations across junior and senior cycle?  Is healthy eating being looked at in the context of the curriculum?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1011" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#G00100"><p>In fairness, I acknowledge that excellent work is ongoing in our schools regarding healthy eating and well-being.  There is significant engagement by schools in this area.  Our students are heavily involved, not just at secondary level but also at primary level where there are healthy eating promotions.  This all falls under the well-being aspect too.  We are conscious of that.  The promotion of health, well-being and fitness in our schools has progressed positively.  Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, we have put in place significant well-being toolkits and increased the provision of guidance, pastoral care plans and teams.  All that activity looks beyond the traditional classroom and subjects that have been taught towards a wider and more holistic experience.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that element of the breadth of vision has always been in our schools.  The staff in our schools have always been forward-thinking and holistically-minded when it comes to our students.  That may not always have been named or tagged with the language we use now.  The Department is entirely committed to resourcing well-being initiatives and to supporting schools.  From primary level and right into secondary level, schools have been rolling out these types of initiatives for healthy eating plans.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1013" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#G00300"><p>I have a few brief questions for the Minister and Minister of State.  One for the Minister relates, perhaps tangentially, to the subject of health and obesity.  Most secondary schools will now have a hall, but a fair proportion still do not.  As matters stand with capital funding, unless there is a new build or refurbishment that is effectively tantamount to a new build, schools are not getting approval for halls.  We must address this in the capital programmes.  In accordance with the Healthy Ireland targets and the desire to offer physical education, PE, to every school as a leaving certificate subject, schools need halls.  I can think of examples of school in my area, and elsewhere, that do not have school halls and have no prospect of getting them.</p> <p>  Turning to the Minister of State, one of the elements of the budget which I welcomed was the numbers in respect of SNAs.  The last two budgets have shown that having targets in place does not necessarily mean they are realised.  We do not seem to be able to recruit the same number of staff as the funds have been allocated for.  It is not just a budgetary issue.  Part of it comes back to the recognition of qualifications aspect.  I disagree with the response that this issue will be part of the public sector pay talks.  A review should be undertaken before that happens.  It is putting the cart before the horse otherwise.  We cannot decide what people should be paid unless we have a sense of exactly what their responsibilities are going to be.  My request to the Minister of State, and I do not think this is unreasonable, is that she establish an expert group to look at the qualifications and criteria for SNAs.  The order in which this should proceed is to undertake an expert review before moving to pay negotiations.  We must first know what we are asking SNAs to do and what qualifications they should be expected to have to qualify.</p></speech>

We want to see the outcome of that training to allow us to evaluate it properly and get feedback from the SNAs.  We can then bring that back to the Department and take the matter from there.</p></speech>

We are conscious of making provision for these facilities in our new builds where there is an opportunity to do so.  Funding is in place for the future but it is part of a later tranche of development funding available to us.  I will do all I can to bring that about earlier.</p></speech>

Society has changed and males must now take a more proactive role in the home.  Are there plans to make home economics a mandatory subject for male and female students in secondary schools?  Has the Minister or her Department given this any thought?  This will be important from the perspective of obesity because home economics has such broad content and is a subject that can expand.  I believe the Department should give some thought to this.</p> <p>  The hot school meals scheme is under the auspices of the Department of Social Protection, which is an odd fit.  The scheme should be run by the Department of Education.  Has there been any consultation between the Department and the Department of Social Protection on bringing the hot school meals programme under the banner of the Department of Education?</p></speech>

On home economics as a subject, we have worked hard to put in place the widest offering to students in respect of subjects which might meet their interests and talents.  I like the fact that they would have the widest possible choice and it is important that we preserve that in future.  We will be imaginative in respect of the types of subjects we will make available to students.  The kernel of the issue raised by the Chair is similar to what has previously been raised in the context of healthy eating campaigns.  There are opportunities for us to undertake such initiatives in our schools as well and to continue to support the excellent ongoing work in that regard.  I appreciate the point the Chair is making regarding equality of access.  There is currently equality of access but the choice must be made by the students themselves.</p> <p>  On the hot school meals programme, I know the Chair is invested in this issue and has raised it with me before.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  She has always been proactive and generous in her engagement with my Department.  As the Chair correctly said, this scheme is now under her Department.  She has an open style of engagement with the Department in fulfilling the hot school meals programme.  The scheme is of enormous benefit to our schools and we would like to see it grow, advance and develop even further.  We will continue our discussions with the Minister for Social Protection and her Department in that regard.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, would agree with me, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.

I agree completely with the Chair that having it run by the Department of Social Protection is an odd fit.</p> <p>  I have a follow-up question regarding the capital programme and new school builds and rebuilds.  Does the Department of Education actively engage, directly or via patrons, in operating any form of building control inspections during the building or redevelopment of schools, or is that matter delegated to local authorities?  Is there a form of project management whereby officials from the Department are on site at school building projects?</p></speech>

In recent years, there have been opportunities for us to explore a variety of different mechanisms for delivery.  That has served us especially well as we have had to significantly ramp up this programme.</p><p>We will be doing that going forward as well.</p><p> There is, of course, as the Deputy would be aware, a clerk of works on the ground, who is overseeing all of operations and ensuring that everything is at the standard that it should be.  As I said, we are fortunate that we have been in a position to find not just one mechanism, but a variety of strands, in terms of delivery.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out earlier, the issue of provision of places, facilities and variety of facilities that everyone here referenced is a priority.  It is optimum to do it in as speedy and as timely a manner as possible.  It is, obviously, overseen by the clerk of works.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1032" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#H00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to its consideration of this Department&rsquo;s Revised Estimates.  I am conscious that I have only five minutes to deliver my opening statement.  I will, therefore, give a very brief overview of the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2022.</p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for Vote 45 that is before the committee now provides for a net allocation of &euro;2.9 billion, representing a gross allocation of &euro;3 billion reduced by appropriations-in-aid of &euro;76 million.  When taken with the National Training Fund expenditure of &euro;765 million, the gross allocation for our Department in 2022 increases to &euro;3.7 billion.</p> <p>  The Vote 45 allocation comprises the following key elements: a core allocation of more than &euro;2.9 billion to meet the various requirements of the Department in the areas of further and higher education, research innovation and science; temporary Covid funding of &euro;20 million at budget 2021 to fund increased demand for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants in the face of the ongoing pandemic; temporary funding of &euro;19 million to support education and training reform for new and future technological universities under Ireland&rsquo;s national recovery and resilience plan; and temporary funding of &euro;3.5 million through the Brexit Adjustment Reserve to address the impact of Brexit on the Erasmus scheme.  The Department&rsquo;s capital ceiling has also increased and funding was provided to meet the costs associated with the public sector Building Momentum pay deal.</p> <p>  Some 47% of the Department&rsquo;s gross Vote is allocated to pay and pensions, reflecting the crucial work public servants are carrying out in the further and higher education system and in the research, innovation and science sector.  This Department provides the funding for more than 26,000 public servants and 11,000 public service pensioners.</p> <p>  Excluding temporary adjustments and funding, the core increase year-on-year for my Department&rsquo;s Vote is 8%, or &euro;204 million.  This increased from additional funding received during budget 2022, allowing this Department to progress major priorities.  </p> <p>  First, we are making a significant investment in the higher education sector, including funding for increased undergraduate places to support leaving certificate students and meet Ireland&rsquo;s demographic needs.  In 2022, funding for the higher education sector increases to &euro;2.1 billion, the highest it has ever been, and higher even than peak funding levels in 2008.  This is only a start and my Department will be publishing the consultant report under the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support, DG REFORM, programme on sustainable future funding of the tertiary system later this year.</p> <p>  Second, recognising that the levels of support for students are out of step with the costs of going to college, this Department increased student supports in order to address increased cost of living.  The SUSI review will make key recommendations on how to improve the SUSI grant scheme and this report will be brought to Government alongside the future funding report shortly.</p> <p>  Finally, the impact of the pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we all live and work.  Industries are crying out for staff, including digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, construction, transport, logistics, climate sustainability and many more.  In 2022, we have significantly invested in upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship in order to help address the significant workplace change associated with digitalisation, automation and climate change, whose impacts are expected to increase in the coming years.</p> <p>  I trust and hope that this overview is of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to discuss this in more detail and I commend the Revised Estimate to the committee.</p></speech>

It was 23,459 at the end of November.  I wish to find out what the end-of-year figure is for that.</p><p>Why is the target 23,534 for 2022 if this is already the level it is at?  Are we not aiming for an increase in the number of apprenticeships until 2023?  Will the Minister of State clarify this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1041" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#J00200"><p>We will get the exact number for the Deputy.  She will be aware that in the apprenticeship action plan we are setting a target to build 10,000 new registrations per annum until 2025.  This is a target in the plan.  We can supply these details afterwards to have them circulated to the committee.  By way of information I will give an overview of where we are at.  The total number of persons enrolled in apprenticeships in 2014 was 6,913.  In 2017 the figure increased to 12,851.  At the end of 2020 the figure was 19,630.  It is positive there has been an increase.  It is growing.  We have discussed this on many occasions and as late as this week in the D&aacute;il.  There is a lot happening.  Capacity is being expanded.  The response in terms of viewing apprenticeships as a career pathway and an option is becoming obvious to people and is being taken up, which is positive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1042" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#J00300"><p>We can see from the figures there were 6,913 in 2014.  We are so far behind.  This is why we need to monitor this as well as the number of dropouts.  We need to keep advancing.  We also need clarity that we are measuring it properly across the board.  The Minister of State will agree we are still way behind other countries in how apprenticeships are handled.</p> <p>  With regard to the backlog in phases 4 and 6, in November the Minister, Deputy Harris, said it would be cleared in the early months of 2022.  Instead of this we have seen the number of registered apprentices trying to access classroom training jump back up by 2,500 in the past two months.  This would suggest there has not been progress since November when all of the capacity restrictions were lifted.  I am trying to get a take on whether we are really making advances on clearing the backlog.</p></speech>

An amount of &euro;37 million was provided between last year and this year to clear the backlog.  SOLAS and the education and training boards are hiring more trainers and building more capacity.  It is a fact we have also increased the number of registrations coming into the system.  I do not have available to me now the figures I had in the D&aacute;il earlier in the week to quote to the Deputy.  Suffice it to say it is the priority of all to address the backlog.  We will get the committee an up-to-date figure as of the end of January on where exactly we are.</p></speech>

I need to know how many apprentices are not included in the waiting list figure because they have been given a date.  They are waiting but they have been given a date.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1045" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#J00600"><p>The Deputy knows this but it is worth restating.  The national apprenticeship office is kicking into gear.  The director has been appointed.  This will be a key focus of the office in terms of addressing the backlog and the point with regard to dropouts the Deputy has quite rightly raised.  It was raised by another Deputy in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday evening.  This is something that will be on the work programme of the director of the national apprenticeship office.</p></speech>

That would be good.  On phase 2, the Minister, Deputy Harris, said the backlog would be cleared.  Obviously this is where the majority are on the waiting list.  He said it would be cleared by the end of 2022.  Is this the case?</p></speech>

How much is as a result of apprentices being trapped in the system?  I take what the Minister of State is saying on the national apprenticeship office.  Many of these issues will be deciphered so we can see clearly.  It is important for the Minister of State also, with regard to investments being made to clear the backlogs, that we are able to measure it in a very clear and transparent way so everybody knows we are making progress.  We all want to make progress on this.  Sometimes I get concerned about the way things are presented with regard to phases.  It is difficult to dig beneath it to find out what is going on and whether we are getting value for money and going quickly enough to stay ahead and make progress.</p></speech>

How much of this has been allocated specifically to clearing the backlog?  What is the difference between them in terms of the savings made?  How much is allocated to it?</p> <p>  In his statement the Minister of State referred to an increased number of undergraduate places to support leaving certificate students.  Do we know how many undergraduate places are being created at this stage?  The Minister of State rightly referred to identifying industries crying out for staff, with regard to digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, construction, transport, logistics and climate sustainability.  Are we matching up where we see urgent skills shortages to creating the places?</p></speech>

The number of students in full-time higher education, which includes universities, technological universities, institutes of technology and other higher education colleges, in 2020 was 165,946.  In 2014, it was 151,360.  We can see the increase.  The split between undergraduate and postgraduate, favouring undergraduate, is 85% to 15%.  We have had a demographic increase and an increase in the numbers attending college.</p> <p>  Last year the Department engaged with the universities and higher education institutes on providing increased places on high-demand courses.  The discussion will happen again this year.  I cannot give an update on where we are at with regard to this year.  Last year we ensured additional places were made available.  There are approximately 200 additional places on nursing and midwifery courses.</p></speech>

My question on the per-student figure is important because of the chronic underfunding of the system.  It is one thing to add the places but it entirely different to consider how much is invested per student to create the places.  I am very conscious of the pressure put on the institutes to deliver more and more.  I am concerned about the quality and integrity of the education that can be delivered with such restricted budgets.  Again, it is important that we address this.</p></speech>

That is a benchmark metric from before Covid.  Management and delivery in this regard were possible during Covid.</p></speech>

I will start with a matter that has been subject to much debate of late and that has been addressed in the D&aacute;il and Seanad by several Ministers.  Consent classes and arrangements at third level are extremely important.  They must be rolled out uniformly across all third level campuses.  What supports are being provided by the Department to achieve this?  Interrelated, bearing in mind non-academic activity on campuses, how much has the Department invested in mental health supports on our campuses?  These are critical services that third level institutions should provide, with the support of the Department.  Could the Minister of State comment on those two points?  When he answers, I can come back to the two other matters I wish to raise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1059" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#K00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Both issues are important.  The Department takes them very seriously.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has really led in these areas.  In 2021, &euro;5 million was allocated to our higher education institutions to support student mental health and well-being.  That builds on the &euro;5 million provided in the previous year to enhance the capacity of the support structures available.  We were particularly mindful of the fact that we wanted to help people in a more one-to-one setting, so in this regard the money went towards hiring additional capacity and providing people with more contact time and support hours.</p> <p>  On consent, sexual violence and harassment, the framework for consent in higher education institutions was launched in 2019.  Its aim is to ensure the creation of a campus culture that is safe, respectful and supportive.  To assist institutions in implementing the framework, funding of over &euro;400,000 was allocated by our Department to a number of initiatives since the launch.  In addition, the Higher Education Authority has allocated funding of over &euro;500,000 to consent workshops for the development of what is called Speak Out, an anonymous reporting and support tool.  Significant resources and funding have been made available.</p></speech>

I recognise what the Minister of State said.  On the final point he made, I wonder whether the funding is sufficient to deal with the issue, which is now so prevalent in society.  In the past few years, individual incidents have been talked about.  Usually, we remember them for a few days and then move on as a society, but I feel that we are not moving on at the moment.  That is only a good thing, as far as I am concerned.  If we are not moving on, there is an onus on the Department to examine the funding stream and determine what else can be done to support safety on campus and the ambition set out in the programme, which, of course, I welcome.  I do not really need a response on this matter but request that the Department consider it seriously in the context of future budgets.</p></speech>

The initiatives are demand led in that demand can go up and down.  We will not be found wanting in providing the required supports.  Along with having provided supports through the student assistance fund, we have significantly ramped up student assistance funding.  There is over &euro;18 million for this year alone across all the higher education institutions, which is significant.</p></speech>

Yesterday evening, I was in the University of Limerick.  Its student services office has in its student assistance fund more than &euro;1 million, which is significant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1064" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022021000002#K01100"><p>When I think back to my days at Waterford Institute of Technology, I shudder to think that there was probably less than &euro;100 in some of the funds.  It is a long time ago.  I recognise the steps the Department has taken to support students, particularly over Covid, during which technological supports have been offered.  That is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  My two other questions relate to parliamentary questions I submitted this week.  They are specific to critical skills.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, answered the questions.  I was not aware that the Minister would not be present today so I apologise if I am putting the Minister of State on the spot.  The critical skills in education right now, beyond those of teachers and special needs assistants, entail offering additional supports to children with additional needs, including occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and clinical psychological services.  The response I received from the Department this week was that there are 244 places available per annum for those three areas on an ongoing basis.  There is a chronic shortage, particularly at clinical psychology and occupational therapy levels.  To my mind, these involve critical skills.</p> <p>  I was talking to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, before and during the meeting this afternoon on the supports the State provides to children with additional needs.</p><p>If ever there was a critical skills shortage, it is in the number of places that are available across the State for those areas.  I cannot think of a school that has not been in touch with me in my 18 years of public life that does not have one of those critical skills deficiencies, either at a school or community level.  To put it mildly, the waiting lists are very difficult.  When put in the context of a child with additional needs, it is almost impossible outside of the school sphere for parents to get access to supports they desperately need in a timely way.  I understand that the CAO is a separate entity and that the HEA sets up these courses.  I recognise that some of the courses are at doctoral level, as the Minister of State indicated in response to my questions on Tuesday.  I totally understand that, but the Department has a role to play in ensuring we can meet the critical skills deficiency in that area.</p><p> The other part of the question relates to a topical issue in the further and higher education area, which is retrofitting and the skills required in that regard.  The Government has put in place an &euro;8 billion nine-year programme, which I am sure will be added to over the years and will most likely continue past 2030.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has stated the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science plays a key role in ensuring that places are provided.  It was indicated to me that courses range from a few hours to a few weeks, while others are for a few months.  They will provide people with the skills to allow us to deliver on our climate commitments.  Does the Minister of State have a comment in that regard?  I have one final question after his response.</p></speech>

The sector is aware of the challenge.  We are getting ourselves to a place to provide the training that will be required to produce the workers.  As the Deputy rightly said, a training course can range from a number of days to a few weeks.  There is a limited number of training centres at the moment.  There are two centres of excellence and, currently, two education and training boards provide training.  All the other ETBs are working now to scale up to a point where they can provide this training.  As the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, alluded to yesterday when he spoke about the announcement, the sector now has certainty as the scheme has been launched.  That is a good thing.  In response to that, tomorrow we will invite submissions from providers, SOLAS and the ETBs.  We are providing &euro;430 million in capital to training providers to make a submission to us on their requirements to provide training centres and facilities.</p></speech>

It is not just in retrofitting, although retrofitting courses will be part of it.  In the ETB sector in particular, a lot of work has been going on in the background as the ETBs get ready for this.  We have the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, centre in Wexford which is in the Chairman's constituency.  We have provided funding of &euro;75 million to provide for more than 35,000 learners to avail of green skills modules.  They are the shorter type of courses.  There are 2,650 additional places in retrofit and NZEB.  This did not commence with yesterday's announcement; a great deal of preparatory work has gone into it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about access.  The Department works with the agencies that provide these services and supports.  We are happy to look into any specific queries the Deputy wishes to raise.  In particular, we have a national plan for equity of access to higher education.  Over the past four years, since the commencement of the plan, 193 students with disabilities have been awarded bursaries.  The funding for the national plan for equity of access to higher education for 2022 is &euro;5 million.</p></speech>

They are being provided to support children with additional educational needs but that it is not enough.  It might well be a demand issue but the Department has an important role to play in increasing the number of places available so that we have professionals coming out the other end to provide ongoing support children in school, especially at primary level, to access education.</p></speech>

I apologise if I have gone on a little too long.  My final question is one I have asked before but to which I have not had a response thus far.  I appreciate that it is possibly an unusual question.  The modified leaving certificate of the past two years has had significant consequences for third level and a significant amount of funding had to be provided to meet extra demand for courses.  In the past in an average year, the Department would have known the number of students dropping out in first year as a consequence of making the exact mistake I made in 1995 when I selected the wrong course.  I subsequently found the right course and went from there.  The dropout rate is measurable.  There is a significant amount to be learned from the dropout rate and an analysis of the reasons behind it.  The past two years of accredited grades put an awful lot of students into third level who, in other circumstances, might not have been so fortunate.  I would like to either prove or disprove that statement and the only analysis apart from the grades at third level is the dropout rate.  Such analysis would be helpful, especially in the context of the root and branch reform of senior cycle and the leaving certificate the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, is doing at secondary level.  To be fair to him, the Chairman has probably held more than 20 hours of committee hearings in the public eye, not to mention the dozens of hours of work that are done out of view of the public.  That analysis would feed into the leaving certificate reform.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's view on that.</p></speech>

As I alluded to in my comments to Deputy Alan Farrell, the Department will announce a capital investment call tomorrow.  That will be available to the technological sector for any projects or proposals it may have for us.  The Chairman will be aware that the different technological university projects are at different points in their journeys or transitions and that we have a fund of &euro;90 million, the technological university transformation fund, that will run until 2023.  We allocated a further &euro;40 million to the technological university education reforms under the national recovery and resilience plan and &euro;18 million for technology-oriented research under the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, was also progressed.  Funding is not an issue.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State accept that the current situation unfairly disadvantages technological universities and that there should be a level playing pitch with regard to borrowing?  I know technological universities can borrow for accommodation but, other than that, they are prohibited from doing so.  We have visited Cork and Limerick, the Minister of State's own constituency, and absolutely fantastic work is being done.  This is an issue that consistently came up when speaking to people in the institutes there and in speaking to the presidents of other technological universities.  The committee has a module of work on funding for universities and technological universities coming up.  We are trying to arrange a date on which the Ministers, Deputies Harris and Donohoe, could come before the committee together to talk about this specific issue.  I do not expect the Minister of State to have an answer but I impress upon him the need to progress this matter in his Department for the benefit of the technological universities.  That would be very much appreciated.  We will have a wider conversation on this issue with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and possibly the Minister of State along with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.</p> <p>  We are talking about apprenticeships and so on.  We were told in Cork that, if the borrowing capacity was available, the number of apprenticeships going through the technological university could be increased.  The facilities there date back to the 1970s and 1980s.  In fairness, the institution is doing a fantastic job.  I give the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and their Department full credit for increasing the number of apprenticeships and making them more appealing to an awful lot of students.  In the past, there were students who felt looked down on for doing apprenticeships.  That has totally changed.  The Department has done a great amount of work on that.  However, at the same time, we should be putting the proper level of investment into the institutions as well.</p></speech>

There is great demand for it and we are addressing that.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has spoken about this on a number of occasions.  The technological university sector will be permitted to borrow to build student accommodation.  That will happen.  The Minister is in ongoing dialogue with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage because the issue has implications for the Housing for All plan.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has indicated that he is open to looking at the cost-rental model for student accommodation.  The two Departments are collaborating on that.</p></speech>

I welcome that.  I bring to the Minister of State's attention the town of Ballyhaunis.  There has been an application in for some time with regard to delivering training and apprenticeships in a centre in the town where programmes have been delivered.  I mention Ballyhaunis in particular because it is a very vibrant, multicultural town, which results in challenges, particularly with regard to delivering training and apprenticeships within the community.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that application.  I will wait until tomorrow to see the criteria being used for this.  I ask the Minister of State to take the whole town and the make-up of the population into consideration because delivering apprenticeships within the community so that people do not have to travel can result in many positive externalities that can feed into the whole of the community, helping those who are working very hard to ensure the community is vibrant.  The bank in Ballyhaunis has been taken away.  It had a Bank of Ireland branch and another bank but there is no bank there now.  One of the best ways to ensure the town is sustainable and viable and to increase the human capital within it is to provide for apprenticeships and training in order that people can find work of the very same kind they would be doing in those apprenticeships in the area and meet the skills demands there.  It is crucially important.  We should not miss this opportunity.</p></speech>

There is to be a 115% increase in our capital allocation, which is a significant amount of funding.  As I said in my remarks to the Chair and Deputy Alan Farrell, it is a matter of building and increasing capacity.  That is exactly what we want to do.</p></speech>

I submitted a longer and more detailed written statement, which the members have already, so I will keep my remarks relatively short and present an overview.  I also appreciate the Chair's kind remarks regarding the briefing provided by departmental officials to members.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2022, as well as the Votes for the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority, which are also under the aegis of my Department.  As the Chair mentioned, I am joined by my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for local government and planning, Deputy Peter Burke.  I am also joined by my officials, Mary Hurley, assistant secretary, local government division; David Kelly, principal officer, social housing delivery division; David Flynn, principal adviser, water division; Lorraine O'Donoghue, principal officer, local government finance unit; and Janet Jacobs, assistant principal officer, departmental finance unit.</p> <p>  Starting with Vote 34, this totals over &euro;5.9 billion for the year and comprises &euro;2.5 billion in current funding and &euro;3.4 billion on the capital side.  In addition, there is a &euro;276 million capital carry-over from 2021.  Another &euro;91.5 million is coming from the proceeds of the local property tax, LPT.  This means that &euro;6.3 billion in funds will be managed across Vote 34 this year.  As we continued to grapple with the ever-changing reality of the impact of Covid-19 last year, our ability to push forward at the pace of delivery anticipated was simply not possible.</p><p>Construction closures, social distancing measures, workforce impacts and supply chain issues outside of any of our control or visibility had a significant impact on delivery and, consequentially, had an impact on expenditure.</p><p> My Department continued to work at a relentless pace to deliver emergency legislation, to ensure that vulnerable households were protected and to push on to provide a new pathway for housing delivery at a scale and investment level never seen before in the history of this State.  The past few weeks have been very positive in terms of the cautious reopening and I am very hopeful that will translate now into an unimpeded and very productive year.</p><p> More than &euro;3.6 billion is being allocated to housing programmes in 2022, representing an increase of more than &euro;527 million or 17% on the Estimate for 2021.  In addition, there will be &euro;92 million from local property tax receipts and a carry-over of &euro;246 million from 2021.  The total funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes is just under &euro;4 billion, including &euro;2.6 billion in capital funding.  This will be further supplemented again through Housing for All, HFA, lending and Land Development Agency funding for the most substantial capital budget for housing ever seen.</p><p> Bearing in mind that there are many types of social housing needs with this budget, we must take a multipronged approach and maintain the support for the 82,000 households in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, or in the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  We cannot simply turn off the tap in that space.  We must ensure immediate supports being made available for families who seek urgent assistance in providing funding for an additional 15,000 immediate supports for 2022.  Focus will be on long-term housing delivery, with the delivery of 11,820 new social homes, 9,000 of which will be new-build social homes.  As part of our Housing for All programme, we intend to get that average of new-build homes up to 10,000 over the period of the plan.</p><p> The Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever stand-alone affordable housing legislation, established the basis for our delivery of new affordable purchase and cost-rental schemes.  We have targeted 4,100 affordable homes this year to be delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and through a strategic partnership between the State and banks.  The first cost-rental homes in the country were tenanted in 2021 in Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, at an average of 40% below market value.  The first affordable purchase homes will be made available in Boherboy in Cork city at purchase prices ranging from &euro;217,000 for a two-bedroom home to &euro;243,000 for a three-bedroom home.  We will now see a really significant year-on-year increase in the number of affordable homes which will lead to an average of 6,000 homes per year over the lifetime of Housing for All.</p><p> While it is clear and strategic to have our focus on the long term and on building our housing stock, we must also invest energy and funding into tackling homelessness, which is a real, immediate and acute issue.  Those in homelessness are living at the sharpest end of this housing crisis.  The &euro;194 million allocated in 2022 reflects the priority the Government is giving to this area and will advance 18 distinct commitments under Housing for All.  I will also provide funding for other important areas, including &euro;85 million to retrofit 2,400 social housing homes; enhancing measures to tackle vacancy and providing support to the rental sector.</p><p> Recognising that funding alone will not yield results, a central element of Housing for All is to build institutional capacity.  I am committed to strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects and to engage in the range of activities to promote living cities and towns, by tackling vacancy and dereliction and supporting regeneration.</p><p> My Department has made substantial progress on how we manage our water quality and water services.  Central to this is the transformation and separation of Irish Water from the Ervia group and the creation of a national, publicly-owned, regulated, single public water utility.  There is a major programme of work ahead of us to complete this transformational journey and engagement on a framework for the future is currently taking place at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I believe it will be possible to reach a collective agreement that addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.</p><p> In 2022, the Department will provide more than &euro;1.4 billion to Irish Water.  This includes &euro;830 million in capital to allow it to continue its capital investment programme to modernise and expand the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s water infrastructure through projects such as Ringsend, Arklow and Kilkenny wastewater treatment plants, which will raise network capacity, increase water quality and bring us closer to compliance with European directives.  It is important to say it is the first time Irish Water has a view of its funding on a multi-annual basis and can plan appropriately to deliver projects such as Ringsend, which is now commissioned and Arklow, where we have broken ground and contractors are in place and throughout the country.</p><p> The record level of investment will ensure that Irish Water can support the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s housing objectives in Housing for All.  In addition, Irish Water is taking additional actions to support housing connections to public water services through publishing capacity registers, which are available now, engaging with the LDA on identifying land suitable for development and facilitating self-lay accreditation, which is an important step forward.  We initiated a pilot scheme in July 2020 to allow for self-lay accreditation and it is now expanding throughout the country.</p><p> My Department also continues to invest directly in rural water services through the rural water programme by allocating more than &euro;62 million in 2022.  It will launch a new multi-annual rural water programme later this year.  This will also include a new element to support the provision of wastewater treatment in non-sewered villages.  This will be a very important announcement shortly.  We will manage this programme with the co-operation of local authorities and Irish Water.  I will have additional announcements on that in the coming weeks and months.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will shortly speak on matters related to local government but I would like to specifically mention the significant capital investment in fire and emergency services in 2022.  The allocation will amount to &euro;19.3 million, including investment in the national directorate for fire and emergency management, NDFEM, and &euro;18 million in capital.  Some &euro;6 million is allocated for the progression of fire station construction and upgrade projects.  The projects announced under the 2021 to 2025 fire services capital programme are progressing.  Further drawdown is expected in 2022, as more projects progress through the design and planning stages, with construction beginning on others.</p><p> Some &euro;5 million will contribute to appliances, procured under the new fire appliance procurement programme, which runs from 2021 to 2023.  Some &euro;2 million will progress the final element of the upgrade of the communications and mobilisation system under the Ctr&iacute; project.  Some &euro;5 million will fund other necessary emergency and rescue vehicles and equipment, including jeeps, vans, road-traffic accident equipment, breathing apparatus, telecommunications and other fire equipment, where grant aid has been approved to fire authorities.</p><p> On the heritage side, in 2022, a total of &euro;180 million is allocated for heritage projects, of which &euro;176 million is Revised Estimates Volume, REV, funding, with a further &euro;3.5 million carbon tax carry-over for peatlands restoration.  Operational and capital budgets will increase almost 45% year on year in 2022. This will fund activity under the National Monuments Service, the built heritage programmes and the National Parks and Wildlife Service's extraordinary teams that deliver for the citizen directly through the agencies and bodies under our aegis, which are the Heritage Council, Waterways Ireland and the Irish Heritage Trust.</p><p> This substantial funding will allow the Department to progress an expanded programme of peatlands restoration; biodiversity investment and nature conservation works.  We will expand participation in the National Parks and Wildlife Service farm plan scheme and the LIFE nature programmes.  We will protect our archaeological and built heritage with a further 1,100 built heritage projects targeted for support in 2022.</p><p>We will invest in and support Ireland's national parks and reserves.  Approved staffing levels for the NPWS now exceed those in place prior to the financial crisis.  We will maintain and invest in our inland waterways for some 15,000 registered boat users through Waterways Ireland, including the acceleration of the Ulster Canal and other cross-Border projects.</p><p> The 87,000 ha national parks and nature reserve network and the heritage estate of national monuments and historical properties saw unprecedented levels of visitors over the last two years, offering a lifeline by providing physical and mental health space where people could safely access the outdoors for fresh air, exercise, mindfulness and well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic.    </p><p> To summarise, the 2022 funding continues the supports for heritage and associated grant schemes providing conservation, amenity, health and well-being benefits to our citizens along with jobs, as well as supporting Ireland's climate actions, tourism and economic development in communities and regions.  All this work on heritage is being ably led and managed by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is doing a fantastic job.  He cannot attend this meeting due to other commitments this evening.</p><p> This year, some &euro;43 million will be provided to Met &Eacute;ireann and will be used to fund the essential maintenance, development and support of Met &Eacute;ireann's specialised meteorological and ICT infrastructure.  In the context of climate change and the impact of weather in Ireland, Met &Eacute;ireann serves society through the production and communication of reliable weather and climate information that will protect life and property.  This funding will further enhance Met &Eacute;ireann's role as the authoritative voice of meteorology and climatology in Ireland.</p><p> As the committee is aware, my Department also has responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority.  A provision of nearly &euro;19.6 million is made in Vote 34 for Ordnance Survey Ireland in 2022, while the other two organisations have separate Votes, amounting to &euro;22 million for the Valuation Office and &euro;35 million for the Property Registration Authority.  These bodies are to merge to form Tailte &Eacute;ireann and work is proceeding in my Department on this important project.</p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible given we are covering a Department as broad as the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with such a significant investment programme for 2022.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will now speak about the important work being funded in local government and planning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1097" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#C00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Estimate for 2022 in planning and local government.  I also have responsibility for Traveller accommodation and support and housing for people with disabilities and older people.  As the Minister noted, significant capital and current funding has been provided to the Department in 2022 and we are all firmly focused on ensuring the maximum output from this State investment.</p> <p>  Regarding Traveller accommodation and supports, it is important to note that some &euro;15.5 million in capital funding was fully drawn down by local authorities in 2021.  A total of &euro;1.33 million was also provided to local authorities for Covid-related measures such as the provision of additional accommodation, halting site cleaning, additional sanitation and isolation units.  There will be some Covid-related expenditure in 2022.  Our objective is to ensure that services provided to halting sites will be maintained.  To that end, funding will be provided for any additional services deemed necessary by local authorities.  Overall, some &euro;18 million is being provided in capital funding for 2022 representing a 16% increase over 2021.  In addition, some &euro;6.5 million in current funding will be provided in 2022 bringing the total funding to &euro;24.5 million.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware of the recommendations of the expert group on Traveller accommodation.  The programme board overseeing the implementation of these recommendations met on six occasions last year and the board has agreed to report progress on the recommendations on the Department website.  This will be available shortly.</p> <p>  Turning to housing for people with a disability and older people, over &euro;2.7 million will be provided under subhead A14 in 2022.  The review of the national housing strategy for people with a disability was completed in 2021.  The implementation group for housing options for our ageing population joint policy statement also completed its work in 2021.  Work on a number of key actions will continue into 2022.  The Housing Agency is working with local authorities to ensure their strategic plans for housing for people with disabilities are updated and implemented.  The mental health tenancy sustainment project, which is jointly funded by the Department and the Department of Health, is continuing and will be expanded in 2022.</p> <p>  Funding for the Age-Friendly Ireland shared services supporting the implementation of the actions set out in the Housing Options for Our Ageing Population policy statement will also continue in 2022.  Complementing this strategic work is subhead A18, which makes funding provision for the payment to local authorities of expenditure incurred on the suite of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability.  Three separate schemes are available.  The housing adaptation grant for people disability scheme provides grants of up to &euro;30,000 to assist people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried.  The housing aid for older people scheme provides grants of up to &euro;8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out.  The mobility aids grant scheme is available to fast-track grants of up to &euro;6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household.  Some &euro;65 million is being made available in 2022 to deliver on these schemes.  </p> <p>  The Local Government Fund's primary purpose is to channel local property tax to local authorities following collection by the Revenue Commissioners as well as certain local authority initiatives.  This programme includes a contribution to the Local Government Fund of &euro;225 million in 2022 to support the local government sector in providing a range of essential services at local level, including assistance towards increased pay and pensions, costs arising under national pay agreements, local property tax equalisation payments and important local government initiatives across the country, including supporting shared services.  In 2022, income sources to the Local Government Fund are estimated to be local property tax of &euro;520 million as well as a payment from the Vote of some &euro;225 million.  The payment from the Vote includes the Exchequer contribution of local property tax equalisation of &euro;34.3 million.  The total local property tax allocation for 2022 is just under &euro;524 million, which includes the impact of all local variation decisions.</p> <p>  Over the past two years, the Department has worked closely with local authorities to provide an essential lifeline to local businesses in the form of a rates waiver.  By the end of 2021, more than &euro;1.1 billion had been routed through the Local Government Fund for this purpose, with an additional &euro;62.3 million that will issue in respect of quarter 4 of last year.  It was recently announced that the targeted rates waiver for quarter 4 would be extended to quarter 1 of 2022.  However, this does not form part of today's Estimate and Covid-19 supports for 2022 will be kept under review.  Further supports are not currently anticipated.</p> <p>  A significant number of activities are under way or in planning.  A few key programmes merit mention.  The largest area of planned expenditure is the urban regeneration and development fund, for which a total of &euro;159 million is being provided this year, including a &euro;25 million capital carryover from 2021.  The immediate focus is on ensuring early progress on the programme of 132 transformative regeneration and development projects and the Department is in regular contact with local authorities to assist their advancement.  The next call for proposals under the urban regeneration and development fund will be arranged later.  The focus of the call will reflect the experience of the funding calls to date, the objectives of Housing for All and tackling vacancy in towns, which is reflected in our town centre first approach.</p> <p>  A total of &euro;7.1 million in current and capital funding is being provided towards the cost of activities of the Land Development Agency in 2022 ahead of the imminent capitalisation through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.</p><p>There has been more than &euro;45 million funding for the operational budgets of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Office of the Planning Regulator and Ordnance Survey Ireland.</p><p> I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

It is when we see the brief on the Estimates that we realise the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's wide remit and the large number of matters under it.</p> <p>  I move now to members' questions.  If members say to which part of the Estimates they are directed, it might assist the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#D00300"><p>It is great to have the Minister and Minister of State with us to discuss the realities of Housing for All.  When we first saw it, we saw a plan.  We also saw a multi-annual budget, which is crucial to the delivery of many of these housing solutions.  When Housing for All is broken down programme by programme, with a funding stream assigned to each, phrases like "Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe", "First Homes", "Project Tosaigh" and so on start coming to life.  That is welcome.</p> <p>  Many members of the committee, especially those on the Government side, feel that a significant body of work has been done over the past two years in trying to deliver legislation that gave approved housing bodies, AHBs, local authorities, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and others the ability to deliver a wide range of solutions for housing.  Having all of the various programmes is key.  Sometimes, the housing crisis is painted as one problem with one solution, but we know that there is much more to it than that.  That said, we can see from these Estimates a significant commitment to the idea of public housing and different types of solution that allow communities like mine to deliver mixed-income housing.  That is crucial.  I come from a community in Ballymun and Finglas that was built as a solution to a housing crisis in previous decades.  We know that we did not get everything right in such communities.  Perhaps we put in too many houses and not enough supports and there was not the right mix in some areas.  This is why I welcome each of the tools.  AHBs and local authorities must now use them together to deliver on the ground.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about delivery.  A figure of &euro;4 billion is referenced.  It comes from &euro;2.6 billion in capital funding as well as funding from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, and the LDA.  I will give the Minister an opportunity to expand on that a little and explain the sources of that funding.  Am I correct in saying that they are all State sources?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#D00400"><p>We have underpinned the programme on a multi-annual basis to ensure that the LDA, now that it has been established on a statutory footing with the help of the committee and most Members, can be capitalised.  The Minister of State mentioned that it would be capitalised imminently.  It received its first capitalisation through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  The HFA is a source of low-cost lending, particularly to AHBs.  We have been able to secure that as well.  In each year, we are looking at in or around &euro;4 billion - that will grow - in investment in new social, affordable and cost-rental homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#D00500"><p>The start of that will be programmes like the affordable housing fund, to which almost &euro;60 million has been allocated.  When can local authorities start drawing down that funding?  There are already some plans in place for various sites.  Is the architecture in place for local authorities and AHBs to start benefiting from the fund?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#D00600"><p>We have received housing delivery plans from every local authority in the country.  In the Custom House, our housing delivery team, which deals with affordable and social housing, is working through those plans with each local authority.  Next week and the week after, I will have housing summits with all 31 chief executives and their directors of services for housing and planning.  The affordable housing fund is open for calls now.  We have expanded further our cost rental offering through the cost rental equity loan, CREL, 2.  Under that call, I have signed off on a series of additional projects and it will deliver hundreds more cost rental projects this year.  We are going through proposals that we have already received from some local authorities for advanced purchase arrangements for affordable purchase.  I expect the LDA, through Project Tosaigh, to work through a number of proposals that it has received on activating dormant planning permissions while focusing that development on affordable and social housing.</p> <p>  We have different funding streams working together to deliver social homes at a level that we have never seen before.  This is the 9,000 new builds out of the 11,820 that we want to deliver this year, made up by acquisition and leasing.  On the affordable housing side, we are targeting 4,100 homes this year while building up the capacity to reach an average of 6,000 over the course of the plan.  I believe that we can do more than that.  There is immense potential in cost rental in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#D00700"><p>I am conscious of those two programmes because my community in Ballymun is halfway through a master plan that started nearly 20 years ago.  We want to ensure that we have affordable purchase and affordable rental in the area.  Local authorities did not have those tools before the legislation was passed in the past two years.  We could not deliver mixed-income housing with that legislation.  The programmes are important.</p> <p>  There are 28 ha of land in public ownership across 19 sites.  Dublin City Council has been looking at them.  Without being critical, I expect Dublin City Council to be ambitious about all of those sites, particularly the ones with a commercial element.  I hope that the Department will be in a position to support the council across the city, but specifically in respect of the sites in Ballymun.  While this is about providing housing, it is also about delivering on the promise of the regeneration plan.  This is a major opportunity.  It is 30 minutes from Dublin city centre and on a proposed metro line.  It is all in our ownership and under our control.  We can build thousands of houses in Ballymun.  That would be a significant benefit, so I would appreciate the Minister's support.</p></speech>

We are asking them to take a lead role in the delivery of affordable homes.  I visited many of the sites in Ballymun with the Deputy.  There is a real opportunity there.  I am asking our local authorities - and we are working with them - to bring forward sites and deliver affordable, cost-rental and social homes, but we also need a tenure mix.  We have opportunities thanks to the land that we own.  The affordable housing fund is open right now and our local authorities know what they will have for investing in social homes on a multi-annual basis.  They have a view right up to 2026.  That is important.</p> <p>  Once we have agreed our housing delivery plans with our local authorities, I intend for there to be full transparency in each local authority area across the country about what we are asking them to deliver.  All members of this committee and, as importantly, public representatives at local authority level know what they need to deliver in each of their areas.</p></speech>

I compliment the officials on this report.  It is probably the best Estimates report that we have got in my time on the committee.  We have been given a table on page 8 that sets out expenditure line by line.  The report then goes on to explain it all in detail.  That is helpful from the committee's point of view.  I am seeking clarification on some aspects of the Estimates, though.  I will run through them as quickly as I can so that I can get as much information as possible.</p> <p>  Regarding the CREL, page 10 sets out a target of 700 units for this year.  So that we are clear, 325 of those are from last year's target of 390 that were not delivered.</p><p>The 375 are additional to the 390 committed to last year.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The 1,000 to be delivered by the Land Development Agency will be turnkey in the sense that they are not part of the Land Development Agency's current pipeline.  The LDA has told us that its current pipeline will not produce any new units until 2023 or 2024.  Given that it was very difficult to deliver 390 turnkey cost rental properties last year and the Minister is now looking to do 1,000 with the LDA and an additional 375 with the AHBs, how confident is he that that target will be met?  That is a big jump from the 65 delivered last year to the accumulated total this year?</p></speech>

We are all hoping that we are going to have an unimpeded year this year.  Last year, construction was closed up to Easter and the supply chains and capacity constrained.  Thankfully, our capacity as a sector is now back to pre-pandemic levels and we need to build on that.  Through project Tosaigh the Land Development Agency has opportunities to delivered cost rental in that space.  I am not talking about acquisition of existing homes but new homes being built.</p></speech>

That is understandable.  For the LDA to deliver 1,000 cost rental homes this year for purchase and tenancy in real terms those homes would already have to be at an advanced stage of construction.  That is a fair point.</p></speech>

There are some projects that can be started quite quickly and on a joint venture basis through project Tosaigh.  We will be able to deliver cost rental in that space.  I have no doubt that will be challenging, but we have set ourselves a challenging target of 4,100 affordable units.  There are capacity issues, particularly around the cost rental side, but there are opportunities into 2022 and beyond to deliver more than our target.</p></speech>

I am a big supporter of home ownership.  We need to deliver homes by all mechanisms possible.  I am not hung up on ideology.  I do not care who builds the homes, be that councils, approved housing bodies, the LDA, public-private partnership or private builders, so long as homes are built.  For that to happen, we need a plan, political will and investment.  We have a plan, Housing for All, which is a multiannual plan.  We have the political will and we can see very clearly that we have multi-billion euro investment behind that plan to deliver much-needed homes</p> <p>  I particularly welcome the affordable housing fund of &euro;60 million and the allocation of &euro;44 million towards the shared equity loan scheme, which will help bridge the affordability gap for young couples, young families and other people who are now looking to purchase.  It is great to see 1,500 voids provided for in terms of council homes that will be refurbished, retrofitted or turned around quicker so that 1,500 families can avail of them.  I welcome the investment in terms of vacancy.  I particularly welcome the &euro;12 million allocation for repair and lease.  An issue that arises again and again in committee is the lack of local authority targets for schemes like this.  Was funding for last year fully drawn down and how do we make sure this year's allocation is fully drawn down?</p> <p>  From an LDA perspective, it is fantastic to see the commitment in terms of affordable and cost rental homes with 1,000 such homes to be delivered this year.  I welcome the level of investment in the AHBs, first homes, cost rental and retrofitting.  All of these are really practical measures that will make a huge difference on the ground.  LIHAF enables the delivery of homes and local infrastructure.  My own area has benefited from the URDF.  The Minister visited Tandy's Lane Park in Lucan and Adamstown where he saw first-hand how well that funding is being so well spent in growing communities.  Funding has been allocated for the establishment of the housing commission.  I am particularly interested in hearing if there is any update on when the planned referendum will take place.  </p> <p>  Turning to the Ministers of State, Deputy Peter Burke and Deputy Noonan, it is great to hear so much from a heritage perspective in terms of the Heritage Council, our built heritage and our natural heritage, which are all big amenities for us as a society.  It was to great hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, that Traveller accommodation funding provided last year was fully drawn down.  That was an issue in previous years.</p><p>It is great to see local authorities fully utilising these funds.  </p><p> The Department has allocated quite a large amount of money in support of disability in older people accommodation.  It will be key to see how local authorities use this.</p><p> The rates waiver which the Minister has spoken about has been a very significant lifeline to businesses up and down this country and it is great to see it provided for and further rolled out this year.  </p><p> The 132 regeneration projects that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has spoken about are all a significant part of the plan and it is very encouraging to see the funding allocation spelled out on the diagrams on pages four and five and exactly how much of this is going directly into the delivery and support of housing.  That is a top priority of this Government and it is great to see that there in black and white in that report.</p><p> On the affordable housing fund, it would be great to receive some information around the regulations that will be published as part of that.</p></speech>

On the vacancy issue, we have done a very significant amount of work through our Town Centre First policy which is a very exciting new enabling policy to unlock the potential in our towns and villages right across the country and to draw these funding investment structures together to enable a ground-up approach from community groups that can work with a town regeneration officer in the local authority.</p> <p>  We have also increased the budget for the vacant homes offices and hopefully by the second quarter of this year we will have a full-time vacant homes officer in each local authority.  We see that as a very significant priority because it is an area that needs considerable focus into the future.  Everyone is aware of the challenges in rural areas of trying to bring derelict or vacant properties back into use and in allowing these to realise their potential in the local community.  </p> <p>  Something which the Deputy also referred to which is very important is the Traveller accommodation budget.  I acknowledge that we still have very substantial challenges in that area but we are working very hard with families to support them.  </p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, report last year was very chilling and I have met with staff of the office.  I also met with the rights commissioner last year to try to advance our proposals.  We have a number of schemes now, backed up by finance, which are trying to support families, as well as our expert group which meets to drive the implementation of the expert report.  It has set out its programme of work, working currently on 18 of the 32 recommendations.  That is a very challenging area.  As a father of two young children I am fully aware of the pressures that arise in that field and I am working also very hard to deliver in that area.</p></speech>

The year 2022 is going to be a very significant one.  The Deputy has outlined a number of different funding streams for the delivery of affordable housing.  I have been out in Tandy's Lane with the Deputy also.  I see our local authorities, like South Dublin County Council and others, are very progressive in driving things forward.  We need more of that and we are providing the funding to do that.</p> <p>  I mentioned something else to Deputy &Oacute; Broin earlier on in a response, which is that I want our local authorities and its our members to have transparency over what the targets are in their own areas which is important.  We all know that we have to deliver new homes for people across our social, affordable, private and cost rental sectors.     I believe it will be very significant if we can deliver and build more than 4,000 affordable homes this year basically from nothing, which I intend that we do.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the housing commission and the referendum.  The commission has been established and had its first meeting under the chairpersonship of John O&rsquo;Connor.  This will be a superb commission comprising a good group of people with a breadth of knowledge and experience.  Part of its terms of reference is to proceed with work on the provision of details for a referendum on housing.  It is something that we have committed to in the programme for Government and which I would like to see.  The commission, independently of me, will be working on that.  It is up and running and is doing that work already.</p> <p>  On social housing which the Deputy has also asked about, we set a new-build target of 9,000 houses in one year.  That will be very significant and will require all of our local authorities, including my Department, to be working together to deliver something that they have never come close to in recent years.  This is a significant jump up but the pipeline is good, not just for this year but for next year and into the future.  We need to be able to support that through resources.  That is why the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and I made the announcement in respect of additional housing staff, engineers, quantity surveyors and architects.  Those skills at local authority level right across the country are so important.  I hope I have responded to the points raised by the Deputy and I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I will take the next slot now. Deputy McAuliffe covered the Housing for All strategy and all of the work that went into that very well.  I will not go through that again.</p> <p>  I wanted to concentrate on water and water services, especially in programme B.  I note that if we do not look after our water supplies and wastewater treatment, one cannot have any houses or development.  Water is critical to that and I am glad to see the funding in place for that.</p> <p>  The Minister visited us in Wicklow at the official opening of the Vartry Water Treatment Plant there.  I note that the Environment Protection Agency has announced that 130,000 people have been taken off the remedial action list because of the investment in that facility.  That is critical.  </p> <p>  I also pay tribute here, while I have the opportunity, to Ned Fleming who is the caretaker of that facility and is an absolute legend in water treatment throughout Wicklow and no doubt across Ireland and I wish him well.  I do not know if he is retired but I believe he is headed in that direction.</p> <p>  I know that the river basin management plan is into phase 3 now.  I remember when that started way back in order that we could meet the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC.  That is also a positive.</p> <p>  The Arklow wastewater treatment plant is also a very significant investment in Arklow for which we have waited a very long time.  I see the latest photographs and we receive regular updates from Irish Water on that.  That site has been cleared now since the date we were down there for its official launch.  That will be critical to improving the quality of the water and the marine environment around Arklow and Arklow Harbour.  I remember many years ago when the investment was made in Shanganagh wastewater treatment plant, when I believe the former Minister, John Gormley, was in office.  That actually allowed Bray to win its blue flag back a number of years later.  </p> <p>  There are a whole range of benefits that accrue to society, including in health, tourism and quality of life, when one has good wastewater treatment and drinking water.  It is not something that gets attention much of the time because pipes in the ground are not things that really excite people too much but they are very important.</p> <p>  I wish to raise one issue on B.7, the legacy water environmental issues and possibly B.4, the rural water programme.  I have a situation in north Wicklow in an area that was once probably rural but because of urbanisation is now an urban area around which much housing has been built.  This relates to a number of houses which are on individual septic tanks and the mains foul water network is now running past.  What is in place for those areas, which would not be classed as rural as they are urban now but would have been rural at one stage, to try have these taken on board?  What funding does that come under?  Is it the rural water programme or does it come under legacy water environmental issues?</p></speech>

We now have a &euro;134 million investment into our wastewater treatment there.  There are many other such examples.  That is why it is important that we have the Irish Water programme of direct Exchequer funding of approximately &euro;4.9 billion over the next number of years, but where it has sight of its capital plan of &euro;6 billion between now and 2026.</p> <p>  To address the Chairman's question on a smaller settlement that has become urbanised, I expect those settlements to be dealt with where Irish Water has published its capacity plan and that these would be in its capital framework.  It is not necessarily a legacy issue.  It is an issue but I would not see it as falling under that programme and we will confirm the position there.</p> <p>  Very shortly, I am talking about a matter of weeks here, I intend to bring a programme forward that will partner with our local authorities in towns and villages, but mainly in villages and rural settlements that do not have any Irish Water wastewater infrastructure at all.</p><p>As part of the plan, the local authority would bring forward an acquired piece of land that has planning permission.  We would assess that piece, provide a grant to the local authority to tender and procure those works and, when the works are completed, then hand them over.  </p><p> For argument's sake, I visited communities such as Broadford, County Clare.  It is quite a substantial settlement with no wastewater treatment at all.  Unfortunately, there are approximately 665 settlements such as that all over the country.  We will not fix them all overnight.  However, I want to see a programme where Irish Water is advancing on one side and our local authorities can advance on the other.  </p><p> We will open a fund, which I referenced it in my opening statement, and the local authorities will bring forward shovel-ready projects.  I want stuff moving.  I do not want to be coming forward with a plan that will take a long time.  There are things we can do right now. </p><p> The level of investment in Irish Water by this Government is unprecedented.  The Chair is right, as well, in that without the freshwater and wastewater infrastructure, we will not be able to deliver the houses that we need.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, on his engagement with this committee during long committee sessions on the Maritime Area Planning Act that we passed last year.</p> <p>  In meeting our emissions targets, it is critical to have that planning framework in place, which we have now for the maritime area.  Offshore energy will be critical to us in meeting our energy demands.  Energy is so costly now, that when we achieve that energy resilience of having 5 GW of offshore wind in the east and a target of 30 GW over the next decade after that, it puts us on the path of not being dependent on fossil fuels.  </p> <p>  It is critical that MARA has the budget to get up and running quickly to do what it is set up to do, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be judging these planning applications that come in from maritime area planning and it is not something it has dealt with to a huge extent before.  Therefore, we need to ensure that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is sufficiently staffed and has a specialised maritime planning area office to deal with that.  Can the Minister briefly assure me that we are on top of that, as I only have about one minute left?</p></speech>

It was very significant that the legislation passed and is now an Act.  MARA, in skeletal form, will be established this year.  I expect it to be fully operational by 1 January 2023.  It is very important that we have a streamlined planning process to harness the resource of offshore wind for energy security and offshore renewables, in particular.</p> <p>  I approved the workforce plan in An Bord Plean&aacute;la for additional staff, who are now being recruited.  We will need more experts on the water side, in particular, and in relation to marine planning and development.  Those posts will be advertised very shortly.  We are already advertising for additional staff within An Bord Plean&aacute;la and there will be a very significant increase in its numbers.  </p> <p>  I am very confident we will have in MARA a single regulatory authority, for the first time ever, that will manage and regulate all of the things that happen within our maritime area, which is seven times the size of our land mass, and will help to reverse the decline in our marine biodiversity and be able to provide clean energy for our country on a secure basis.  We are well on track to doing that and having the planning framework in place that will underpin that.</p></speech>

First, I will ask about some of the headings in housing where there are reductions in expenditure for 2022 compared to 2021.  First, on subhead A25, in terms of the important area of rented accommodation inspection, not enough is being done in terms of rental inspections and enforcement.  What is the rationale in cutting it from &euro;12.5 million down to &euro;10 million, which is a 20% reduction?

I apologise, I am just trying to find it here.  Please bear with me for one second.</p> <p>  I will say a general point while I am getting that information for the Deputy.  We have substantially increased the investment in the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, year on year.  There was a very significant increase between 2020 and 2021.  If there is a small decrease into 2022, I will have to get that detail for the Deputy.  We approved, last year, the workforce plan for the RTB and we are putting in place a chief executive at assistant secretary level, which was a very significant step forward.  It is enhancing and improving the inspection regime that is there.  We are asking the RTB to do more now than we have ever done before, underpinned by way of legislation.</p> <p>  I will just have to double-check with regard to an overall small reduction.  Last year, &euro;10 million was made available to local authorities on that.  However, total expenditure on rent and inspections was &euro;2.763 million.  There was a reduction of physical inspections last year because of Covid.  Therefore, there were unspent funds in that space.  I will have to look at the overall figure.</p></speech>

It is the comparison of the 2021 Estimate with the 2022 Estimate.</p> <p>  On subhead A13 on page 179 of the Estimates, &euro;218 million is the Estimate on accommodation for homeless in 2021 and there is a reduction to &euro;194 million-----</p></speech>

If he looks at the out-turn in 2021 under rental inspections, the out-turn was approximately &euro;5.6 million.  It was significantly below what we targeted for.   Therefore, the estimate for this year is &euro;10.13 million, which would effectively be a near doubling of what was spent in 2021.</p></speech>

We will also expand the virtual inspections.  I expect more inspections.  We want to get to a stage where 25% of private rental properties are inspected on an annual basis.  Therefore, we have approved additional staff for the RTB, we approved the workforce plan and we have a new chief executive in place.  It is in good shape to do that.  If I were to allocate &euro;15 million this year, for argument's sake, I would want to make sure that those resources are going to be able to be used and we have the capacity to do it.

In the context of the budget, there was a minute surrender of in the region of &euro;19 million.  That is on the total Vote.  It is very small.  We expended what we said we would, though not in all the places we wanted because we had the construction shutdown and were impacted on delivery.  We reallocated in that space, particularly in voids.  We looked at activating existing properties and getting them back in.  It was a minute surrender, if that is the question the Deputy is asking, in the context of the overall Vote.</p></speech>

Will the Minister talk us through that reduction?  I have often raised quality in homeless emergency accommodation, especially in some of the privately run establishments.  Is there funding to have HIQA, for example, do inspections?  What is the Minister's view on that?</p></speech>

Maybe in the next round I can come back on that.  I will explain the expenditure piece.  Before Covid, we were spending about &euro;168 million on homeless services.  The additional funding we gave to bring it to over &euro;200 million were the Covid supports we needed to shield people and provide services.  The &euro;194 million is a significant increase on the pre-Covid years.  We are not seeing a like-for-like reduction.  We put in additional measures and expenditure will not be an issue.  My big focus is on helping many people who are homeless back into permanent accommodation and expanding Housing First for those with complex needs, including addiction, mental health and others.  A total of 1,300 new tenancies in that space will be underpinned by what we are doing.   It is a significant increase on the pre-Covid year of 2019.  I will come back on standards, which I would like to talk about.</p></speech>

They have hit the ground running.  In particular, over the last quarter and the start of 2022 we have seen real success in the battle against the housing crisis.</p> <p>  The Minister is the bainisteoir and is here with his bainisteoir c&uacute;nta and my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is not here because I wanted to pay tribute to the work he is doing in heritage.  I have seen first hand small community groups heartened by the enthusiasm he has shown.  I hope the message can be passed on to him.  Though the Minister is the figurehead, it is important to acknowledge the team in the Custom House.  We can see the amount of work and effort gone into the Housing for All plan.  It is clear to see there is a fantastic team behind the Minister and we look forward to the results over the next three years or so.</p> <p>  I was heartened in the last week to see our first Fresh Start success in Longford in a matter of five weeks.  We can be cynical about these things sometimes but to see that coming through so quickly was a ringing endorsement of the work being done in the Department.  Everybody involved has to be commended.  It was great to hear that woman who thought she would never get her life back on track after a difficult separation get equity in a Dublin property and started her life again in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  It will come as no surprise that I will ask about affordable housing and Housing for All.  Affordable housing cannot be just centred on Dublin and the big metropolitan centres.  The Minister already has his housing delivery plans across the 31 council areas.  Is there a dedicated component and target for affordable housing in each of those delivery plans?  On engagement with local authorities at this stage on affordable housing, will the Minister indicate how many local authorities are actively engaging?  He will appreciate I am obsessed with one local authority, namely, Longford, but I still get a sense it will be difficult for those counties to get it over the line.  I cannot tell the Minister enough how real an issue affordable housing is across the country.  If we do not tackle it in rural areas and provincial towns, we will not tackle it nationwide.  </p> <p>  Where are we in relation to the launch of the affordable purchase shared equity scheme?  When will it be ready?  It is not clearly set out but I assume that is just for new builds.  If we are struggling to get affordable housing up and running in rural Ireland, there is an opportunity for some counties to tweak that to include second-hand house purchases and enable people hanging on for affordable housing to get onto the property ladder.  I am not looking for it nationwide but a specific and targeted approach across a number of counties might be worthwhile.  </p> <p>  The Chair spoke about Irish Water, which is an area of expertise for him.  There are concerns across the country about Irish Water.  Irish Water today revealed a figure of &euro;13 million for the cost of repairs and leaks in Longford over the past two years.  That is, on average, just under &euro;18,000 a day being spent on leaks and repairs.  At the same time, we are struggling to see that body put in place a decent infrastructure to allow the local authority move ahead with its plans.</p> <p>  I welcome the non-seweraged villages initiative and the Minister's plans to work with local authorities.  For example, for a town like Ballymahon that is maxed out in terms of its capacity, will there by an opportunity for the local county council to come up with a proposal on the basis that Irish Water's capital plan is unlikely to deliver a solution for that town for the next three to five years?  Is there an opportunity for the council to come to the Minister with its own bespoke plan and seek funding?</p></speech>

Towns and villages that have existing treatment plants will not apply for that fund.  I want to get this up and running.  I think it can have an impact.  The regular capital plan can apply there.  I can talk to the Deputy separately about that.</p> <p>  He is 100% right and the affordability measures being brought forward do not just relate to Dublin, Cork or the main cities.  I signed off on the first number of affordable purchase homes by way of advance purchase arrangements today.  I cannot tell the Deputy where they are but they are outside Dublin and Leinster.  I want to see the spread across the country.</p> <p>  The first home shared equity scheme will apply to all first-time buyers or buyers under the Fresh Start principle.  I welcome what the Deputy said on Fresh Start.  It is a principle that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and I, as well as our Government, absolutely believe in.  Someone who has had a change in life circumstances, gone through personal insolvency or is starting again should be supported and will be through the measures we are bringing forward as a Government, like we have done with the changes to the local authority affordable housing loan.  We have made significant changes there for singles.  </p> <p>  The first home shared equity scheme will apply to new builds, first and foremost.  I do not envisage a change.  That will start at the end of quarter 2 and be operational at the beginning of quarter 3.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages fund will be a opportunity for vacant properties in our regions.  Young and not-so-young couples and Fresh Start and other individuals will get assistance in refurbishing a property to bring it back to use should they wish to live in it.  We are targeting initially 2,500 homes.  We want to see how it works and if we need to change it, we will do so.  I am excited about that initiative.  It will make a major difference but we will need to manage it.  I expect the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages fund to be announced this quarter, that is, quarter 1.</p></speech>

It is important that this topic is being put front and centre.  Last year, the first quarterly report of the Housing for All plan showed that, last year, building commenced on 30,000 homes.  That was a high since 2008.  There were 39,000 planning permission grants for homes.  They are really important figures because they show that the tide is starting to turn.  They show that delivery is happening as a result of investment and plans.  The foundations for homes are being built every year.  The Minister did a fantastic politician's job of sidestepping one of my questions earlier, so I will ask it again.</p></speech>

I am only joking.  The question relates to the affordable housing regulations, which I know are coming down the tracks.  I stress that as we are putting together these plans, we do so in a way that allows couples to plan for their future in order that they can aspire to purchase a home that they would be purchasing on the open market at an affordable rate.  I want to make sure that we are planning and providing stability for young couples who opt for the affordable housing options.  I will hand over my remaining three and a half minutes to the Minister to give him the opportunity to say what these Estimates for &euro;4 billion mean to people who are struggling in the housing market and how it will help them this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#J00400"><p>I thank Deputy Higgins.  I did not mean to sidestep her question.  To answer it, the affordable purchase regulations will be published in the coming weeks, in March.  Some work is being done on it.  The cost-rental regulations have been published already.  We need to tell people the parameters within which they need to operate.  As I said to Deputy Flaherty, the first home shared equity scheme will be initiated at the end of the second quarter and operational at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>  The &euro;4 billion means that people who have been waiting for years on the social housing list will see a ramping up of new-build delivery through our partners in approved housing bodies and local authorities, to provide over 9,000 new builds per year and to get it up to 10,000.  We will also allow for elements of acquisition and a small element of leasing, because real families have been waiting for these homes.  That will provide capacity of 90,000 social homes for us to start making progress on the lists.</p> <p>  People who are working, saving, renting and so on now have a couple of options.  Cost rental did not exist 12 months ago.  We focused on passing the Affordable Housing Act.  Tenants are in place, with more receiving tenancies in Leixlip and there will be tenants on Enniskerry Road, which is the first local authority scheme.  There is a group of nine different schemes, which I have not published yet, which will be delivered this year too.  There are hundreds of new, safe and secure tenancies for real people at 40% to 50% below market rates.  Policy and plans are important but there is nothing more important than delivery in order that people can see this is actually changing.  On the affordable housing side, we will have directly-built, local authority-led affordable homes, with people buying them this year.  The first is in Boherboy, Cork, followed shortly by Dun Emer, Lusk, and there will be more.  We need to build capacity in the local authority sector to do that.  It will not be able to deliver hundreds or thousands this year.  We will supplement that through the LDA, which we are funding, and through the first home shared equity scheme.  An individual or young couple will now be able to bridge that gap of unaffordability.  The State is rightly saying that it backs homeownership and will help people to own homes.  We want that for younger people.  We have to keep working to ensure that happens.  We may have to adjust as we progress.  We have a real plan, with real money, and we will see real delivery this year.  We will build on that as we go into 2023.</p></speech>

The message that this Government backs homeownership is critical.  I began earlier by talking about the need for a plan, for political will and for investment.  It has been made utterly clear this evening that we have all of those.  We have a costed plan, the level of investment that we need, and the political will to tackle this and deliver real change for families who need it.</p></speech>

There was an underspend on the social housing budget this year.  Is the Minister in a position to give us the final new-build social housing delivery number for last year and a breakdown of the number of direct deliveries and turnkey housing by local authorities and approved bodies?  Does the Minister have a sense, from looking at the pipeline in local authorities, of the breakdown between direct delivery versus turnkey housing for the new-build target for this year?</p></speech>

Turnkey housing is ground-up delivery of public homes on public land.  I know the Deputy agrees with that.  I think we will give as much detail on that as we can.

The Minister knows that there was a lot of anger at the last-minute construction of the sliding scale at the end of last year.  Families on the western seaboard have expressed anger about two aspects of the terms of reference agreed between the Department and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, for remediation with regard to the 2007 building standards and the exclusion of foundations.  I have two related questions.  It is unclear from the memorandum published this week whether the sliding scale is now off the table.  Will the Minister confirm that?  Can the 2007 building regulations and foundations where they might be defective be considered for inclusion?</p> <p>  The key thing is to pass the legislation and to open the revised scheme this year, albeit with the proper amendments.  Does the Minister have a date to publish the general scheme?  Is he confident that, with the support of the committee, he will pass the legislation and have a scheme with the regulations in place before the end of the year?</p></speech>

This is complex legislation.  Much work is happening in the Office of the Attorney General in this regard.  I hope to publish the general scheme in March.  In fairness, committee members have offered to co-operate to expedite its passage through the committee, D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We need to pass the legislation by the summer recess.  I believe that the current scheme exists on quite tenuous grounds because it only exists under the previous Act.  We need primary legislation.  It is advancing well.  I will keep the committee advised of it.  I am aiming for March.  We need to start progressing it.  If we need amendments on Committee Stage, we can do that too.  I corresponded with residents again today.  I am committed to bringing forward and building on the enhancements that we brought to the existing scheme of &euro;2.2 billion.</p></speech>

On Traveller accommodation, I acknowledge that the money has been spent for two years in a row, which is very positive.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister of State gave me a detailed written answer recently showing how only 70 units of accommodation had been provided between the various schemes.  No new units were provided by 13 local authorities.  How can we ensure this year and next year not only that the money is spent but that the bulk of it is spent on new or upgraded accommodation because that is what the bulk of that money is meant to be for?</p></speech>

We must do this in a number of ways.  I have been liaising strongly with the local authorities as I go around the country visiting sites.  There is a very significant capital programme in Cork that I expect and hope to see commence this year.  I have been down there on the ground trying to progress the programme.  I have carried it forward through all local authorities as much as I can but it is a significant challenge.  I must be honest about that.  As we work through the expert group, we will hopefully have significant changes in how we go about delivering Traveller accommodation through the programme of work the group has set out.  It will be a challenge but that will not be for the want of energy and commitment on my part as I try to drive this forward.</p></speech>

I am substituting for a committee member.  I have a number of questions on Vote 34 specifically.  Some are for the Minister and others for the Minister of State.  I note a further &euro;275.8 million in capital has been carried over from 2021.  I am assuming that is related to an underspend caused by the pandemic.  It is also noted that a little over &euro;92 million will be available from the Local Government Fund.</p> <p>  Turning specifically to the &euro;2.53 billion allocated for expenditure, there is, I believe, a figure for programme B, which is water.  The Chairman mentioned Arklow but I am also conscious of water quality in Dublin Bay.  Irish Water has a particular programme under way for refurbishing and improving treatment plants.  Is funding provided for that in programme B, under capital to Irish Water?</p> <p>  Programme F deals with conservation.  There are various conservation funds, including the historical structures fund, the architectural structures fund and the annual funds administered by the local authorities.  Are they included in programme F.  Subhead F11 deals with climate adaptation.  Is there an increase in funding under that subhead?</p></speech>

The citizens' assembly on Dublin is very welcome.  Does the cost of that come from the Department's budget or the budget of the Department of the Taoiseach?  I inquire also about the establishment of the electoral commission.  There is a lot in that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#K01500"><p>I thank both Deputies for their questions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is driving forward the electoral commission.  Art O&rsquo;Leary, the former Secretary General to the President, is moving to the commission and we want to get it established.  I expect and hope the Bill will come to the committee in this quarter.  It will be significant legislation.  We have a census this year as well.  There will be a requirement for a boundary review of D&aacute;il constituencies and we want the commission established to have input into that.  I will have to check with my officials on the citizens' assembly.  Citizens' assemblies are generally initiated in the Department of the Taoiseach.  I welcome the announcement in that regard.  Citizens' assemblies have worked very well.</p> <p>  Deputy Devlin asked a number of questions.  On Irish Water specifically, I visited the Ringsend facility for the opening of the second plant, which is the second biggest plant in the country.  It will make a major difference to water quality in the Dublin Bay region.  The plant has been commissioned and is up and running.  Its capacity is expanding by close to 500,000 population equivalent, PE.  Further work is being done on one plant with regard to storm water run-off and so forth.  There is much we can do in that regard.  Investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in the coming years is unprecedented and is now allocated on a multi-annual basis in order that we do this better.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a couple of questions on heritage funds.  He may have missed our comments on that in the opening statements.  Funding has increased significantly in 2022.  The historical structures fund is in place and will fund about 100 projects.  More than 150 projects across the country, many of which I have been able to visit, will be funded under the community monuments fund.  What is great about that fund is that it gets local communities involved with their local history.  Local authorities and their heritage officers have done a superb job bringing people on board with them.  In some instances, the amounts of money involved are small but they make a massive difference to local communities and generate interest in history and the sites on our doorsteps that most of us did not know about before the pandemic.  During the pandemic, people became far more in tune with their local areas.</p> <p>  Under subhead F11, &euro;200,000 has been allocated to progress relevant actions under the climate change sectoral adaptation plan for built and architectural heritage.  That has been incorporated into the climate action plan 2021.  Those actions will be overseen by the National Monuments Service and the built heritage policy, which will look at examples of best practice in this area, while ensuring everything we do is compliant with our climate change strategy.</p></speech>

The new standards the Dublin Regional Homelessness Executive, DRHE, has drawn up for private, for-profit providers of emergency accommodation are clearly informed by HIQA.  HIQA is the body with the experience and expertise in inspecting areas and settings where people may be vulnerable and need care and support.  That should certainly be the case with emergency accommodation for the homeless.  People should get support but in some circumstances that is not the case.  Will HIQA be appointed to do that?  It is critically important.  It would cut out many of the problems in that sector.  I would like the Minster's view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#K01700"><p>We have discussed this matter a number of times.  I am glad the Deputy continues to highlight it.  I have established the national homeless action committee, as he knows.  I want standards in this area, especially private emergency accommodation, dealt with.  The Deputy mentioned the DRHE's new standards for emergency accommodation, which focus on private emergency accommodation.  They are an adaptation of the national quality standards framework, NQSF, standards.</p><p>It is a question of their application and of the wraparound services.  I was on outreach myself recently and, from talking to people who are out on the ground, I believe that we may not have the same level of wraparound services in some private emergency accommodation as we have in the State-run sector.  That needs to be addressed.  The situation is improving on where it was.  I know that from talking to practitioners on the ground and from going out with the outreach teams.  </p><p> To be honest, we can do better in that space.  That is why I am very focused on the homelessness action committee, which is not just made up of officials from my Department.  That is very important.  It also includes representatives from the Departments of Justice and Health and I chair it.  All of the main NGOs have also agreed to be part of it.  That is a standing committee within Government.  The new standards are welcome but it is a question of their application.  If there is an easier way to do it, perhaps through the standards being applied directly by HIQA, I am not opposed to that.  I want to get there.  I have been told that the lead-in time to do that would be quite extensive.  I have to work with partners to see how we can do that.  </p><p> Obviously, we all want to see a reduction in the use of emergency accommodation.  We have changes in the demographics of the individuals and families who are accessing emergency accommodation, which makes it quite difficult to plan with regard to our capacity.  That is why it is important that the Departments of Health and Justice, Tusla and others are involved in this process.  I chair the committee myself.  We have to ensure that all of those people have security, standards and wraparound services.  I met a gentleman last week who will not go into hostels in Dublin.  He had been beaten up twice.  When he was sleeping out in Dublin, he was beaten up for a cigarette.  I have visited really good own-room hostels that have their own lockers, good services and nurses and doctors on board but not every hostel is at that standard.  It is our challenge to achieve that.  Our real challenge is to make sure the young lad I met last week has a safe place to live.  He is working away.  There are others with very complex needs.  That is why the expansion of Housing First is also really important.</p></speech>

It is important that he acknowledged that we could do a lot better in some of those areas.  Exactly as the Minister said, there are people who actually feel safer on the street than in some of the very badly run private emergency accommodation out there.  There are different standards between different operators.  As the Minister said, the survey done by Mendicity showed that more than 90% of those in private emergency accommodation who were surveyed had either been assaulted or robbed in private emergency accommodation.  It is appalling that people are in that vulnerable situation in accommodation funded by the State, albeit not run by the State.  As the Minister said, it is important to have the standards but it is their application that matters.  There is no one better to ensure they are applied and to carry out inspections than HIQA.</p></speech>

It is important.  I was with Mendicity every week and met people who are accessing its services.  When somebody comes out of a hostel, they may unfortunately get beaten up on the street.  That is the challenge but there is no question but that we can do better in certain areas.  The application of standards, inspections and wraparound services are really important.</p></speech>

Has the Minister asked the local authorities whether they have enough staff, particularly in the area of affordable housing?  Are their requests being met?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.1226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022021000002#L00500"><p>That is a good question.  We are engaging with them.  I have more housing summits with local authorities the week after next.  We have approved another 250 posts across the 31 local authorities for the housing delivery teams.  To look at the figures for whole-time equivalents, actual staff, for 2020 - I do not have the full-year figures for 2021 - we had 29,366 staff in local authorities.  That was up from 26,800 in 2016, so we are going in the right direction.  We need more housing staff like quantity surveyors, engineers, draughtspeople and so on.  We have helped our local authorities to build up their housing delivery teams and we continue to do so.  That forms part of their housing delivery plans.  We have given the resources that have been looked for so far because I wanted the local authorities to be able to deliver the affordable and social homes we need.</p></speech>

I note the references to the work the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has done.  He has really engaged with this committee.  We have gone through the Bills on electoral reform and the mayor for Limerick.  We are going through the Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill at the moment.  I note subhead F8, which relates to peatlands restoration, conservation and management.  I am once again talking about carbon emissions.  What the restoration of our peatlands can do for us with regard to carbon sequestration is absolutely incredible.  It also provides jobs in those midland areas.  It is about the natural management of water, which can aid in addressing the flooding we often see in midland areas.  That is key and I am glad to see that budget is there.  It is worth &euro;10.2 million, for a total of &euro;13.8 million.</p> <p>  There is funding of &euro;85 million under the energy efficiency subhead.  I assume this is in addition to the funding for retrofitting announced by Government yesterday, that massive &euro;8 billion.</p></speech>

We are targeting approximately 2,400 units.</p></speech>

That is critical.  The message went out loud and clear yesterday that there is a whole range of supports available.  There is the 100% grant, the 80% grant for smaller works and the grant of up to 50% for large-scale jobs.  There was also mention of the Land Development Agency, LDA.  The chair designate, Cormac O'Rourke, came into us recently.  We had a really good session with the LDA and many of us left confident of the work it will do.  It is a critical agency with regard to managing the land and pulling it together.  The land aspect has always been key in making housing affordable.</p> <p>  I will move to planning and the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF.  The Minister has visited many parts of the country to see the benefits that fund has brought about.  Local authorities need to have the funding in place to develop a pipeline because it costs them money to design these projects so they are ready for when the funding grants are announced.  I hope that local authorities have a small amount of funding to develop their plans so that, when funding is announced, they are shovel-ready and ready to go.  I hope that is in place.</p> <p>  On energy efficiency and retrofitting, the planning exemption for solar panels is critical.  We are coming into the sunny season now.  There are megawatts of potential power up there in the sun.  We could have panels on every school building, community building, farm building and church building out there to generate energy predominantly for on-site use, but with the ability to feed back into the grid.  That work on microgeneration is due shortly.  I have covered a lot.  I do not know whether the Minister can answer some of those questions.  I am conscious that he needs to go at 8 p.m.</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, may want to come in on some points.  With regard to the URDF, work has been done in the Chairman's constituency of Wicklow, specifically Wicklow town.  I have seen the work there.  Public realm work has been completed in Tralee and Ennis.  There are some fantastic projects there.  We need to see ground being broken on those projects.  There are some very significant projects, such as those on the north quays in Waterford and on the quays in Cork, that will really drive regeneration forward to support commercial investment and people living in our towns and villages, which is something the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has been working very hard on.  Some &euro;1.7 billion has been allocated across hundreds of very significant projects right across the country.  We expect to have another round of URDF funding this year.  We support the local authorities in making their plans.  The Chairman will see where they are phased.  In Balbriggan in my own constituency, Fingal County Council applied for funding to do the detailed planning that allowed them to unlock an additional &euro;25 million to rejuvenate the town centre and the harbour in the town.  There is immense potential there.  We want to see more and more projects commencing and then concluding so we can move forward to the next round.</p><p>The Minister of State may wish to speak on the solar panel piece.  It is something that we are absolutely committed to.  It is awaiting a strategic environmental assessment.</p></speech>

We are working very hard to progress it.  I know it has to go through the environmental thresholds, but we expect to have it shortly.</p></speech>

Obviously, under Housing for All additional tranches of land have been handed over to the agency under its responsibility to deliver a further 15,000 homes.  This year is a most important year for the LDA.  We will see it delivering homes this year.  We will see it breaking ground on Shanganagh Castle and the LDA proving concept being capitalised by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  That will be matched by additional borrowings.  We have increased its borrowing capacity to allow it to move forward with Project Tosaigh, which is about activating dormant planning permissions.  There will be a real focus on affordable, social and cost-rental homes.  The vehicle to deliver cost rental at scale into the future may very well be the LDA.  The members met the new chairman, Mr. O'Rourke.  There is a really good management team in place there.  They are really focused.  I am encouraging them every day to make sure that they deliver in 2022.</p></speech>
