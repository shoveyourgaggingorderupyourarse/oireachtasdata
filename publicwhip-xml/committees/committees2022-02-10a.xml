I begin by welcoming witnesses and members to the meeting.  While Covid-19 restrictions are receding, and while it is open to members and witnesses to attend meetings in person, I ask that they continue to use face coverings.  When addressing the committee, face coverings can be removed.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.</p> <p>  This morning, we engage with the officials from National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to examine the national broadband plan, NBP, expenditure and related matters in the context of the 2020 appropriation accounts, Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications.  The meeting will be suspended for an hour at 12.30 p.m.  When we resume at 1.30 p.m., we will engage with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, to examine the national broadband plan expenditure and related matters further.</p> <p>  NBI has been advised that the committee may wish to examine the following matters related to expenditure on the national broadband plan during the course of the engagement: the impact of the pandemic on delivery; NBI's financial structures; the current progress and timelines; subcontracting arrangements; lease and rental of infrastructure from other companies; and penalty clauses in the contract.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from NBI: Mr. Peter Hendrick, CEO, Mr. T.J. Malone, chief executive officer of deployment, Ms Tara Collins, chief marketing officer, Mr. Barry Kelly, chief financial officer and Ms Jenny Fisher, chief legal officer.  They are all very welcome.  When we begin to engage, I will ask those who are attending remotely to mute themselves when not contributing, so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those who are in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or are switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation for anything they say in the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witness' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or of a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The CEO, Mr. Hendrick, is very welcome.  As is detailed in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes.  I know he has a longer statement, which has been circulated to members.  I ask that he keep within that timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#A00600"><p>I will.  I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation to discuss the national broadband plan today.  I am the CEO of National Broadband Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. T.J. Malone, who is CEO of NBI Deployment and who leads the team that is building the NBI network.  In addition, we have senior management teams: Ms Tara Collins, who is responsible for marketing communications; Mr. Barry Kelly from finance; and Ms Jenny Fisher on governance and who is the interface with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The team and I know from our work with other Oireachtas committees that it can be challenging to convey the size, scale, and complexity of the NBP from a boardroom setting.  Therefore, we have instigated a programme of field trips to show first-hand how the NBI network is being deployed.  The sessions have been widely recognised as informative and helpful.  For this reason, there remains an open invitation to all committee members to experience the work of our teams out in the field.</p> <p>  As CEO of NBI, I remain incredibly proud of the work our team is delivering, particularly against the backdrop of turbulent conditions caused by Covid-19.  NBI has been operating for 25 months, 23 of which have been under the shadow of the pandemic.  I believe that, despite the extreme and turbulent conditions faced throughout the project to date, the work of our team provides a platform that gives us confidence to deliver the project on time and on budget.  Our team has now scaled, with construction active across all 26 counties and more than 1,200 people hired, onboarded and working on the project.  That includes our specialist subcontractors, the likes of Integro, Indigo, KN Group, Secto, Actavo and TLI.  We are also working with infrastructure operators such as Open Eir and Enet.  I acknowledge all of the hard work that has been done by everybody involved to date, as well as the collective commitment to bring high-speed broadband to those who need it most.</p> <p>  Across the project, we have already made major achievements.  More than 298,000 premises have been surveyed, of which in excess of 252,000 have been designed or are in detail design.  These activities are vital precursors to the main build and they are continuing at pace.  More than 54,500 premises are currently able to place their order via their preferred retail service provider.  There are in excess of 154,000 premises that have been constructed or are under construction.  For context, the original plan would have seen us at approximately 180,000 premises under construction at this stage in the programme.  We have now awarded contracts to our build partners for more than 195,000 premises, which includes network build due for completion in first half of 2023.  A total of 475 broadband connection points, including schools, have been installed by NBI.  We have also increased our minimum speed from 150 Mbps to in excess of 500 Mbps, as well as offering 1 Gb and now 2 Gb products.  We recently announced that we are delivering high-speed broadband infrastructure to six islands off the coast of Donegal and Mayo, two of which were completed in January.  More than 50 retail service providers have already signed up to sell services on the NBI network, ensuring an increased range of products, all being offered at competitive prices for consumers.</p> <p>  As I have just mentioned, in excess of 154,000 premises either have been constructed or are under construction.  We believe this metric is the leading indicator for delivering the programme.  For context, the equivalent figure this time last year was approximately 19,000.  Therefore, it can be seen how this is ramping up and how it will directly feed into premises passed and connection numbers in time.  Additionally, we are implementing a series of initiatives that lend confidence to the delivery of the 2022 programme and beyond, including, but not limited to, the fact we have contracted with Eir to increase the volume of pole replacement and duct insulation, which commenced on 1 October 2021.</p> <p>  Turning to other matters, I can appreciate some recent media attention on the shareholder structure of NBI may have concerned members of the committee.  We endeavoured to clarify these matters in a transparent and open way at an Oireachtas joint committee two weeks ago.  We welcome the opportunity to attend today to provide further clarifications.  Consequently, I would like to clarify the following points.  The ownership structure remains as it was at the signing of the contract.  The shareholders of NBI Infrastructure DAC and NBI Deployment DAC are Metallah Limited and the Minister, who holds a special share with certain consent rights in respect of NBI Infrastructure DAC and NBI Deployment DAC.  The shareholder of Metallah Limited is Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited.  Above Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited, there are holding companies and investment vehicles into which the various investors have invested at different levels.  This structure would not be unusual in the context of a major infrastructure project with a series of international investors.  David McCourt, via voting rights in each tier of the company's structure, retains control of NBI.</p> <p>  On the potential for bringing in new investors to the project, I would clarify the following.  As the risk profile of the project evolves, it is likely that some of our early stage investors, who helped to turn NBI from an idea into reality at a point when there was still much unquantifiable risk in the project, will be replaced with investors who specialise in long-term investments.  This has always been the plan and is the reason that mechanisms for change of ownership are allowed in the contract, subject to approval from the Department, as is standard practice in such long-term contracts.</p><p> The corporate structure as it is today or into the future will not change NBI&rsquo;s contractual commitments or collective goal, delivering the infrastructure that will radically transform the country&rsquo;s broadband landscape.  Any new investors will be required to step into the proportional share of the shareholders' funding commitments.  The shift to new investors, who will bring this long-term capital, will not cost the people of Ireland or the State any additional money and will not impact on the day-to-day operations of the business.</p></speech>

His script is available to members, and they have read the rest of it.</p> <p>  The lead speaker this morning is Deputy O'Connor.  He has swapped with Deputy Devlin.  Deputy O'Connor has 15 minutes and the other speakers will each have ten.  I will give the Deputy a reminder after 12 minutes.  We will break for ten minutes at 11 a.m. approximately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00300"><p>I welcome the representatives from NBI and thank them for appearing before the committee.  For the purposes of full disclosure, I have met all of them previously through the other Oireachtas committee.  I was also on one of the field trips.  I found it was helpful to go and see the work being done.  It helped me develop a better understanding of what NBI is doing.  However, the job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to scrutinise the financial aspects of these deals.</p> <p>  How does NBI make a profit?  I ask Mr. Hendrick to keep an eye on the time because it is precious.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00400"><p>NBI&rsquo;s profit ultimately comes from the revenue we generate from the network -  the take-up of customers connecting to the network.  We are a wholesale operator.  We sell services to retail operators, which many consumers know in terms of their broadband, television or voice services.  It is the connection of those end users whether it is homes or businesses, including farms, and the revenue we generate from those retail operators that connect those homes, where we generate our revenue and ultimately our profit.  The profitability of the network is dependent on our operations costs versus the revenue we take in.  The objective of this subsidy is entirely about building the infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00500"><p>Is it correct that NBI and its shareholders are not making any profit from approximately &euro;2.6 billion in public money approved under EU state aid rules or is it part of the overall set-up of the organisation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00600"><p>It is entirely funded towards the build of the project; it is not about shareholder return.  The subsidy goes to specific categories, what we call permitted expenditure, which is all about the building of the network and the infrastructure that we are delivering in the national broadband plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00700"><p>Is Mr. Hendrick in a position to outline how much it costs NBI on average to install broadband in a home?  How many homes are in the intervention areas?  I think it is approximately 500,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00800"><p>When the contract became effective in January 2020, there were 537,000 premises.  Today there are 554,000 premises.  Even though the number of premises is going up, there is no additional subsidy allocated.  We are still required to deliver the project within that subsidy envelope.  On average, we estimate it is just over &euro;2,000 to pass a home.  Obviously, there is a subsidy associated.  That is just building the infrastructure putting the cable on the poles or under the ground to pass the home.  Then there is a cost in connecting homes.  The cost in connecting homes can be an average of &euro;2,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#B00900"><p>That is interesting.  I thank Mr. Hendrick.  A very good investigation was carried out into the NBI deal by <i>The Currency</i>.  I give the people there credit for the work they have done.  One of the issues they raised is that when this was originally proposed, approximately &euro;220 million was promised in equity to NBI by shareholders, which, I think, has turned into about &euro;100 million in debt.  Why were the original promises by investors not honoured?  Can Mr. Hendrick give the committee any details on that matter?</p></speech>

So, that is the contract.  However, between the company and the shareholders there is a commitment of &euro;223 million to support our working capital requirements.  In terms of equity and shareholder loans, from a corporate finance perspective, they are viewed as being one and the same.  That would be very typical of infrastructure projects, including State-funded infrastructure projects in terms of putting in money between equity and shareholder loans.</p></speech>

In December 2021, our shareholders invested an additional &euro;20 million and the expectation is that there will be additional funds drawn down in Q4 of 2022.</p></speech>

It is about the building of the network.  Up to the end of December, we had received &euro;177 million in subsidy.  We can only claim that subsidy on achievement of milestones.  When we achieve those milestones, that gets referenced against specific permitted expenditure.  The permitted expenditure needs to have been audited and verified.  All the invoices, largely to do with our build contractors' materials we are buying and infrastructure that we are building out, making ready or repairing, are assessed and verified by our own financial team.  Our internal auditors do an assessment of that, as do our external auditors.  Equally, the Department has its own advisers, EY, who assess all those invoices.  When all of that is done and all the verification on the permitted expenditure is done, when we have achieved a milestone, there is an independent certifier that certifies we have achieved the milestone and all the permitted expenditure is signed off and applicable to the subsidies we receive.  There is quite a diligent independent assurance process around all our subsidy receipts.</p></speech>

That is why I am asking the question.  It is interesting that we do not have an answer to it yet.  I will be interested to see the answer.</p> <p>  Originally, more than 600,000 homes were to be connected prior to the creation of the current entity, NBI.  There was an agreed reduction for that to happen.  I want to make sure that I have my figures correct.  The original target set down by Government was approximately 927,000 homes being installed.  NBI currently has a contract for 542,000 homes.  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

The definition of high-speed broadband then was anything above 30 Mbps.  Any premises with less than that speed was deemed to be in the intervention or amber area.  The overall number in that category was 900,000.  As the programme of procurement and bidding continued, the Department continually engaged with the industry concerning activity around the construction of commercial networks.  In 2016, Eir announced it was going to complete 300,000 premises, predominantly in townland areas, by replacing its old copper-based network with one based on fibre.  Ultimately, that network would deliver more than the 30 Mbps speed to those homes.  In the final consultation run by the Department in quarter 4 of 2019, the final assessment for the overall number of premises at that stage was 537,000.</p></speech>

Is that a concern for NBI?</p></speech>

We looked at this aspect of alternative technologies in 2018 and 2019.  We explored where the market for low-orbit satellite technology was going and that for 5G.  Considering the future-proofing of fibre technology, it was intended originally that we would have launched with 150 Mbps.  The benchmark in urban areas became 500 Mbps.  In this context, it is important to remember that the purpose of the NBP is to provide equality in broadband access across the country between urban and rural areas.  In urban areas, 500 Mbps is now the minimum benchmark product.  We moved our product to that standard.  The network we have built and are building supports speeds of up to 10 Gbps being delivered to homes, without replacing any equipment.  We can undertake a software upgrade to bring that speed up to 25 Gbps, which will involve replacing a small box in homes and that can be posted out.  The fibre technology itself, the capacity we are building into the fibre network and the way we are designing and engineering that network will support many hundreds of Gbps of capacity way into the future.  We have looked at this over a horizon beyond 25 years.</p></speech>

What impact has the pandemic had on NBI's roll-out of broadband?  How much has it slowed it down?  Has any analysis been done concerning set targets that have not been met during the last two years?  I am not trying to damage any of the work NBI is doing, but it would be interesting for us to get an idea of what type of a knock-on impact Covid-19 has had on the roll-out.</p></speech>

We talk about surveys happening on the ground in respect of testing poles and testing duct to ensure it is clear to install cable.  We were significantly behind in doing surveys, but we have now recovered in that area.  We have put more surveyors into the field and we are ahead now.  It is the same with designs, where we had a challenge in getting designers onto the programme.  We have now put more designers into the programme and we are now ahead there as well.  Equally, we are ahead with the connections.  We have more contractors trying to get more homes connected.</p> <p>  The building programme is, of course, the most significant part of the challenge.  We have more than 1,000 people actually building the network.  Concerning the issue of the impact of Covid-19 and close contacts, we have teams of between four and six people.  Therefore, if one person contracts Covid-19, that has a significant impact on the programme.  What we are doing to recover in that regard is that we are increasing the number of make-ready activities happening.  Eir has increased its volumes since October.  The intent is that it will double the capacity in respect of the number of poles it will replace annually.  Eir will also increase the amount of underground duct it is going to install from 1,500 km to 2,500 km annually.</p> <p>  Regarding the background, we had originally planned to deliver this project with two contractors.  We now have four contractors on the ground, and we are also looking to bring additional contractors on board to increase our activity and the volume of completions annually.  To give some context concerning where we stand today, in the first two months of this year we will be installing enough cable every month to get from here to Paris.  Those figures will increase as the number of contractors working on the project and the number of builds increase.  If it may be helpful, Mr. Malone can give more detail or answer further questions.</p></speech>

We must provide specific evidence of what those delays are.  Regarding the details in respect of surveys, design and engagement with contractors, our own auditors have been reviewing all the data we get back.  We verify what is a delay not of NBI's making.  We verify what is, in circumstances of relief, related to Covid-19, and then what delays are not related to a relief context.  In the case where relief applies, we get time extensions.  We do not get financial compensation.  Our imperative, therefore, is to increase the volume of activity to try to catch up on those delays.  We do not, however, get compensated in this regard.  Our milestones stay as they are, and we must deliver the network to achieve subsidies.</p></speech>

I would like to go through this detail.  It was well covered in a D&aacute;il debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on 27 January.  I am sure Mr. Hendrick has had sight of that.  In responding to my questions, it was interesting - and I am sure it is okay for me to quote the Official Record - that the Minister of State said that, &quot;There has been an impact from Covid-19&quot;.  The Minister of State acknowledged that context, but said it was &quot;not the entire story&quot;.  He continued by saying: &quot;Part of the problem is the contractor's fault.  Part of the delay comes simply from the natural things&quot;.  He went on to say, though:</p> <blockquote> 	I would expect that at least a portion of the delays are the fault of NBI.  It may believe it is the fault of its subcontractors and may try to attribute blame, but that does not excuse it because it is not in a position to abdicate its responsibility. </blockquote> <p>Mr. Hendrick has acknowledged that.  The Minister of State continued his response by saying NBI &quot;must take responsibility, even in a situation where it has delegated authority for some of its functions&quot;.  What does Mr. Hendrick think the Minister of State meant when he said that &quot;a portion of the delays are the fault of NBI&quot;?  Will he outline that to me?</p></speech>

The original plan was to allow for a mobilisation period.  Part of the reason the delay penalties would not start until 1 February 2022 was to allow for that mobilisation period.  It was intended to allow for lessons to be learned from activity on the ground, bearing in mind that much of this infrastructure has never been built in these areas before.  Infrastructure has not been built in some of these locations in more than 20 years.  Therefore, as we are building out the network, we are learning ways to do things more efficiently.  Ultimately, we must support anything we put forward as a delay with evidence.  We are going through that process with the Department now in respect of the 2022 programme.</p></speech>

I will give an example.</p><p>Across the country there are 1.4 million poles.  We have to test all of these poles to see which ones need to be replaced.  We make an assumption of how many poles need to be replaced based on evidence from the past.  Take Eir's 300k network.  When it was building the 300k network, it replaced faulty poles.  We made an assumption of what that percentage was through engagement with Eir.  As we start to roll out across more rural parts of the network, we start to see different percentages.  This means we have to reassess the volumes we put forward for the programme for the year ahead.  We can never understand what these issues are until we have gone down and tested the infrastructure on the ground.  We will never know how many blockages we have per kilometre in terms of putting cables into ducts without doing detailed surveys.</p></speech>

During this period of time, have we had delays in getting them to contractors?  Absolutely, because we would have expected to have had the surveys and designs done earlier in the project than we initially got them done.  In the earlier stage there were delays in getting stuff to Eir because we had not had the designs ready to give to it. There was then a knock-on effect with the contractors.  In the earlier stages we were behind in the surveys and the designs.</p></speech>

We have forward procured for the next three years all of the fibre and equipment required to build out the network.  Our suppliers are holding stock for six months in advance but we have secured our pricing for the next three years.  With our subcontractors we have continuous procurement activity.

This may be unfair so I will give Mr. Hendrick an opportunity to answer it.  That phrase sat aside, I read about the way in which some of the vehicles were put together quite quickly at the time the contract was being signed and in the period immediately prior to it.

The key thing for us on that is that we do not get stale and we are not too far ahead.</p><p>We are fine from the point of view of contractors.  In regard to construction on the ground, we break it into two parts.  There is what we call the passive construction, which is building the fibre, cleaning the manholes, the blockages and so forth.  We currently have four contractors employed on that part of the project and another contractor has just been added to the framework through the Department.  We have gone through the process with the Department.  It is quite a lengthy process.  That is done now and we are in the middle of a process of trying to add another three to the framework in order that as we ramp and build, we can add them into the mix as well.  </p></speech>

We directly employ about 300 people with NBI and there are direct contractors working on this, so it is roughly 1,200 at this stage and ramping up.  We see that probably topping out at around 1,800 to 2,000 contractors at our peak.</p></speech>

We are probably the third largest county behind Cork and Galway in terms of the need for high-speed broadband as more than 36,758 premises are covered in the NDP deployment plan.  People express frustration about how it is being rolled out around the deployment areas where a number of premises are caught between different timelines associated with it and that is causing huge frustration.  There may be premises across the road from one in a separate deployment area that has a date related to 2025 or 2026 whereas across the road the premises is ready to preorder and go live.  That is causing huge difficulty.  For us, as public representatives it is very difficult to explain that.  Is NBI doing anything to alleviate that type of concern?  It is causing a huge difficulty.</p></speech>

If you bring it back to how we have 554,000 premises to cover in 26 counties, we have now commenced construction in all 26 counties.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill said, we have broken it into 227 different deployment areas or local exchanges and each of those is done on how far light can go down the fibre-optic cable, that is the limit as to how far we can drive it, in that particular area.  We have build them around that design and demographic.  There always will be an end to one deployment area and a start to another.  The ideal for anybody, from a commercial point of view to go in and build a county, would be to go in and stay in that county, just complete that county as fast as possible and move on to the next one.  From that perspective there would not be the long wait but to be fair to the people of Ireland, we have to bring in the 26 counties at the same time.  In order to do this and to use the resource we have to spread it across the country.  I acknowledge it is frustrating for a person on one road to be available for connection now while it might be a year or two before the next one is.  We will come contiguously as soon as we possibly can.  It has to spread to 26 counties as otherwise some of the counties will be-----</p></speech>

I ask that in some instances, the design and the project team surrounding the surveys would look at townlands and deployment areas within townlands and try to minimise that level of confusion for some people who are not aware of it.</p></speech>

In regard to the importance of getting surveys and engineering designs complete in County Mayo.  Mr. Malone mentioned that Eir has now become part of the roll-out <i>per se</i>in terms of the use of its infrastructure.  Will Mr. Malone outline what agreements are in place and how that will support the national roll-out?</p></speech>

If you think about the existing infrastructure, there are 1.4 million poles.  When we started the project we assumed there would be about 22,500 poles per annum that we would need to repair or replace.</p></speech>

Most of the urban areas probably have infrastructure that already is fit for purposes.  However in the new areas we are going into, we have doubled Eir's capacity.  Over a space of nine months they are going from just over 22,000 poles to more than 44,000 poles per annum.  Even with that capacity, we have to spread it across all 26 counties.  If we wanted to go faster, if we want to get this ultimately done faster, there are a couple of things we need.  We need to have more poles replaced, which means more subcontractors which means more poling trucks, which is plant and machinery, to do all of the make-ready work first, before we ever come along to put the cable on the poles or under the ground.  The survey and design is obviously the prerequisite of that.  That is what we are feeding out to Eir in terms of the make-ready.  There is a capacity restraint in terms of the number of poling trucks and resources available to do all of that work.  To be fair, we have agreed with Eir, we have contracted with it to increase its capacity.  We are spreading that capacity across all 26 counties and are trying to do it on an equal basis.</p></speech>

The only way I can articulate my point is by giving a practical example and that is the village of Ballyhooly, in north County Cork.</p><p>Typical of every small village throughout the country, it is quite literally being split down the middle in that part of it is to be provided with broadband through the national broadband plan and the other part is to be provided for by the market.  In the case of Ballyhooly, there is a housing estate that quite literally is being split down the middle in this regard.  While we accept that the market is providing and that there is an entity called NBI, as public representatives who spend a lot of our time advocating on issues such as access to broadband, particularly in the current climate of remote working, we find it hard to understand why there is not a greater degree of interoperability or connectivity between NBI and the private operators to solve problems and ensure provision of services to people in villages.  It is extremely frustrating.  </p><p> Can Mr. Hendrick provide any reassurance to public representatives like me that people in Ballyhooly and every village like it throughout the country who want to get connected and have a right to be connected will be guaranteed access, that they will not be denied access in the times we live in?</p></speech>

For anybody who does not have access to 30 Mbps today that will be addressed under the national broadband plan.  While that commitment was made, probably, ahead of most other European member nations, Europe is following suit.  The intent is to deliver future-proofed infrastructure across Europe.  If somebody has 30 Mbps or between 30 Mbps and 100 Mbps, he or she is obviously on a commercial operator's network, whether Eir, SIRO or another provider.  I would expect - we are seeing this in terms of the announcements that are being made by commercial operators - that there will be a transition to future-proof networks, those being fibre.  Over the past six months, there have been a number of announcements by SIRO and Eir in terms of their continued roll-out of fibre networks.  The expectation is that by 2026, over 95% of homes will be connected on fibre-based networks.</p></speech>

When the national broadband plan was rolled out there was an expectation - Mr. Hendrick can tell me if it is not a legitimate expectation - that there would be a more timely intervention in those areas where there are serious gaps.  I refer again to Ballyhooly, because as far as I am concerned it is a ground zero for every village of a similar type.  There was an expectation that there would be a realisation of the commercial realities, but also a realisation of the corporate social responsibility of ensuring that where there were gaps, right down to micro-level, NBI would be the responsible partner in ensuring that where public representatives like me make representations through our broadband officers in the local authorities or directly to NBI, there would be an understanding of that dynamic and there would be moves to fast-track or, at least, recognise the fact that there are households wherein there are two parents working remotely and a post-primary or third level student who are quite literally taking turns using the broadband such is the lack of capability.</p> <p>  Mr. Hendrick speaks about an offering by NBI of minimum speeds of 100 Mbps, a 1G product and a new 2G product.  Is NBI guaranteeing those speeds or is it, as set out in the small print, "up to" those speeds.  There is a big difference between "up to 1G" and actually guaranteeing 1G.  The term "up to" could mean anything up to that level.  Those are the issues that we are trying to deal with here and that, as public representatives, we are trying to navigate.  We are quite literally reflecting back to NBI what we are hearing on the ground from countless numbers of citizens in the types of villages mentioned, who are deeply frustrated that there is no intervention that appears to be serving them.  </p> <p>  Mr. Hendrick is telling me about something that is going to happen in the future, the future is now as far as those people are concerned.  The pandemic has fast-tracked remote working and they want results now.  What can I tell the people of Ballyhooly arising from my engagement with the witnesses today that would give them some hope that there will be an intervention to meet their needs and they will get a service?</p></speech>

It is not an "up to" service.  ComReg has dealt with this in recent times.  It is applying penalties where operators say they are delivering a speed or an up to speed that they are not achieving.  Consumers are very frustrated that they are not achieving the speeds they are supposed to be getting and are paying for.  In our network, we are guaranteeing the service and we are testing all of the retail operators to ensure they are meeting those metrics.  There are consequences to them not achieving those metrics.  It is something that we absolutely stand over and have contractual obligations to deliver on with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></speech>

As I have only ten minutes and a number of questions to ask, I will try to keep my questions brief and I would appreciate brief replies.</p> <p>  The two big issues are the ability to deliver and the financial stability.  In his opening statement, Mr. Hendrick made the point that as the risk profile of the project evolves it is likely that some of the early-stage investors who helped to turn the NBI from an idea into a reality at a point when there was a lot of unquantifiable risk in the project will be replaced with investors who specialise in long-term investments.  The early-stage investors obviously were never in it for the long term.  Were they just named partners?  The build-out is not a particularly lengthy contract.  Have investors dropped out?  Is there concern about finance?  Is there stability in terms of finance?  If NBI is paying high interest rates on loans that tends to suggest this is high risk.  Have investors that NBI expected to remain with the project pulled out and, if so, who are they?</p></speech>

It is the opposite.  The risks now are quantifiable.  There is no question around technology and demand of high-speed broadband.  The measurable risks around construction are clear.  We are active in all 26 counties.  The opposite applies.  We are at a stage now-----</p></speech>

When we look at encroachment, we estimate a potential overbuild of 31,000 premises by Eir in the NBP area.  Ultimately, the overall number of premises in the NBP area has gone up.  There may be cost savings in terms of building out or not passing some of the homes, but we find that although commercial operators may have passed a home, it is a question of whether they can actually afford to connect it.  Are they asking the consumer to spend thousands of euro to get the connection from wherever-----</p></speech>

One covers what are effectively build assumptions.  Within the financial model we would have agreed with the Minister at the outset as part of the contract, there were assumptions made about the remediation of ducts, poles etc., as Mr. Hendrick mentioned.  To the extent that those assumptions are wrong, the contingency pot is eaten into.  However, to the extent there are savings against that, they get clawed back 100% by the Minister.  There are assumptions in respect of rates paid to Eir.  ComReg obviously sets the rates for Eir.  To the extent they change, the pot is eaten into up to the cap.  If it goes above that, NBI swallows the excess.  However, to the extent there are savings &mdash; ComReg has recently spoken about the potential to reduce some of the costs &mdash; 100% goes back to the Minister.  The third pot relates to connections.  As we connect up to 550,000-odd premises over the next 25 years, some will be in more easy to access areas and some will be in more difficult to access areas.  The average costs will vary from premises to premises.  Where there are more expensive connections, we can draw from the pot up to a certain cap.  Similarly, where costs are below the average, we will put money back into the pot.</p> <p>  On the previous point, the subsidy is capped at &euro;2.1 billion, plus the &euro;500 million contingency, and it is up to NBI to bear any costs on top of that.</p></speech>

There is a concept under the contract where we have to understand the impact of that encroachment.  We would have to say what the cost is to NBI, where we may have lost revenue or we may have to incur additional costs.  When one thinks about how we will be covering more than 90% of the land mass of Ireland, if we will be passing those premises anyway to reach the ones very far down the road that the commercial operator might not want to get to, there will probably be very little cost difference to us.  The incremental cost of passing that operator is very small.</p></speech>

Thereafter, we can make assumptions.  Obviously, the further out one goes, it is harder to make those assumptions.  The financial model that we agreed with the Minister includes assumed inflation within it, as well as a contingency for inflation and other assumptions.  The model is set up to include a number of different layers of contingency, whether it is &euro;500 million contingent pot, assumptions around inflation and also some buffer equity that we have included, as Mr. Hendrick mentioned.  Investors have guaranteed up to &euro;223 million of equity, which is above and beyond what we foresee having to draw down, but it is available.  We feel comfortable that there is lots of capacity to absorb any sort of bumps in the road, whether from Covid or inflation.</p></speech>

In many cases, we are connecting homes that other commercial operators may have said that they had infrastructure close by to connect to, but they are not connecting.  What we are finding is that these premises are not getting connected.  Therefore, we are not duplicating infrastructure and we are not looking to seek compensation against encroachment at this time.</p></speech>

We would intend to utilise most, if not all, of those poles.  Where there are gaps in the network, we will add additional poles.  We originally thought that there would be a 10% requirement for new poles, approximately.  As we are getting on the ground now and out there surveying, we do not think we will need as many new poles as initially envisaged.  It is too early to say exactly what the number will be.  Originally, we would have thought it would be a little over 100,000, but what we are seeing is a bit less than that.</p></speech>

I know some people have already touched on our existing system from Eir, and I would like to as well.  I am in Cork North-Central and we have a huge number of areas that will not receive an NBI service until 2026.  I have one area where the pole is physically on the person's property, but Eir is not allowed to connect because the property is in the amber area.  What engagement has there been with other operators where there are properties in very close proximity to the boundary?  For instance, in this case, they are connecting a house 200 yds down the road, but they are not connecting the house that is closer to the pole than the one down the road.  What engagement has there been with the other providers on this issue?</p></speech>

There are two reasons, potentially, that the provider is not making its service available.  One is the cost of the connection may be too high and the second is it might have capacity or connectivity issues in being able to serve those homes.</p></speech>

On cost, the property it has connected is at a far greater distance than the property on which the pole is situated.  In other words, the pole is situated at the entrance to the farmyard, but Eir will not connect the farmhouse.  Yet, it can run the cable 200 yd down the road to connect another house.  The argument consistently coming back to us from Eir is that because the property is in the amber area, it is not prepared to connect.  We have quite a number of cases like this, where we think a significant number of properties could be immediately connected, if there was engagement between NBI and the other suppliers.</p></speech>

That is one side of it in respect of what is happening around encroachment.  We are saying that commercial infrastructure is available to connect a home but the cost of connecting is too high.</p> <p>  Part of our obligation under this contract is to ensure future-proofing of the service and the network for 25 years and beyond.  Notwithstanding that we have that obligation, and we are building the network to meet that contractual obligation and the demand for the future, we are engaging.  We have a request for proposal, RFP, in the market at present, for which we have already received the first round of responses for a number of wholesale operators, where we could leverage their network and service.  What is critical is that they connect with the speeds deemed under the national broadband plan, with the service level agreements that go with it, and the future-proofing requirements we need to give certainty to these homes when they get connected.</p> <p>  It is something we have under way and are keeping the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications informed of.  We gave it an update two weeks ago and we said we would give our next updates at the end of March and the end of June.  It is something we are looking at and it does make sense, where it is available.  The whole premise of the NBP is to use infrastructure where it is available, but it does not take away from the fact we have to deliver the service, and the benchmarked minimum speeds, with service level agreements, SLAs, and future-proofing.   </p></speech>

As Mr. Malone described, the 154,000 premises we have under construction today are largely coming out from some of those central points.  On the number we will assess, our team is currently doing that through a process, with a number of operators, where we are sharing them, in other words, these are the premises, what technology the operators can serve and whether they can meet the future demands of high-speed broadband over the next 25 years-----</p></speech>

I expect it will be in multiple areas, again, testing what the product and service looks like, the distance from the central point to where the infrastructure is, the service level agreements and the future-proofing.  There are quite a number of parts.  We have to ensure, and this is certainly the focus for the network we are building, that this will be here for future generations.  We have to make sure the same applies, even if we look at alternative technologies or networks.</p></speech>

I will move on to another issue.  It relates to the workforce and the availability of people to carry out the work that needs to be carried out.  Is NBI facing challenges in that area at present, in view of the fact that the whole construction industry is going at full speed and many other areas are having difficulties in getting people for jobs that are available?  In looking at that over the next 12 months, has NBI set out the number of people that are required, in addition to setting out the number of people who are currently available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. T.J.

We are definitely acutely aware of the marketplace, where we are in the market at present and that the level of unemployment is dropping at all times.  We have gone out to all our contractors over the past six or eight months and looked at what availability of resources they would have in the event we want to up our production levels, number one and number two, if an accelerated programme was feasible for us down the road.  We have got that detail back.</p> <p>  In addition, to try to circumvent this and get ahead, which is no different than what we did in the procurement of materials, where we forward bought for three years and increased the stockholding at any one time, we have added another subcontractor in recent weeks and months to the panel we can choose from.  That particular contractor has strong links into European countries that are possibly coming off the back of some of these projects so there is more availability of labour.  We are looking at adding three more contractors to that panel at present.  Again, one of those also has international links.  We are constantly looking at that.  The existing contractors are telling us they will be able to ramp up to meet the demands but, in order to be sure of it, we are being prudent by adding additional contractors to the list.</p></speech>

Why does NBI now believe that these contractors can deliver within the time period?</p></speech>

It has been down to the operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  We just could not physically get out there or could not estimate what would hit us from that perspective.  From an actual manpower point of view, we believe the contractors have sufficient capacity on the ground.  We are also seeing that at present.</p> <p>  As Mr. Hendrick said, the level of fibre we are rolling out at present is enough to go from here to Paris on a monthly basis and that has been so for the past three months.  We stepped that up, as Eir has stepped up its area.  Part of it is the poling capacity.  If there is an area in poling capacity, that is probably our tightest pinch because that takes more time to ramp up as specialised machinery is involved that needs to be brought into the country and manufactured.  That is why, when we carried out an agreement with Eir on 1 October, it was based on an incremental step between 1 October this year to 1 January next year, in different phases, which gave Eir time to seek people and machinery.   </p></speech>

Eir is working through that itself.  It replaced the poles on our behalf as part of the Eir make-ready work.  The machinery for that is specialised and there are long delivery times for it.  It is either brought it in from abroad, if it is already there, or it is manufactured.</p></speech>

On 1 October, we agreed with Eir to increase our capacity to just more than double.  We had initially contracted with it for 22,500 poles per annum.  To catch up and get ahead of ourselves, we have contracted to double that capacity.  Although we are only just more than six months behind, we want to double it to give ourselves a chance to build contingency back into the programme.  We are virtually doubling the capacity that Eir originally committed to, from 22,000 or 24,000 poles per annum, to just shy of 50,000 poles.</p></speech>

I refer to the cost of providing the scheme.  Adding together the State subsidy and the private finance and dividing that by 540,000 or 550,000 gives a figure of approximately &euro;12,000.  Is that correct?  I am talking about the actual cost of the scheme.  In other words, the average cost for a premise in the orange intervention area to be connected, in the context of the overall scheme, is in the region of &euro;12,000 per premises.</p></speech>

We know this.  We have been over it for the past five or six years.  We now know there are two sums of money - one is the State or taxpayer subsidy of &euro;2.6 billion or &euro;2.7 billion and the other is private sector investment of approximately 9% or 10% of that figure.  What has NBI calculated is the cost per premises in terms of the overall cost of the scheme?  That is what will count.</p></speech>

To build the network and pass the homes, it is approximately &euro;2,000 to pass the homes.  To connect the homes, it is approximately &euro;1,000.  Those are the primary functions of the subsidy.  The third bucket where the subsidy comes in is the rental of infrastructure, namely, renting the poles and ducts of Eir's infrastructure.</p></speech>

Therefore, we want to remove them from the map.  We have removed premises from the map, but we go through a process of analysing, first, if they are guaranteed to get a service and if it is going to be a cost saving on the project by not building.  There are premises that we have removed from the map, but it is a small number.  We are not seeking encroachment compensation for those premises.</p></speech>

In response to a question earlier on the cost of the infrastructure, my understanding is that the Eir infrastructure is currently owned by French investors, if it has not been flipped again.  Mr. Hendrick knows that it has been flipped a number of times over the years since it was privatised in 1999.  NBI is renting poles and ducting from Eir.  How much per pole is being paid per annum?

It would be fair to say they were not in good shape.  A lot of poles had to be replaced.  Mr. Hendrick outlined the programme of what will be done per year.

The M0s are largely associated with a lot of the mobilisation activities, onboarding of retail operators, setting up the test lab, getting data centres, and getting all the infrastructure up and running in order to be able to start serving and engaging with the retail operators.  They are predominantly the M0 milestones.</p> <p>  The M1s then are the designs after we have done the surveys.  We must have done a complete survey of each deployment area.  We must also have designed it from a physical network perspective.  We must further have built in all of our assumptions around how many trees need to be trimmed, how many poles need to be replaced, and how many kilometres of underground duct needs to be installed.  Once the Department has audited that activity, it gives us an approval to proceed, ATP.  Effectively, we then issue that ATP to the independent certifier and, including on the M0 milestones, the independent certifier does an audit on all of our achievements to ensure that we have met the achievements.</p></speech>

We have a list of all the different deployment areas within that county, and the various stages from the survey to design to build commencement and build completion.  In the case of Mayo, by the end of next year, we will have around 80% of the survey completed.  We will be well on the way at that stage.  By the end of 2023, we will have 34% of the builds, all the premises, commenced.  By the end of 2024 we will have 52% commenced, and by the end of 2025 we will have about 77% of the builds commenced within the county.  For builds completed, by the end of 2025 we will have between 49% and 50% of the entire county completed and about 73% completed by the end of 2026 and the remainder will be done in the balance of that timeframe.</p></speech>

Over 25 years of the project, all of the other costs - the bid costs we spoke about, the advisory costs the Deputy asked about, all the operating costs, as well as the balance of the capital expenditure - have to be covered by NBI through either shareholder investment or through revenue generated to the extent that if there is not sufficient revenue generated, that risk stays with NBI.</p></speech>

He said that 12% is not unusual.  It is very high.  When this scheme was being devised, loans were being offered at interest rates of 0.25% and 0.5% by the European Investment Bank, EIB, and other sources, and here the State is tied into a contract where 12% interest is being paid out.  That is highly unusual.  It does not sit right with me for some reason.  It does not seem like a good way to be doing business.  I also notice that it is compound interest, which means that in a period of just under six years, that will double because there is an accumulator on it being compound interest.  That in itself would seem like an excessive sum.  I looked at some other infrastructure projects that were coming at 3.2% and 3.4% interest.  Here we are with 12% compound interest.  This has the potential to become a much larger sum.  Does Mr. Kelly not find that unusual?</p></speech>

If one thinks about paying one's mortgage at 2% or 3%, they are secured loans.  It is very important to differentiate between an unsecured shareholder loan and a secured bank loan.  If a person goes to the bank and gives security and he or she does not pay it back, the bank will enforce that security to get its money.  Here, we have shareholders who invested their money where there is no security.</p></speech>

I take it that is unsecured.  In reality, the State has ponied up for between &euro;2.6 billion and &euro;2.7 billion.  We know that.  I do not have time to go into it now but previous questions and commitments regarding milestones turned out to be very different in terms of penalties.  Assurances other Deputies and I got on the floor of the D&aacute;il got in 2018 and 2019 were about the risk.  Mr. Kelly mentioned the risk in response to a number of the Deputies.  He and Mr. Hendrick leaned on this a lot.  I would contend that where the State has put up funding in excess of &euro;2.6 billion, in reality there is very little risk.</p></speech>

Another remedial plan is coming.  Covid-19 was the reason given.  I understand, as will committee members, that that would cause some disruption in the real world.  Telecommunications is one of the areas that continued right throughout that period.  It was exempt.  That is the first thing I will say to Mr. Hendrick.  The next is that the third plan was 115,000 in year one.  Then its status was revised downwards to 60,000.  We await plan No. 3.</p><p>From what I have seen with regard to milestones, targets and penalties, I imagine the investors are very happy.  They must be rubbing their hands together.  Very few investors would be able to find a project as lucrative as this underwritten by a state whose finances are reasonably healthy.</p></speech>

I apologise for being delayed.  If I repeat some questions, I hope I will be forgiven because I did not hear them all.  I listened to the opening statements and a few things struck me.  To allude to something the Cathaoirleach was just saying, at the outset of this there was much criticism and much debate as to whether the State should get involved in this at all when the private sector was not.  That was clear.  There needed to be some sort of mechanism to roll out broadband, particularly for rural Ireland.  I will get to urban heartlands shortly.  If this had not been done, where would we be now in the absence of this framework?  I know it is hard to ponder that but, realistically, where would be if this was not in place?</p></speech>

To put this into context, the homes we are talking about today receive speeds of less than 30 Mbps.  People in urban areas of the country benefit from a benchmark product with a speed of 500 Mbps.  In 2016 or 2017, the gap was not significant.  We were talking about tens of megabits per second.  We are now talking about hundreds.  The demand for those hundreds of megabits per second is only increasing.  One of the benefits we have in our job is that we see the impact our work has on businesses, homes and schools every day.  That is what drives us every day to get out there and build this network.  We know this is more important now than it was two years ago.</p></speech>

Mr. Hendrick also referred to 1,200 people hired.  How many of those are direct employees of NBI?</p></speech>

I just wanted to get a rough total of the number working on it.  In his statement, Mr. Hendrick also mentioned NBI's co-operation and work with Eir and Enet.  I commend him on his work for the islands.  That is important.  We are talking about rural Ireland and you cannot get much more remote than the islands.  That work is essential because it will have benefits in terms of people returning to the islands and repopulating them and in sustaining communities.  That is very welcome.  However, there are also black spots in urban areas.  Colleagues from across the House will know of black spots in towns, villages and cities in the areas they represent.  There are several in my own area.  I am not seeing the sense of urgency Mr. Hendrick has spoken about with regard to connections in those area.  How are those issues going to be resolved?  It seems that dealing with issues in urban areas would be simpler given that the services are practically outside people's doors.  These providers, Eir, Enet and others, give commitments to connect these premises but it never happens.  We are talking about years, long before 2020.  People are losing faith.  Ultimately, that is the engine of the economy.  We need to ensure that there is good connectivity across cities and counties.  What is going to happen there?</p></speech>

With regard to specific urban areas in which we may not have infrastructure when passing or where connection will be quite expensive, we have to consider value for money.  As part of the request for proposals, RFP, we are running at the moment, a number of bidders have given us solutions.  We will engage with them over the coming months and will look at practical solutions, including the use of alternative networks, products and services to connect those homes.  It is really critical that we make sure that, once these premises are connected, there will not be another digital divide and that the service they get will meet demand for the next 25 years.  Working with those suppliers is critical.  We have a team dedicated to and focused on that work over the coming months.</p></speech>

How do we liaise with NBI to highlight those black spots?  As I have said, there are plenty of them.</p></speech>

As we are out surveying, we see the gaps between where we have contiguous network builds and where we have to go off on a certain route because there is a house isolated on its own, which is very expensive to do.  We have already identified the premises.  When end users go to our website and put in their Eircode postcode, they will get a date based on their deployment area.  In parallel, we are looking at one-off houses and buildings in urban areas that are just not contiguous in terms of build.  We will have to put them into a different programme.  They might get done earlier as a result of that programme.</p></speech>

That is probably the bigger issue.  As a representative of an urban area, the existence of black spots is a big issue.  I hope that NBI is aware of them all but, in case it is not, there needs to be a way for Members to feed in for various different reasons.  I am talking about the construction of new homes and certain streets that seem to have been bypassed for the high-speed fibre roll-out.  We need a way to inform NBI to ensure these are included in a work programme and that the works are ultimately done.  I am still not quite clear on the timelines.  I acknowledge that the timeline for each will be different because they are so sporadic but it is a matter of how they are going to be addressed and ensuring they are addressed.  Mr. Hendrick said these premises may be done earlier than the projected date.  I hope that is the case.</p></speech>

If they are in an urban area, we are looking at the most economical solution to connect them.</p><p>For homes that are being constructed at the moment or that do not have 30 Mbps when the commercial operator said they would, we will get the GeoDirectory update every quarter where new homes come onto the map.  Alternatively, they can write to NBI or the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  Deputies and Senators can come to NBI or the Department and we will assess with the Department whether those premises should be in the intervention area or not. </p></speech>

We have subcontracted with the same contractors who are doing the builds a maintenance and connection group.  We have the facilities and the people to support the network and we have to meet high SLAs in terms of the contract, equivalent to what one would expect to see in an urban-based telecoms network.</p></speech>

When we talk about the 30% of control, it includes the category of voting rights.  That is the mechanism through which Granahan McCourt controls NBI.  The other thing that is important to point out is that the contract has protections so if there is a change in David McCourt's voting or ownership interest, there is no <i>de minimis</i>threshold.  Any change would require ministerial consent.  It is separate from and in addition to the 30%.  Similarly, if there was any change in shareholding at the Metalla level - that is the holding company Mr. Hendrick described - that would require ministerial consent.  The 30% figure relates to the other shareholding interests.</p></speech>

That is the figure for premises constructed and built to walk off.  When our contractors are finished and walk off site for built connections, the target is 60,000.  We believe we will have 47,000 completed by the end of February.  We are nearly halfway through February so we are tidying those up and doing the final bits and pieces.  That would be 47,000 and the additional 13,000 will be finalised and under construction by the end of March.</p></speech>

It was just a matter of finalising and finishing the smaller pieces that were left to be done, albeit those small pieces stopped homes being categorised as being constructed or passed.  The end of February and March will involve finishing out those bits and pieces.  That is where a major jump will be seen, as is the case from the end of January to the end of February, which brought the target to 47,000.</p></speech>

We can do so because we get certainty at least 12 weeks in advance of when the construction will finish.  When Mr. Malone&rsquo;s team finishes on site and the 60,000 premises are constructed, we then have to inform industry, which is the retail operators and we give them a notification period where they can go and sell to consumers.  At that point they can give consumers exact dates on when we will install but the installations do not happen for anything between two and four weeks after that.  The definition under the contract is that is when they are contractually passed, even though the construction and all the work will have been done by the end of March.</p></speech>

In advance of completing the build we take pre-orders for the three months in advance of completion.  We have measured Cavan, Carrigaline and areas like that and we are seeing take-up of above 30% and growing.  There is a demand but equally there are consumers who may be in contract with an existing operator and so they may be coming to the end of a contract.  As we build across all Twenty-six Counties and as more retailers are actively selling, we are noticing that retailers are starting to migrate their customers onto our network, even if they are in contract, because they see the opportunity to get them on board with this fibre network.  To keep that customer for the long term they have to migrate them while they are already in a contract.</p></speech>

We would assume we will get to an overall take-up of approximately 85%.  Originally, when we looked at historical data cross Europe, and we were not comparing against fibre networks because at the time there was not a significant level of them being built, we assumed that it could be up to eight years after work was completed in a deployment area before that threshold of 85% take-up would be reached.  We are seeing that the demand for high-speed broadband is greater, that the capacity requirements are greater and that Eir is committed to switching off the copper network, notwithstanding other retailers in the market that have TV or mobile services that are driving their customers onto this network.  The achievement of 85% should happen significantly faster.  If I go by Eir&rsquo;s switch off of copper, Eir has committed that it wants to switch off that copper network within five years of NBI finishing in a deployment area.  That brings the period down from eight years to maybe five years after completing in a deployment area.</p></speech>

We said earlier that we will not fully know until we go out and complete all the surveys and designs.  It is only when we have the low-level designs completed for the entire amount that we will know.  With the high level we are seeing at the moment we would envisage somewhere between 90,000 km and 98,000 km in the construction of the network itself.  When the additional fibre that will be required to do the connections over the next 25 years is added in, we would say there will be somewhere around 140,000 km to 145,000 km.  It will only be over the next year to year and a half-----</p></speech>

We have a number of different working groups with the Department whereby it interrogates the information we are giving to them to make sure they have the assurances they require.</p></speech>

It is a broad target.  If delivery is on the lower end of that scale or if other targets need to be amended, are our guests satisfied that, whatever the circumstances, they will be in a position to convince the Department to recalibrate the milestones?</p></speech>

We must always demonstrate whether it is the result of something within our control or outside our control.  The important thing is that we do not get paid until we actually deliver the milestones so we still have to go through the test strategy with the independent certifier, demonstrate how the network has been delivered and confirm that we have all the financial evidence in place before we receive any of the subsidies.  The subsidies are only paid when we deliver.</p></speech>

The shareholders in NBI today are the same shareholders and partners David McCourt has had with Granahan McCourt in other entities, Enet being one.  They are not unknown entities.  It was not a rush to get out.  They have an investment cycle, which is typically anywhere between three and seven years.  Oak Hill is a typical private equity investment fund that has an investment cycle of three to seven years.  It wants to bring in the remaining long-term partner now because we are at a point where the technology and demand for high-speed broadband is clear and the construction is clear.</p></speech>

It seemed to me an obvious project with a State-backed contract for a major commercial opportunity.  It was underpinned, as the Chairman said, very strongly.  It did not have a high risk profile.  That is as may be.  That is a difference of opinion and that is okay; we are allowed to have that.</p></speech>

There was not a view on long-term future-proofing for 25 years.  What happened was that when we got through to the pre-qualification stage, when we had SIRO, Eir and what is NBI, all three bidders said fibre was the long-term future for the network.  I do not have this information; it is for the Department to say.  Where was that range?  Where were all three bidders?  A bid was not received from SIRO, which involved ESB and Vodafone.  My understanding was that the cost of the make-ready would have been significantly greater in terms of building the infrastructure and renting on the electricity infrastructure.  Obviously, Eir put in a bid along with ourselves and then decided to exit the process.  Again, it was down to risk and shareholder return.  That was the reason it decided not to go forward.</p></speech>

We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Ken Cleary, principal officer in the environment climate and communications Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask those who are attending remotely to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind people to have their mobile phones on silent or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, for the benefit of this afternoon's witnesses, I wish to explain the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references a witness may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation that they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything that they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse his privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that is not abused.  Therefore, if a witness&rsquo;s statement is essentially pharmacy to in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply.</p> <p>  Members are again reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government for the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or in official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  We are joined by Mr. Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, and I now call on him for his opening statement.</p></speech>

This represented just under 50% of the &euro;106.8 million that was available for spending under the subhead in 2020, the majority of which was earmarked for the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  A note to the account states that the underspend of &euro;53.6 million was due to the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the original expected roll-out of the broadband plan.  Delays in the planned roll-out continued in 2021.  This was reflected in the annual target set for the cumulative number of premises able to avail of the broadband service.  As indicated in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2021, the target set initially was that 102,000 premises would be able to avail of service by December 2021.  This target was revised down during the year to a total of 60,000 premises.</p> <p>  As we heard this morning, the total number of premises within the implementation area passed by the end of 2021 was just over half of that level.  The target indicated in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2022 is to have a total of 130,000 premises able to avail of the broadband service by December of this year.  The 2020 outturn in relation to the broadband plan expenditure was &euro;51.4 million.  This included payments to the main contractor, amounting to &euro;42.5 million and payments for advisory services related to the contract, totalling &euro;8.9 million.  The projected total cost of payments to the main contractor, as at 31 December 2020, was &euro;2.764 billion of which an estimated &euro;2.72 billion was outstanding at the year end.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#Z00500"><p>I thank the Chair.  The national broadband plan is a transformational national project that is unparalleled and is unique in terms of its ambition, scale and complexity.  It will deliver high-speed and affordable broadband initially to 550,000 homes, schools and business premises in Ireland.  Over the 25 years of the contract, it is expected to serve over 600,000 premises.  In line with the Government commitment, this will ensure that 100% of premises in rural Ireland, including those in the hardest to reach places, will have a broadband service that is in line with the rest of country.  This will be done as part of a single programme over seven years, and it will be delivered within the budget of &euro;2.6 billion.</p> <p>  2020 was the first year of the NBP contract. It saw a significant level of mobilisation activity by National Broadband Ireland, including the recruitment of personnel, procurement of materials and contractors, installation of equipment and exchanges and building IT systems to support the network.  Surveys and designs were progressed to inform the build programme, resulting in the first homes being connected to the new fibre network in January 2021 in County Cork.  Over the course of 2021, the project continued to build momentum.  By the end of last month, almost 296,000 premises were surveyed, build works were under way in almost 120,000 premises and a further 34,500 premises were passed.  Some 54,500 premises could order or preorder a service, while 469 broadband connection points, BCPs, including 200 primary schools, have been connected by NBI to date, with many of the public BCPs now supporting remote working.</p> <p>  Well over 1,000 people, all of them in Irish companies, are employed in the project.  There have been delays to the roll-out programme compared to the targets set in the contract.  Like many other construction projects, the NBP has been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The specific challenges for the project due to Covid and the mitigations put in place by NBI are set out in the briefing note that has been provided to the committee.</p> <p>  Reuse of the existing rural network, comprising about 1.5 million poles and 10,000 km of duct to lay the NBP fibre network is a condition of state aid and makes sense from a value-for-money and sustainability perspective.  While it was anticipated that elements of the rural network would need to be mediated or upgraded, the extent of the remediation required, particularly the underground network, is greater than was envisaged when the contract was signed.  Both Eir and NBI are addressing these issues, including the introduction by Eir at the end of last year of rapid response teams to support the timely remediation of network issues as they are identified.  Eir has also increased the volume of poles and ducts to be provided under the make-ready programme, which is a positive development.</p> <p>  Given the reliance on the Eir network, ongoing close collaboration between NBI and Eir is essential to the successful delivery of the project.  Additional resources have been brought into NBI and its subcontractors.  Local authority licensing issues have been substantially revolved, following intensive engagement between the Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, working with NBI.  The contract makes provision for dealing with delays to delivery of the network and provides for circumstances where subsidy will be permanently withheld where milestones have not been met.  Where there are unprecedented events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI can seek what is termed "relief" under the contract and additional time to meet contract milestones without facing deductions to their subsidy payments due from the Department.</p><p>In circumstances where such relief is permitted, no sanctions would apply.  In other circumstances, the contract provides that sanctioned provisions relating to delays in the delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of contract year 2, which is from 1 February this year.  Sanctions will be applied as appropriate and will be calculated and imposed in line with the contract.  This places a significant pressure and incentive on NBI to speed up the delivery of milestones missed.  Due to delays in rolling out the network, NBI as a commercial company is also losing out on critical revenues from customers it should have connected by now.</p><p> Regarding the ownership and financial structures of NBI, the ownership structure of NBI remains the device in the contract awarded by the Department.  The Minister has rights of consent under the contract in respect of changes in ownership or control and NBI must notify the Minister in advance of any such event arising.  There have been no notifications of changes to ownership or control to date.</p><p> The social, economic and environmental benefits of the national broadband plan cannot be overstated.  As each home, school and business is connected, the benefits of the plan will be experienced in the daily lives of people across the country.  Without the national broadband plan, the market would not deliver broadband to all citizens in all parts of the country.  My Department is fully seized of the transformational nature and benefits of the national broadband plan and we are fully committed to driving the project forward.  We are also fully seized of the scale of the investment the Government is making in this project and the necessity of ensuring value for money throughout.  Robust governance for a project of this nature, scale and cost is paramount.  There is a skilled and resourced multidisciplinary team in the Department implementing the protections and provisions drafting into the contract.  The national broadband plan is supplemented by external legal, financial and technical advisers on network build and service metrics, project costs, procurement of materials and subcontractors.  Corporate governance requirements are being overseen by the Department.  My Department is engaging with NBI to finalise its roll-out plan for 2022.  This plan will be completed by the end of March and relevant details can be provided to the committee at that stage.  I look forward to assisting committee members in any questions they may have.</p></speech>

It is good to see them again.  There are a few things I would like to cover.  We had a good discussion this morning with NBI and Deputies were able to ask questions about delivery.  We now know there is a small number of connections relative to the number of passings, which is less than it might have been.  We have heard about that.  How is the Department going to hedge bets on the delivery challenge?  There is a delivery challenge at the moment, some of which is understandably down to Covid-19.  Mr. Griffin said that in his statement but the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, went further in the D&aacute;il and acknowledged that some of the delay, in his view, is because of NBI.  NBI discussed that this morning as well with regard to difficulties bedding in and so on.  What is Mr. Griffin's understanding of the source of delay beyond Covid-19?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.629" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#AA00300"><p>I will not go back over the Covid-19 issues because they are well covered in the letter I provided the committee on 17 January.  I did not hear the session with NBI this morning but I understand that it covered that to a significant extent as well.  The Covid-19 impacts were very significant.  One of the challenges was that when the engineers went out to do the build on the ground they were seeing things that could not have been anticipated at the time that the contract was being put together, such as in the condition of the underground network.  That has led to the challenges in addressing the deficiencies as identified, engaging with Eir to have them remedied and ensuring proper governance arrangements for all that work to be pulled together.  As I said, good progress has been made with Eir in additional poles and duct being rehabilitated under the programme.  That is a positive.  It is important that both parties remain engaged to make sure that any wrinkles in the "make ready" programme are identified, escalated and addressed and that there is an appropriate governance and oversight mechanism in place to make sure that is as smooth as possible.  When building on an existing network with somewhere in the region of 99 km to 146 km of fibre cable, depending on whether you are talking about premises passed or premises connected, and 10,000 km to 15,000 km of duct to be reused, you will come across those difficulties.</p></speech>

I regard it as a double-edged balance and it would be useful to go through it in that way.  What is the source?  If the project was underestimated to that scale, to what is that attributable?  Is it because of the quality of the design?  Who oversaw that?  What is the source of that underestimation?</p></speech>

That is fine and that is built in.  In reality, you only get a sense when starting to do the work on the ground as to the extent of the difficulties or challenges within the network that have to be addressed.</p></speech>

Was there a difficulty with the design of the random sampling exercise?  I am curious about how far divergent it appears to be.  We are talking about real delays in the design, both the high-level design and, as we discussed this morning, the low-level design, that are at variance with the assessment that had been done.  I am asking what that is attributable to.  Why would someone do a random sampling exercise that was so at variance with the overall outcome?</p></speech>

It is a random sample.  The sample is sized and designed appropriately in accordance with what would have been best practice insofar as the design work was concerned.  When you go out on the ground and are installing, surveying, designing, you come across things that would not have been anticipated at that stage.</p></speech>

There is clearly the opportunity to change shareholders.  I note, in his statement, Mr. Griffin states that the Minister has the right of consent under the contract in respect of changes of ownership.  That is something we discussed with NBI this morning.  Are there circumstances in which the Department would not give consent?  Has the Department considered the scenario in which new investors may not be forthcoming?  They are two different questions but they are linked.</p></speech>

The Minister has a call over investors who may want to come in.  There would be determinations around whether they are a suitable investor.  There are various controls and mechanism that would be applied there.  I might ask Mr. Mulligan to deal with some of the specifics around that.</p></speech>

An unsuitable third party is broadly defined.  Obviously, somebody who might have been involved in criminality or something like that would not be a suitable third party.  The Minister would clearly veto any such change of ownership that involved those sort of parties.  The contract is around are they a suitable or unsuitable third party.</p></speech>

The current standard connection charge is &euro;100.  NBI will charge Vodafone, Eir, Regional Broadband or any of the 50 operators that are selling.  The retail operators, therefore, cannot charge the homeowner &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000 or &euro;4,000 to connect a home, which can happen in a commercial sector.  NBI is subvented to do that in rural Ireland.  That is why this is non-commercial.  In the majority of homes, it will cost a significant amount to put in underground ducting and new poles to a farm yard 300 yd from the road.  All that sort of thing is subsidised so that the consumer will get connection.</p></speech>

That is fine.  I thank Mr. Mulligan.</p> <p>  I have one final question.  Returning to the financial stability piece, the reason we are interested in it is because it is such a change in ownership and financial structure potentially.  From the Department's perspective, does it have any guarantee?  This is why I am asking about the implications of investors not coming in.  What happens if it does not work?  What happens if the company is not financially sustainable?  Where is the State in that then?</p></speech>

National Broadband Ireland, over 25 years, is expected to be profitable.  In the event that it is not profitable, like any contract or any public private partnership, PPP, the contract allows for the Minister to step in or to terminate.  There was also, back in the day, Carillion, for example, as the Deputy will remember, with the schools.  In the end, the State sometimes, in extraordinary circumstances, may have to step in.  We do not envisage that here, but in all commercial contracts the State has with third parties you make for these provisions - that there are termination events, step-in rates and all that sort of standard stuff.</p></speech>

That is where "step in" means.  Your first port of call is to try and sort it out without terminating it if the business seems to be going off track.  That is the first port of call, and then you can step out if the business recovers.  In the worst case scenario, if you have to terminate, in the event of a termination the Minister has the option to either take over the assets or the business or both, so it all comes back to the State.</p></speech>

I thank them for their work to date on a hugely important project.  Certainly, robust governance of a project of this scale is of huge importance.  We have seen in another project costs spiral and timelines being pushed out.  It is great to have the Department here to engage with the committee on this important matter.</p> <p>  My first question is in regards to the Department's key performance indicators that are contained within the contract and how these were monitored in 2020 and 2021.  Can Mr. Griffin indicate whether NBI has met all these key performance indicators?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#BB05200"><p>I will make a couple of points on that.  First of all, the Department sets out key performance indicators, KPIs.  There are KPIs around deployment, design, which was mentioned by Deputy Carroll MacNeill, premises passed, deployment areas completed, broadband connection points connected and connections made.</p><p>Getting into the operations phase, minimum download and upload speeds, wholesale products and prices, time to connect, operational response times, network outages and time to repair faults form a comprehensive suite of performance indicators.  They are monitored on an ongoing basis by the team in the Department.</p></speech>

Has NBI delivered on both build and survey to date?</p></speech>

We had expected that by the end of contract year two, by 1 February, that 60,000 premises would be passed under the interim remedial plan, as the Deputy will have seen in the documentation submitted.  Approximately 34,500 premises have been passed.  Pre-orders can be made at more than 50,000 premises.  When one looks at it in stark terms, there is a problem and we have not reached where we need to be.  There are reasons for that.</p></speech>

What course of action was originally agreed as per the contract?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.710" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#CC00500"><p>There are extensive governance arrangements in place.  Mr. Mulligan, Mr. Neary, Ms Leeson and other members of the team are constantly engaged with NBI.  There are generally no surprises with deviations in figures.  There are 17 groups in place that look at a whole range of things, meet weekly with NBI, and look at what issues have arisen and how blockers are being fixed.  NBI is obliged by the contract to formally notify us of delays.  There was constant engagement through 2020 and 2021.  The Deputy asked me about targets for premises surveyed.  This is an indicator for the potential for significant progress during 2022 and 2023.  By the end of quarter 1, 56% of premises in the State will have been surveyed and approximately 47% of the premises will have been designed.  Approximately 50% of the BCPs will be installed - that is 42% of schools and 95% of public points.</p></speech>

I understand the rationale for this is that it is expected that the first year or two of the contract is about mobilisation.  There is a focus on that.  At the end of contract year two, there is a delay to the milestone payment.  Once that milestone is hit, there is a recalculation to determine the extent of the payment allowable.  If it continues to be unmet for a period, one adjusts the net and says what the payment is.</p></speech>

We have paid what is deemed permitted expenditure under the contract.  It is not a case of NBI submitting a bill and the Department paying it.  There is substantial due diligence to make sure that an assessment is made of every item that it submits to us to determine whether that is permitted expenditure.</p></speech>

In 2021, we were more than &euro;50 million behind the projected spend on the project.  NBI has not made the milestone and, therefore, the subsidy has not been paid out.  Penalties will potentially arise this year and onwards if NBI does not recover on existing milestones and meet future ones.  That kicks in from this year onwards.  Other operational KPIs include BCPs around the country that may be out of service for a few hours when they should not be.  NBI suffers penalties for that and we have imposed penalties on it for those across the country in the past 12 months.  Some 6,500 premises are connected.  Thousands more should be connected.  NBI is losing revenue daily because it is delayed.  Those are the penalties.</p></speech>

We see that additional payments were made to NBI.  The Department's team is supplemented by external legal, financial and technical advisers.  To what extent is the Department reliant on additional experts to measure work carried out by NBI?  We previously talked about KPMG and EY.  More than &euro;42 million has been spent to date on external contractors.  Will Mr. Griffin explain why that is the case?  What will that spend look like over the next 25 years of the project?  Is that part of the &euro;2.7 billion for the original contract?</p></speech>

I will try to answer as comprehensively as I can.  When one looks at any major infrastructure project, whether roads, public transport or water, there is reliance on external contractors.  That is a given.  As the Accounting Officer responsible for a budget of &euro;2.6 billion, I need to make sure that we have a team in place to do serious due diligence on expenditure and the performance of the contractor, checking whether deployment milestones have been hit, premises have been passed and connections have been made.  It also needs to check that the claims for permitted expenditure and subsidy as set out in the contract are given the required level of oversight.  We have approximately 30 departmental staff.</p></speech>

Some &euro;9 million has been spent on technical advisory services from Analysys Mason and &euro;8 million has been spent on current legal advice.  Are these once-off payments or will this continue over the duration of the contract?</p></speech>

When it is averaged out, I would deem it to be the level of investment that we require to make sure that we have a fit for purpose contract and design, and that the complexity of this, which I have set out in my opening statement, was addressed as part of the procurement process.  Now that we are post-procurement, that due diligence is being applied.  If the Deputy is asking if we will spend to the same extent as we spent in the past, my priority is to ensure that we have controls in place in the Department-----</p></speech>

We have technical advisers, policy advisers, governance experts and legal experts.  We are building a team.  Over time, I expect more of the effort to fall back into the Department, with less reliance on external consultants.  It is important to say that the telecommunications sector is different from roads and water.</p><p>In the roads sector there is Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which has 293 staff.  Several thousand extra staff are involved in build, operations and asset renewals.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has a local authority system beneath it so it has a huge infrastructure supporting something similar to what we run out of the Department with 30 fantastic people on our team and 20 to 25-plus consultants.  We bring in the consultants to do particular things for us, so that is not necessarily a standing function within the Department.  There are particular pieces of work we call for - for example, legal advice from William Fry, commercial advice from EY and technical advice from Analysys Mason - to supplement the work done by the team.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#DD00200"><p>It is a nice segue that we are talking about the reliance on external advice.  If I understood Mr. Griffin correctly, he is talking about 25 consultants assigned to the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  I submitted a parliamentary question for written answer on 19 January of this year asking how much the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was spending on external consultancy services.  The figure I got back was &euro;14.3 million, of which &euro;10.1 million, approximately, was being spent on external services for this very project.</p> <p>  If I break that down further - and the reply is a matter of public record - Analysys Mason received &euro;3.9 million, EY business advisory services received &euro;5.3 million and William Fry legal advisory services received &euro;846,000.  That adds up to approximately &euro;10.1 million.  Is it possible to give a further breakdown of the spend between the three entities I have just mentioned?</p> <p>  The reason I ask the question is that I perceive that in latter years Government Departments have been hollowed out and there is an increased dependency on external advice.  None of us are against the idea of external advice.  It needs to be procured if and when a certain skill set or a specific project needs to be delivered.  That is understood.  However, &euro;10.1 million seems to me to be an extraordinary figure.</p> <p>  What were EY's business advisory services, for example?  The consultancy, the PQ reply states, is for financial and commercial advisory services, but it amounts to &euro;5.3 million, which is not an insignificant amount of money.  Is it possible to provide the committee with a further breakdown of that cost in terms of, to use the vernacular phrase, billable hours?  What is the Department getting for &euro;5.3 million?  What is it getting from Analysys Mason for &euro;3.9 million and what is it getting from William Fry for &euro;846,000 so far?  That is only for 2021.  It would be very useful if this committee had a further understanding of just how much money is being spent on consultancy services, not only for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - officials from that Department are here today - but for every Department of State, for that matter.</p></speech>

To follow on from the conversation with Deputy Dillon, we have been tasked with overseeing the successful delivery of a once-in-a-lifetime project that is hugely complex and that will cost the State a maximum subsidy of &euro;2.6 billion and then a bit for VAT.  It would be utterly irresponsible of me if I did not ensure we had the expertise of the brilliant people I have working with us in the Department and external consultants.</p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned Analysys Mason.  I will get Mr. Nearly and Mr. Mulligan to come in on this because they deal with the teams every day.  Analysys Mason has been with us for a while.  We went to tender and it came back to us.  It provides services in development of the contract, technical solutions, evaluation, support in respect of the State aid, reference officer evaluation, project cost, model, compliance and robustness evaluation, mapping and monitoring of the intervention area, input to State aid issues and a whole range of work being done now, because we are in the active build and deployment phase, on supporting the overseeing of that.</p> <p>  I hope, with the passage of time, that more of that work will come back into the Department because Mr. Mulligan has lots of experience in the telecoms sector, as does Mr. Neary.  Ms Leeson is our governance expert and Ms Carrigan is a chartered accountant.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in is project sponsor.  They have huge experience, but the reason Departments employ consultants is that, in the long run, there are occasions when they need to flex up and flex down in terms of the experience and capacity of a particular type needed in the organisation.  I would hope, as this project enters a more mature phase and as we move beyond deployment, that the need for the extent of external expertise we have in place at the moment would diminish.</p> <p>  I go back to the point I made to Deputy Dillon.  In the telecoms sector we do not have the core agency such as exists in the likes of Irish Water, housing agencies, the local government system or Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  That simply was not there and available to us so we had to build that team.  The risk for me, to be brutally honest with the Deputy, is that I would come before the Committee of Public Accounts and be accused of not having the right people in place to oversee a &euro;2.6 billion contract.</p></speech>

What I would like is a deeper understanding of the breakdown of these costs.  We need that for every single line Department that relies on external services and consultancy.  I am not sure we have a deep understanding of that.  Certainly, I speak for myself in that regard.  The question then, and Mr. Griffin can fold this all into the reply in two minutes, is do I take it from his reply that the Department will continue to require the services of external consultants for this?  If the answer to that is "Yes", which I think it is, for how long more will it require them?  It has spent &euro;10.1 million so far.  What does Mr. Griffin anticipate the future spend will be on external services for the lifetime of this project?</p></speech>

It is not the only overhead, obviously.  There will be responsibilities that will entail thereafter.  If the Deputy wants me to put a figure on it for the next 25 years, I absolutely cannot do that at this point in time.<br/><br/>The other thing we need to consider is how the system more broadly manages big projects like this.  One of the options for us is the <i>status quo</i>with a function in-house with less external support.  That builds on the work EY did for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

I think we all appreciate that there is a reliance on external services.  We have all acknowledged that.  I am merely asking at this juncture - I think Mr. Griffin was about to defer to his colleagues on the matter - about the breakdown of costs and to have sight of the breakdown of those costs.  If I could come away in the short time I have with some understanding of that and a commitment that the Department will write to the committee in that regard, I would be grateful for that.</p></speech>

We wrote to the committee on 17 January with a breakdown, but I will give the Deputy an update because that correspondence covered a particular period.  I will give the Deputy a detailed update and an update on what work is being done by the consultants now that we have moved into a build rather than a procurement phase.  I am happy to do that.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Neary want to come in?</p></speech>

In particular, we have advice from Analysys Mason on the oversight of the build.  We would have sourced from Analysys Mason people with over 30 years experience in building large-scale infrastructural projects in the telecoms space.  That is not replicable in the Civil Service.  We are reliant on those experts to scrutinise and oversee the plans from NBI.  For example, if it is looking to re-baseline its project plans and seek relief, we are reliant on those experts to give us advice and say that is an appropriate level of relief and the level of productivity it should be able to extract from the market, etc.  On the build, that is just one section of the technical advice.  Within that, we procure from Analysys Mason on-site inspections of quality of workmanship on the build works that have been completed.  We have carried out a number of site visits.  This involves relevant experts who would be able to inspect the quality of workmanship.  We have done this in areas that have been in part completed and fully completed so we can see how progress is being administered by NBI so we are not just reliant on reports.  We go out and have experts taking photographic evidence and interviewing people on site.  Those are the type of activities that Analysys Mason carries out for us on the build.</p> <p>  In tandem with that, we also have-----</p></speech>

As is the case with all contracts, there are a number of areas where there might be disputes or potential disputes where we try to avoid disputes.  Both parties get their legal advice on that so we defer to William Fry the odd time for advice where somebody might have a certain interpretation of a clause in a contract.  There may be complaints by other operators in the industry about what NBI is doing and they might come to us looking for information around the contract.  Judicial review proceedings from another operator are ongoing and this is something where we get legal advice.  We get state aid advice generally and commercial law advice where, again, there might be issues around a subsidy payment such as whether it should be this or that.  We get legal advice on those sort of things.</p></speech>

We were told this morning that some of the original investors' early stage investors who helped turn NBI from an idea into a reality at a point where there was a degree of unquantifiable risk in the project will be replaced with investors who specialise in long-term investments.  Most of us understood that the majority of these investors were in it for the long haul, but we can see some of the investors are using loans that are relatively short term at very high interest rates.  Who out of the people who formally invested in the project to begin with have dropped out?  Has a large investor dropped out?</p></speech>

Our understanding is that as the network moves into a build phase albeit that we have a concern about the number of premises passed and the relatively small number of premises connected, there is a stream of work going on in terms of service design and so on, which gives us that confidence regarding 2022 and future years.

It is there to be drawn upon if it is required.  NBI made it clear to us and, I believe, the committee that it has no intention at the moment of seeking that encroachment.  NBI also made it fairly clear that it think around 31,000 premises may be passed but we are not clear if they will actually get a connection so it is a bit difficult to say whether 31,000, 20,000 or 10,000 premises will get a fibre connection from a commercial operator.  That is the difficulty we have.  You would have to analyse every home to see whether it would actually get a connection from a commercial operator.  That is something we have not done but I think it has done it.</p></speech>

These premises are not in a block of 10,000 premises and 5,000 premises there.  They are in ones, twos and threes in urban and suburban areas.  It is not like an entire cohort of the intervention area can be removed.</p></speech>

Analysys Mason did a piece of work on metropolitan area networks.  There was a lack of transparency regarding the people who ultimately were on the retail end.

There was much controversy around this at the time about the lack of the tender being really tested by virtue of the fact that there was really only one tender in the end.  People entered into at the early stages but did not proceed to tender.</p> <p>  Looking at an academic paper by Gary Healy, Donal Palcic and Eoin Reeves, the &euro;5,500 that we are discussing to effectively pass each house and premises is, by a distance, more expensive and while we are not probably talking like with like, it is still costing substantially more than the experience in other European jurisdictions.  Has the Department looked at that issue in retrospect on the value-for-money side?</p></speech>

In the first instance, this project is fairly unique in that the State is providing for the connection costs.  We are not aware that in many other jurisdictions that this is being funded.  That is an important consideration.  By virtue of the fact that the State is funding this, it provides a far greater opportunity for people in rural Ireland who do not have this service to get access to it at a reasonable price.</p> <p>  My second point is that the figure of &euro;5,000 is the top-level cost.  The average figure would be well below that.</p></speech>

What is the 25-year cost of operating a hospital, taking into account any revenue?  When one is benchmarking to other countries, what is probably not taken into account is what those other countries modelled.  Did they model five years or 25 years?  Have they taken into account that connection cost and a fibre-to-home network that is going to be future-proofed for 40-years?  It is a very difficult number to benchmark.  Peter Hendrick said earlier that the average costs to pass a premises is approximately &euro;2,000 and the average cost to connect around &euro;3,000.  Those are the capital costs that we are funding over the lifetime of the project.  The revenue model over time will dictate how much the average costs will be and that will be the unknown as to what will happen over the 25 years.</p></speech>

I raised an issue this morning where Eir and other operators are providing services that are very close to the areas that are designated as amber.  They are then not prepared to go into the amber area because they are saying that they are being restricted and that there has been very little engagement with them in trying to deal with the boundary areas.  I represent Cork North-Central and I am coming across this problem where one house has a connection but houses within a very close proximity are not being connected, even though we are being advised by Eir that there is capacity but the company is not prepared to touch a house that is within an amber area.  We went through this this morning and I am not quite satisfied with the answer I am getting on this.  I believe a great number of houses could be connected.</p></speech>

They can certainly deliver services in the amber area and there is no prohibition on them from doing that.  It is a decision for any company as to whether they want to deliver or it is commercially viable for them to deliver services in the amber area, which I state as a point of clarification.  Without looking at the particular circumstances, I cannot speculate as to why these operators are not connecting those particular homes.</p></speech>

I have had a number of these incidents.  The standard reply that they are getting from the employees of Eir is to contact their local politician who will sort it out.  We are getting on directly to Eir, which is saying that this is in the amber area and it is not prepared to connect, even though it does have capacity.  Eir is saying that because the broadband scheme is costing over &euro;5,000 per house in real terms, it feels that it is not getting anything on its contribution to connect up properties that are technically in the amber area and are the responsibility of NBI.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the lack of engagement that is going on between the providers in dealing with properties on what is the boundary area.  I have an example of another estate, for instance, where over 120 houses have been connected to broadband and the houses that are only just across the road but which are not in the estate are all being refused a connection.  In fact, some of the new houses that are across the road are also being refused the connection by Eir, even though fewer than ten houses are involved.  The company will not engage or connect because these houses, which on the other side of the road from the estate, are in the amber area.</p></speech>

That is where Mr. Neary and his team do a significant, in-depth analysis of every housing estate, road and boreen in the country to establish whether something is commercial or not and this is done in consultation with the industry.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in that this is an issue and is one across every county and townland in Ireland.  The response from Eir, and not just Eir but from any commercial operator, is that there are instances where it is simply non-commercial for them to connect-----</p></speech>

That engagement has happened.  If it is amber that is because the industry told us that it was non-commercial and that they could not make money by connecting those promises.  That meant going that extra 100 or 200 yd.  In some instances, when we investigate these, it can be as simple as being 100 yd but we have to dig across a road.  To dig across a road-----</p></speech>

That would require engineers to look at every single case to see whether it is actually a capacity point back at the exchange or whether a new pole is required that would require a licence, will that pole get planning permission, has ducting to be put in, is a private way leave required etc.  There are many reasons that in the case of a customer who may look commercial to the ordinary person, the commercial operator may come back to us, as the operators have done, to say there are a number of reasons they cannot actually bring the fibre that extra 100 yd.  I have no doubt but that there are instances where it probably could happen.  As Mr. Neary said, if that is the case, then the commercial operator should connect them.</p></speech>

We are looking, for instance, at a case where the Deputy is being told that this is because it is in an amber area, notwithstanding the proximity of a commercial pole, fibre and all of the rest.</p><p>If that operator makes a commercial determination that it wants to do this, it can absolutely do that and there is nothing in how we decide the contract that would prevent it from doing it.</p></speech>

We have had meetings with not just Eir but also SIRO, Virgin Media and many other operators to ask them whether they can connect a given Eircode postcode.  In the vast majority of cases, the operator comes back with reasons it cannot and will not make the connection.  It is happening all the time.</p></speech>

We have connected 200 schools.  Because of Covid, many people now work from home.

All towns and villages have high-speed broadband, whether from Eir, SIRO, Virgin Media or whatever.  For towns and villages, therefore, the broadband connectivity is there and it is a matter of getting the right building.  That is where the local authority and the broadband officer, be it in Cork, Kerry, Limerick or wherever, come in.  They are there to facilitate local people.  If they identify a building that would be appropriate for a broadband or digital hub, they should talk to these people in the first instance, and then apply for grants through the local authority under the town and village renewal scheme-----</p></speech>

I am advised by Cork County Council that it has spent all the money it has received and it is not prepared to engage further in respect of providing additional hubs.  A large part of this area will not get broadband until 2026 and nothing is being done by the local authority or the Departments to try to fast-track some connectivity to the area.</p></speech>

In summary terms, there can be a withholding of the subsidy, and when the milestone is met, there is a recalculation of that milestone subsidy to see whether reductions should be made, having regard to any relief to which the contractor might be entitled under the contract.  There are also performance credits whereby, if certain operational requirements are not met, there can be a deduction or a withholding of subsidy.  The description of the remedial planning process will probably give a good understanding of exactly what we are doing in terms of due diligence on this.</p></speech>

It clearly was both last year and the year before, when Covid hit it hard, so it notified us of the delay.  It might say whether it is delayed by three months, six months or, in the current instance, about 12 months.  If Covid had not been a factor, a significant penalty would probably apply for missed milestones this year, but Covid has been pretty prevalent.  That has been a unique situation for all of us and the contract allows for that.</p> <p>  To return to why we have so many advisers, engineers and whatnot, we have to make a determination independently of NBI, given it will naturally push for the maximum relief possible under the contract in respect of Covid.  Our job is to scrutinise that, get the engineers on the patch and say whether it was NBI's or Covid's fault it was delayed.  It is a difficult determination to make because Covid impacts on everything, from top to bottom of a project, and wreaked havoc in the early parts of last year and this year.  We are turning over every rock to see whether there is a systemic problem within NBI that explains the delay.  If we determine the delay of, say, one, two or three months was down to NBI's project management because it got the plans wrong, we will apply penalties beginning in February this year for every milestone it misses.  In the case of any milestones that have been achieved up to now, no penalties have been applied because they did not apply for the first two years.</p> <p>  For the next-----</p></speech>

What is the milestone for the number of premises passed by the end of this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-10a.811" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022021000002#GG02100"><p>There is a target number of premises passed for each milestone and the aggregate number for the end of the year has yet to be determined.  Earlier today, Mr. Malone from NBI indicated he expects between 100,000 and 130,000 premises to have been constructed.  "Constructed" is different from "passed", as we all understand.  A household being &ldquo;passed&rdquo; is what allows it to order a broadband service.  We do not yet have a number for that from NBI in respect of the end of the year.  We are still scrutinising that because our job is to challenge whether that is the best the operator can do.  We want it to go faster and do more, and my engineers are scrutinising whether that is a credible number and whether we can get the operator to go faster.  That is what we are going through at the moment and in March, we will have a number that, as Mr. Griffin said, we will share with the committee once we are satisfied it is the maximum number it can achieve by the end of the year given the conditions it is working under.</p> <p>  Within that, there are a number of milestones.  There are milestones for all the deployment areas in Louth and Cavan.  Every deployment area has a milestone attached to it.  That is why this year, there could be 15 or 20 milestones we are checking along the way to see whether the operator will achieve them.  There are 227 deployment areas.  That figure has to be multiplied by the number of milestones and there is also a milestone for designs.</p> <p>  For 25 years, including from day one, there are penalties for the key performance indicators, KPIs, that apply.  It is supposed to be a 24-7, 365 service, with some limited time for upgrades to systems and so on.</p><p>However, if NBI goes outside the contract, penalties will apply.  For example, the contract might allow for systems to be fixed between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m, and if it goes beyond that, we will penalise NBI because customers should not have any downtime on the service.  That is what is unique about the broadband network.  Unlike commercial operators-----</p></speech>

For clarity, although I would need to check the transcript, I think I was very clear that I was asking for the figures in respect of properties passed as opposed to properties constructed or any other figures.  The initial target for the end of this year was 180,000.  Today, we are being given potential figures of between 100,000 and 130,000, which seems like a huge variation that has not been fully explained.  My sense of it, which I think is shared by the people who are waiting anxiously to have broadband provision passing their properties, is that NBI appears to be quite confident that any recalculation of targets or milestones will be explainable and, in so far as it is explainable, NBI is satisfied the penalties will not apply.  Do the witnesses think that confidence is misplaced?</p></speech>

A figure was presented to the Department by NBI as part of the interim remedial plan, which was 60,000 by the end of January 2022.  Leaving aside what was provided for in the contract initially, we now know the figure was 34,454 at the end of January.  We are all over that like a rash in terms of the assessment as to whether that target stands up against the root cause analysis and whether there is an entitlement to relief by the contractor.  That is very much in play and there is a huge amount of due diligence being done.</p> <p>  Similarly, before we accept a figure from NBI for 2022, we will do a very detailed assessment ourselves to determine whether it is credible and realistic.  If we sign up both parties to an updated interim remedial plan for 2022 and if those figures are not achieved rolling forward, then penalties will apply against the targets.  From my perspective, there is a level of assurance when we look at the number of premises surveyed, the designs done and the premises at construction.  There is a degree of momentum now that gives us a greater level of assurance.  However, we will look at things very closely and do our own assessment on whatever figure NBI provides to us.  As we said to Deputy Catherine Murphy, we expect that work to be completed by the end of March and we will share it with the committee.</p></speech>

If there are properties that were included in the original NBI contract but which have subsequently been serviced by Eir or another provider, is it the case that NBI can either continue to service them, in which case it will be paid as per the original contract, or it can seek compensation for that?  Am I correct in my overview?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  We had an interesting opportunity to engage with representatives of NBI earlier today.  I have a question regarding the interaction between NBI and the Department.  An issue I raised with NBI was around the knock-on impacts of the Covid pandemic on the original roll-out plan.  Is the Department confident the roll-out will be on target towards the end of this year?</p> <p>  I also want to address the matter of construction inflation.  In every sector, we have seen enormous rises in the cost of construction,  including in respect of labour inputs.  I am aware a fixed agreement is in place regarding the costs for installation.  Does the Department have any concerns about renegotiating that agreement when it expires?  When will the agreement expire?</p></speech>

As of now, we absolutely are of the view the project will be delivered within that.  In fact, NBI is on record at the Oireachtas joint committee meeting last September saying there is no question but that it will be delivered within that time period.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Mulligan to come in on what we are seeing in the construction sector market, including the cost of labour and materials.  One of the mitigations NBI would say is quite effective is that it now has a broad panel of contractors to do work on the ground.  It has pre-procured a lot of the materials and has put in place certain steps to deal with the potential for construction inflation, which we are seeing in other sectors because of demand generally, supply constraints on international markets and so on.  As a general point, Mr. Mulligan might comment on whether we are aware of anything that is of significant concern in that regard at this point.</p></speech>

They have come below the target and saved money on those procurements, which, again, we oversaw.  They have come under budget on materials so far and have good stock for the next two or three years of fibre cable, brackets, poles and everything else.</p><p> On the labour market front, they have a framework with pretty much every major contractor in the State, be it KN Circet, Secto, Actavo, Gaeltec or TLI Group.  They have contracts with Vodafone, Enet and Eir.  They have a very broad scale of contractors up and down the country in every county.  There are currently 1,200 and there will be up to 1,800 by the end of next year and the year after working on the programme.</p><p> There will be pressure points in the market generally on construction.  NBI was, I suppose, ahead of the game to be able to secure contracts and it has secured five seven-year contracts with which it can go to market.  I share its confidence that it should not have a problem.</p></speech>

I am a rural Deputy and I grew up and live in a rural area.  We are living in an intervention area and as it stands, the contractors are working in my region.  A point must be made and I did so on the site visit.  When it comes to telecommunications and access to broadband, phone coverage can be a major problem.  Something I would like to see incorporated in some degree or fashion, now that we are well into the process of rolling out the NBP, is looking at this matter, particularly for those homes that may be waiting until the end of 2026 to be connected.  That is a huge amount of time, a potential four-year wait for people to receive broadband to their homes and getting that direct connection for which the State is paying a very significant amount through State aid.</p> <p>  That point must be made and the Department must take it under consideration.  It must decide if there is scope to work with NBI to try to deliver some degree of value for taxpayers who will not see the benefit of this intervention for up to and over four years.  Is that something that could be considered?  From discussions I have had with people with some degree of expertise in the area, it seems this issue could be solved for well under &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

Much work has been done over the past few years through the mobile phone and broadband task force.  One of the other areas for which our Department is responsible with ComReg is the release of spectrum.  Much work has been done over the past few years to release spectrum, particularly in the bands that are very useful for rural areas and where there is a topography requiring particular types of spectrum.</p></speech>

On the release of spectrum, throughout the pandemic the Minister has temporarily released spectrum to alleviate congestion on mobile phone systems, particularly in rural areas.  It has had a significant impact on the quality and performance of mobile networks outside urban areas.  That was an emergency measure brought in by the Minister to help the phone networks deal with the major uptake in services in rural areas during the pandemic.  The release of spectrum is clearly key to ensuring mobile phone services are delivered appropriately across the country.  The regulator is very much in tune with releasing the largest blocks of spectrum shortly-----</p></speech>

On the national broadband plan, with the roll-out of fixed broadband services to homes, it will enable Wi-Fi within a house and we expect this can be used by a mobile phone user for mobile phone calls.  The plan will dramatically increase the availability of indoor coverage for mobile phone users in rural areas.  It will be a benefit.</p></speech>

The point I am making, just to be crystal clear, is that many houses, taking in tens of thousands of residences in Ireland, will not get any direct broadband connection until 2026.  One might assume this is probably because they are in the most difficult to reach areas and the likelihood, as witnesses are well aware, is that those areas are probably the most problematic when it comes to phone reception as well because of topography challenges.</p> <p>  I have a good example from Germany, where the German Government negotiated the contract before the rolling out of 5G that all areas had to be covered with sufficient 3G services at the time.  It was quite a prudent move.  It is clearly a much larger country with a much denser population so there would not be the same overhead costs in doing that.  There have been other countries looking at the same process.  I am not being critical but I just want to bring the matter to the fore because it is important.  It is not something we often hear about but there are many people out there who are completely cut off.  This project is costing billions of euro, and it would be a very small aspect of it to look to accelerate this over the course of the next while.</p> <p>  I compliment the Department.  This has not been an easy process for it, and we all know and accept that.  I do not want to be overcritical.  I have been on-site to see the work NBI is doing.  It is an enormous task and I do not underestimate the challenges faced by everybody.  I appreciate everybody answering my questions.  Will Mr. Neary make himself available to have a quick discussion later on about some constituency matters?</p></speech>

Figures of approximately &euro;2,000 per connection have been indicated but there is a cost of servicing the overall project of &euro;2.6 billion in State aid and there is also &euro;270 million of investment.  Figures this morning indicate almost 30% take-up.  We might assume the take-up reaches 40%.  If all 540,000 premises and homes take it up, it would work out at &euro;5,000 per house or premises.  If 40% take it up, we are looking at almost &euro;12,000 per household connection.  The charge to the household or premises is &euro;100.  I understand there is deployment and mobilisation etc. to be done in the first year.  In the first year there was less than &euro;100,000 brought in.  Do the witnesses have concerns about that?  There is an overall cost to what we are doing.  I agree with subvention and I understand the process cannot be done commercially.  I support the idea of a national broadband plan but the cost of this at 40% take-up from homes passed is working out at almost &euro;12,000 per household.</p></speech>

The highest figure of which I have heard in that regard is &euro;270 million.  For the first seven months, that is, up to July 2020, there was no representative on the board.

One of the questions we have tried to tease out several times relates to the reason for going with this model when the contribution from the private investor is so small, at just over 9% of the contribution by the taxpayer, which accounts for in excess of 90%.  Why would the Department go with this?  We have learned that the investors are getting 12% compound interest, which, of course, can accumulate significantly, doubling in nearly six years, for example.  The only answer we have been given on the few occasions the matter has been raised is this issue of risk.  In the context of risk, I understand there are supposed to milestones and all that and there are three tiers of those.  This is a project underpinned by the State.  The State has ponied up the money.  It is there.  From the point of view of an investor, investing in this and getting 12% annual return compound interest on an investment underwritten by the State is a sure bet.  If you were a gambler looking at this, it has to be the best investment in town.  People try to play the stock market but this has to be one of the surest bets around.</p></speech>

We did look at a large number of models.  The Chairman is familiar with this from his time on the committee concerned with telecoms.  We looked at full State ownership, a joint venture, the concession type and the gap-funded model.  All of that was done pre-2016.  A Government decision was taken in 2016 that this was the best model that was available.  There were reasons for that, such as the significant reuse of existing private sector infrastructure.  The commercial sector will share the construction and demand risk, and there is significant such risk in the early stages of this project.  The commercial sector will drive economies of scale.  If a strong contract is put in place, which we have done, that will give the State the necessary protections and the State can claw back unused subsidy and share in any excess profits.  That was agreed by the Government in 2016.  We did a project reappraisal in 2018 when we were down to a single bidder.   All the documentation relating to that is in the public domain.  There is &euro;175 million that has been put in by the investors.  That money is at risk.  It does command a rate of return.  That would be expected in respect of any investment in a project of this nature.  We looked at the rates of return that were under consideration when the contract was being finalised.  We did benchmarks internationally, using KPMG, our contact in this regard, and the internal rate of return, IRR, and the interest rate referred to by the Chairman were absolutely typical for projects of this nature where there is significant demand-side risk and an uncertain market.  The Chairman referred to the level of uptake so far.  We are comfortable enough that we are heading in the right direction but there is significant demand uncertainty.  If this was such a sure bet, the uncertainty-----</p></speech>

The Secretary General continued:</p> <blockquote> 	Having expressed our concerns on a number of occasions at this stage in relation to the affordability and value for money of the proposed contract for the National Broadband Plan, I wish to re-emphasise one further time this Department's fundamental concerns in relation to the unprecedented risk that the State is being asked to bear in the event that the current NBP contract is recommended for approval by Government.<br /><br />Any decision to approve the current contract and commit funding of up to &euro;3 billion to this project over 25 years represents a major 'leap of faith' on the part of the Government ...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />we [the Department] do not believe this CBA justifies the use of scarce public funds ... </blockquote> <p>Was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform wrong in that regard?

First, concern around value for money does not only sit within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As the Accounting Officer under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, I am and must be concerned about value for money and the management of public moneys that flow through the Vote of my Department.  All those aspects were considered.</p> <p>  Second, the State could have sat back and decided not to invest in allocating funding to provide high-speed broadband to every premises in rural Ireland.  That was a choice.  We manage risk in the Department.  We have a risk management policy and a risk appetite statement, and we understand the boundaries within which we should operate.  The key aspect of this context is that it is not about avoiding risk, but about understanding the impact of risk on what we are trying to do and whether those risks are being managed.  In the context of all the work we have done and the protections we have built into the contract, we are satisfied that the risk is manageable.  </p></speech>

I refer to the benefits of this project as perceived in 2017 and 2018.  This project is, ultimately, all about these benefits.  We talk about the costs <i>ad nauseam</i>, but there are also huge benefits for every citizen, home and family from the rolling out of high-speed broadband.</p></speech>

Pre-pandemic, nobody thought that people would be working from home.  In its review, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was very conservative in that regard, and rightly so, and decided to not assume that anybody would be working from home or to include that aspect as part of the benefits to be derived from this project.  After the last two years, however, we all now know that everybody is working from home and many people will continue to be hybrid workers in future.  I refer to the benefits of this development in respect of reduced travel and lower carbon emissions, and all those aspects.  When we look at them now with the benefit of hindsight, they are far greater than were ever envisaged.</p></speech>

The improved wireless signal and improved broadband means that many people who could not work from home a few years ago can do so now.  This is the case even before the NBP is rolled out to their areas.  They have worked from home quite successfully.</p></speech>

We are the people who run constituency offices.  We understand full well the significance of the NBP.  We also understand the deficit which exists in respect of the provision of the broadband service.  I think that is self-evident, and I do not think we need to be reminded of it.  I am, however, concerned about the standard of replies that my office receives when contact is made via the dedicated email address for representations to NBI.  I would like to see a greater degree of transparency regarding the number of representations made through that email channel and how many of those representations from the offices of Deputies and Senators are actually resolved.  I refer to a broadband connection ultimately being made.</p> <p>  Whether we like it or not, and whatever about the commercial considerations and the costs, the fact remains that an expectation was created that a service would be rolled out.  The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased or fast-tracked that expectation.  I think we would all agree on that point.  Therefore, a demand and an expectation exist for these services, which I think is a legitimate one.  I refer to people in particular circumstances of which we are all aware, whether down dale or up glen, where there is an expectation of being able to work remotely.  Sometimes there is a perception that people in rural Ireland have particular types of jobs and fulfil particular types of functions.</p><p>I want to remind everyone that the people in rural Ireland are the people with PhDs, MBAs, masters, and they are working remotely across pharma and academia, and that needs to be understood.  They need the access; that is the bottom line.  They are professional people living in these communities and they have a legitimate expectation.  If there is one thing arising from today it is that the quality of engagement with Oireachtas Members should improve such that we can expect legitimately that, when we make representations on behalf of these very people whom I am talking about and there is some sort of priority give to that.  Very often we are the door of last resort for these people because they have tried every other option, given they are more than capable of engaging with the commercial providers themselves and they have done so, but they are coming to us because they have no other place to go.  They have a legitimate expectation of us that we would interface with representatives at <i>nbi.ie </i>and they would then expect, and we would expect, that we would receive some sort of a return, and a deliverable.  The deliverable in this case is a connection ultimately. <br/><br/>That is why I was concerned by the amber map from day one. I do not profess to be an expert in; I am a layman in all of this, not a financial wizard.  I have no technical knowledge in respect of networks or telephony, but I do know what the needs of my constituents are.  I do not see how, in this day and age, there is not some blend of service that could be provided that is a solution for each household.  I do not think there is anything that is insurmountable by way of a solution for every household given the paradigm shift that has taken place.  That is where people like are coming from, quite simply.  We need to get information back to this committee in respect of how many representations have been received by Oireachtas Members and how many of those have been resolved whereby a connection is made.  We need some qualitative and quantitative analysis of those representations in terms of whether they are succeeding through our interventions.<br/><br/>My second point relates to the BCPs.  How many BCPs are up and running and live as we speak?</p></speech>

If not we will take it up with NBI to make sure it is responding in a timely fashion to the concerns raised by Deputies.</p></speech>

I would like Mr. Griffin to go away from this meeting understanding that there is a little village in north County Cork called Ballyhooly, and I deliberately use the example of Ballyhooly because he will remember that name.  There is a new estate in Ballyhooly called Lios Ard, peopled by the professionals I am talking about from all walks of life, and one half of the village can get broadband and the half other cannot.  This is why I am frustrated by this amber mapping.  We all bought into it and now it seems that this amber map has become such an arbitrary tool that we are going to end up with a situation where there will be those people who will have and those who will not all because of a mapping exercise, ultimately.  I do not know what can be done about that.  The question is: what can I tell the people in Lios Ard, Ballyhooly, tomorrow morning?  They are representative of thousands of people throughout this State.  What hope can I give them tomorrow morning that they are going to be guaranteed a connection?  That is the bottom line.  That is ultimately what people want to hear.</p></speech>

There is a number of commercial providers in that area today, and one in particular.  If there are circumstances where the map information we have is incorrect, we will look at that and engage with that operator.  We are happy to do that for the Deputy.</p></speech>

Is there anything within the work those consultants are doing that could be done by augmenting the Department?  If so, has an application for resources been made?  I know this is very different from TII and I accept all that it deals with much larger construction projects.  Will Mr. Griffin give us an idea of what the oversight cost is, in regard to the staffing side within the Department?  Is that different from what was anticipated?  Is there a risk register for missed milestones or issues that were not anticipated?  If so, what kind of issues are identified on that register?  Are there any concerns that aspects of this contract cannot be fulfilled?</p> <p>  Finally, I refer to the ownership.  I asked this of NBI representatives earlier.  I am struggling to get a clear picture of who actually owns National Broadband Ireland.  The contract itself states it is determined by voting rights.  That in itself is determined by who holds the investment or who is entitled to the necessary percentage of dividends, but the threshold is 30%.  Oak Hill owns approximately 49% and NBI owns 51%.  Who is the actual owner of NBI?  I am not at all clear about who owns it.  The issue is further confused by the investors coming in and out but let us leave that aside.  I would like to get clarity as to the beneficial owner.</p></speech>

We have sanction to increase the staff number in the NBP team over the course of this year.  For example, on Mr. Neary's side as the chief technology officer, we are putting in place two senior people at a level below him who will have the capacity to absorb some of the work that perhaps has been undertaken by Analysys Mason.  We have assigned an additional principal officer to the area as well.  We are actually looking at that on an ongoing basis to make sure that we are making best use of the money available to us.</p> <p>   With regard to the risk register, there were risks identified in the project right from the very start and worked through as part of the competitive dialogue process identified when the contract was being submitted to Government for consideration.  Risks are actively managed on a daily basis on the project.  I spoke earlier about the various groups that are in place in terms of governance and the contract liaison board that Mr. Mulligan leads on between the Department and NBI where risk issues, dependencies and, all of that are teased out on a regular basis.  There is an active risk register within the Department that is being worked through.  The usual stuff is impact probability and stuff being moved off and addressed or being elevated as a risk consideration where that risk is more evident at a particular point in time.</p></speech>

On the piece around ownership, I refer to the point I made at the outset that the Minister signed a contract with NBII DAC, 100% owned by Metallah Limited, 100% owned by Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited, of which 50.9% is owned by Granahan McCourt Fund Limited and 49.1% by Tel.IE Broadband Sari, which is the Oak Hill piece.  I am not sure what exactly the Deputy is looking for or how many levels she would like to go up.  There are other investors.

That is within the &euro;2.1 billion in the first instance.  In all contracts, one assumes some level of inflation over 25 years.  The &euro;500 million contingency has catered for unanticipated events such as added inflation.  The &euro;2.6 billion is capped.  On the risk to the consortium and the investors, if there is hyperinflation for longer than we think, the consortium is at risk for that and would have to put in more funding to make up any shortfalls over and above the &euro;175 million.</p></speech>

The level of subsidy we paid out over the past couple of years, at &euro;177 million, would have been absorbed by the design and the build of the network, mobilisation costs, payment of contracts, payment for materials, managed service payments, which would have tied in Enet who provide a service to the NBI, purchase of stock and purchase of equipment.

In regard to the external consultants engaged by the Department, is the payment to them included in the overall contract of price of &euro;2.6 billion?</p></speech>

Is the Department aware of that?</p></speech>

There are mechanisms for the Minister deciding in relation to that.  Given the level of maturity that is coming to the project, it may well be the case, looking at the risk profile, that other investors would want to come in.  There are controls and protections in place in the contract to manage all of that.</p></speech>

In total, taking into account Granahan McCourt Limited and the other funders, there are in the region of 30.  In a project like this, is it unusual to have that many investors?</p></speech>

Where there are international investors, it would not be unusual.</p></speech>

Is there any concern within the Department that these short-term investments have a high yield in terms of, as outlined earlier, a 12% compound interest rate.  Would that be of concern?</p></speech>

They cannot leave unless we approve a replacement.  If company A decides it wants to move its investment to company B, that requires our approval.  Whether company A or company B, the same contractual obligations pertain.  Nothing changes from our perspective.  They still have to put in all the funding that is being committed because it is fully committed in contract with us.</p></speech>

For the purposes of the record, what I said in my opening statement is the state of play in relation to the Eir make-ready programme.  It is a key piece.  We are working hard together.  There is close collaboration, which is essential given that we are relying on the network to deliver.   The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in and I met the chair and CEO of both companies.  We will do that again very shortly.  To ensure the level of predictability that we require looking out to 2022 and 2023, Eir's make-ready programme is a key piece.  That close working relationship needs to continue.  I just wanted to clarify that.</p></speech>
