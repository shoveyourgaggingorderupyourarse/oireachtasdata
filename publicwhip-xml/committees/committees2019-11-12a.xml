We are here to get an update on plans to improve the health and welfare of greyhounds, as a follow-up to a previous appearance before the committee last July.  I welcome from Bord na gCon, Mr. Nyhan, the chairman, Mr. Gerard Dollard, the chief executive officer, Mr. Denis Healy, the veterinary director, and Mr. Pat Herbert, the head of regulation.  I thank them for coming in.  Following from their previous engagement with the committee in July, we requested that they come back to update the committee on how Bord na gCon is tackling these problems and what it is doing to protect and maintain animal welfare across the greyhound industry.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Nyhan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Nyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019111200002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend to update it on the activities of Bord na gCon, especially about the care and welfare of the racing greyhound.  I am accompanied by Mr. Gerard Dollard, chief executive officer, Mr. Denis Healy, veterinary director, and Mr. Pat Herbert, head of regulation.  In July, I outlined to the committee the board's commitment to greyhound welfare and the objective of our strategic plan for 2018 to 2022 to maintain animal welfare at the centre of our industry.  I reiterate Bord na gCon's absolute commitment to the care and welfare of the racing greyhound.  This continues to remain a priority focus for the board.  At the July meeting, I outlined details of a range of initiatives proposed by Bord na gCon and would like to update the committee on the present status of these initiatives.</p> <p>  Traceability has been a priority action for the board following legislative provision being made for such a system in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 which came into effect on 29 May.  A separate board sub-committee was established to devise the appropriate framework for a traceability system for the racing greyhound.  We are commencing the formal tendering process with the issue of an open request for tenders.  When implemented, the system will allow the whereabouts of a racing greyhound to be monitored by the Irish Greyhound Board throughout its life stages, including birth, registration, racing career, changes of ownership and location, and end of life.</p> <p>  The board has approved the acceptance of a tender to provide a scanning and drug sampling system to the board.  This system will allow a significant upgrade of IT infrastructure and progressively move the board from a predominantly paper-based system to an online system.</p> <p>  The establishing of care centres where racing greyhounds can be socialised with other animals and prepared for re-homing in their forever home has also been progressed.  These centre will help the transition between the ending of a racing career and permanent re-homing, having been the subject of an eTenders process.  Sixteen submissions have been received for the provision of care centres at a variety of locations.  These tenders are being evaluated and a recommendation will be brought to the board for consideration very shortly.</p> <p>  Bord na gCon has established a greyhound care fund.  All moneys in the fund are dedicated to initiatives to support and improve the care and welfare of the racing greyhound.  Funding for the care fund comes from the following sources.  Some 50% of all existing sponsorships are assigned to the care fund.  Bord na gCon has undertaken to continue to match existing prize money structures on existing sponsorships.  Some 10% of all admissions, 10% of all restaurant packages and 5% of net tote profits are assigned to the care fund.  In preparing our budget for 2020, it is estimated that &euro;750,000 will be generated for this fund.  Combined with the funding generated in the latter part of 2019, this will ensure a dedicated fund in excess of &euro;1 million for care and welfare initiatives.</p> <p>  The international re-homing initiative with Greyhound Pets of America and Finding Loving Irish Greyhounds Homes Together, a long name which has an acronym of FLIGHT, has also progressed.  Initial transportation of racing greyhounds has taken place to Boston and Atlanta and ongoing discussions are taking place with the representatives of Greyhound Pets of America to establish of a number of hubs across the US to accept retired greyhounds.  The initiatives introduced for fostering and Irish re-homings have been positively received and 51 greyhounds are in foster care as of the end of October 2019.</p><p> This work enhances and progresses Bord na gCon&rsquo;s overall rehoming initiatives in conjunction with the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, a registered charity established and operated by the board, which helped to rehome more than 1,000 retired greyhounds in 2018 and has assisted in the rehoming of more than 800 greyhounds so far this year. </p><p> The confidential greyhound care line and email have been up and running since early July 2019.  This recorded phone line is available 24-7 for members of the public to report greyhound welfare concerns which are followed up by members of Bord na gCon&rsquo;s designated welfare team.  Some 108 calls and emails have been received to the line to 31 October 2019.  These calls cover a range of issues, some not related to care and welfare.  Arising from the calls received, 31 separate welfare investigations have been initiated.  At this point, the status of these investigations is that 11 cases have been investigated and closed, while there are ten open cases currently being investigated.  Three cases have been referred to other authorities and seven cases had been previously investigated and the files closed.  The issues raised in the 31 cases can be summarised as follows: 13 cases referenced export to other countries and 11 reports referenced poor welfare conditions at greyhound premises.  In six of these cases no issues were identified on investigation.  The remaining five cases are currently being investigated and seven cases referred to queries regarding the whereabouts of greyhounds. </p><p> We are continuing our comprehensive programme of welfare-related inspections.  Some 576 inspections have been undertaken in 2019 up to 31 October.  These include welfare inspections, kennel inspections and out-of-competition sampling.  The national greyhound laboratory has processed 5,149 samples to the end of October 2019 with 13 samples, or 0.25 of 1%, returning an adverse analytical finding. </p><p>The Irish Greyhound Board launched its greyhounds at tracks injury support scheme in early August 2019.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide financial assistance up to a maximum of &euro;500 to assist owners to deal with injuries to racing greyhounds where the injury is incurred on a greyhound track licensed by us.  Initial take-up of the scheme has been slow but that has also been the experience in the UK.  It is expected that as the scheme becomes embedded a significant number of applications will be made.  Bord na gCon is budgeting on the basis of 100 such applications during 2020.</p><p> Bord na gCon has prepared a draft of a statutory instrument for consideration by the Minister to require euthanasia of a greyhound to be undertaken only by a veterinary practitioner.  The statutory instrument will be required to be made under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the draft statutory instrument is currently being considered by the Minister and his officials.  </p><p> I again seek to emphasise that the responsibilities of Bord na gCon relate solely to the racing greyhound.  They do not extend to cross-breeds such as lurchers, which are commonly confused with racing greyhounds.  I reiterate the overall position on the export of greyhounds and confirm that Bord na gCon will do everything possible within our remit to prevent the export of greyhounds to countries that do not have acceptable welfare standards.  I wish to make clear, however, that Ireland as a country is not in a position to restrict exports of any animal, including greyhounds, to other countries and must operate under EU law and wider world trade agreements.  Bord na gCon, or any Irish regulator, cannot be held responsible for the appalling attitude to the wider animal welfare issues that may be evident in other countries.  We will, however, continue to promote and advocate for a responsible attitude by the greyhound community to the export of racing greyhounds.  I am satisfied that the greyhound community has been receptive to this message and has acted on foot of same. </p><p> It should be stated that the primary responsibility for the care and welfare of any animal rests with the owner.  The owner&rsquo;s obligations in this regard need to be reinforced and form a legal obligation for which the owner can be held accountable.  The measures, initiatives and schemes put in place by Bord na gCon are to facilitate and support the owner in meeting their obligations in this regard. </p><p> We have prepared an update of the code of practice relating to the care and welfare of the greyhound and an initial draft of same has been considered by the International Greyhound Welfare Forum.  The draft is due for consideration by our board at its meeting next Thursday, 14 November, and following approval, it will be put forward for public consultation as required by the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. </p><p> The board has also agreed additional staffing resources for the care and welfare area to support the expansive care and welfare programme that is in place.   A director of care and welfare is being recruited with the primary role of leading on the care and welfare initiatives and to challenge all stakeholders to further improve behaviour, measures and approaches in the area of care and welfare. </p><p> I am confident that Bord na gCon and the greyhound community has made very significant progress in  improving care and welfare practices within the industry.  This progress can be seen in the last decade particularly with the introduction of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, increased regulation regarding doping and medication within the greyhound industry, which took place in 2015 and the requirement for microchipping for all racing greyhounds, which took effect in 2016.  These measures, combined with the initiatives which I have outlined, and further initiatives which the board will be focused on implementing provide a continuum on which the greyhound community is travelling to achieve a standard of excellence in the care and welfare of the racing greyhound.</p><p> There is no place for cruelty or poor animal welfare practices within the greyhound industry.  We will continue to work with all agencies to eradicate any such behaviour. </p><p> Before I conclude, I must commend also the wider greyhound community, particularly those in Cork and Limerick, who have spearheaded funding initiatives to support greyhound racing at both locations.  These initiatives have been tremendously successful and are testament to the passion and commitment that exists for the sport of greyhound racing. </p><p> We believe our industry is already heavily regulated, and the provisions of the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 will further strengthen this regulation.  We subscribe to the principles of the welfare of our dogs and the integrity of our sport.  We have in place the tools to defend these principles against transgressors.  Greyhound racing has deep roots in the Irish community and our challenge is to preserve our sport for future generations. </p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to come before the committee today.  We will attempt and endeavour to respond to all the committee's questions.  However, if any additional information is required following the meeting, we will provide same in a prompt manner.</p></speech>

I first call Deputy Cahill to put his questions, to be followed by Deputies Stanley and Penrose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019111200002#D00300"><p>I thank Mr. Nyhan for his presentation.  When representatives of the board appear before the committee, I wish to state, as I always do, that I have an interest in the industry.  I am a director of a greyhound track.  I want to put on the record that I have a vested interest in the industry.</p> <p>  I welcome the report.  The "Prime Time Investigates" programme on the industry a few months ago did serious damage to it.  We cannot deny that or put our heads in the sand about it.  The report shows there is considerable work in progress, which I welcome, but still much to be done.  </p> <p>  I will concentrate on the traceability aspect.  We have foolproof traceability in our cattle industry and we must have the same in the greyhound industry.  The sooner we have that up and running, the better.  The fact that every dog is microchipped should make that easy enough to operate.  It is essential to know where every dog is at any given time.  </p> <p>  Mr. Nyhan said 16 submissions have been received for the provision of care centres.  They would get dogs reaccustomed to a different way of life.  When does Mr. Nyhan expect to have them up and running?  How many greyhounds would it be possible for those care centres to cater for in a calendar year?  </p> <p>  A startling element is the level of financial commitment to the care fund from the board from sponsorships, admission receipts, restaurant packages and tote profits.  It should be an ongoing fund and it would be of major benefit in getting to where we want to get in this regard.  One figure in the report that struck me is that foster homes have been found for 51 dogs to date in this country.  That is a long way off where we want to get to on that point..  </p> <p>  Mr. Nyhan said different reports were received on the help line and three of them were referred on welfare grounds.  Whose responsibility is it to prosecute if breaches of welfare are found?  To where will they be progressed?  Is the law adequate to ensure they are progressed to the conclusion to which we would want them to be brought?</p> <p>  Another most welcome initiative is with respect to the euthanasia of a greyhound.  One of the most disturbing aspects of that "Prime Time Investigates" programme was when it showed a dog being taken into a knackery and then being disposed of.</p><p>It is essential to the industry that into the future only a veterinary surgeon can euthanise a greyhound, whatever the reason for it.  The image of what happened to the greyhound in the knackery did untold damage to the industry.  For me, it was probably one of the most disturbing parts of the programme.  In regard to the statutory instrument that is being prepared, as politicians we will do all we can to keep the pressure on to have it introduced as quickly as possible because it is essential.</p><p> On the export of greyhounds, I accept that the board does not have any responsibility for the greyhounds once they leave the country.  Is there a job to be done at EU level to ensure that greyhounds leaving this country for Spain or the UK, to which the vast majority of our greyhounds are exported, do not end up in a country where welfare standards are not of the level required?  In Mr. Nyhan's view, is there something we can do to improve EU policy in this area?</p><p> Returning to the programme, a member of the veterinary profession made claims regarding practices in the industry.  Have those claims been investigated?  If what he said is correct, there are serious actions required.  If not, he has breached the ethics of his profession.  He made very serious accusations in regard to the use of prohibited substances, which portrayed the industry in a very poor light.  I would like to know what follow-up has taken place in regard to the accusations made by that particular individual.  As a veterinary practitioner he should be able to stand over what he said in that programme.  If what he said is true, the situation is serious.  If not, it is equally as serious.</p><p> Reports of the doping of greyhounds and breaches of regulations in terms of the use of prohibited substances reflects badly on the industry.  High-profile trainers have made the headlines in terms of investigations regarding the use of prohibited substances.  In regard to the cases currently under way, where are they at and will sanctions be imposed?  The "Prime Time" programme referenced a high-profile trainer.  Is the legislation introduced a couple of months ago sufficiently robust to enable these investigations to be concluded rapidly?  In the horse racing industry in Ireland, a trainer found guilty of a breach of regulations regarding the use of prohibited substances is rapidly suspended.  One particular high-profile trainer was suspended for two to three years.  The investigations in regard to the greyhound industry are hanging over it like a cloud.  I would welcome an update on where they are at, when they are likely to be concluded, and if people are found guilty, sanctions will be imposed.  There was a report in the media recently in regard to a greyhound that ran in all of the classics having tested for a prohibited substance.  This did serious reputational damage to the industry.  I would like an update in regard to all of the investigations.</p><p> Mr. Nyhan mentioned that 5,149 samples have been taken, of which 13, or 0.25%, were positive.  While 0.25% is low, I would like to know if the breaches were serious in nature and if there are investigations under way in each case.  I refer to Horse Racing Ireland again.  There would be a very plausible reason a horse would fail a test.  While a 0.25% failure rate in the greyhound industry is low, the objective should be an industry in which no tests are failed.  In regard to the 13 test failures, what was the level of breach and what is the status of the investigations in that regard?</p><p> The report is detailed and there is much work in progress in regard to it.  As someone who is involved with greyhounds and as a member of this committee I welcome the report and I compliment Bord na gCon on getting to grips with the issues highlighted in the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme.  It is important to stress that the welfare of greyhounds was always a priority.  It did not just become a priority after the programme.  There may have been room for improvement in regard to euthanasia and the rehoming of greyhounds, but the welfare of greyhounds was always a priority.  The report references the need for assistance where a greyhound is injured on a track.  As someone who owns a greyhound that was injured on a track, that is a welcome initiative.</p><p> This report shows the commitment of Bord na gCon to protecting the reputation of the industry into the future.  It enables us to stand behind the industry.  Prior to this engagement with the witnesses, the committee discussed its work programme in private session.  The funding provided to the greyhound industry from the Exchequer is a matter for discussion in December.  The report before us today makes it easier to stand behind that funding for the industry.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Fortunately, I am accompanied today by people who can answer each of them in detail and I will pass them down the line as they arise.  On the question regarding sanctions, there are people before the courts.  When they are dealt with by the courts, they will be dealt with by Bord na gCon.  We must be conscious of due process.  As members will be aware, we have been challenged before the courts on numerous occasions.  We have to be sure that the sanctions we impose stand up.  We have not been slow in the recent past to impose sanctions on transgressors and we will not be slow in doing so in the future.  On the cases currently before the courts, we will have to be somewhat circumspect in our responses.</p> <p>  On the RT&Eacute; programme, we have submitted a complaint to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in that regard, to which we have not yet had a response.  Our veterinary director is present today.  What the veterinary surgeon had to say in that programme is not correct, and demonstrably not correct.  The substance to which he referred has been tested for every year since 2005 and it has not been detected.  That is a fact.  I will now hand over to the other members of the executive, who will deal with the remaining questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Dollard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019111200002#E00400"><p>I will respond first to Deputy Cahill's questions.  On traceability, we expect that either today or tomorrow we will publish in the <i>EU Journal</i>a tender for the new traceability system.  On care centres, as Mr. Nyhan mentioned in his opening statement, we are in a tender process and we would expect to make decisions before year end, following which we will work out the contracts with those who are successful such that we can have the centres up and running as early as possible in 2020.  On how many will fall out of the process in terms of the number of greyhounds accommodated at each centre, at the initial stage we would anticipate a maximum of 50 being accommodated.  As management processes and the success of the centres become embedded, we will consider extending the accommodation numbers.  On fostering, in July this year we launched additional financial incentives for people who will foster greyhounds.</p><p>We are happy with the take-up to date.  As was mentioned, 51 are in foster homes and a number of new fosterers have come on stream.</p><p> Regarding welfare and the confidential line, the three other cases that refer to other bodies relate to local authorities.  I think one case went to the Irish Coursing Club.  At the end of the day, it is the authority most appropriate for prosecution that will take the prosecution if it arises.  No serious welfare issue has been identified in the cases that have come forward to date.  That gives an indication of the very positive welfare approach by the greyhound community.  There is an open confidential line, yet we have not received any serious welfare complaints at this point.  </p><p> I know the export of greyhounds has been the subject of wide discussion when the Greyhound Racing Act was going through the Oireachtas.  The bottom line is that the export of greyhounds needs to be dealt with at EU level or in wider world trade agreements.  Animal welfare is not a consideration in respect of trade.  Until that changes at either EU or world trade agreement level, it will be very difficult for Ireland to control exports of any animal, including greyhounds.</p><p> The Chairman dealt with the issue of veterinary comments on the RT&Eacute; programme.  With regard to doping and breaches, we have had 13 cases this year which is fewer than we had last year or the year before.  Our level of testing this year will be greater than it was last year or the year before.  The decreasing number of cases shows that the message is getting through and doping and the misuse of medication will not be tolerated in greyhound racing.  If people engage in that practice, they will be caught and the breaches will be identified.  Regarding breaches, every single case goes to the independent control committee, which is entirely independent of the board.  The committee adjudicates on the case and decides what sanctions should be imposed.  </p></speech>

The report is very comprehensive.  The witnesses outlined a number of steps that are being taken by Bord na gCon as the regulator.  It has been said that the RT&Eacute; television programme, which I saw, caused considerable damage.  While some of the information in it may not have been factual, it highlighted serious abuse of animals.  None of us wants to see that.  It was stated that there is a long tradition of greyhound racing in this country.  We want to see it being run properly and animals being looked after.  I welcome the statement, which covers many of the issues like traceability, care centres and the other steps that are being taken with regard to inspections.  According to the statement, 576 inspections were carried out and more than 5,000 samples taken in 2019, which shows that Bord na gCon is doing significant work in this area.</p> <p>  Bord na gCon is a regulatory body that is funded by Government.  From where else does it get funding?  What is the number of staff in Bord na gCon?  What does it see as its key role?  I have the general gist of it but I would like more detail on that.  </p> <p>  The confidential greyhound care line has led to some results.  It was stated that 11 cases were investigated and closed.  Were there any convictions or penalties imposed by Bord na gCon or the courts on the back of those?  Ten cases are being investigated and three were referred to other authorities.  Who are the other authorities?  Regarding the files in seven cases that were investigated and closed, was it the case that there was nothing to see there and everything was okay or was there some kind of outcome in terms of what was required of the owners?  The issues raised in the 31 cases were summarised.  It was said that 11 reports referenced poor welfare conditions at greyhound premises.  Could the witnesses explain this?  What was found in those premises?  </p> <p>  I very much welcome the inspections being carried out by Bord na gCon.  They shows that the organisation is taking its role very seriously.  I think 13 incidents of doping were mentioned.  What is the figure for medication cases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019111200002#F00300"><p>I welcome the representatives from Bord na gCon.  I said on the last occasion that I thought the television programme was significant work by the public service broadcasting service but I also noted that Bord na gCon was annoyed because it never got an opportunity to make rebuttals at the time.  In the interests of balance, there should always be an opportunity to put the countervailing argument so that people can contest allegations they believe to be incorrect.  Nevertheless, the programme was significant and if it heralded or accelerated changes that are required, it has served its purpose.</p> <p>  I am glad to note from the presentation that significant changes have been made at a number of levels across the industry.  Of course, they arose from the 2019 Act, which only came in to force at the end of May.  A significant number of these changes were going to be put in place.  They kept the health and welfare of greyhounds to the fore at all times.  Following recent legislative developments, everybody's focus had to be on the care and welfare of greyhounds and probity and integrity of races to ensure that illegal and performance-enhancing drugs are outlawed, not just verbally but in reality.  The number of tests, the application of rigorous and frequent testing and the imposition of stiff and severe penalties, not slaps on the wrist, when adverse results arise following analysis are critical.  I salute Bord na gCon as it is on the right track.  It is tendering to have analytical devices brought into play.  Long may this continue.  Irrespective of the profile of the individuals involved, if they err or transgress, there should be no sin bin because there has been too much of this.  It should be a case of "out the door with them".  Greyhound racing is a very important industry in rural Ireland.  I have always supported it and will continue to do so once Bord na gCon carries out the steps on which it has embarked to which I have no doubt it is committed.  There can be no room for talking out of both sides of one's mouth.  If something incidental happens, one can understand that but where something is interfering with the fairness and integrity of the sport, there can be no room, irrespective of the personalities involved.</p> <p>  Governance must be an overarching and significant point.  The welfare of greyhounds at home and abroad in areas like breeding, racing and export is paramount.  Perhaps Bord na gCon could encourage the Minister of the day to be at the forefront when it comes to trying to raise at EU level issues pertaining to the export of greyhounds to areas where less than proper welfare standards are applicable.  We should raise this at EU level and get the appropriate standards implemented.</p> <p>  I do not subscribe to codes of a voluntary nature.  It is like somebody at school telling us to do something.  That is the time when we would nearly go and do it.  I can understand the thinking behind it, which involves trying to encourage people to do things in a proper way, but I think the witnesses probably realise that codes of a voluntary nature are not as effective as they would like them to be, notwithstanding that they give everybody an opportunity to comply.  Substantial changes and progress must be made to engender public confidence in the industry.  I think the witnesses know this better than anybody.  </p> <p>  Rehoming is an important initiative.</p><p>Are the locations and organisations involved spread throughout the country or at least to every location where there is a greyhound track?  That would be important.</p><p> Traceability is important.  It is a matter of ensuring real-time and accurate information dealing with all aspects of the greyhound life cycle, from birth to finishing up wherever greyhounds finish.  I refer to the numbers of live registered pups, the number of live registered greyhounds that are breeding, the number registered for track racing, the number registered for coursing, the number exported, the number being euthanised by properly qualified vets, and the number being rehomed.  Work is done on this in Ireland.  What is the number of broods?  </p><p>The unique identifier system is to oversee ownership at all times.  How will it work?  What is the technology pertaining to the total life-cycle of the greyhound?  Will the traceability system be implemented on an all-Ireland basis?  Since we have very close links with Britain, how will it operate, especially in the context of Brexit?  Are the delegates meeting their counterparts in Britain in this regard?</p><p> I am 110% supportive of the assertion that primary responsibility for the care and welfare of greyhounds rests with the individual owner.  This cannot be devolved to anyone else.  Therefore, the focus must be on the owners to ensure they are meeting all the relevant standards set out.</p><p> With regard to the statutory instrument for consideration by the Minister, I notice the board is still waiting.  I cannot understand how Ministers and officials are so tardy.  That is not a matter for the witnesses but I might as well say it anyway.  It might resonate with some in the Department.  As Deputy Cahill said, a significant issue was raised on the television programme.  There is no valid reason the statutory instrument cannot be brought forward.  It is not earth-shattering science.  One could draft a statutory instrument in an hour if paid for it.  They are not too fond of paying anyhow.  Mr. Nyhan would be able to draft an instrument himself fairly quickly.  The instrument is very important.  It is to help the board achieve another objective.  The witnesses can take it that I will be asking the Chairman to communicate directly with the Minister to have the statutory instrument brought forward without any more fiddling around.  I remember the case of a certain statutory instrument when I was a Minister of State for only nine months.  I nearly went mad because I was able to draft it myself in a couple of hours.  Four weeks after drafting, it was still going around in rings like a circling bird.  I got annoyed and made sure it was dealt with.</p><p> Stipendiary stewards are very important.  I know a little about this, maybe because I am a voluntary steward of the Turf Club.  The stewards are important in regard to various controls.  Does the board have the full complement?  The stewards give a very detailed direction to the voluntary stewards, who are not stipendiary.  Control stewards are also important.  They deal with applicable work practices and welfare inspections.  Has the board a programme worked out for inspections?  The inspection programme is key.  While I acknowledge it cannot be implemented all in one slap, has a programme been worked out that will achieve the objectives? </p><p> I am heartened by the presentation today.  It is very positive.  As Deputy Cahill said, it will result in a lot of positivity over the next month or so, when we will have to deal with other issues.  All I can say to the delegates is that they should continue with the work and root out those who are not serving the interests of the industry at all levels.  If they do this, they will have our support.</p></speech>

One can take it as read that everybody on this side of the table is fully in support of that approach and everything we do is designed to ensure abuse is eradicated.</p> <p>  We were asked about Bord na gCon's role.  Very simply, it is a commercial semi-State body responsible for the control, management and development of the greyhound industry in Ireland.  Our origins are in the Greyhound Act 1958, as well as the Greyhound Racing Act 2019, which significantly updates the original legislation.  We are funded through the allocation from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund but there is a significant level of commercial income through sponsorship, tote income, attendance income and restaurant income.  All those elements go towards the funding of the industry.</p> <p>  We carried out a fairly detailed exercise in July on our staffing levels.  There are 39 people at the Limerick head office.  There are 157 employed at the various tracks.  Forty-eight of these are full-time and 109 are part-time.  With regard to our catering division, we do all our own catering.  There are 20 full-time and 329 part-time or casual catering staff.  In our tote, the betting division, there are 261 employees who are part-time or casual.  In all, a total of 806 individuals derive either full-time or part-time employment through the Irish Greyhound Board.</p> <p>  On the greyhound care line, we were asked whether there has been any action on the cases.  It is early in terms of dealing with those cases but we have served five welfare notices so far this year.  We have served ten fines or fixed-payment notices under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act.  I might ask the veterinary director to comment on some of the cases that were dealt with and what is involved.</p> <p>  On Deputy Penrose's points, I appreciate what he is saying about a voluntary code.  It is designed to assist the public regarding the care and welfare of greyhounds.  Everything cannot be provided for in legislation or through statutory regulation.  We regard the code as demonstrating what best practice should be for the care and welfare of a greyhound.</p> <p>  On the unique identifier, I shall ask the head of regulation to give the committee a briefing on traceability, the life cycle, the all-Ireland element and the Greyhound Board of Great Britain element.</p> <p>  On stipendiary stewards, we currently have 21 staff members designated as officers under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act.  We had three stipendiary stewards but this number has been reduced to two.  We have restructured the workload of our control stewards.  The latter are now also involved in welfare inspections.  While the composition and numbers might have changed, I am more than satisfied that the resources exist to ensure sufficient attention is paid to the welfare area.</p> <p>  The veterinary director shall comment on welfare and the head of regulation might talk about traceability.</p></speech>

They involved minor issues, which is good to report.  Thirteen of them pertained to exports to other countries.  In each case where the greyhounds were traced back to an Irish individual, a steward or welfare officer visited the individual and took a statement.  Section 10 of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act requires that the Irish Coursing Club be informed of the movement of greyhounds, or export from a premises.  This must be done within 14 days.  Where we found that movement was not reported within 14 days, we investigated whether it was possible to prosecute.  Some of the cases were historic.  Where a case is within the past 12 months, we can proceed.  If not, it is effectively statute-barred.</p> <p>  There were poor hygiene conditions in some of the premises, including a lack of hygiene in areas where dogs were exercised.  In some cases, the premises were wet.  There was poor lighting in some instances.</p><p>There were cases involving questions about the whereabouts of other greyhounds and whether they had been sent out of the country.  Such cases were investigated and we were able to obtain statements that some of the dogs had been transported to the North and then onwards to a third country through mainland Britain.  There were no major welfare issues in the cases investigated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Herbert" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019111200002#H00200"><p>In response to Deputy Penrose, I will run through the traceability model.  The issue of traceability has been a significant focus for the board in recent months.  I can reassure the committee that a significant amount of work has been put into it.  As mentioned at the most recent meeting of the committee on this issue, the cattle movement and monitoring system was considered.  We travelled to Clonakilty to meet the providers of that service.  We met our Australian counterparts and received an update on how the Australian system was run.  We also met our counterparts from the Greyhound Board of Great Britain.  The Irish Grehound Board, IGB established a workshop with the specific function of developing and evolving a robust traceability model that would meet the requirements of the industry.  It will be all-inclusive in Ireland.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill referred to his involvement in the greyhound industry and will be familiar with many of my points.  As he stated, every dog, including greyhounds, is subject to the microchipping regulations of 2015.  The microchipping of greyhounds is carried out at 12 weeks by IGB and Irish Coursing Club, ICC, stewards.  They are also given an ear tattoo at 12 weeks.  This provides a robust data set model for the measurement of greyhound whelps in the country.  The registrations can refer specifically to the whelp pedigree, include registration details of sire and dam, the location of whelps, the controller of whelps, the age, sex and number of whelps from a particular litter, microchip details and ear tattoo details.  There is also an input of details on greyhounds assigned for the specific purpose of greyhound racing.  </p> <p>  Deputy Penrose referred to the requirement for real-time information.  It is a game changer.  This information must be available in real time.  The Chairman referred to a scanning project to be carried out at tracks.  It is envisaged that the traceability model and scanning at tracks will feed into our systems, including our race card generation system which is known as a race management system.  The traceability model will include a reporting function for owners and breeders to feed into the traceability model.  It will include details such as the death of a sapling from natural causes or euthanasia; the sale or export of a sapling, to include country of destination; a greyhound's retirement as a pet which will debar it from further racing; and retention of a greyhound for racing.  It will be possible to edit details such as a change of location or controller.  There will also be a provision such that if details are not appropriately updated, further registrations will be prevented.  That will apply to a breeder or owner and payment of prize money to the owner or breeder will also be prevented in future drawdown.  Like every system, the intention is to promote compliance.  It will include details on the loss or theft of a greyhound.  The use of an app or web portal will facilitate data inputs.  The ICC will be informed of notifications such as the death of a greyhound.  The traceability model will focus on changes in status related to key life events of every greyhound.  In conjunction with the scanning project, it will be able to ascertain on point of racing or trialling whether all appropriate updates have been provided when a greyhound is presented for its first trial.  If they have not been, the greyhound will not be allowed to trial until the updates have been provided.</p> <p>  Deputies Penrose and Cahilll referred to the cattle monitoring and movement system.  Ours must be a robust and foolproof system.  If a dog is allowed to race without the details having been updated, it will compromise the integrity of the system.  Once appropriate updates are provided, the greyhound will be permitted to trial and race.  The traceability model will need to include all life events when a greyhound commences racing such as trial and race form, changes of ownership and the export of the greyhound.  As Deputy Cahill will be aware, 85% of greyhounds registered in the United Kingdom are of Irish origin.  The retirement, rehoming, death, loss or theft of a greyhound will also be recorded.  The scanning project to which the Chair referred will include the recording of the microchip and ear mark, something which has previously been carried out as a paper exercise.  The digital recording of the microchip and examination of the ear tattoo, in addition to the certificate of registration, will ensure there will be three methods of proving integrity before a greyhound will be accepted for racing.  It will cover all areas such as racing, trials, veterinary reports, stewards' inspections at premises, welfare inspections and sampling which is currently a paper exercise.  The added functionality of the system will mean that when a steward arrives at a premises, he or she will able to bring up a report on what greyhounds should be present and will have advance warning in that regard.</p> <p>  The 2019 Act will provide for the regulated exchange of information between the IGB and the ICC.  It is envisaged that there will also be an exchange of information between the Greyhound Board of Great Britain and our system, subject to legal compliance and data protection regulations.</p></speech>

He or she will have a seat at the executive table and be responsible for driving caring initiative functions throughout the organisation.  That will be the biggest driver of change.  Although we have staff who currently deal with these issues, we should have one person for whom it is his or her sole function.</p> <p>  The second initiative will be the rehoming of greyhounds in America.  There is room for a significant increase in the number of dogs travelling to America.  It is in its infancy, but in the longer term there will be a significant appetite in America for greyhounds as pets.  We will be able to service that market once we are satisfied with the chain in delivering dogs to America and ensuring their welfare there.  They are the two biggest advances that will happen.</p></speech>

It will provide an outlet for people to have their greyhounds rehomed.  As far as we are concerned, the primary responsibility for a greyhound lies with the owner, but we wish to facilitate a situation where, when an owner is finished with a greyhound as a racing dog, the greyhound will have another life.  That is the driving force behind the initiative.</p></speech>

Annually, at budget time, the board will have to decide on the allocation of resources to welfare, notwithstanding the availability of the care fund.  The care fund, combined with the resources we assign to welfare in any event through staff engaged directly for welfare purposes, will ensure there will be a significant pot of money to focus on care and welfare.  It will be reviewed annually because the care fund comprises a percentage of admissions and of restaurant packages, which will vary.

It is a priority of the board.  Whatever resources are needed to pursue the activities and initiatives that are necessary for care and welfare will be funded.  Traceability, rehoming, fostering, care centres and the injury scheme are the five main actions we are focusing on funding and bringing into effect.</p></speech>

Shelbourne Park holds races four nights per week.  Any animal that races at the speed of greyhounds will be susceptible to injury.  Overall, our injury statistics have reduced in recent years because of the focus we have put on track management and maintenance.  If there is a racing schedule of four nights per week, with ten or 12 races per night, a risk of injury is inevitable.  It is like any sport involving high speeds.</p> <p>  The veterinary director might like to comment further.</p></speech>

An injury might include anything from a cut pad on the foot or a laceration on a leg to a fractured hock or limb.  The percentage of injuries at Shelbourne Park this year in respect of the number of starters was 0.22%.  Where it was a severe injury, a decision was taken by the veterinarian, in conjunction with the owner, to put the greyhound to sleep.  The number of greyhounds put to sleep at Shelbourne Park thus far this year is three.</p></speech>

The death of any greyhound is regrettable in any circumstances.  We have trained staff at the track and they are updated regularly, specifically as to best practice in regard to track maintenance.  We have specific equipment at tracks for the maintenance of those tracks, such as power harrows, and tracks are dug every week and put back.  The Deputy mentioned Shelbourne, where the whole racing surface has been refurbished this year and has been relaid and re-cambered, and a new irrigation system has gone in.  Every effort is made at track level to ensure the safest racing surface possible.  It is a matter of pride among track maintenance staff at tracks.  Nobody is more affected by any greyhound casualty than our ground maintenance staff.</p></speech>

Many issues have been covered regarding the infrastructure, the care fund and the IT upgrade, which are all very positive steps.  I want to ask about the promotion of the dog racing industry and how we are faring on that level.  One of the major races in my part of the world, the Irish Laurels, took place two weeks ago.  There was a fantastic crowd and it was a massive success for my parish, given the winning trainer for the last two Laurels came from my small parish.  However, I failed to see a picture published in any newspaper, very little press and no acknowledgement of one of the major sporting events in the calendar in my county.  I am concerned about the current promotion of dog racing, whether the media are onside or offside, and whether there is a strategy in place to develop those connections with the media to try to promote the sport.  I am deeply concerned by what I saw, given a small parish won the Laurels two years in a row and there was no picture in the local newspapers.  This was deeply upsetting for the owner, the community and the trainer.  I am concerned about where the strategy is going.  Do the witnesses believe the media have simply turned against us and turned against the dog racing industry?  Where do we now turn to promote dog racing?</p></speech>

When we have questions in our heads and they are answered in the report we are given, it always sends a very positive sign.  The question that is left after all of the other speakers have asked their questions is probably a continuation of Senator Lombard's point, namely, what fallout there has there on the back of the television programme.  The care fund is a percentage of the restaurant takings, the sponsorship and the tote.  What financial hit did they take and what corrective actions is the board taking to bring those figures back to where they would be?  If things took a <i>pro rata </i>hit after the programme, it means that the percentage of funding going to the care fund also took a hit, which would be contradictory in certain ways, given the programme aimed to improve the welfare and well-being of greyhounds.  I would like to know what financial hit the industry took, how that affected the percentage contribution that is going to the care fund, what corrective measures have been taken and how close the industry is to getting back to the <i>status quo</i>or improving its position.</p></speech>

They have clearly acknowledged the challenges and the hit the sector took as a result of the "Prime Time" programme.  The sector is very important nationally and, in particular, to some of our rural areas.  In order for it to thrive, it is important it maintains public support and, for it to be successful into the future, a lot will depend on people attending and participating in greyhound racing.  There is no doubt the participation level has been challenged by what has come to pass.  I know Bord na gCon is very much aware of this and is taking the measures required to restore public confidence in the sector, and we would certainly be supportive of it in that regard.  However, it is very important that job is thought through very thoroughly and that the issues which were raised in regard to traceability and welfare are fully addressed in a verifiable way that can be stood over.  In the future, there is no doubt there will be a spotlight on this and that the systems the board put in place will be tested, rightly so.  They have to be able to stand up to that scrutiny, which is essential from a public confidence point of view and, most of all, from a greyhound welfare point of view.</p> <p>  The witnesses might address one question that has been coming to us from members of the public, that is, the categorisation of greyhounds as livestock as opposed to as pets.  What are the implications and considerations around that? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Nyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019111200002#K01400"><p>I will deal with the questions in the order in which they have been asked.  In response to Senator Lombard, we do what we can in terms of promoting our industry.  We have a full-time media officer and we have public relations and promotion people within our staff.  Like the Senator, I was there the night that event took place.  All of the reports and photographs were submitted to all of the newspapers but, unfortunately, we find it hard to get heard.  In fact, the situation now is that we welcome appearances before committees like this because it allows us to get our message out there.  Unfortunately, there is a reluctant reluctance to report on the positive side of our industry, and we believe there is a positive side.  All we can do is keep trying and we will do that.  The man the Senator spoke of was the greyhound personality of the year last night and there was a presentation, but I do not think we saw a photograph of that today either, unfortunately.  We will keep trying.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Daly, it is the same situation.  We suffered some significant loss in attendances following the programme, particularly in the period immediately after the programme, which I presume was inevitable.  Thankfully, the situation in October has shown a significant improvement and we hope that is the start of an even more significant improvement.  However, we did undoubtedly suffer a significant blow at the time.  The figures we have given to the committee for the care fund take that into account.  We have figures to year-end based on our current position, and our budget for next year has taken account of the fact we suffered some significant losses this year. </p> <p>  In response to Deputy McConalogue, the designation as livestock is for the protection of the greyhound because it allows a significant amount of legislation to protect the welfare of the greyhound as a sporting animal.  They are not pets during their racing life; they are racing animals.  They have to be looked after when they are finished their racing life, and that is where the transition back to pet takes place.</p><p>During their racing lives, though, they require the designation of livestock to ensure they have the protection of the various statutes and are properly looked after.</p></speech>

If there are no further questions, that concludes our business for today.  I thank the witnesses for appearing before us and updating us on how matters stand.

I welcome the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  He is accompanied by officials from the Department of Finance, Mr. John McCarthy, Ms Anne-Marie Walsh, Ms Deirdre Donaghy and Mr. Paul Cotter, and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Ronnie Downes and Mr. John Kinnane.  I thank the Minister for attending this post-budget scrutiny session.  This opportunity to engage with the Minister is an important point in our committee's calendar.  We acknowledge the assistance of his officials in the ongoing scrutiny undertaken by our committee.  I ask the Minister to begin with his opening statement and then we will have questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I look forward to a good exchange of views.  I remind the committee of the Government's main priority in the framing of budget 2020, which is to help our economy and society to deal with the potential impacts of a disorderly Brexit.  As the committee is aware, on 11 September the Government agreed to base budget 2020 on the assumption of a disorderly Brexit at the end of October.  A primary reason for making this decision was to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario.  Although the risk of a disorderly Brexit in 2019 has clearly receded, considerable uncertainty remains with regard to the final outcome.  Consequently, assuming a no-deal Brexit ensures that the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to be able to meet this exceptional challenge, while preserving the longer-term sustainability of our public finances.  Those sectors and regions most affected by a disorderly Brexit will be supported through timely, temporary and targeted measures.  Before taking into account certain Brexit-related costs of &euro;1.2 billion and timing-related cash costs of &euro;169 million, the overall increase in core voted expenditure on public services and infrastructure in 2020 is estimated at more than &euro;3.3 billion</p><p>After taking account of discretionary revenue-raising measures of more than &euro;400 million, this results in a net budgetary package of more than &euro;2.9 billion.  This package is broadly in line with the amount of &euro;2.8 billion set out in the summer economic statement that would apply under the orderly Brexit scenario.  Further, taking into account commentary, including advice received from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in relation to in-year spending increases, two things have happened.  The first is that a significant effort has been made this year to reduce the level of Supplementary Estimates that are required, without jeopardising our ability to meet the public service needs of our citizens and, second, the additional funding increases for this year have been carried into our budget day package for next year.  This package is consistent with the advice we have received from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council but more broadly, is appropriate given the current position in the economic cycle and the risks in the external environment.</p><p> As outlined on budget day, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government will intervene to protect the impacted sectors and regions.  This funding will be borrowed money used to protect our economy.  If a no-deal Brexit does not happen, the money will not be borrowed for other purposes.  In the event of it happening, &euro;650 million of expenditure and funding will be available to be released in different waves and additional funding for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will be made available but that will only happen in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  Mitigating the effects of Brexit has been a feature not just of budget 2020 but also of the past three years' work.  This has included initiatives to increase competitiveness and put in place greater resilience in our economy.  For these ongoing initiatives, which are already in place, approximately &euro;200 million is included within the departmental allocations published on budget day.  This amount is additional to the &euro;1.2 billion noted earlier.</p><p> Since I published budget 2020 on 8 October, an extension of the EU's deadline for withdrawal to 31 January 2020 has been agreed.  As such, the risk of the UK departing the EU without a deal has been averted for now.  However, the ultimate outcome is still uncertain and a disorderly Brexit is still possible.  We hope that the UK's withdrawal will take place on the basis of the deal agreed between the UK and the EU at the October European Council, while also awaiting the outcome of the UK's general election.  The extension of the Article 50 exit point means there is likely to be some upside to my Department's forecasts.  However, if the withdrawal agreement is ratified, Ireland's position will improve with increased revenues and lower expenditure than forecast in budget 2020.  Growth could be expected to be in the order of 3.1% for next year, approximately 2.5% higher than forecast.  In addition, the general Government balance could be around 0.5% of national income or gross domestic product in 2020.</p><p> Furthermore, I want to indicate to the committee, because of the distinct possibility of stronger corporation tax receipts, it is conceivable that the fiscal position for this year could be better than assumed at budget time.  However, that depends on the continued careful and improved management of public expenditure.  As such, I will make a call on the end-year position following the publication of the November fiscal monitor, given that November is the single most important month of the year for tax receipts.  In addition, the Government is committed to running surpluses over the medium term, to reduce our debt and guard against risks such as the possible transient nature of some corporation tax receipts and potential reductions in revenue as a result of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project.</p><p> Our public finances continue to move in the right direction and this is testament to the right policies in recent years.  However, Brexit is not the only risk we face.  Due to the highly open nature of the economy, our public finances are always vulnerable to potential knock-on impacts from a shift in tone in global trade.  Should these risks not materialise, the principal risks then relate to potential overheating if the economy approaches full employment and changes in other jurisdictions affect the competitiveness of our corporation tax regime.</p><p> Going forward, we must continue to build on the hard-won gains of recent years and ensure our public finances remain on a stable and secure footing.  Some of the policies I have implemented in this regard include the establishment of the rainy day fund, which I will say a word about now, and, in addition, we must continue to maintain a broad and stable tax base to ensure the State's finances continue to be financed properly.</p><p> I am happy to tell the committee that I commenced the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund or the rainy day fund on Thursday, 31 October.  On foot of commencement and the necessary delegation order to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, regarding the management of the fund, I then directed the NTMA to transfer &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to the rainy day fund by 30 November.  In preparing budget 2020, I set out that a disorderly Brexit was the baseline scenario for budget planning purposes, and therefore a budget deficit was in prospect.  On that basis, I decided that there would be no transfer of &euro;500 million from the Exchequer in 2019 to the rainy day fund.  That will remain as a cash balance and, in particular in the context of a no-deal Brexit, will be used to meet the Exchequer funding requirement that would arise, which in turn will then be used for public spending priorities.  However, on budget day, I also set out that the funds transferred to the rainy day fund can be deployed in the event that the economic impact of a disorderly Brexit is larger than assumed.</p><p> I will now turn to the fiscal position.  Our economy has performed well in the year to date.  Gross domestic product growth of 5.5% is expected for 2019, which is generating for now a planned surplus of 0.2% of national income.  It is worth noting that this surplus could have been in the region of 1% to 1.25% of national income had the Government not increased capital expenditure from levels prevailing in 2016.  Public capital investment will increase this year by 22%.  Unemployment, at 4.8%, is now at its lowest level since 2012.  The end-October Exchequer returns indicate that tax revenues are up 6.7%, driven by broad-based buoyancy in all major tax heads.  We expect to meet our tax revenue target of &euro;58.6 billion by year end.  This represents a &euro;200 million increase on the stability programme update, SPU, forecast.</p><p> Turning to the outlook for next year, the economy is forecast to grow by just over 0.7% if we have to deal with a disorderly Brexit.  However, even in that scenario, our economy will grow.  It will be a two-speed economy with continued growth in the multinational-led sectors but a much more difficult situation in UK-facing sectors.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, my Department is forecasting a deficit of 0.6% of national income and we also expect to see a slower increase in the rate of employment.  However, as I stated on budget day and, as outlined by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, there is much more uncertainty regarding short-term prospects than is normally the case.</p><p> I will now turn to expenditure and give a brief overview of the outturn.</p><p>At the end of October total gross voted expenditure was just over &euro;53.5 billion, made up of &euro;48.9 billion in current expenditure and &euro;4.7 billion in capital expenditure.  The amount is &euro;3.6 billion, or 7.2%, ahead of the outturn for the same period in 2018.  Of this, &euro;2.7 billion relates to current expenditure, while just over &euro;900 million relates to capital expenditure which, as I stated, will be up by over one fifth by the end of the year.  This is broadly in line with the projections set out on budget day when the need for additional spending was announced for 2019 in a number of areas.  </p><p> The biggest pressure remains in the health sector, with the 2020 expenditure report outlining the potential scale of the Supplementary Estimate.  In recognition of the risks arising in health expenditure in recent years, a new health budget oversight group was established this year, incorporating members from the Department of Health and the HSE and chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The purpose of the group is to monitor health spending and staffing against the current budget allocation and act as an early warning mechanism for any deviation.  It is fair to say that while further progress is required in 2020 on health expenditure, the expenditure management position in 2019 is very different from what it was when I appeared in front of the committee last November.</p><p> In recent years the Government's priority has been capital investment.  We have seen a 90% increase since 2016.  Making large strategic capital investments was the right course of action in recent years, given the large fall-off during the crisis period.  Given the scale of investment in recent years, the growth rate is set to decline to more normal levels from 2022 onwards. </p><p> From a debt perspective, an important milestone is in prospect for this year, namely, that the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, GDP, is projected to fall below the 60% threshold set in the Stability and Growth Pact for the first time in the post-crisis period.  Having said that and as I stated on a number of occasions, our debt burden remains highly elevated and is forecast at 100.2% of GNI* for 2019, albeit declining to 97.4% in 2020.  Reducing the nominal level must be our priority.  In that context, at budget time my Department projected a surplus in headline terms of 0.2% of national income for this year.  However, given that the external economic outlook is deteriorating and the remaining uncertainty surrounding Brexit, our policy approach should be to run budget surpluses into the future if the economy continues to perform strongly and to use them to reduce the national debt.  Furthermore, windfall receipts that arise from the State reducing its involvement in the banking and financial sectors will be used to reduce the level of public debt.  We must continue to prepare for the inevitable slowdown, ensuring we do not spend money we might not have in the future and building on the achievements thus far. </p><p> Corporation tax revenue has been growing strongly, driven by increased company profitability.  Receipts to the end of October stand at 10.6% ahead of target.  November is the largest collection month of the year and we expect receipts to be stronger than forecast.  Ireland has been very successful for several decades in attracting leading multinationals.  Given the size of these multinational firms and our high level of integration with the global economy, we have seen the corporation tax base become somewhat concentrated, with the ten largest firms accounting for approximately 45% of all corporation tax receipts. </p><p> While Ireland's corporation tax receipts as a proportion of economic activity are broadly in line with those of other small, open, trading European economies, the Government is still acutely aware of the risks associated with the concentration of receipts.  That is why we will continue to broaden the tax base, prioritise the reduction of debt and run Exchequer surpluses in the future and for now.  In addition, on budget day my Department published a scoping paper entitled, Addressing Fiscal Vulnerabilities, to identify possible solutions and initiate a discussion on how best to mitigate our increasing reliance on corporation tax receipts.  The paper also sets out several proposals to ensure our fiscal rules will not contribute to budgetary imbalances.  I am considering them.  My Department will undertake a further assessment of corporation tax receipts in the context of the OECD process.  It will be published next March.</p><p> I will turn to specific matters I understand the committee wants to discuss.  On our expenditure review, a sustainable expenditure policy needs to meet certain key requirements, including ensuring the overall level of expenditure remains affordable and delivering sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  Consequently, this requires that expenditure growth be set at a level that is consistent with the longer term growth potential of the economy and that there be an ongoing focus on the quality of expenditure.  In that regard, spending review papers provide an evidence base for departmental spending that informs budgetary choices.  The spending review process is aligned with the Estimates process as most papers are published in July or August each year.  In addition, given the rolling nature of the spending review process, the analysis produced in one year can help in other years.  The findings of spending review papers feed into the policy process by providing evidence to make well informed decisions in the relevant policy area. </p><p> I wish to comment on the demographic pressures and their impact on the budget.  The population is young, but this will change in the coming decades.  Last September my Department published a report entitled, Population Ageing and the Public Finances in Ireland.  It outlines that the ratio of retirees to workers is set to more than double by 2050.  There are around five persons of working age for each person aged 65 years and over.  By 2050, the equivalent figure will be just over two.  The greying of the population will have an adverse impact on the public finances, with age-related expenditure expected to rise by 6% of GDP by 2070.  Accommodating demography-related costs was a feature of budget 2020.  As with previous budgets, budget 2020 includes &euro;500 million for demographic pressures in the areas of health, social protection and education.  These allocations are informed by the paper Budgetary Impacts of Changing Demographics 2017&ndash;2027 which was published by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  An updated paper was published alongside budget 2020. </p><p> While we are potentially heading into choppier economic waters, we do so from a position of relative strength.  We do not have the imbalances that marked the economy a decade ago.  There is no credit-driven bubble, for example, but there is still uncertainty about the final outcome of Brexit.  Consequently, we must seek to continue to manage our finances next year within the parameters set out on budget day, with borrowing to fund the Brexit contingency measures to be triggered only in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  </p><p> I again thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak today.  I will be happy to address questions members may have.</p></speech>

He stated towards the end of his contribution that we were potentially heading into choppier economic waters.  He spoke about uncertain times and the hopes for an orderly Brexit.  He also flagged the issue of overheating.</p><p>The Supplementary Estimate for health will be limited to &euro;335 million.  The fiscal monitor continues to show health expenditure below profile, which we know is not reflective of the true picture.  Are there plans to make the fiscal monitor more reflective of the actual in-year health position?  Will the Minister update the committee on the status of the health budget oversight group to which he referred?  The committee has previously called for the minutes of the group meetings to be published.  Are there plans to do this?  Aside from health, are there other areas of expenditure about which the Minister is concerned?  What is being done to manage overruns in other areas?  What is the updated position on Brexit?  The Minister has mentioned the various deal and no deal possibilities.  If there is a Brexit deal and the UK remains in the EU until the end of 2020 will additional resources be available for allocation next year?  Will an additional transfer be made to the rainy day fund should a Brexit agreement be finalised?  I will come back to ask further questions later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#G00200"><p>That is a substantial list of questions for the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#G00300"><p>I will work through each of them in turn.  I do not expect my Supplementary Estimates to vary from what I indicated on budget day.  I expect they will be broadly in line with what we announced on budget day.  Sometimes there is a degree of change because there are technical issues in various Departments that require an intervention but I am confident the figures I outlined on budget day, and where we will stand with those figures, will be in line with what I indicated, which is a figure of approximately &euro;660 million.  That figure includes the funding needed for the Christmas bonus.  I do not expect a significant change beyond what I have indicated.</p> <p>  I am confident the health Supplementary Estimate will be in line with what I indicated on budget day.  With regard to the November fiscal monitor and the Deputy's point on the lag between it and the figures coming out of the HSE, which show a difference in the budgetary position, I have asked Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials to inquire into this matter.  While in previous years we saw a gap between the published HSE position and the fiscal monitor that we publish each month, it is fair to say that for this year the gap is wider than we saw in other years.  The officials will look into the issue as we close out this year.  It is worthwhile saying the Supplementary Estimate we have agreed with the Department of Health looks potentially large in the context of the November fiscal monitor but we have it at that level with an expectation of convergence between our fiscal monitor and the HSE figures when we move into December and January.  It is predicated on the basis of careful planning that stretches beyond the fiscal monitor.  I do not propose to introduce other significant Supplementary Estimates.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on the minutes of the health budget oversight group, given that they are released through freedom of information requests I see no reason not to publish them on the Department's website and we will begin to do that.</p> <p>  With regard to Brexit and likely outcomes, it is fair to say at this point that the risk of a no-deal Brexit for 2019 has clearly receded.  Given all the experience I have built up as, I am sure, has the Deputy, of trying to predict what will happen with Brexit and then other things going on to happen, I will only reach a view on what will happen with Brexit once I see a withdrawal agreement pass through the House of Commons, we are completely clear on the content of that withdrawal agreement and we see it ratified.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit with additional money being made available for other priorities, while I know the priorities are great in many parts of society, I do not plan to change the budget in the event of the country avoiding a no-deal Brexit.  When we get into the first half of next year, the stability programme update, which we will do by 31 April, and the economic statement, which we will do in May, June or July, will give us a perspective and opportunity to assess where the economy stands if a no-deal Brexit is avoided.  We have done one budget for 2020 and it is my strong view there should not be another budget until October 2020.</p></speech>

Regarding his final point, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill is before the D&aacute;il this week and the bulk of social welfare recipients, who are often to the pin of the collar trying to survive, did not get increases in what was another austerity budget.  Who can predict what will happen in British politics but if 2020 turns out to be like 2019, is there not a strong case to target more resources at people dependent on pensions and social protection?  Should that be the case, we would be able to afford it so is there not a strong case to have another budget, given that the Minister did not have a budget worth talking about.  It was a non-budget last month.</p> <p>  In the spending review cycle how do Departments decide on what topics will be included in the spending review?  How has it turned out with regard to what was planned when the review on particular areas was taking place?  Have the findings of the review been incorporated into policy in various expenditure areas?</p> <p>  Following up the questions that have been asked about health, we all saw a lengthy interview last Sunday with the CEO of the HSE, in which he seemed to indicate the overspend of &euro;335 million and that we will have a Supplementary Estimate for it.  Has the Minister received his plan?  He spoke about publishing it yesterday or at the weekend.  Does he have his operational plan for 2020?  I know it has a specific technical name.  Some people thought we did not have a plan for 2019.  How do we know what resources the CEO of the HSE and all of his 120,000 staff will need in 2020 when we do not know what they are planning to do with regard to acute hospital beds, waiting lists, the treatment fund, more consultants, more GPs and all of the issues we hear about day in and day out?</p> <p>  With regard to corporation tax, the Minister has been speaking all the time about broadening the tax base but what exactly has he done to do so?  He mentioned the 45% dependence on corporation tax from these large companies that have headquarters not too far away from this building.  How does he see that panning out as time goes on?  With regard to stamp duty and capital taxation in the October fiscal monitor, stamp duty seems to be cumulatively well behind by &euro;100 million.  What is the Minister doing in this territory?</p> <p>  With regard to the topic of the hour, besides Brexit, namely, climate change, are Departments working intensively on the overall packages that will be needed to retrofit all homes in the country?</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has given some figures for different areas relating to decarbonising transport, such as with cycling and using electric vehicles.  Car taxes and excise duties were traditionally a huge bedrock of revenue, but do we have a master plan for the next five years to enable us to make up for the gaps in duties while providing the necessary funding to decarbonise this country seriously from 2030 onwards?</p></speech>

A Department may recommend a topic to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or we may recommend one to it.  The topics tend to be worked on between both Departments.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about health.  I understand that the Department of Health has received the HSE service action plan for next year and is considering it.  There was a HSE service plan for this year.  I was also asked what I had done to broaden the base of corporation tax, and I can point to five measures in this area.  First, I have reversed the lower VAT rate on the hospitality and services sector.  Second, I increased betting duty.  Third, I changed the taxation on commercial property.  Fourth, I have increased carbon tax and, fifth, I have left the entry points for USC and income tax unchanged, as I have done in all my budgets.  The Deputy is correct about the decline in stamp duty up to October.  That has been driven by a decrease in the number of share transactions, upon which stamp duty is paid.  We will have to look at what is driving that and see if the trend continues into November.  The underperformance of stamp duty on share transactions has been the key issue this year.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how we were engaging with different Departments on climate change.  The process is being led by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, with my active support, and all our engagement in this area takes place through the climate action plan.  Yesterday, I visited Lough Ree and was reminded of the many changes we have to make to deal with the huge challenge of climate change.</p></speech>

Work has also been done by industry bodies.  I do not have the figure for the total budget for this at the moment, but we can write to the committee with details.  Some &euro;13 million from the change in carbon pricing is going into the warmer homes scheme run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give the committee an update on the provisions that were made in the budget for a Brexit contingency fund?  Given that there has not yet been a deal, I assume the fund will not be drawn down.  What is the provision for the funding in that case?  Is it returned to the rainy day fund?  What amount is contingent on a no-deal Brexit?  Given that a decision is not likely until the end of January, is that section of the budget on hold pending developments in the UK?</p></speech>

If a no-deal Brexit does not happen, the money will not be used for any other purpose and would transfer into an improved surplus position for next year of 0.5% of our national income.  We would see a swing from an expected deficit next year of 0.6% of national income to a surplus of 0.5%.  We have discussed this kind of surplus and we have responded to issues raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We need to bring the issue of corporation tax receipts more onto our horizon.  Last week, the OECD published its public consultation paper on global minimum effective tax rates, and change is coming in this area.  That change will begin to take shape in 2020, and in order for Ireland to maintain and further build its reputation from the point of view of legitimacy, we need to be inside the OECD framework and we need to get ready for the change by continuing to run budget day surpluses.</p></speech>

Our reputation will be best served by supporting and agreeing to the OECD setting a minimum corporate tax rate and, even if it is higher than the current 12.5% rate, it is our duty as a responsible country.  In Europe, &euro;1 trillion is lost through tax avoidance measures, so we need to support such a move.  Does the Department have any sense of what a potential rate might be if the OECD did this?  Does it have anything to suggest that, as I suspect, adherence to a minimum tax rate would actually increase our corporate tax revenue?  This would mean we should support it not just for reputational reasons but for fiscal gain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#H01400"><p>There are two different pillars of the potential OECD framework.  Pillar 1 relates to taxing where value is created and pillar 2 refers to the requirement for a global minimum effective tax rate.  The Deputy referred to our responsibility and Ireland has not received the recognition it has merited for the scale of change we have made to our tax code.  Looking forward, I am clear that to continue to be legitimate in using corporate tax policy to make ourselves competitive, we need to be inside an OECD framework.  I favour pillar 1 as the way we can craft a potential landing zone that manages the different priorities we have.</p><p> Within the OECD we depend on influence and negotiation.  Many big countries within the OECD will be looking to ensure their national interests are protected.  I do not have a rate in mind.  If a rate is created, it is work for the OECD to do.  It is not my place to speculate on what the figure could be, given that I believe the bedding in of that principle could present a challenge for Ireland.  I do not believe we are likely to face a revenue gain as a result of such a change.</p><p> I believe we will see corporation tax receipts increase again this year as I indicated in my statement to the committee.  It is very likely that they will increase again next year.  I believe our corporation tax receipts will plateau and then decline at some point.  That could be for any one of a number of reasons, but I will highlight three.  First, the phase of corporate profitability many large companies are going through could begin to change in the future.  The second is the effect of OECD measures on our share of global tax profits.  The third is that we could see other countries begin to adopt more competitive attitudes towards corporation tax rates.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the greying of the population.  I am one of the people to whom he was referring.  I recognise that he has allocated &euro;500 million to address these demographic changes and the committee is working on examining them.  Will he commit to supporting that work and provide the detailed information that will be requested by us to carry it out?  I have three questions about the pressures mentioned.  What challenges will the demographic changes present to the public finances?  Will any major policy change be required in the immediate term to mitigate any of the risks?  How do those increased allocations made in budget 2020 to meet the cost of demographic changes compare to what the Departments requested?</p> <p>  The second element is equality budgeting.  Why was the equality budget statement not produced in announcing budget 2020?  When will the Minister be in a position to produce an equality budget statement?</p></speech>

For 2020 we have provided a sum of &euro;451 million; for 2021, &euro;455 million; and for 2022, &euro;455 million.  In my statement to the committee I outlined some of the medium-term consequences of demographic changes.  I have made the point that in coming years we will see a really big change in the ratio between the numbers of people at work and not at work.  That will have an impact on the amounts we will raise in tax and the amounts spent.</p> <p>  We have defined demographics in terms of the age profile of citizens.  Particularly as a result of my engagement with the Department of Health, I have become increasingly aware that because, thankfully, people are living for longer, related expenditure is growing.  We will need to be able to respond to conditions such as dementia and others that are likely to be prolonged the longer people live.  We will need to reconsider this issue in the medium term to ensure we will have the correct level of provisioning for it.</p> <p>  On equality budgeting, I have been informed that we did not publish the statement on budget day because we had received quite a significant report on it from the OECD.  It contained ten recommendations that it asked us to take into account in the development of our equality budgets.  We are studying the report.  I will come back to the Deputy with a date by which we expect to be able to publish a response to the report.</p></speech>

At one time there used to be three or four pages in the budget day document, but on this occasion there was no such information as far as anybody could see.</p> <p>  The Minister has said he anticipates that we will receive at least the same amount in corporation tax in 2020.  Obviously, international trade wars, Brexit, etc. could have a major impact on what might happen, but is there any indication as to when the corporation tax yield might plateau?</p></speech>

We have since published the information we had available on the distributional analysis of budget 2020.  It is to be found on the Department's website at <i>budget.gov.ie</i>.  I will outline the figures for the Deputy.</p><p>It is estimated that 29% of households will benefit as a result of the announced direct tax and welfare measures announced.  A total of 71% of households are due to experience no change in the level of their disposable income.  They are the headlines figures.  The key reason is that the changes were very small and focused.  As the Deputy said, the social welfare changes were focused in targeted measures as opposed to changes in broad rates.</p><p>The Deputy asked what I expected to see happen with the corporation tax yield.  I expect to see them grow again next year, as published in our tax forecast for 2020 which was published on budget day.  At this point it is difficult to specify the timing of the change I indicated because one of the key variables is what will happen in the OECD's work which will not conclude until the end of next year at the earliest.  It will only be possible to give an informed answer to the Deputy's question once we are clear on the impact of that work and when the findings will be implemented.  We will not be clear on it until this time next year.</p></speech>

It is overseen by both Secretaries General and that will continue to be available and will be made available in advance of any election.  This is just a practical matter but if big and exciting new proposals are being developed, the quicker they are shared with the two Departments, the quicker the Departments will be able to give the committee an informed cost.  However, I can assure the committee that the Departments will not be sharing those ideas with me.  </p></speech>

In light of the European element and Brexit in general, does the Minister see our contribution to the EU budget increasing significantly in a post-Brexit world?  When we look at things we want to protect like CAP, this has put us in a position where we have made a commitment to consider increasing that contribution.  Has the Minister received feedback on this from other European countries?  When one looks at the scale of the promised spending that seems to be planned in the UK in its preparations for a post-Brexit scenario, is there a case for us to consider the same scale of spending?  I do not necessarily subscribe to this view.  They think it is a good idea in the UK in light of much of the fallout from Brexit.  What impacts on them will impact on us.  What is the Minister's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#K00600"><p>Regarding the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, we will be contributing more to the budget.  Later on in the D&aacute;il this week, I will outline some of the issues and questions regarding all of this.  The tone among my fellow finance ministers on the topic is very mixed.  Many colleagues are resolutely opposed to any increase while a small number are willing to see some increase and quite a few are looking for a decrease in the contribution they make.  A smaller number is looking for a decrease in the scale of some parts of the EU budget.  The scale of national contribution to the EU budget is a major topic of political debate in a number of other EU countries.  Ireland has only recently become a net contributor, as the Deputy is aware.  Ireland has now become the third highest contributor <i>per capita</i>.  One of the main reasons why we have become a net contributor so quickly is because of the scale of national income growth here in a post-crisis period.  The EU uses gross national income in a modified way to calculate a country's budgetary contribution.  I expect that it will increase in the future.  I will be making the case that an increased contribution from Ireland in terms of maintaining our current percentage contribution but seeing our national income grow in the future is something we should consider doing because the Single Market is of incalculable value to Ireland.  Putting measures in place to support its development across the European Union is very much in our long-term national interest.  The flip side of it is increased budget contributions to the EU.  As that means we cannot spend that money on other things in Ireland, we need to get that balance right.  The next question that tends to be put to me concerns the figure.  It is a negotiation in which we are involved and it is not appropriate to lay out that figure at the moment.  Even if we were to maintain the tab unchanged, it would mean that Ireland will pay more in the future for the simple reason that our national income is growing.</p><p>As for what is happening in other countries, for example, the current debate in the UK, there has been a hint of that in the questions I have received to date from other members of the committee.  There are three things to be aware of as we look at where we are.  The first is the huge scale of capital expenditure growth that has already occurred in Ireland.  In 2016, we were spending &euro;4.2 billion per year in capital expenditure.  For 2020, that equivalent figure will be nearly &euro;8.2 billion.  We have seen a really big increase in capital investment across the past number of years, which I decided was the appropriate response to a post-crisis society and all of the challenges we face in terms of housing, homelessness and investment in carbon change in our economy.  We have implemented the capital expansion that is being debated elsewhere in Ireland and it is under way.  </p><p>The second point is that our level of national debt is still very high when looked at in the right way for Ireland and we need to be aware of the challenges we may face in the future regarding corporation tax receipts.  This is why running surpluses would be so important.  Let us bear in mind that in the pre-crisis period a decade ago, we were running surpluses and we still got into awful difficulty.  This was for many different reasons and lots of those other reasons are not present in our economy but it still shows the need to have surpluses because I believe that as we move into future years, we will face challenges that will be different to those we faced a decade ago.  </p><p>The Deputy will be well aware of the third point, which is that the UK has its own currency and central bank and will be running higher deficits in the future if it makes this decision.  We have our own currency but we share it with hundreds of millions of other people.  We have our own Central Bank but key monetary policy decisions are made by the European Central Bank.  We forget all of that at our peril and we forgot it previously.  </p></speech>

I am joined by senior colleagues who were involved in the subsequent investigations.</p> <p>  The EPA has a wide range of regulatory functions which it discharges through licensing, enforcement, guidance and co-operation with other regulatory bodies.  In addition, under section 63 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, as amended, it has a supervisory role in the environmental performance of local authorities.  Two distinct issues raised on the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme prompted investigations by the EPA, namely, leaks to the environment from fluid filled cables in ESB Networks' distribution system and the management and control by ESB Networks of SF6 gas at the ESB's Moneypoint generating station, including the ESB Networks compound.  I propose to address each of these investigations in turn.</p> <p>  The first investigation concerned leaks to the environment from fluid filled cables in ESB Networks' distribution system.  The EPA first became aware of the extent of losses of fluid from underground ESB Networks electricity cables in May following the receipt of inquiries from RT&Eacute;.  It subsequently received a letter from ESB Networks on 27 May which briefly outlined the extent of the underground fluid filled cables, the nature of the insulating fluid, the leaks associated with the cables, questions about possible reporting obligations to the EPA and a request for a meeting.</p> <p>  Concerned that there might be consequential environmental damage, a possible need for remedial actions and a failure to meet statutory environmental reporting obligations, the EPA undertook to investigate the matters.  We met representatives of ESB Networks on 11 June when ESB Networks agreed to prepare a report on the extent and nature of fluid-filled cables, the types of fluid used and their classification, the maintenance and monitoring of cables for leaks by ESB Networks, actions and procedures to be followed when a leak is detected, as well as the extent of the leaks and the reporting to regulatory bodies ESB Networks had undertaken on the leaks.  Withd these reports from ESB Networks, we were able to define the scope and objectives of the investigation, details of which are set out in our written submission to the committee.  </p> <p>  Turning to the fluid filled cables and based on the information provided, the EPA understands 221 km of underground fluid filled electrical cables were installed by ESB Networks between 1950 and 1989, of which approximately 44 km have since been replaced with non-fluid polyethylene cables.  Since 1980 there has been a gradual transition from fluid filled to polyethylene cables.  Fluid filled cables remain functional for the transmission of electricity.  However, owing to deterioration, vegetative intrusion and/or third party excavation works, the cables may leak fluid to the environment.  ESB Networks has confirmed that 68 historical leaks occurred from fluid filled cables located within four local authority areas between 1993 and June 2019.  In addition, there have been seven "current and new" leaks since June.  ESB Networks has stated it was "not able to locate any information on identified leaks or rate of leakage prior to 1993".  Table 1 in our written submission gives some of the data for the last decade.</p> <p>  The fluid used as an insulating liquid in the cables was originally mineral oil and, thereafter, linear alkylbenzene.  When the cables lose fluid to the environment as the result of a leak, it must be replaced to ensure continuity of electricity transmission.  Addition of fluid continues until the leak is located and repaired.  Cable fluid added to the cables prior to approximately 1986 was mineral oil; thereafter linear alkylbenzene was used as the replacement fluid.  Mineral oil is classified as hazardous, whereas linear alkylbenzene has been classified as non-hazardous since January.  ESB Networks has identified that the fluid lost in the cable leaks is often a mix of mineral oil and linear alkyl benzene and that such a mixture must be classified as hazardous.  Linear alkylbenzene will biodegrade in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas mineral oil is not readily biodegradable in the environment.  ESB Networks has commenced a process of assessing the impact of all leaks from fluid filled cables.  The assessments are being completed in accordance with relevant EPA guidance and site specific and may involve site investigations to establish the impact, if any, and identify appropriate remedial measures, as necessary.</p> <p>  Moving to a brief examination of the applicable legislation in considering these issues, there are four relevant items.  They are the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, as amended; the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, as amended; the European Communities (Environmental Liability) Regulations 2008, as amended; and the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010, as amended.  In particular, section 14 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, as amended, requires a person responsible for the discharge of any polluting matter "which enters or is likely to enter any waters" to notify the relevant local authority.  Local authorities are the principal response agencies for water pollution incidents.  As fluid filled cable leaks involve a discharge of polluting matter, they come within the scope of that requirement.  The European Communities (Environmental Liability) Regulations 2008, as amended, came into operation on 1 April and require an operator to take measures to prevent environmental damage where there is an imminent threat or further damage if damage has already occurred.  Operators must also notify the EPA of any imminent threat or case of environmental damage.  A failure to comply is an offence liable to prosecution.</p> <p>  The EPA required ESB Networks to complete a screening of all leaks that had occurred since April.  The screening identified four leaks, with the potential to cause environmental damage.  On 8 October the EPA issued four separate directions to ESB Networks requiring the submission of a site assessment report by 31 October and instructing ESB Networks to take preventive measures, as required in the European Communities (Environmental Liability) Regulations 2008, as amended, should an imminent threat of environmental damage be established.  A response to the directions was received by the EPA from ESB Networks on 31 October.  The EPA has assessed the four responses received and is satisfied that no further action is required under the regulations in three of the cases.  It is seeking further information on one case.</p> <p>  The main conclusions in the first investigation were as follows.  There were 68 historical leaks between 1993 and June 2019.  There have been a further seven "current and new" leaks since June.</p><p>The locations and scale of each leak have been identified by ESB Networks and it is undertaking site-specific investigations of each.  While ESB Networks reports that it consulted a relevant authority regarding 20 of the 68 leaks identified prior to June 2019, it failed in the case of 48 leaks to notify local authorities in accordance with section 14(1) of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act.  ESB Networks failed to screen the impact of fluid leaks which occurred since 1 April 2009, for the applicability under regulations Nos. 7 and 9 of the European Communities (Environmental Liability) Regulations 2008, as amended, until after June 2019. </p><p> ESB Networks has established two protocols since June 2019 to deal with historic and future leaks and the EPA is satisfied with the approach and protocols now being implemented by the company to assess each leak and to engage with the relevant local authorities.  The EPA acknowledges that decommissioning of fluid filled cables can be a challenging process but considers fluid filled cables that have a high occurrence of leakage and are in proximity to sensitive receptors should be prioritised for decommissioning.  The agency is finalising a full report on this investigation and documenting its findings and recommendations with a view to publication in the coming weeks. </p><p> The second investigation concerned the management and control of SF6 gas at the ESB generating station at Moneypoint, including the ESB Networks compound.  The EPA is designated as the competent authority in Ireland for the purposes of fluorinated greenhouse gas regulations 2016 and 2014.  As the competent authority, the agency is responsible for compliance, monitoring and enforcement of these regulations.  Following the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme, the agency carried out an assessment of the management and control of SF6 gas at Moneypoint.  It should be noted that SF6 is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 23,000 times that of CO&sup2;.  The EPA investigation comprised a two-day site visit in June 2019 during which the storage of SF6 was inspected and records assessed.  Additional records were requested during and subsequent to the site visit which were considered as part of the overall assessment.  A report on EPA findings is currently being finalised and will issue to ESB at Moneypoint in the coming weeks.  </p><p> Preliminary findings of the EPA investigation indicate that management and control of SF6 at the Moneypoint site is operationally rather than environmentally focused, with sustained and prolonged leaks from equipment within the ESB Networks compound.  There are four substations within the ESB Networks compound relevant to SF6.  ESB Networks data indicates that 2,376 kg of SF6 leaked from one of the substations since 2013.  This represents 0.02% of Ireland&rsquo;s total national greenhouse gas emissions over the period.  The general approach to corrective action by ESB Networks was to top up equipment with SF6 rather than undertake repair.  Records available at the time of the EPA site visit relating to the management of SF6 losses from equipment and associated top-ups were inadequate to control and minimise leakage of SF6.  During the EPA site visit, these records were insufficient to support the determination of SF6 losses and associated leakage rates.  ESB Networks subsequently provided data to support its estimates of SF6 leakage at Moneypoint for assessment by the EPA.  The site does not have a robust system for the management, labelling and storage of recovered SF6.  The old 400 kV substation was fully de-energised in June 2019.  ESB Networks states that since this substation was de-energised, leakage of SF6 is no longer an issue.  The EPA is seeking verification of this assertion and the removal of any remaining SF6 before finalising its report.  The data provided by ESB Networks indicates that the new substations installed since 2013 are currently operating at the site and have not required top-ups of SF6 since installation.  The final conclusion is that ESB Moneypoint, failed to report SF6 leaks to the EPA in accordance with its industrial emissions licence and ESB Networks failed to report emissions of SF6 under European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register requirements.  The EPA is considering its enforcement position under applicable legislation and is finalising a full report on this investigation with a view to publication in the coming weeks.   </p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members for their patience and for allowing me to read this statement into the record.  I assure the committee that the EPA will complete those investigations and reports will issue shortly.  I thank members for their attention and am happy to address any questions they may have. </p></speech>

Dr. Ryan said that of the 68 leaks identified prior to June 2019, the ESB did not comply with section 14 (1) of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act in 48 cases, in that it did not report them to relevant local authority, namely the Dublin councils.

The EPA has been so frank and open that there is not a lot to question in the detail.  ESB Networks clearly had information that it did not share with the appropriate authorities.  It was aware of the leaks because it did provide information on them to the EPA at a later stage.  It is clear that at a minimum, the company failed in its reporting duties, which is significant.  It is also clear that none of this would have come to light but for the good work of a whistleblower in conjunction with our public service broadcaster, which frames my first question.  Was the first information received by the EPA as a result of that broadcast in the middle of this year?</p></speech>

We were aware of two leaks, as I outlined in my opening statement.  One leak was in 2012 and related to ESB marina; the other was in 2006 and related to the ESB generating station at Poolbeg.  One of those was within the perimeter of a licensed facility and we dealt with that in that context and closed it out.  The other one was just outside a licensed facility and we advised that it be reported to the local authority.</p></speech>

We have had difficulties with the ESB in the past regarding the way in which the whistleblower was being treated.  I know this is a HR issue and I do not want to get into it but the EPA recognises the importance from an environmental perspective of the information provided by the whistleblower.  If the committee were to send any message, it should be recognition of the important role the whistleblower has played in bringing this important matter to the fore.  In his written submission, Dr. Ryan stated SF6 as a greenhouse gas has a global warming potential of 23,000 times that of CO2.  This is pretty stark when we look at it in these terms.  He went on to say that it represented 0.02% of Ireland's total national greenhouse gas emissions over that period.  This is striking, as is that ESB Networks did not maintain an appropriate inventory or appropriate controls over a gas that is so harmful to the environment.  We have come to believe over time, and rightly so because of the personnel in ESB Networks, the quality of what they do and the brand recognition of the company, that by and large it is a very good company that is very well run but at a time like this when we see significant failings it is important that it is documented and appropriate action is taken.  I am sure it will help the company to comply better in future.  I thank the witnesses for their work.</p></speech>

Dr. Ryan mentioned a particular issue that arose in the programme, which was responded to in detail, but I will raise another issue while I have the opportunity to do so as the EPA is before the committee.  This is the boil water notice that has been served because of the Leixlip water treatment plant in particular.  It is a local issue for me but it is also a local issue for most of the greater Dublin area.  The EPA was involved in an audit.  Will the witnesses briefly describe the results of that audit?  Was the audit strategic or operational?  I understand three samples were taken.  Was it an emergency audit to see whether the water was drinkable again?  Was it a procedural audit regarding what could be done differently in future to prevent a recurrence?  I appreciate the EPA was, to an extent, stepping into the breach on this occasion.  What body is the primary regulator?  How can we stop it happening now and in future?  This is the big question.  If the witnesses would indulge me on this, I would be very grateful.</p></speech>

Last Friday, the EPA conducted an audit in response to the incident to try to verify the performance of the plant at that point to assist in the gathering of information that would be required for the HSE, in conjunction with Irish Water, to lift that boil water notice.  We carried out our audit.  A series of sampling has to take place and the HSE must be satisfied those samples are clear.  A meeting is taking place this afternoon to assess the outcome of that series of samples with a view, if everything is okay, to lifting the boil water notice.

Irish Water has to notify the EPA whenever there is a failure to meet a water quality standard or if there is an incident that affects the quality of drinking water.  Aside from this, we carry out an auditing programme of the water treatment plants throughout the country where some of the audits are carried out in response to incidents and others are carried out at plants that are performing adequately as a random check of those.  We have an ongoing role.  At the end of the year, every monitoring result carried out on drinking water taps throughout the country is submitted to the EPA.  There are almost 200,000 test results.

One was on an EPA licensed site and we dealt with it in that context.  The other was outside a site and the ESB was referred to the local authorities.  The onus and obligation for reporting leaks is on the ESB.  If they take place in the general environment as most of these did, they are reported to the local authorities.  It is for the local authority to take action.  The first thing the local authority will be interested in is a site-specific impact assessment and whether any damage was done locally.  The ESB has undertaken to do a site-specific assessment in all 68 cases.  The work will take some time but it is committed to doing it and will do so on a risk-based schedule that will take into account and give primary focus to leaks that may have occurred in or close to sensitive areas.  Additional enforcement action will be a matter for the local authorities if they feel prosecution is warranted.  This will be a matter that local authorities will consider first.  When it comes to the environmental liability directive, it is for the EPA to take enforcement action if it sees fit.  We are just concluding our investigation.  We have not concluded on that matter yet.</p></speech>

During an earlier hearing, I asked Mr. Paddy Hayes whether the ESB had contacted the EPA and he said it had not.  He said the ESB thought it was appropriate just to contact the local authority.

Dr. Ryan is saying that it did not take environmental responsibility.  There were prolonged leaks for a sustained period with a lack of due recording of a remarkably virulent greenhouse gas.

I welcome and support the independence and rigour of the EPA.  What we have heard today backs up and validates what Mr. Seamus O'Loughlin said to the committee.  As Deputy Dooley says, it is further justification of the good work that RT&Eacute; did, in presenting some of his analysis.  It is a dark day for the ESB, for a company which needs to have the highest of environmental standards.  To have the State's Environmental Protection Agency issue such a judgment on just one example of what we have heard today is very serious for ESB.</p></speech>

I do not want to get into details but, as have others here, I have had considerable interaction with the whistleblower.  He has gone through hell in this time.  For some time, the ESB sought to distance itself from discussing the individual issues of the whistleblower.  I think we should invite the ESB to attend, in private if necessary to protect all concerned.  We will probably be having a debate in another module about the funding of RT&Eacute; and assisting it in its continued investigative work.  It is quite striking that the EPA would come before us and tell us that if it was not for the actions of the whistleblower and the capacity of "RT&Eacute; Investigates" to put together such an important report, this really damaging event would not have been addressed.  Who knows where that would have gone or if it would have continued?  At least now ESB Networks is in the crosshairs.  It is under the watchful eye of the EPA.  I am sure it will comply now that the cat is out of the bag.  It is important work that the committee needs to finish.  I thank the EPA for its important role in taking this step but I suggest that we still have more work to do.</p></speech>

That is why, in the regulatory world, if we find that something has happened and an organisation has not reported it, we take it all the more seriously.  On the leaks and the SF6, the regulations and appropriate powers are in place.  I do not think that we have identified anything additional that we would require in that context.</p></speech>

This is not a fly-by-night operator that is trying to cut margins.  It has a monopoly.  It is a large-scale company.  The principle of self-reporting works well.  It is how Revenue collects its money from the vast majority of taxpayers who, in the last number of days, have been filing their returns.  It does so on the basis of people making an open and frank disclosure.  That is why it is particularly troubling when one looks at the breadth of events that have taken place that have not been reported.  One would have to believe that there is a culture of non-reporting.  Dr. Ryan identified that the only two reports the EPA received were for areas that were on or very close to a licensed operator.  It is fine if it was done within the confines of a licensed environment but if it was further afield and it was a real issue, does Dr. Ryan find it strange that nothing was referenced?</p></speech>

The ESB example is a good one in that it has put the protocols in place for future occurrences.  There are ongoing issues and since this was detected there have been seven more occurrences.  ESB has been dealing with those appropriately and reporting them to the local authorities.  It is committed to doing site-specific assessments.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak today about the Central Bank&rsquo;s work in regulating and supervising the insurance industry and specifically the practices of differential pricing and dual pricing.</p> <p>  Insurance serves a critical role in the functioning of a modern society, through reducing uncertainty by protecting people and businesses against the risks of future events.  Policyholders rely on insurance to provide support in the event of loss or serious accident, plan for retirement, enable them to confidently invest in and run their businesses and much more besides.  Consequently, a functioning financial services system that sustainably serves the needs of the economy and its consumers requires fully functioning and trustworthy insurance markets and firms.</p> <p>  We are responsible for the prudential supervision of insurance companies and overseeing compliance with the Central Bank's conduct of business rules.  We are also responsible for the supervision of conduct of business in Ireland, including in the context of consumer protection.  Prudential supervision seeks to ensure that insurance firms remain solvent.  That is to say, that insurers are able to pay claims in full as they fall due.  Given that claims are paid long after the premiums are set, this requires a forward looking assessment with respect to the entire business of the insurance company, including its solvency. </p> <p>  Our risk-based supervision of insurance firms seeks to ensure that the system, as a whole, and individual firms operating within it, are appropriately resilient.  It seeks to ensure that regulated firms have the following: sufficient financial resources, capital and liquidity, including under a plausible but severe stress; sustainable business models to enable them to operate through the economic cycle; are well run, appropriately governed, have effective risk management and control functions and appropriate cultures; and can recover if they get into difficulty or can be resolved without significant taxpayer support.</p> <p>  The Consumer Protection Code 2012 protects the interests of consumers in their dealings with insurers and is central to our conduct of business mandate.  Regulated insurance firms, which underwrite and sell insurance, must act honestly and fairly in the best interests of both their consumer and the integrity of the market.   Firms must fully disclose all relevant information, including charges, in a way that seeks to inform their customers.  In particular, we expect firms to focus on delivering fair outcomes for customers and not solely on maximising shareholder return and ensure that all consumers are treated fairly at all stages of their relationship and that treating customers fairly is an integral part of the good governance and corporate culture of all firms.</p> <p>  Our prudential and conduct supervisory tools include on-site inspections, thematic reviews and regular engagement with industry, including board and senior management.  Over the past two years, in particular, we have focused on mitigating potential risks to consumers from a hard Brexit scenario, and addressing cross-border emerging risks.  Other core work includes focusing on emerging issues such as cyber risk and recovery and resolution.  Our 2018 annual performance statement specifies the work undertaken, in particular, to protect consumers from the risks of disorderly failure and inadequate reserving at certain firms.  In addition, in line with the report of the cost of insurance working group, the Central Bank has set up the national claims information database, which will provide further public information about the relationship between insurance premiums and related costs.</p> <p>  In recent weeks, we have further strengthened protections for consumers in two key areas.  On 1 November, the Central Bank introduced new regulations requiring insurers to provide individual policyholders with details of the premium paid for private motor insurance renewals in the previous year.  This information must feature prominently on the same page as the renewal premium.  Motor insurers must also now provide a quotation for each policy option available to the customer such as comprehensive, third-party fire and theft cover or third-party only.  In addition, insurers must also extend the renewal notification period from 15 to 20 working days for motor, health, damage to property and general liability insurance to allow policyholders more time to seek comparison quotes.  These measures provide greater transparency to customers and will help them to make more informed decisions and allows policyholders more time to seek comparison quotes.</p> <p>  In September, we introduced new rules to ensure transparency of commission arrangements between financial intermediaries, such as brokers and financial advisers, and product producers such as banks and insurance firms, and to minimise the risk of conflicts of interest relating to commissions.  From 31 March 2020, intermediaries will be required to publish details of the commissions they receive from product producers on their website.  The Central Bank will no longer permit intermediaries to describe themselves and their regulated activities as independent where they accept and retain commission in circumstances where advice is provided.  Free hospitality for intermediaries such as golf trips and sporting event tickets will also be prohibited under the new rules.</p> <p>  The Central Bank does not have a role in setting prices of insurance policies or in the approval of proposed increases in premium rates.  However, insurance firms must treat customers fairly and comply with the consumer protection code.</p> <p>  We are on record, through our behaviour and culture report, in hearings with this committee and through numerous other channels, as to the culture we expect to see in the financial services firms we regulate, including insurance firms.  In our supervisory engagements with chairs and chief executives of insurance firms, we drive home the message that culture is set from the top down.  Boards and senior management must ensure that firms' pricing practices are compliant with the code.   The Central Bank also requires boards to be aware of, have oversight of and be able to stand over pricing and underwriting strategies.</p> <p>  In 2018, the Central Bank conducted a thematic review, examining a sample of the pricing and underwriting information supplied to boards at 12 general insurance firms.  We found that two thirds of this sample required improvement.  As a result, we instructed firms to improve their oversight and governance of pricing strategies to ensure that they are subject to appropriate board challenge and scrutiny, and meet the high standards required.</p> <p>  As with all the sectors we regulate, our assertive risk-based supervision of insurance firms is underpinned by robust regulatory and enforcement action.  In February 2018, we directed an insurance firm to cease writing business with immediate effect and successfully applied to the High Court to appoint a provisional administrator.  In December 2018, we fined and reprimanded a leading insurance firm after finding the firm failed to establish and maintain technical reserves in respect of underwriting liabilities, and failed to have administrative and accounting procedures and internal control mechanisms that were sound and adequate.  </p> <p>  Before describing our work in the area of differential pricing in more detail, some context may be helpful.  Differential pricing differentiates between customers on considerations other than the cost of claims and expenses.  It describes a range of techniques that combine information about expected claims experience, customer behaviour, tendency to renew or shop around.  Differential pricing techniques are being widely used across many industries.  For example, airlines, hotels, telecoms and online retail sites.</p> <p>  While differential pricing has been used in the insurance industry for some time, in more recent years the tools available for differential pricing have become increasingly sophisticated with greater access to big data, more granular assessment and more accurate modelling techniques brought about by new technology.  The environment is increasingly complex and the Central Bank, in common with other national competent authorities, is adjusting its supervision of insurance firms to oversee changes in pricing practices from a conduct perspective.</p> <p>  Dual pricing is one example of when firms seek to charge customers with similar insurance risk profiles different prices for the same or similar insurance policies.  It is important that such a practice is consistent with the need for firms to act fairly as set out in the code.  Our review into differential pricing will focus on motor and home insurance as the most widely held insurance products in Ireland.  It will be carried out in the following three phases: market analysis; quantitative analysis and consumer insight; and findings and recommendations.</p><p>The review will seek to establish the impact of differential pricing on consumers, while at the same time establishing the drivers of consumer behaviours, including how consumers engage with the insurance industry and it will assess the extent to which these pricing practices lead to outcomes that are consistent with the consumer protection code.  A comprehensive data-gathering and analysis is essential in order to move beyond anecdotal evidence or individual case studies which, while potentially pointing to problematic practices, do not establish a comprehensive view across the industry.  The consumer insight phase will include meetings with consumers to understand their experience of switching or choosing to stay with their providers.  We will shortly write to the chief executive officers of the relevant insurance firms setting out our terms of reference and expectations for the review, and we will provide the committee with a copy of that letter.  We will liaise directly with the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, on the work it is doing in this area, and we will engage with key domestic stakeholders, including the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which has a competition mandate, as part of this review.  We will consider the potential range of policy responses, if any are required, once we have sufficient evidence to hand, in line with our domestic and European legislative mandates.</p><p> The code sets out that firms must act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers and make full disclosure of all relevant material information.  Our review will look to establish the facts.  Once the facts are established, we will then establish what action, if any, needs to be taken.</p></speech>

I know they were with us just last week so I appreciate them coming back again.  I am delighted the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has started our own process of having hearings on dual pricing.  When I asked the committee to carry out this type of investigation on 24 September, at that stage the Central Bank was not carrying out its own investigation.  The following day I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank requesting an investigation into dual pricing, including the practice and the prevalence of dual pricing in the market, the cost of dual pricing to customers and what direct intervention could be made to protect customers from price discrimination.  I welcome the fact that on foot of that request and on foot of the 130-page submission I made the following month, which is available to this committee as well, that the Governor of the Central Bank and the Central Bank have agreed to carry out the work Ms Rowland has outlined and I welcome the promptness of that response.  I met the Governor last week and I was satisfied to hear about the work Ms Rowland has now outlined to the committee.</p> <p>  My view is clear.  I believe dual pricing needs to be banned.  We know insurance companies in Ireland are using big data and complex algorithms to set artificially high prices for insurance, particularly for those who are deemed less price-sensitive or for those who are more likely to renew with the companies.  We know it targets customers who are less likely to switch.  We can see from evidence that was gathered in Britain, and many of the insurance companies who operate here also operate in Britain, that the loyalty premium affects and hurts vulnerable customers.  It particularly identifies the elderly, those with mental health problems and those in low-income households as those who are affected as a result of this.</p> <p>  The general manager of AIG appeared before this committee a number of weeks ago and he confirmed, while acknowledging his company does not operate dual pricing, that dual pricing is a policy that punishes loyalty with higher premiums.  We know from the report of the FCA that was concluded just over a month ago that this affects 6 million consumers in Britain at a cost in overcharging of about &euro;1.3 million per annum.  We also see from some of the statistics, and unfortunately we do not have the statistics for Ireland but I welcome the fact the Central Bank is doing the analysis, that if one is renewing with an insurance company one is likely to be hit by a loyalty premium of 20% if one has renewed on four occasions or more and of 40% if one has renewed ten times or more.</p> <p>  I take on board the point Ms Rowland made that as opposed to individual case studies, we need to look at what is happening right across the industry and that is appropriate but it is important to put on record some of the case studies I have provided to the Central Bank, and we have numerous case studies.  Take Ray for example, because this goes to the core of it.  He renewed his motor insurance with Liberty Insurance and he got a renewal premium of &euro;1,420.  He entered the exact same details on Liberty Insurance's online website and he got a quote for &euro;680.  That is a 109% difference.  Alex from Waterford works part-time and he renewed his motor insurance with AA.  He received a renewal premium of &euro;871.  When he entered the exact same details on the AA website, he got a quote for &euro;400.  That is a 118% difference.  There are many other examples I have been inundated with and I welcome people giving us their examples to show how unfair this practice is.  It is known to hurt individuals.  The Citizens Advice report in Britain in 2017 identified that it hit particular vulnerable groups such as older people, people with mental health problems, people with health problems and those with lower levels of formal education.</p> <p>  I want to ask the Central Bank some questions about the work it is proposing to do on foot of the request I made.  To make sure we are on the same page, can I confirm quickly that the Central Bank will look into the practice of dual pricing by the insurance industry?</p></speech>

Yes, I confirm that as part of our risk-based supervision, we had previously identified big data and the innovative techniques that are available as a risk for customers and because of that and as part of our work at a national level in the focus on the cost of insurance, we have already taken policy measures that I referred to in my opening statement where the price of previous premiums in motor insurance have been disclosed.  As a part of our continuation of that work and as part of our 2020 work programme, we are doing a wide and deep market analysis of the practice of dual pricing because big data brings the possibility of analysing information.

We are particularly focusing on the practice as it applies in the insurance industry.  We have already been doing our preparatory work on that but we expect to formally commence the first phase of that work in 2020.  We will establish a multidisciplinary team.  Does the Deputy want me to take him through a bit of the detail of that?</p></speech>

I would like to observe that this has been ongoing for a long time, as the Deputy will know, not only in the insurance industry but in a lot of industries.  The FCA has concluded, and we are of the conclusion, that it is not necessarily a negative thing because there can be significant winners and losers and this is a complicated area where some people can get a good price for them if they switch provider and that can be a good thing.  Also, we need to establish the prevalence and the impact of this practice in the industry to see what the impacts on groups of customers can be.  We would expect to acquire detailed information from a relevant group of insurers.  In our view, in excess of 70% of the market for motor and home insurance would have to be covered with a representation of the main insurance providers and some of the key brokers because they will all have complex business models and they will be selling different types of insurance through different insurance channels.  We will have to look at their pricing strategies and we will have to look at how that is applied in the business, how it is applied in the board, how they deploy it through their system, how they satisfy themselves they are in compliance with our expectations for regulatory requirement and how it is deployed.  That is not in one document.  It is in many different places and our experience with firms is this can be iterative.  In the end, what we will have to do to get a line of sight on the decision factors and decision points they are using, is to do walk-throughs of the business models and see how they apply through that.</p><p>This is a significant, wide and detailed piece of work, the aim of which is to identify the decision factors they are using and the groups of customers that are affected.  That will lead us into phase 2, which is the detailed granular data analytical request about the groups of customers, the characteristic points and those things that can only be formulated after we have established the prevalence, practices and impacts in place in phase 1.  There is another part to that work if the Deputy would like me to go on.</p></speech>

Will this include the impact on vulnerable customers?</p></speech>

That will include characteristics of the customers.  As part of that we also need to contact a representative group of customers to find out what is motivating those customers in their circumstances and what are the operating factors in their own decision-making.  When this problem is looked at, we have seen that there are a number of very different and important dimensions in terms of the cause.  One important factor, which I will put out there straight away, is the very important responsibility on the part of firms to comply with the regulatory frameworks and our expectations.  It is very important.  That is our role and we are going to discharge it.  It is also important to note that complex competition effects are in place here and that is not our role.  It is the role of the FCA in the United Kingdom, it is not ours.  That is not to shy away from our responsibility, but it is just to be plain that this is a highly complicated topic.  The third complicating factor is the way individuals respond.  As the level of sophistication of big data increases, the ability of firms across all industries to inform how to use information in the system with nudges through behavioural economical insights becomes an important factor.</p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, with which the committee has been in contact, is going to carry out a study into consumer behaviour but we too must do a deep piece of work about what is operating with customers.  Only through that will we be able to identify any concerns regarding groups of customers who may have characteristics of vulnerability and to see what, if any, impact is being caused to them and any action that may flow from that.</p></speech>

It is an evidence-based piece of work.  The right thing to tell the Deputy is that the way we approach our work is to acquire the evidence, understand the impacts, understand what is going on with the customer and then we move to conclusions and findings, and what, if any, policy prescriptions may be needed or required to fit the circumstances.  I was plain at the beginning that the mere fact that dual pricing occurs is not something we are against <i>per se</i>, nor is the FCA against it, as can be seen from its findings.  The FCA has set out a menu of options for consideration but its work will continue into next year.  We would not prejudge the issue.  We will look at that.  It is why we are doing such an enormous piece of work.<br/><br/>I will give the committee an idea of the scope of what we are dealing with.  It is 2 million motor policies per year and 1 million home insurance policies, but those may include buy-to-let.  This is a very big piece of work with lots of people who get better prices by requoting and switching.  That impact needs to be carefully considered in order that an unintended intervention which does not treat the cause of any issue that arises is not made.  We have an open mind and we think it is an important topic.  To be plain, we think it is an important topic right across the board and not just in financial services because of the impact on competition, on new entrants to markets and on consumers generally in terms of GDPR, their behaviour on the Internet and whether they know how their information is being used.</p></speech>

There is a memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the CCPC where they can carry out joint work.

It states:</p><blockquote>1 in 3 consumers in our consumer research who paid high prices showed at least one characteristic of vulnerability, such as having low financial resilience or capability.  For consumers who bought combined contents and building insurance, lower income consumers (below &pound;30,000) pay higher margins than those with higher incomes.</blockquote> <p>This is one of the findings in the executive summary.</p></speech>

The FCA observes some consumers having some characteristics of vulnerability but that does not correlate to a conclusive finding in the report, or that this in fact matches their characteristics of vulnerability in total.  I am not in dispute with the Deputy.  The FCA has issued an interim report stating that there is concern in this area and that it is thinking about what to do.  The FCA said it will do more analytics and perhaps issue a consultation paper next year around options and proposals.  Appended to this the FCA has clearly pointed out that in its findings it sees older customers over represented in the group that holds insurance policies for longer.  These are customers who perhaps do not like to use online channels.  The FCA has also found other things where customers have some of the characteristics the FCA has defined as a vulnerability.  We are not in disagreement that this is a big topic that has many dimensions to it.</p></speech>

In that FCA paper and in many of the other papers it is pointed out that this may not be the preferable option.  The FCA talks about collars, positive nudges and disclosures to customers.  The authority talks about that because the FCA has produced other literature on this topic to do with the United Kingdom finding that bans can act as a dampener to competition and can increase pricing, which can be bad for those at the more marginal end who could do better where they are price sensitive and could shop around.  They were using the utilities interventions in England as an example where they saw a price ban acting as a depressant on competition and it did not improve pricing.  They unwound that.  I simply say this because it is a very complicated topic.  The overwhelming evidence is that one needs to get underneath why this is happening and get to the cause of it in order to build an intervention that can deal with it.</p><p>It is true that all of us would want to see consumers getting good deals with products that suit their needs and that pay out when events happen at prices that are good for them.  There is a significant competition dimension to it.</p></speech>

What we focus on is fairness over the lifetime for the customer, which is an important driving principle.  We expect the fair protections of the consumer protection code to be discharged and we will look at this issue to see if there has been a new adaptation and assess the impacts of that in an evidence-based way.</p></speech>

Ms Rowland said that the consumer protection code of 2012 is central to the Central Bank's conduct of business mandate.  We know that firms must fully disclose all relevant information, including charges, in a way that seeks to inform their customers and act fairly in the interests of customers.  I gave Ms Rowland two examples earlier.  One involved Ray who had a renewal premium of &euro;1,420 when the same company offered it for &euro;680 online.  The other example involved Alex from Waterford who was charged &euro;871 when the same company offered it for &euro;400 online.  We are talking about differences of 100%.  How could we argue that those companies are in compliance with the consumer protection code of 2012, which is the law of this State, in the context of acting fairly when it comes to Alex or Ray regarding the prices they were charged because there was no disclosure that the companies were operating dual pricing?  Perhaps people do not know that companies are using big data and algorithms to basically impose a loyalty premium.  It is not about what is the best price the company can offer a customer. it is about how much it can get away with charging the customer.  That is the approach here.  How could these companies be in compliance with the consumer protection code regarding their requirement to act fairly towards their customers when we see two different prices for the exact same risk profile from the exact same company?</p></speech>

With regard the examples given by the Deputy, it is impossible for me to come to a conclusive answer.  I do not know what distribution channels are being used, if there was a claims history change and the particular facts.  What I can say is that the examples raise the issue and we are doing a huge piece of work across motor and home insurance precisely to get a lot of information about this.  It raises the issue.  However, I cannot be conclusive in an answer without looking at this, which is precisely why we are going to do this very detailed and comprehensive piece of work.</p></speech>

In other words, charging similar risk and applying different prices for cost channels.  For us, it is a focus on the different mark-ups being charged because it is this that is changing.</p></speech>

For example, it was identified in our 2018 consumer protection risk assessment.  Our process is to gather all relevant information about risks consumers face, some of which are outside our competence, but it is good and important that we have an awareness of the threats posed to customers.  From that, we do a prioritised work programme to address specific and particular risks.  The risk of differentiated pricing or that issue has been well known for long before that but the big data innovation has come in more recent times.  Some of that is to the benefit of customers because innovation can bring cheaper prices.  Telematics can be applied to someone's driving to get him or her cheaper policies while genetic testing can be good for some and bad for others so the availability of new information to make decisions can produce personalised pricing, which can be good or bad.  As a result of that, we developed our work programme on insurance.  Clearly, a key focus in Ireland is Brexit and the threat to insurance customers.  We have been working on that but as part of our work on the cost of insurance problem at national level, we also developed policy initiatives to address this issue in part, which we did during the course of this year.  For 2020, we have decided that this is work we would now develop in this way.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that this piece of work will take all of next year.  It will develop into further work programmes.  It will probably be a feature of our work in different guises.  We anticipate that the first two phases of the work on the insurance industry and dual pricing will take most of next year.  Depending on what we find and the level of complexity, in all likelihood, there will be work into the following year.  The FCA has been doing work on this for a number of years and anticipates that its work programme will go on for a number of years so we think that is a likely prediction of the time.</p></speech>

We must take a relevant analysis of the market participants, the different business models they have, the different business lines they have, the costs supporting that and the strategies.  We must ascertain the impacts on customers and directly contact those customers to find out the impacts on this so this is a wide and complex piece of work ranging across a number of dimensions.  If the Deputy wishes, I could ask Mr. Cullinan to talk to him in detail about the complexity of the market in respect of which we must do the analysis.</p></speech>

The Central Bank does not need any big investigation.  It can go online and see there are better deals for new customers than they are willing to offer their existing customers.  Why is the Central Bank not dealing with that issue?</p></speech>

I can ask Ms McEvoy to give the Deputy more detail.</p></speech>

If a person is a customer of Permanent TSB and wants to be on a fixed rate, he or she is paying a higher fixed rate than a new customer of that bank.  It is not about transparency.  The person is paying more and has no option but to do so.</p></speech>

We required the firms to communicate to their customers on an annual basis if they had a better product available, particularly a mortgage product, and if it was a cheaper product, they had to write to and inform the customer of that product.  All of that was within the mindset of encouraging the customer to switch.  We know from our evidence that there is a very low level of switching within mortgage products.  This was introduced exclusively for that reason, namely, to encourage customers to switch.  We were very clear and transparent, based on the research we had undertaken, about the savings that were available to customers in one, two or ten years down the line.  It is a very real saving.  It is an initiative that came into effect on 1 January 2019.  As yet, we do not have the evidence to show whether it has yielded or given rise to greater degrees of switching in that space, but it is an important measure that will actively encourage consumers to switch.</p></speech>

However, I am making the point that differential pricing in our banking system is happening under the nose of the Central Bank.  The bank to which I refer advertises a discounted managed variable rate for a period for new customers which is not available to existing customers.  Existing customers can only move once to a managed variable rate, they cannot update the valuation and avail of a lower rate and if they want to be on a fixed rate, they are paying a higher fixed rate than a new customer.  It is classic differential pricing and I do not see anything in the initiatives the Central Bank has undertaken to deal with that.</p></speech>

It requires the firm to communicate to its customer where it has a cheaper and better product available within its suite.  That was the sole purpose behind that initiative.</p></speech>

That is happening right now in parts of our banking system, although not all parts, and I do not want to tar all of the banks with one brush in respect of this issue.  However, if we take that particular example, it is classic price differentiation.</p></speech>

If the insurance company believes a customer is not going to move his or her business or switch, is it acceptable for the insurance company to charge that customer more than it otherwise would because of that fact?  It really comes to down to that net question of whether, from a consumer protection point of view and looking at the terms of the Central Bank's consumer protection code, it is acceptable.  That is what they are doing.</p></speech>

Precisely because this is an issue that needs to be looked at in greater detail, we are doing this significant piece of work.  They are required to adhere to the high standards of the conduct of business requirements, and that is precisely what they have to do.  There are winners and losers in this, for sure, and that is what happens.  I am aware some businesses do not price differentiate at all and some businesses give existing customers cheaper prices to stay with them.  There are now flash sales occurring in insurance whereby there are windows of additional discounts being given to people if they move their business to others.  There are cheaper prices online.  There is a complex set of circumstances here.  We have to look at this in the life cycle of the fairness over time to customers, and that is precisely what we are going to do.</p></speech>

We are going to acquire the evidence.  What we have to do is look at the impacts on the customers and the behaviours of the market, and that is what exactly we are going to do.  We are very clear that we expect high standards and we expect adherence to the consumer protection code, and nothing changes there.  This is a complex issue where lots of different pricing is occurring, with lots of different variants within that and, as stated, with more price-sensitive, younger customers who have the ability and the desire to shop around and get better pricing for themselves, which can be seen as a good thing.  Some of this is as a competition strategy, not a pricing strategy, but we have to test that and we have to test what, in fact, is going on.</p></speech>

How long it is going on here, and the various levels of sophistication the different companies are applying, varies.  We have seen some that has been relatively recent.  Some only introduced it in the last couple of years whereas others have gone back as far as ten years in terms of price differentiation.</p></speech>

It is our understanding that very many industries, including financial services, have charged different prices for a very long time.  That is long-established, it is a matter many competition regulators look at and it is something that our competition regulator is also looking at.  With regard to price differentiation or dual pricing with respect to consumer attitudes in the UK, the UK competition regulator has been looking at that, as well as the FCA, which also has a competition mandate.  We are looking at it from the perspective of a consumer protection mandate.  However, price optimisation and big data is a more recent innovation and level of sophistication with respect to that phenomenon.  The idea of personal pricing, arising from information on people's behaviours on the Internet, for example, when they click the box saying they are okay with their information being shared, has brought about far more sophistication and ability of the firms to slice data in a different way.  Some of that innovation can be to the advantage of customers because it may be that we can get personalised pricing to our advantage, but it could be that techniques could be deployed in a way that is changing over time.  That needs to be looked at to see what, if any, impacts there are on customers and what, if anything, should be done about that.</p></speech>

The database is particularly focused on motor insurance.  It is expected that information will be published before the year's end.  Discussions on widening the information to other types of insurance are ongoing, for example, liability insurance.  This is important work for us and we expect to report on it shortly.</p></speech>

It will break down the claims channels and payouts via them.  The idea is to provide more transparency.  It was a massive undertaking.  The data request went out in April of this year.  Perhaps not unlike the investigation we are about to go into, it involved multiple companies using multiple channels and so on to look into the matter.  It will shed light on the aspects that the Deputy mentioned.  It will also shed some light on the profitability of the motor insurance industry.</p></speech>

We also saw examples of firms' reliance on data and services from third parties or groups to support pricing and underwriting decisions.  In that context, there may be issues around price optimisation.  The real point was that there was a requirement under the Solvency II directive for the actuarial function to provide an opinion underwriting to the board on an annual basis.  We did a great deal of work on clarifying exactly what our expectations were in that regard.  We expect the opinion provided to each board to get into the issues of pricing so as to increase oversight and transparency to the board itself in order for it to be satisfied about its own pricing strategies.</p></speech>

It could result in some people initially getting a price less than the cost of the risk and other costs but seeing their payments increasing over time to more than that.  This is an example of where the cross-subsidisation that Mr. Cullinan referred to - winners and losers in the internal pricing models of the business - could be at play.</p></speech>

It should continue its work in that regard.  Most banks are not engaging in it with the exception of the upfront cashback offer, which we have discussed previously.  In terms of actual rates, though, there are still examples of clear differential pricing.  In the interests of consumers, it should be ended.  I suggest that the Central Bank examine the matter.  Perhaps it could get a quick win and not have to wait until the end of 2020 or 2021.</p></speech>

That the Central Bank is undertaking this review leads one to presume that it suspects or has cause to question whether the insurance companies have been acting honestly and fairly, ensuring which is the Central Bank's remit.

The Senator cited one.  As part of our work, we perform a risk assessment every year in which we draw in all of the relevant risks to consumers.  Some touch on actions that we can take, some do not, but it is important that we see the threats and risks to consumers.  Price differentiation has been in existence across economies and markets for a very long time.  It predates our involvement by decades.  It is a widespread phenomenon.

That is the flow of work involved.  If, during the course of that work, issues arise that are pertinent to our normal supervisory work, we will deal with them in that context.  That will happen as is normal in every piece of work we do.  Where issues arise, we deal with them.  This is a huge piece of work, with which we will proceed.  Where we have cause for concern, we will in our supervisory role deal with those issues in that context and separately from this matter.  The report will probably be at the end of phase two.

We always work cross-functionally by putting large-scale teams together for such work and then disbanding them.  We might add different work streams as the work flows through, as we might need a lot of data in one phase and many insurance experts and actuaries in another.

If issues arise in that context, we will, as we would with anybody, refer them issues to the commissioner.  This is a big issue that extends well beyond financial services.  It has a major impact on competition and is a serious data issue.  It is a very serious conversation for the citizens of any country to understand when they click on links on the Internet.  There is an ability to analyse and predict behaviour with behavioural economics; therefore, people must understand on a broad scale what can be done with information.  We set up a behavioural economics unit in the Central Bank this year and it is examining these matters.  It will support us in our policy and thinking about what modern interventions need to be made in dealing with what we call "evil nudges" or "positive nudges".</p> <p>  We want customers to act in their own best interests, which is why we made the policy improvement of giving customers information on the previous year's premium.  It has been tested in the field and seen to have had two very powerful effects.  The first is that when people who might not normally seek a better price see the previous year's figure, they change their behaviour and obtain a quote to see if they can do better.  It also has an impact on the pricing of firms as they are now conscious that they must communicate previous prices to customers.  It can have a very powerful cash saving effect for customers.  These policy interventions are required.  We will review the consumer protection code in a fundamental way next year.  We are thinking about digitisation and innovation as part of the way the code needs to be constructed.</p></speech>

We have key protections in place in this jurisdiction, including the communication of previous pricing in offering motor insurance cover to customers.  The authority's work is in development.  It has nothing in place with respect to the list it has suggested, except a discussion document, on which it anticipates undertaking further work and analysis into next year.</p></speech>

We cannot sit here and say customers are being protected and that we have a hold on the problem.  It really does not give me confidence.  Deputy Pearse Doherty has all of the examples.  I tried to get a quote and believe the insurance industry is even catching on to this.  I cannot obtain a quote without giving the postcode.  There is ongoing manipulation.  In designing terms of reference the Central Bank needs to have an awareness of what is going on.</p></speech>

We agree that there is a risk and that the matter should be examined and we are doing so.  The terms of reference for phase one are clear in that we must establish with a high degree of accuracy the pricing strategies, the models and approaches being employed by businesses.  It is our intent to cover more than 70% or 80% of the motor and home insurance industry in Ireland.  We will cover the industry providers, some of the brokers and the branches with delegated authority for pricing.  We will move across all of their business models and make walk-throughs.  We will meet the boards to ascertain precisely what is going on in order to identify what, if any, decision-making factors are employed in the course of dealing with the dual pricing issue in order that we can be very clear about the next phase of the work involved.  It is an enormous, complex, wide and deep piece of work.</p></speech>

As I say, differentiated pricing has been in existence for a long time.  A lot of people in Ireland are price-motivated and change insurance companies regularly when they get their quotes.  That is an important consideration in the wider context of dual pricing.  However, we agree that this is an issue that needs to be looked at and we are doing very significant work to establish the facts.  We are an evidence-based policymaking institution.</p></speech>

The UK authority, the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, would write to the Central Bank of Ireland in such a case and notify us that one of its firms wished to provide services into Ireland on a cross-border basis.  In the absence of some very radical outcome, Brexit will inevitably mean that will no longer be possible.  That will mean that from the end of January next year, individual firms that are providing services from the UK into Ireland on a cross-border basis will no longer be permitted to do so unless they have implemented contingency plans or made arrangements to seek an authorisation in Ireland or any other EU jurisdiction.  Those firms' ability to continue to provide services here post Brexit will depend on an EU domicile.  If the FCA introduces new regulation, its rules will apply only to the entities it regulates.  If those UK-based firms are not allowed to provide services on a cross-border basis, those regulations will have no bearing on any activities that take place here.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to an important piece of information which was mentioned earlier-----</p></speech>

Britain will be taking a different approach.  The rules we make here in Ireland are based on what is happening in the Irish market.  We also look at best practice that can inform us but our work has to be evidence-based and bespoke to our own market.

There is a large degree of consumer protection which other countries do not afford their citizens.  We take that very seriously.  Our policy work always looks at what is out there globally but it must be bespoke for our own jurisdiction on the basis of appropriate evidence in order to have a positive effect on our own system.  In financial services, it is particularly noticeable that different markets operate differently with different practices and preferences.

Of those, six are authorised by the Central Bank.  Two are not authorised by the Central Bank but operate on the basis of freedom of services into Ireland.  One of those is Liberty Insurance, a Spanish firm whose ultimate ownership is in the USA.  The other is AIG, a Luxembourg firm ultimately owned by an American firm.  None of the big players passports into Ireland from the UK.  The UK demands a completely different pricing model than Ireland, as it is a completely different jurisdiction.</p></speech>

We think that is the right place to put the focus of our current efforts on this topic.  As we said, this is a significantly wide and deep piece of work.  Our plan is to apply our resources to this and a great deal of expertise will go into doing so.  We believe these are the right areas on which to focus from the consumer protection point of view as 2 million people in Ireland have a motor insurance policy and about 1 million have home insurance.  These are very important products for families, who do not really have a choice on whether to buy them.  That is where we are putting our focus.</p></speech>

The next steps will be consultation on the proposals the FCA has outlined, which include banning dual pricing and automatically switching customers onto the best-priced policy.  Those are the next steps.  The FCA has come up with a suite of recommendations and it is now engaging with the industry and consumers on which one is the best.  It has carried out all of the necessary evaluation of the impact on customers and vulnerable consumers and on the prevalence of the practice.  It has completed work which the Central Bank of Ireland has not even begun.  The FCA is now looking at feedback on its recommendations.</p></speech>

It has carried out significant work over several years.  I accept that.  Everything the Deputy says about the FCA's work is right.  It has set out a range of options.  However, it is true to say that it is going to do more analytical work.  It has said as much and it is true to say it expects to go into a consultation phase and consider that next year.</p><p>All of that is true.</p></speech>

What is her view on the potential remedies we propose not to focus on?  What remedies should we be considering?  Are there any other potential changes or innovations?  While the FCA is carrying out consultation, it is doing so in the final stages of a large piece of work.  It has done its analysis and come up with a suite of options and it is looking for feedback.  I do not wish to waste time but I make that point because it would be unfair to suggest it is at the same stage as the Central Bank of Ireland.  I welcome that the Central Bank is carrying out an investigation into the matter.  I know from my meeting with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission that it is looking at including this issue in its work programme for 2020.  I encourage engagement and co-operation between the agencies.</p> <p>  I was a little concerned by some of the contributions on dual pricing and price discrimination or price optimisation or whatever one wishes to call it.  Some would call it fleecing the customer.  It was suggested that it is just about attracting new entrants.  An insurance company that offers a 10% or 20% reduction for new entrants is following normal business practice and trying to entice new customers.  The practice in the mortgage market is different.  If Senator Conway-Walsh and I seek mortgages from Permanent TSB or AIB at the same time, we will be offered the same rate regardless of our personality or behaviour.  Insurance companies do not just look at one's likelihood of renewal, which is the loyalty premium; they use big data analytics of a type and scale we have never seen before and about which customers do not have a clue.  They are using artificial intelligence to manipulate those data, including images and videos on applicants' social media, to decide whether they will be hit with a bigger insurance premium.  Is that not the case?  Is that not what these sophisticated algorithms are doing?</p></speech>

That is why we must examine this in great detail.  Concerns relate to big data and analytical abilities, what can be done, what is being done and how that affects customers.  The Deputy and I are in agreement that there are many ways variants to which this can be deployed.  They can be deployed for personal pricing.  The work of the FCA refers price-walking strategies and other variants of these practices.  There is potential for information from a range of activities in one's life to be used to predict behaviours and inform pricing.  It is a big data concern and is exactly why work needs to be done to see what is happening in the Irish market.</p></speech>

Leaving aside dual pricing, there have been many reports of insurance companies using algorithms and artificial intelligence to inform the issues of pricing and risk in the insurance industry.  I am sure Ms Rowland is aware that the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, carried out a significant analysis of 222 insurance companies across many European jurisdictions - I am sure some companies operating in Ireland participated - and the companies openly admitted that they are involved in this type of data manipulation.  An insurance company may use artificial intelligence to access my social media and see that I was bungee jumping or scuba diving last week.  This big data stuff is so sophisticated that the company would be able to conclude that I would be a higher risk than Senator Conway-Walsh, for example, who was out walking her dogs rather than jumping off a cliff with an elastic band tied to her ankles.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is just as wet in Donegal.  The Deputy has identified an issue that was not previously a problem.  It arises from the advent of modern technology and a change in our behaviour in terms of information sharing, such as surfing the web and clicking a box to consent to the usage of information in ways that people may not understand.  In addition, technological advances in the manipulation of data and extraction of structured information from vast arrays of data from which we were not previously able to divine insights have changed the world in which we are living across all manner of industries.  It is a topic of real concern, which goes far beyond financial services.  The pricing of risk can be informed by many different fields.  It is a slightly different matter but it goes to the heart of the same key topics, namely, innovation, our behaviour on the Internet, technological advances and information and how it is governed.</p></speech>

We give insurance companies a significant amount of data, including our Eircode postcode, as well as our job title, which influences one's price bracket.  We tell home insurance providers the value of our house contents.  Other data may be revealed by those seeking holiday insurance and so on.  However, the companies are also able to access our publicly accessible data through social media.  The Central Bank indicated it is not aware of any company in Ireland carrying out such practices but I presume it has not asked them.  Has it asked?</p></speech>

I mentioned two firms that are not engaged in it; we are aware of the companies that engage in it.  There are various levels of sophistication but I am not aware of any company accessing social media in the manner the Deputy suggests.  It is a wide and complex area.  I do not know whether the Deputy is familiar with Lemonade, an American company.  Customers make their claims online.  The company looks at the claimant's face and can tell - apparently with a 96% accuracy rate - whether the customer is lying.  I am aware of another American firm that asks 13 questions on its proposal form and looks at 300 data points in the background.  The reality is that the level of data and sophistication available differs somewhat between Ireland, the UK and the United States.  That is why we need to progress this investigation and establish exactly what is happening.</p> <p>  This runs a little deeper than price differentiation because there are other issues.  Ultimately, insurance is about the pooling of risk.  Things could get to a stage whereby risk is disaggregated to such an extent that a person who is a very low risk will get a very low price but other people may be completely priced out of the market.  That would be of concern.  Things have not yet reached that point anywhere.  We need to pursue the investigation to look at current price differentiation in the Irish market and determine its extent.  We are well aware of the ethical and fairness risks that exist.</p></speech>

However, the EIOPA study showed a big increase in these practices.  Many of the companies stated that although they are not currently using these techniques, they will begin doing so.</p><p>It is very timely, if not overdue.</p><p> The other data the companies use to profile our behaviour are third party data which they can legally hold, such as data from retail store loyalty cards, which provide lots of data on consumption.  Are we aware that insurance companies are using any third party data?</p></speech>

In terms of distribution channels alone, there are direct channels, intermediaries and bank insurance channels.  There are different models for each of those depending on the channel being used.  It is, therefore, a huge task and undertaking.  As already mentioned, there are more than over 2 million motor policyholders and more than 1 million household policies.  It is important that we take time to do this study thoroughly and properly to ensure we have an evidence base from which to draw conclusions and make recommendations.</p></speech>

How can a person be charged significant extra fees by the same insurance company at renewal time despite no change in his or her risk?  We know that people tend to roll over their policy and accept the renewal quote they receive, even though they could get a significantly reduced quote online.  I have countless examples of this and I am a living breathing example of it.  How can that be seen as fair in any way shape or form under the definition of the consumer protection code 2012, which places a responsibility on insurance companies to be clear and fair with their customers?</p></speech>

We have to get into the detail of that and look at those examples precisely.  We have to check the conditions and parameters, the cost base and the channels to see what is going on.  We have to look at the disclosures and the various issues.  I cannot give the Deputy a top-of-the-head answer without looking at the detail.  The important point is that-----</p></speech>

If it says it is the best quote and I ask why I can get a quote from the same company online for &euro;274 less than the renewal quote, how is that company in compliance with the consumer protection code of 2012, under which it has a responsibility and legal obligation to treat me fairly?</p></speech>

These are products that are purchased by people year after year.  We are talking about a market where different pricing is a permitted practice.  The consumer protection code is about protecting all of the consumers.  When we look at this, we have to look at the life cycle of the products and see how that plays out for customers over time.  We have to see how that works for people.  There is a significant group of customers who regularly get far better deals for themselves because they re-broker and move around every year.  There are others who do not do so and we have to look at how they are treated over time and see what the impacts are for them.  We believe it is very important to do that and to analyse any innovation or new practices that might develop in the approach to pricing that need to be addressed.  We need to do the work in that respect.  That is why we are undertaking this study.</p></speech>

The issue goes wider than dual pricing, which is just one element.  We have a system under which people are legally required to have insurance to drive on the roads, and rightly so.  That system is not in place in every country.  I will give the example of a 19 year old who holds a provisional licence, which means he has to be accompanied by a qualified driver.  He owns a car, which was registered in 2008 and is valued at &euro;2,000.  He tried to get insurance.  I have emails from insurance companies stating that he falls outside their risk appetite and so on.  He then contacted a broker to get the best price and the broker responded as follows: </p><blockquote>Further to our conversation, I can confirm that we have obtained terms for the above type of insurance.  The most competitive premium I have obtained is &euro;12,319.78.</blockquote> <p>This quote was for a third party, fire and theft policy so it was not even fully comprehensive.  That is what the insurance industry is doing to some people.  This young man lives in a rural area.  He wants to learn how to drive and has to be accompanied by an adult.  The most competitive price he can get is &euro;12,319.78.  There is something seriously wrong in the insurance market when that is happening.  There is huge frustration about this.  I raise this case with Ms Rowland to elicit a comment from her but also to show that the Central Bank, which has a consumer protection role, needs to offer encouragement in order that people such as those to whom I referred are not fleeced.  People I know only too well are being fleeced as a result of dual pricing, a practice which, to return to  my earlier point, has been banned in over 17 states in the world of the free market.</p></speech>

Dual pricing is about the profit margin being priced differently on the underlying same product.  The problem mentioned by the Deputy is of a young man who wants to learn how to drive and is finding it hard to get insurance at a price that anybody could possibly afford to pay.  That is a distinct and separate issue because that is the way the companies are pricing the risk.</p><p>There may be more detail in that.  However, they are separate issues.  I might ask my colleague, Mr. Cullinan, to speak on the insurance quote.  We are all sympathetic to young people who want to get behind the wheel of a car at insurance prices they can afford.</p></speech>

I am undertaking a series of public meetings in respect of insurance reform.  One of the issues that arose at two of the meetings was that insurance companies are price discriminating on the basis of a full driving licence that is not an Irish driving licence.  For example, people are entitled to drive with French driving licences but the companies increase the premiums.  I intend to raise this with the European Commission.  Is that acceptable?  Does Mr. Cullinan know about this?  When they increase the premium, what they tell the customer is that they price it in on the basis it is a provisional licence, which is ridiculous.</p></speech>

I propose, in my opening statement, to pick up on some of the key themes from our perspective and provide some further clarifications to assist the committee in its work.  Of course, as part of the drafting of the Bill, there will be a thorough and detailed consideration of the committee's report on the general scheme.  </p> <p>  As appropriate for a general scheme dealing with the establishment of a new body, the debate to date has focused on the role and functions of the LDA and its governance.  These are matters that I might briefly address.  Regarding the role and functions of the agency, it is important to recall that the national planning policy statement, which was published in 2015, recognised the importance of creating sustainable communities by ensuring that the right development takes place in the right locations and at the right time.  Following on from this, Project Ireland 2040 through the national planning framework, NPF, and national development plan, NDP, provide for the alignment of spatial and investment policy to ensure future developments are plan-led rather than developer-led.</p> <p>  The LDA is being established in this context and responds to the need for more active land management by the State, which has been articulated in many policy documents over the years, including the 1973 Kenny report and various reports of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  Indeed, in its latest report on this issue, report No.1451, NESC stated that Project Ireland 2040 provided the perfect moment to transition to a new system of urban development and land management.  In this regard, the council strongly supported the concept of a national regeneration and development agency as proposed in the NPF, and now established under secondary legislation as the LDA. </p> <p>  The LDA's immediate focus is on managing the State's own lands to develop new homes and regenerate underutilised sites.  In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land banks from a mix of public and private lands making these available for housing in a controlled manner, bringing essential long-term stability to the housing market.</p> <p>  Allied to this, the LDA will also act as a national centre of expertise, supporting and complementing the ongoing work of local authorities, public bodies and other interests to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment, and to achieve compact, sustainable growth with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.  The general scheme seeks to ensure that the primary legislation provides for both the immediate and longer-term roles of the agency. </p> <p>  State intervention in this manner invariably gives rise to considerations regarding potential state aid.  In developing the legislative approach, we are working both with the Office of the Attorney General and the LDA's legal team to ensure the evolving model is compliant with all aspects of EU law.</p><p>The advices to date have informed our approach to setting out the functions within the general scheme.  In particular, head 9 draws a distinction between a range of non-economic<b></b>functions, the LDA will carry out on behalf of the State in support of the NPF and management of public lands such as the proposed register of public lands and an advisory role to the Minister, and the core economic functions it is intended will be undertaken on a commercial basis without providing an advantage to either the LDA or other parties under State aid rules. <br/><br/>As the legislative process evolves, including having regard to proposals that may emerge from the committee, we will continue to examine the various legal dimensions, including matters of EU law such as state aid and will engage with the European Commission. <br/><br/>The Commission was informed about the LDA at the time of its establishment in August 2018.  The next step will be a structured engagement with the Commission through its informal preliminary procedure.  This will be based on information from the agency on its business model as well as the draft LDA Bill, outlining the nature and role and functions of the agency.  This structured engagement is consistent with the approach taken in respect of other commercial state bodies and reflects the specific nature of the LDA.<br/><br/><b></b>An important function of the agency will be the delivery of affordable housing on public lands, both through activation of the lands transferred from Ministers to the agency and through the services it provides in partnership with local authorities in respect of the activation of local authority lands.<br/><br/>While the nature of the provision on local authority lands is as matter for the respective local authorities, in the case of public lands, the Government has decided that a minimum of 30% affordable housing should be provided in addition to the 10% social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts.  This has been articulated to the LDA and other public bodies, as a matter of policy, but the Minister is open to exploring if this requirement should be placed on a statutory footing.<br/><br/>I turn now to the issues of governance and accountability of the LDA.  Having regard to the proposed roles and functions of the agency, it is important that its legislative framework provides the appropriate balance between the commercial freedom to fulfil these functions and the accountability to the State as the owner of the agency.  A key document in this regard is the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  This code was updated and revised in 2016.  It is designed to ensure that both commercial and non-commercial State bodies meet the highest standards of corporate governance.  The code is based on the underlying principles of good governance: accountability, transparency, probity and a focus on the sustainable success of the organisation over the longer term. <br/><br/>The LDA will have to comply with this code, and this will include the issuance by the relevant Ministers of a shareholder expectations letter, which will outline both policy, corporate governance and financial expectations.  This letter will be developed with the support of NewERA.<br/><br/>In addition, key components of governance and accountability are reflected in the general scheme, based on the most recent legislative approaches for other similar bodies.  Head 6 refers to the development of the constitution of the LDA, such documents are required under the Companies Acts, and were previously known as memorandum and articles of association, which will set out the powers of the agency consistent with its governing statute and the actions that will require ministerial consent.  Head 10 deals with board of the agency, which will be appointed through the <i>stateboards.ie</i>process.  Head 27 deals with borrowing by the agency, with the limit to be set in statute.  Head 29 deals with the financial statement of the agency and provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General will audit the agency.  Head 30 deals with accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Head 31 deals with reporting arrangement.  Finally, head 36 specifically provides for a review of achievement of the agency's purposes by the Minister. <br/><br/>I am aware that, in the context of the governance of the LDA, the discussions have focused on the approach to both freedom of information and lobbying.  The approach currently being adopted aligns with the general norms for commercial bodies as set out in legislation, which is generally a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister is open to proposing alternative approaches to Government where measures are identified that would enhance accountability without compromising on the LDA's capacity to execute its proposed statutory role.  We will, therefore, consider any recommendations of the committee in this regard.</p><p>I thank the Chairman and members for offering us the opportunity to update them on the general scheme of the Bill and I hope I have clarified many of the issues raised in previous sessions.  As always, the Department's team will be happy to clarify any further issues.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague Mr. Phelim O'Neill, head of land at the LDA.</p> <p>  During my previous appearance before the committee, in early October, I provided a progress update on the sites in the LDA's initial portfolio and on the wider progress we have made since inception a little over a year ago.  I also outlined our plans for the remainder of 2019 and 2020.  Our engagement with the committee that day was very constructive and informative.  I thank the committee for that and for the wider support it has shown for the LDA and the concept behind it. </p> <p>  On a more general note, I thank the committee for the extensive and detailed work it has done on pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of this Bill.  The contributions made by members and the many attendees before the committee recent weeks, which have included people with considerable experience of, and insight into, the issues and constraints facing the housing sector, are essential and valuable steps in the process of designing this legislation.  It is clear that the committee's work is making a significant contribution to enabling the LDA to provide effective, tangible and durable measures that will improve housing supply in the short term and bring much-needed stability to the housing market over the long term.  </p> <p>  In a similar vein, I am grateful to local authorities throughout the country for the quality of their engagement with the LDA since it began operating.  The support they have shown, as well as the detailed knowledge and innovation that they have brought to their discussions with us, augurs well for our collective ability to address the problems that we share and that we want to resolve together. </p> <p>  Ultimately, the LDA cannot succeed without the support of its key stakeholders.  I have been greatly encouraged by the strong commitment, collaborative approach and shared desire for solutions that I have seen at first hand among members of this committee, local authorities and our other stakeholders.</p> <p>  I will use my opening statement today to give the agency's perspective on some of the issues that the committee's work has identified in recent weeks.  In particular, I would like to talk about the need for the agency to be established as a commercial body; the importance of enacting the legislation so that the agency can make the financial commitments it needs to make; our commitment to accountability, governance and transparency; and the delivery of affordable housing on State lands. </p> <p>  On the need for the LDA to be established as a commercial body, there have been some suggestions in recent weeks that it should not be established as such, or that if it were, it would in some way act in a manner that was not in the interest of addressing our housing issues.  I reassure the committee that there is no conflict at all between being established as a commercial body and the provision of much-needed housing.  My strong view is that operating as a commercial body offers the best way to ensure the sustainability of the LDA's resources and the sustainability of the agency through economic cycles.</p> <p>  I can assure the committee that the agency and its board, including me as CEO, are clear that our primary objective is to ensure that homes, including affordable homes, get built and delivered to people and families on the land we gain access to.  Many State bodies have a commercial mandate while, at the same time, being committed to achieving important social and economic objectives, which include providing electricity, public transport, operating ports, health insurance and many other essential services.  The LDA is no different, and while it will be commercial, pending the outcome of the legislative process, its mandate is clear.  The mandate is to accelerate the provision of homes and supporting development on State and other lands.  </p> <p>  We see ourselves as custodians and stewards of the &euro;1.25 billion in taxpayers' money that the Government has earmarked for the agency.  Our job is to use that money in a way that strikes the right balance in achieving all our objectives &ndash; improving housing supply, delivering long-term stability in the housing market, using State lands more effectively and freeing it up to deliver new homes wherever that is appropriate.  We must do this in a way that preserves the sustainability and long-term impact of the agency.  My fear is that if we do not get the balance right, we will be at risk of using valuable State resources inefficiently or unsustainably, and hence running out of these resources early.</p> <p>  Acting as a commercial operator will also help us to deliver housing in the good times, when Exchequer funding is available to support this activity, and future-proof the agency so that it can be just as effective in bad times, when the Exchequer does not have access to resources to invest.  Establishing the LDA as a commercial body will enable it to raise finance and invest in housing provision in times when the Exchequer is simply not in a position to do this.</p><p>This will mean that the agency will be able to act countercyclically, which will achieve important wider economic benefits in stabilising housing supply and achieve best value for money by enabling it to procure land and buildings when the housing market is weaker.</p><p> When we talk about the desirability of the LDA being a commercial body, it is not because we are seeking to make profit for the sake of profit; it is about ensuring the agency can be an all-weather contributor to the State and housing market, irrespective of how the wider economy is performing.  By way of example, if we consider the extreme financial pressures on the State ten years ago, as we were on the verge of a troika bailout, it is not realistic to believe that had the LDA been in place at the time, it could have sought money from the Exchequer to buy land or perform any of its other activities.  If we are to be successful as a countercyclical operator that can take advantage of long-term opportunities for the taxpayer, we have to create the conditions that will allow us to achieve this.  Establishing the LDA as a commercial body is the best way to do this. </p><p> Let us consider the importance of enacting the legislation so that the LDA can make the financial commitments it needs to make.  There has been some public discussion on its ability to operate in the absence of the legislation.  While we are operating effectively on the basis of a statutory instrument signed by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, last year and this has been sufficient for what I would term the "start-up phase" of the LDA's operations, I am conscious that we are approaching the end of this phase.  As I told the committee last month, we have made significant progress on the sites in the agency's initial portfolio, which have the capacity to deliver approximately 3,000 homes, and we are working well with local authorities in respect of these and other potential sites, including at Shanganagh in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area.  We have been able to achieve this progress on our existing statutory basis.  However, the more progress we make, the closer we come to a stage where we will need the provisions of the proposed legislation to continue to deliver on these sites as expeditiously as possible.  In particular, we are approaching a point where we will have to make significant financial commitments in the middle of 2020, as our work evolves from valuable preparatory work to the nuts and bolts of active construction on the sites.  This creates a natural time constraint for the enactment of the proposed legislation.  While we do not envisage any delays in progressing our projects based on the current timelines, the existence of this constraint highlights the value of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny process and the importance of getting this legislation right within a defined timeframe.  I assure the committee that we will continue with our existing approach of working closely and collaboratively with it to ensure its concerns are addressed to its satisfaction and to facilitate the efficient and timely passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas.</p><p> I assure committee members and other stakeholders that we share their desire to create an organisation that is the best in its class in terms of its accountability, governance and transparency.  As CEO of a State agency, I am aware of the importance for the LDA not only of doing our job to the best of our ability but also of being able to demonstrate to citizens and public representatives that we are doing our job to the best of our ability, and, indeed, to the highest standards, which people have every right to demand and expect from agencies such as the LDA.  I regard exposure to public scrutiny as an essential part of our mandate and something that my colleagues and I should, and do, welcome.  We want significant levels of oversight and accountability built into our operations, and the proposed legislation and governance frameworks for State bodies set out measures to achieve this. </p><p> Under the proposed legislation, the LDA is accountable to our ministerial shareholders and the Committee of Public Accounts, and it will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, it will appoint an external statutory auditor under the Companies Acts and an internal auditor.  Since the inception of the agency last September, we have set out to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance.  The agency's nine-person board comprises experienced professionals with a diverse mix of both public and private sector expertise.  The board was established in January 2019 and provides ongoing strategic direction and oversight in regard to the agency's activities.  We have established an audit-and-risk committee with responsibility for overseeing the assessment and management of the strategic risks facing the LDA that could result in financial, reputational or other loss to it.  We have also provided for an investment committee, which will have responsibility for assisting the board in the control and management of the agency's investment activities.  The agency will adhere to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, as required and as mentioned by Ms Graham.  In summary, the LDA will be accountable to its ministerial shareholders and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will have three separate auditors.  It has an experienced independent board with audit-and-risk and investment committees.  It will publish a comprehensive annual report and will be subject to the code of practice.  I assure the committee that the LDA has been committed to continuing to place accountability, corporate governance and transparency at its core.</p><p> I draw the committee's attention to our commitment to delivering affordable homes on State lands.  This has been, and will continue to be, one of our top priorities.</p><p> The affordability requirement on State lands is a separate policy matter set by the Government.  The requirement sits outside the LDA and applies to any party accessing State lands, be it the LDA or anyone else.  The LDA will implement the requirement as a party that will seek to access State lands on an ongoing basis.  While it is ultimately a policy matter for the Government, in my view the policy strikes a balance in providing significant amounts of social and affordable housing while leaving open the option to lever the initial funding of &euro;1.25 billion provided for the LDA.  This is particularly important when one considers the context that if no third party funding was added to the LDA's mix, the &euro;1.25 billion would be used in its entirety by our initial site portfolio when our ambitions go much further than that.  To frame it another way, the 150,000 homes which have been targeted for the LDA to facilitate their delivery in a 20-year period would have a total delivery cost of well in excess of &euro;45 billion, which I do not believe it is feasible to be funded entirely by the State.  Furthermore, it provides for flexibility in particular areas which may need a diversity of housing tenures, including social, affordable and private.</p><p> As I said to the committee last month, we see the figure of 40% for the number of social and affordable homes to be provided as a minimum, not a maximum.  We anticipate that we will be able to deliver social and affordable homes to a figure of 100% on individual sites where the circumstances are right.  I am conscious that the provision of social and affordable housing is a major focus for the committee and that it is entirely understandable that many stakeholders want to highlight the importance of not missing any opportunity to deliver in this space.  What I say to these stakeholders is that we share that sense of urgency and commitment to delivering on the requirement to provide all types of home, including social and affordable.  We are confident that this can be achieved through a range of delivery options, including developments where 100% of the homes provided are social and affordable and developments in which there is a mix of private homes alongside social and affordable homes.  </p><p> In my opening remarks I hope I have provided greater clarity on some of the issues raised in recent weeks.  I am happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

The reoccurring themes in our deliberations have been good governance, accountability, transparency, probity and a focus on sustainable management and structure.  That is really important because it is one of the biggest things about which the public is talking.  It is one of the issues that arises concerning the LDA when one sees media commentary and letters to various newspaper editors.  I do not suggest it is correct, but some people make an analogy between it and NAMA or say they are similar.  That is not the case, but the reality is that many see it that way.  People will have a greater understanding as the pre-legislative scrutiny ends, the report is made and the Bill published.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on a few issues.  I acknowledge that we have had two really important papers which provide great clarity.  In particular, I like the tenor of Mr. Coleman's document.  I get a sense from it that there is greater partnership and understanding with local authorities, a group with which I work especially closely.  An issue arises about the figures of 30% for affordable housing and 10% for social housing.  We all know what the mandate will be for the LDA.</p> <p>  Ms Graham referred to the allocation of &euro;2.3 billion for housing.  She stated: "While the nature of the provision on local authority lands is a matter for the respective local authorities, in the case of public lands Government has decided that a minimum of 30% affordable housing should be provided ... [and] 10% social housing requirement under Part V".  We are familiar with this.  I am encouraged by the following line that reads: "This has been articulated to the LDA and other public bodies as a matter of policy, but the Minister is opening to exploring if this requirement should be placed on a statutory footing."  Will Ms Graham, please, refer to this when she responds to me because I think people would like it to happen?  I personally would like it to happen.  I do not wish to be too restrictive, but there is an issue.  We are in a housing crisis.  We know the reason the LDA has been set up, especially in accessing lands, about which I would like to hear more.  I have been talking to other parties as part of my work on the Bill prior to it being brought to the Seanad.  It is an area on which I am focusing and one on which a number of my colleagues want to focus.  Therefore, I am flagging it here.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to two or three other points.  On page 3 of his statement Mr. Coleman refers to timelines and says we are approaching the end of the first phase.  He also says, "In particular, we are approaching a point where we will have to make significant financial commitments."</p><p>That is clearly telling us that there are timelines.  As he is flagging concerns, perhaps he might tease them out with me and the committee.</p><p> Mr. Coleman is familiar with the lead agencies, as well as the development agency, particularly in the context of a strategic development zone such as that in Cherrywood.  I might be wrong about this, but I read correspondence from IDA Ireland in which it flagged a concern.  Does Mr. Coleman consider the LDA should be given power in this legislation to be a developer and take the lead in a strategic development zone?  I would like to hear his views on that matter.  I think it should, as I am familiar with the strategic development zone in Cherrywood.  The issue is very clear.  We should remember that at this point the planning application has gone through and that we have a master plan for a strategic development zone.  Very little deviation is possible once a strategic development zone is approved and ultimately sanctioned by the Government.  I am especially interested in hearing Mr. Coleman's views on that matter.</p><p> I seek clarity in situations where the LDA acquires land and on how it will pay another State agency for the land acquired from it.  This was an issue of concern in the context of EU competition rules.  What is Mr. Coleman's view on that issue which has been flagged for me by elected members in many local authorities?</p><p> The disposal of land under section 183 is a reserved statutory function of the elected members of a council, not the executive.  How will the LDA overcome this issue?  Does Mr. Coleman think it should be addressed in the legislation?  Should there be special exemptions in the disposal of State or local authority lands, particularly where it can be demonstrated that they are required for the roll-out of the critical mandate of the LDA in the delivery of housing in most cases, although I am aware that it also has a commercial remit?  I refer to situations where there is a strong case to be made for bringing local authority lands into play.  We know that there are local authority lands sitting idle throughout the country that are not being developed.  In many cases, they have been zoned for residential purposes.  Does Mr. Coleman believe we should look again at how we can fast-track the release of local authority lands to the LDA, specifically for housing development, and how will local authorities be compensated for the land which, in many cases, they bought with resources from their own reserves?  I am particularly keen to hear what he has to say because it will perhaps be one of the most difficult issues in accessing State and local authority lands.  I expect Mr. Coleman to speak about partnership, but the reality is that there are commercial issues involved concerning offers and acceptance, about which I would like to hear more.</p></speech>

I will start with the first point he made concerning what I might most appropriately talk about, namely, the financial commitments made and the need for legislation in advance.  The funding source of the LDA is to be a transfer of funds from the ISIF which will be taken by the Minister for Finance and then invested in the LDA.  The NTMA Act requires an amendment to facilitate this which will follow on the back of this Bill.  That is the turning point for the LDA in accessing finance.  On how it will co-ordinate with our on-the-ground activity, as the sites to which we have access and of which we have control come on stream with the granting of planning permission, we are constantly looking to take time out of the process for an obvious reason, namely, to have homes provided.  One of the things at which we have started to look is direct delivery, similar to what is anticipated in Shanganagh, whereby we will have to procure a contractor.</p><p>To do that, we cannot enter contractual arrangements with a contractor until we have visibility on our funding to honour the financial commitments that will arise.  That is where my point was focused.  As the projects come on stream, they will need money or funding sources triggered by the Bill being enacted.<br/><br/>On how the LDA acquires land and how it is paid for, the way I think about it is that there are, broadly, three ways we can gain access to land, namely, through centrally controlled Government bodies, commercial semi-State bodies and local authorities.  I distinguish between the three categories because they have individual governance requirements and infrastructure.  Naturally, the Government controls centrally controlled Government bodies.  For the local authorities, as was outlined, it is a reserved matter as to what is done in the sale or transfer of land in section 183 decisions.  Commercial semi-State bodies are independent bodies with independent boards that have to make decisions as opposed to being centrally controlled, for plenty of good reasons.<br/><br/>We might acquire land from local authorities through negotiation with the local authority, subject to the approval of its elected members.  How the land will transfer will depend on the commercial arrangements.  As for the payment for the land, typically, local authorities are not necessarily as interested in making money from the land, given that they will often have their own financial constraints.  Rather, the provision of affordable housing tends to be their primary concern.  It is perhaps less of a material issue for local authorities.<br/><br/>We have to deal with commercial semi-State bodies as if we were dealing with any private market player.  A commercial semi-State body, which has a company to run, services to finance and obligations as board members, will typically seek the best deal and, therefore, it will be as if we were dealing with any other party.<br/><br/>In the case of centrally controlled Government bodies, the thinking is that the lands will transfer from the relevant Ministers as an equity investment, or an <i>in specie</i>consideration for shares, in the LDA in order that the agency would not necessarily have to transfer money out.  That makes sense given that, otherwise, our funding would just be distributed to various State bodies from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which was not the intention.  The intention was for the money to be used to fund the agency's activities.  The consequence of that would be that land from centrally controlled Government bodies would sit on the agency's balance sheet at the correct market value.  That would ensure we would have to preserve, maintain and deal with the asset in the most efficient and financially sustainable way, which would take account of the affordability requirement, namely, a valuation of 30%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111200002#O00300"><p>I will build on what Mr. Coleman stated in response to the specific question on putting affordable housing on a statutory footing.  As he noted, local authorities own their land and dictate how it is used.  Similarly, Ministers own their land and the Government can dictate the practice it wants associated with its disposal, which is what has been done to date.  The Government has been firm about the additional dividend of affordable housing on the disposal of land.  The Minister has written twice to colleagues to ensure that the matter has been highlighted.  It would be a step forward, to which the Minister is open, to put it on a statutory footing.  A number of elements must be considered when putting something onto a statutory footing, which is slightly different from just articulating policy.  For example, when drafting legislation and the evidence base for it, it must be decided whether a number will be hardwired in the legislation or whether it will be a provision prescribed by a Minister.  Such elements ensure that legislation will be future-proofed.</p><p>An important consideration at the backdrop is the new housing needs demand assessments that local authorities will carry out, following on from the national planning framework.  They will examine the nature of the demand and the various types of housing required, and including that in development plans.  It will give a good evidence base for the future that will build on the overall quantum of affordable housing.</p><p> It is in the context of examining two elements.  The approaches are whether there should be a requirement for the disposal of public land or whether there should also be a requirement for the LDA, across its portfolio, to achieve a certain percentage of housing.  The options would have to be examined.</p></speech>

I am conscious that it would be a variation on this legislative vehicle if it is to be used for it.  I acknowledge that the committee, on the previous occasion, discussed matters that would arise on Committee Stage, but I am sure that if that is to be the case, the committee will examine it then.  We will probably examine it during the drafting of the Bill.<br/><br/>The Senator also referred to strategic development zones, SDZs.  I might deal with the matter from a general perspective and Mr. Coleman might like to comment on some of the practical aspects.  We have learned quite a bit from the operation of some of the SDZs and how delivery can be affected by changes in the development cycle.  In the longer term, one of the purposes of the LDA is site assembly, which allows us to be more robust and the State to be ready before the market can respond.  We had hoped activity would be faster for a number of SDZs but it was a matter of market conditions.<br/><br/>The other element is infrastructure provision.  Quite often, SDZs were put in place but there may not have been sufficient infrastructure provision, or the cost of infrastructure provision hampered them somewhat.  The urban regeneration and development fund, which will account for &euro;2 billion over the period of the national development plan, will provide a useful vehicle for supporting such activity in the future.  Under the first call, both Cherrywood and Waterford SDZs received some funding, which was to bridge the gap.  From a policy perspective in any event, we seek to learn from experience and ensure that the SDZs work more efficiently.<br/><br/>While one role of the LDA is activating, assembling and working on transferred land, there are also the services it may assign local authorities for master planning and other aspects.  Mr. Coleman might like to comment on that aspect and how it might work in an SDZ context.He covered the elements of how land is acquired, which addresses the underlying way we approach the transfer of land as an <i>in specie</i>investment, to address the point the Senator raised about ensuring that the LDA will act as an economic operator and that there will not be an issue from a competition perspective.<br/><br/>We probably dealt with the issue of elected members disposing of land.  It is their land.</p></speech>

The bit of this project which I like, the active land management, will be far weaker than we need.  The part with which I was always uncomfortable, that is, the residential development, is probably worse than I thought it was going to be.  I will keep an open mind as we go through the legislative process but I want to be upfront about that.  A broad range of people raised significant concerns, most of which have not been addressed in any detail by either the Department or the Land Development Agency today.</p> <p>  Mr. Coleman says the Land Development Agency has been set up as a commercial entity to allow it to operate countercyclically.  The opposite is the case.  The point of countercyclical interventions is that at a time when the market dries up, in a recession when there is an investment strike by private investors, then State bodies which are reliant on borrowing or rainy day funds directly intervene as non-market operators counter to the cycles of the market.  In my estimation, a disadvantage of setting the LDA up as a designated activity company is that it will be cyclical.  After the first tranche of investment by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, the LDA will be dependent on accessing market finance and investment and market operators.  It will fall foul of recessions and slumps when they come.</p> <p>  This will also dramatically undermine the ability of the State to deliver the volume of social and affordable housing that is needed.  To keep it off balance sheet, one has to have a majority of units, whether it is 60% or not, as open market price commercial units.  We are using public land and a majority of the units will not be for social and affordable housing.  At a core level, my view is, and everything I have heard to date suggests, that it will not do the things I genuinely believe Mr. Coleman wants it to do.  I am not in any questioning his desire to do what he is saying.  I just do not see how it will work.  There are two contradictory things in what he keeps tells the committee.  On one hand, 40% is a minimum and he hopes to increase it.  On the other hand, as Mr. Coleman rightly points out at the end of his presentation, the more one increases the percentage of social and affordable housing, the less one has open market sale houses, and the more liability will be on the State.  I will question Mr. Coleman's &euro;45 billion figure in a second.  In some senses, he is telling us something that we want to hear, which is that there will be more social and affordable housing.  At the same time, he is telling us why that will not really be possible outside of a small number of peripheral projects at the outset.</p> <p>  The figure of &euro;45 billion is not correct.  That is for all units but the State is not in the business of building units to sell at open market prices.  It funds social and affordable housing.  If 40% is the rough benchmark, the Land Development Agency will only deliver 60,000 social and affordable homes over the lifetime of the Land Development Agency.  On the basis of Mr. Coleman's calculations, that is a capital investment of &euro;18 billion, or &euro;900 million a year, which is eminently possible for the State.  I know it is rough stuff, but the LDA is pricing its units at &euro;300,000.  The State currently delivers good quality two and three-bedroom homes at an average price of &euro;216,000.  Mr. Coleman is coming to the committee and giving us figures which are back-of-the-envelope calculations.  I know it is hard to predict cost over 20 years but it would be better not to give us figures that just are not accurate than to give them.</p> <p>  If I was asked by a councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown for my advice with regard to section 183, I would say that the first question is to ask what would be the added value of the LDA becoming involved.  The purpose of the LDA is to try to access land that cannot currently be used for housing, including land held by the HSE, transport companies or whatever.  If lands are held by the Housing Agency and local authorities, they and the Department can develop it now, as they are on Enniskerry Road and elsewhere.  Involving another layer of bureaucracy makes this much more complicated.  What added value can the LDA bring to Shanganagh that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, with its very competent staff and with advice from the Housing Agency and Department, cannot deliver today?  I do not get the value of involving the LDA in residential projects that should be progressing already and in a sense are only being delayed because the land cannot be transferred until the LDA is set up on a statutory footing.</p><p> I welcome Ms Graham's comment to the effect that there will be a structured engagement.  That is important because, as we know from NAMA, these are tricky and complex areas of EU law.  Will she indicate when that will happen?  Why did some level of engagement not happen in the context of the general scheme?  On an issue as tricky as this, I would have thought that the earlier the engagement started, the better it would have been.  Ms Graham talked about the general scheme separating economic and non-economic areas of activity, which is true.  From my limited understanding of state aid law, that is not the distinction that matters.  The distinction that matters is between services of economic interest, which are fully commercial, and services of general economic interest, which are more public services.  In order to not fall foul of or to get exemptions under state aid rules, those two activities have to be kept separate, yet here we are, creating an entity that will mix services of economic interest and those of general economic interest, such as commercial, open-market-price homes and social and affordable homes that are in some way subsidised by the State.  Are our guests concerned about that mix?  Has there been a discussion in the Department about how to separate those two or whether there is a need to separate those two elements?  From my limited knowledge of these issues, if one does not find a way of successfully separating those, one could fall foul of state aid rules and therefore not be able to achieve the off balance sheet status that is sought.</p><p> My biggest concern with the legislation is the limited compulsory purchase order powers that it seems will be introduced at some point, whether when we get the Bill or later.  NAMA was given very limited compulsory purchase order powers for small strips of land which are often called ransom strips, to gain access to other developments.  Those would clearly be helpful to have.  I would have thought that if the LDA sits down with the HSE, Dublin Bus or a port authority to negotiate a transfer, while it does not have the ability to threaten to issue a compulsory purchase order for a large parcel of land, it will not get very far in those negotiations or it will have a very weak hand with regard to the eventual outcome.  Will our guests provide more information on the kind of compulsory purchase orders that they hope to see catered for in the Bill?  Can they give any reassurance that there will be broader powers than those that NAMA has, which would clearly not be sufficient for active land management?  I agree with Mr. Coleman that we desperately need active land management in the State.</p><p> The price at which the LDA acquires the land from public agencies is an issue.  Land can have one of three values.  It can have the original book value for which the public authority bought it, it could have the existing use value for whatever purpose the land is currently zoned or planned for and if the land is not currently zoned or planned for commercial residential development, it could have a full market value.  The ability of the LDA to do its job well means that, inasmuch as possible, it has to try to acquire land at the first or second of those values if possible.  To comply with state aid rules and to ensure that the LDA, as a commercial operator, does not have an economic advantage over other commercial operators, it will have to buy the land at full market price.  If the LDA, as a statutory agency, buys Donnybrook Garage, for example, at anything less than full market price, many developers will queue up and ask why it is getting the land for an amount below the market price they would have paid.  If the LDA has to pay the full market price, it has to ask if that is what it is trying to do.  Does that not go back to inflating land values or limit the LDA's ability to deliver genuinely affordable units because it has to factor in the full market land value to the prices of homes to buy or to rent on the affordable side?</p><p> To return to the matter of social and affordable housing, the Economic and Social Research Institute and National Economic and Social Council are reputable bodies that are not radical hotbeds of socialist thinking or critics of the Government.  They are mainstream bodies funded by the State to provide expert advice to the witnesses.  It was clear from what they were saying that the quantum of social and affordable housing being proposed here is nowhere close to enough.  Both indicated, on the basis of substantial bodies of evidence, that it has to be much more than that.  I am not reassured by the language being used that 40% is a minimum.</p><p>What we really need to see is what the full scope of this will deliver for the needs that are there.</p><p> In terms of the land from the Housing Agency, will Mr. Coleman confirm whether this will be transferred before the LDA becomes a statutory body or after?  If it is transferred after, will the Housing Agency still have the ability to insist on covenants of use, as it currently does, for the lands it transfers to other bodies?  Does the ability of the Housing Agency to constrain what happens with that land change if the LDA is a full statutory body?</p><p> I know it is not Mr. Coleman&rsquo;s responsibility but a Government policy area.  However, we keep on talking about affordable housing to buy or rent.  The only examples of this under way are developments in Enniskerry Road and O'Devaney Gardens.  In the main, they are not affordable for households earning between &euro;35,000 and &euro;75,000.  If we want to deliver homes to rent for between &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,600 a month, or homes to buy at &euro;320,000, that may not be affordable for the cohort locked out of the private market.  My main concern is that, ultimately, the market will set the price for so much of it.  This means that we will end up with many developments like O'Devaney Gardens rather than Poppintree in Ballymun.  Is there anything that Mr. Coleman can tell the committee that will convince us otherwise?  Will we all be here several years from now complaining that, while the LDA built homes, they are not accessible for those households above the thresholds for social housing and below &euro;50,000 for single households or &euro;75,000 for couples?  That is who that housing must be accessible for.</p></speech>

One way to think about is if one thinks about the extreme situation back in 2009 and 2010 when there was no money for anything and everything was being cut.  If the LDA had been set up then, dependent on the Exchequer, would money have been there for the LDA to buy land and develop housing?  My view is that it would not have been.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that we would be dependent on market funding outside the &euro;1.25 billion.  That is a significant amount of money which could come into play.  If that was capitalised with that equity capital at a point in time when we enter a downturn - we are now nearer the next downturn than we were at the last one - I expect the LDA would be quite well positioned if it were not dependent on Exchequer funding and had its &euro;1.25 billion to acquire land and so forth.  That could be countercyclical if it was done during a downturn.</p> <p>  On the accuracy around the &euro;45 billion remark, the Deputy is correct.  That was applying a rule of thumb of around &euro;300,000 delivery costs per home.  This takes into account that we will be focused significantly in line with the national planning framework on compact development which implies more expensive typologies to deliver such as apartments.  These are coming in a bit more than the &euro;216,000 referred by the Deputy.</p> <p>  On the &euro;18 billion versus the &euro;45 billion, the point I was making was the affordability requirement at 40% and the ability to invoke private housing at 60%.  This probably increases the amount of market participation that could happen and money from the market as opposed to perhaps money from the State that would have to go towards funding the &euro;18 billion.</p><p>A 100% social and affordable housing requirement would become a &euro;45 billion burden on the State in that situation.  That is the point I was making around the balance that is achieved with the current affordability level.<br/><br/>On compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers, we are <i>ad idem</i>in respect of the powers we hope to obtain in this regard.  That is a work in progress with the Attorney General in terms of working through some of the technical issues around those.  The Deputy mentioned that if one does not have extensive broad-reaching powers, they are not worth the paper on which they are written.  The Deputy may not have said it that starkly but the point is that we need strong powers.  If one looks at examples further afield, for example, in the Netherlands, the existence of CPO powers as a negotiating and bargaining chip, rather than having to use them, is often the most significant impact of them in those situations.  I am just drawing the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to that point.  I am in agreement with him on our need for CPO powers, as is the LDA board.<br/><br/>On the point the Deputy made about land values coming across from, say, commercial semi-State bodies, if there was an affordability requirement through Government policy or, for instance, shareholder expectation letters that may be sent through to commercial semi-State bodies, the land values should take account of the affordability requirement which would have the effect of lessening or reducing the land values where there is affordable housing delivered on those sites.</p></speech>

Part V of the Planning and Development Act allows the State to acquire units and the land value calculation on those is existing land use value, not the full market value.  My main concern is that even if the LDA gets the CPO powers, in order to be fully compliant with state aid rules, in particular the requirement where the State does not give one an economic advantage over others, it will have to acquire the land at full market value if some of that land is going to be used for the sale of houses sold at open market prices.  The reason the State gets away with it through Part V is because it is using it for non-market social housing.  My concern is that even if the LDA gets the powers, which I would like it to have in terms of the CPO, it will still be locked into the requirement to pay full market value for it.  The State then will have to find some other way to subsidise the affordability, not necessarily in a way that is good for the taxpayer or the home purchaser</p></speech>

If the HSE sold a site, according to Government policy at the moment, there would be an affordability requirement on that site, even if it sold it to a private market player.  That would apply to the LDA as well.  That has an impact on the value of the private market player would pay.  Similarly, it would impact on the value the LDA would pay.  It is a level playing field for any market player which will, hopefully, help avoid those issues the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

There is no question about that.  We have been in discussion with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council regarding the site pretty much since our inception.  The site has been undeveloped for quite some time.  We helped the council's departments to work on co-ordination and project management.  That went well.</p> <p>  Another issue is the funding structure for affordable housing on the site that we invoked.  Our mandate is to deliver affordable housing on sites to which we gain access, be they from local authorities or elsewhere.  To deliver affordable housing, we will need a funding structure, which we have been developing.  The application of that structure to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where more than half of the homes that are anticipated for development are to be affordable, including affordable rental or cost rental, is a major added value that could not be achieved elsewhere.</p></speech>

I welcome and understand Deputy &Oacute; Broin's support of the concept of and need for active land management.  The countercyclical piece was touched on.  I might add to Mr. Coleman's explanation and say that many of our commercial companies had sufficient credit ratings to borrow in 2009 when the State was not able to.  Unfortunately, we know the impact of those hard times.  The companies were able to continue their investment programmes when the State did not have that capacity.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about engagement with the European Commission.  In drafting the legislation, there was an iterative process of developing the operational model through the prism of different elements of EU law, including those that the Deputy touched on - the transfer of land and the structuring of various functions.  We need to be ready to show the Commission a formed idea of the CPO powers.  We want them to be as strong as possible while also compliant.  That is the balancing act that is required.  The draft Bill will take account of all of the discussions.  Some technical reports, including benchmarking, and the business plan also need to be done.  We are nearly there, but we would not find it fruitful to approach the Commission so early in the iterative process that we needed to come back because, for example, we were now thinking of putting the affordable housing component on a statutory footing.</p><p> The Deputy touched on the two different components.  That is why we have structured the Bill in this way.  He correctly pointed to the economic and non-economic functions.  We believe that we can do both within the organisation.  We are developing an organisation that will have certain capabilities to perform its core function, that is, active land management.  We should spin off that centre of excellence to give support, as required, to local authorities and other agencies.  It is a matter for us to define this clearly within the draft legislation so that the terms of the two elements are quite clear.  One is not in state aid territory and the other has to demonstrate that it is compliant.</p><p> This relates to the discussion on affordable housing.  It is a complementary and new add-on to the suite of affordable housing activities.  It is not substituting for local authorities, but will instead be available to local authorities if they wish to use the centre of excellence to support them in their role.  It will not supplant the affordable housing activity that they should engage in as housing authorities.  The quantum of affordable housing coming through other streams should be enhanced by this.  Local authorities do not have to use the LDA.  It is a question of choice.  If the State develops an agency with those kinds of capability, it is important that it be used as a shared service to deliver benefits.  From the LDA's perspective, this fits into the overall affordable housing policy, which is a matter for the Department.</p></speech>

I remain to be convinced that an exemption is necessary.  We received correspondence from the Information Commissioner in this regard.  He stated that the exemptions contained in the FOI Act were sufficiently robust to ensure the protection of records whose release would be likely to give rise to any of the harms against which the exemption seeks to protect.  Mr. Coleman mentioned how many State bodies had a commercial mandate while being committed to achieving important social and economic objectives, including the provision of electricity, public transport, etc.  Public transport bodies are under the auspices of the FOI Act, though.  I can submit an FOI request to Dublin Bus, the National Transport Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I am curious about the logic.  I will ask both witnesses why head 39, which provides for an exemption, exists in the Bill.  Is it not the case under the FOI Act that commercially sensitive information can be redacted while still being subject to FOI?  Is it not also the case that the Information Commissioner could adjudicate on such matters?  Are robust and significant protections not built into the Act?  I invite Mr. Coleman to answer first, then Ms Graham.</p></speech>

I do not need to name the bodies - people know what I am talking about.  Any blanket exemption poses significant concerns.</p><p>I am curious as to the logic behind empowering the LDA with them again.  Surely the exemptions in the Act with regard to commercial sensitivity are significant enough.</p></speech>

When I consider the impact on the LDA of freedom of information issues, it is purely to protect the LDA and the taxpayer resources going into it, for instance, regarding information on how we analyse sites or sites we are interested in acquiring in future.  It is about commercial sensitivity and commercial operations.  Deputy O'Broin made a good point on the general exemptions that exist under the Freedom of Information Act and this just follows recent precedents and precedents from elsewhere.</p></speech>

The concept is that the information will be excluded by nature of the commercial provisions anyway and there is a considerable element of administration and consultation with people.  It was for operational reasons.</p> <p>  As I indicated my opening statement, the Minister is open to examining the issues that might be raised by the committee with regard to freedom of information and lobbying to see whether we can strike a balance to increase the accountability people want without being unnecessarily burdensome to the LDA or infringing on its commercial freedom.  If measures come forward that can achieve this balance, we are perfectly willing to take them.  We were following the most recent legislative vehicle in the housing domain, which was with regard to lending to developers and protecting that commercial role.  We will consider whatever comes from the committee in this regard.</p></speech>

I do not want to go back to the countercyclical issue because it is important to acknowledge that the difficulties the State had after 2008 were not because of a lack of borrowing capacity or a lack of Exchequer revenue; they were because of decisions taken to use the borrowing capacity and Exchequer revenue to hand to do something else.  For example, we had the National Pensions Reserve Fund with &euro;30 billion.  That money was available for a range of measures but the Government made policy decisions to use the money to recapitalise banks.</p><p>Likewise, with regard to the borrowing capacity of the State, in 2008 our debt-to-GDP ratio was 42%, which was well below the Stability and Growth Pact rules.  The State had a capacity to borrow and, in fact, it took on the liabilities of Anglo Irish Bank with the promissory notes.  The only reason I say this is not to rehearse the history of it but to state that at that point in time, economic difficulties notwithstanding, the State had significant borrowing and spending capacity but chose to use it for something else.  It is not the case that because we are in a recession, we cannot borrow or pump prime the economy.  We just chose to pump prime and borrow for the banks rather than for housing.</p><p>I ask witnesses to look at what is happening with the approved housing body sector in the UK.  It has taken on an increasingly commercial <i>modus operandi</i>, whereby it is engaged in building open market price houses and using the sale of those houses to cross-subsidise mid-market affordable houses as well as social houses.  I attended a major conference in London recently where these bodies said clearly that they are nervous about the dip into recession and how it will constrain their ability to generate revenue to invest countercyclically.  In fact, the one model that is not unlike that of the witnesses, albeit without the land element, is telling us very clearly there is a danger to this model and I do not hear this being recognised.</p><p>To go back to the added value, if I get it right, good local authorities can co-ordinate among themselves and it is about the &quot;financing structure&quot;, to use Mr. Coleman's words.</p><p>This really refers to the LDA's ability to find affordable rental and purchase properties off-balance sheet.  The nub of the matter is that is what it brings to the table; therefore, rather than a local authority or an approved housing body having to borrow, as happened in the case of the project on Enniskerry Road, off-balance sheet development is the key.  That is my interpretation of what Mr. Coleman said.</p><p> My point about the economic and non-economic bits of the Bill is that they are not with what state aid rules are concerned; rather, they are concerned with two types of economic activity.  They are economic activities which are commercial and general economic activities which are non-commercial.  Market price housing is in the first category, while social and affordable housing is in the second.  Is there a concern that mixing the two and having one agency overseeing the development, delivery and sale or allocation of the housing will fall foul of state aid rules?  Is this something at which the LDA is actively looking?  In my limited knowledge of these matters, this will be one of the big hurdles the agency will faces when it comes to engage with the Commission.</p></speech>

The distinction I was making was that the commercials were able to stick to their statute and investment plans.  They were not dependent on the choices made by the Government.  That was the element to which I was trying to refer.  We have been looking at that model which includes both affordable housing and private housing, with reference to the tests we have been undertaking from a state aid rules perspective.  It takes account of both components and what they mean.  Part and parcel of it is the issue to which Mr Coleman referred.  We are speaking about the use of public lands in the first instance and the fact that the transfer of those sites, irrespective of whether it was to the LDA or a private operator, would encompass the provision of social and affordable housing.  That is the landscape on which all of this is set.  I confirm that we are looking at both angles.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is on what the LDA should rely in its model, although I agree that it should seek ways to deal with the issue of affordable housing provision, in particular.  Social housing will always be a function of its service in the interests of the general public.  We should seek ways for affordable housing to be deliverable without a subvention through a downturn.  It is something for which we should strive.  In time, it might be decoupled from private housing delivery.  Something else we would love to do through a downturn is buy land, particularly for the longer term, that obviously would not be tied to private housing production.</p> <p>  On whether the value added in Shanganagh would be solely due to the financing model the LDA might be able to invoke, it is a significant part of it.  Developing something that would be sustainable through a downturn will be very important.  If the LDA can sponsor and lead on it, it would be of benefit to the markets and the local authorities.  It would also help us to deliver on our obligations through downturns if we still had an affordability requirement to meet on our sites.  It is not as simple as purely being about the financing model.  On a practical basis, we have been working well with the local authority on project management in Shanganagh, as well as with other local authorities.</p><p>It is not purely the financing model.  We are collaborating well on other aspects.</p></speech>

With Mr. Coleman's previous experience with NAMA, what was the experience there on the freedom of information, FOI, thing?  There are some similarities between NAMA and the LDA.  Clearly, FOI will be a big issue.  Mr. Coleman got a taste of it this morning.  We talked earlier about probity, transparency, openness, open government and accountability.  This will be a big issue.  Many things were learned from NAMA.  There was considerable disquiet in the public domain.  I genuinely wish the LDA well, but it must have the confidence of the public at large.  That will be critical in setting the foundations for its success.  I ask Mr. Coleman to share with the committee his experience of how the FOI thing was dealt with in NAMA.  Does he see any similarities?

One way to think about that is to consider the different context that applied in NAMA as opposed to the LDA.  NAMA was of a time.  The nature of its work was highly controversial.  There were many people tied up in NAMA who did not want it to succeed in its objectives, which may have been against their interests.  It is a different beast from the LDA.  The LDA is generally dealing with State assets, certainly in its initial guise before it starts acquiring land on the private market at the appropriate time.  It will probably be more of a force for positivity as opposed to the difficult and sometimes unpopular job that NAMA had to do.</p> <p>  That applies a different context to the FOI requests that come in.  We have had a number of FOI requests and our approach to FOI so far would be to err on the side on the side of transparency and releasing as much as we can.  We try to engage with inquirers and FOI requesters to work with them to establish what exactly they are looking for and see if we can get to the nub of the issue they are trying to uncover etc.  That would be our bias towards doing that and I do not see why that would change.  Irrespective of whether the provisions of the Bill carry through, we will still be subject to FOI.</p> <p>  I would rather not speak too much about NAMA because it was a different context.  I would see the LDA having a bias towards releasing as much as we can without it impacting on the commercial sensitivities of the LDA and ultimately taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

An FOI would confer an obligation rather than a generous disposition.  Personnel may change, as can the focus and ethos of an organisation.  If it is underpinned by a legislative certainty where FOI has hold in an organisation, that is far better than the current situation.  While I accept the LDA may be erring on the side of transparency right now, in future it may not and that is at the discretion of the organisation.  That gets to the nub of my line of questioning.</p> <p>  I have not seen any logic that would override the exemptions already within the Freedom of Information Act and that would override the prerogative of the Information Commissioner to adjudicate on any commercially sensitive issues.  In their answers, both the LDA and the Department have indicated the need to maintain and preserve commercial sensitivity.  Based on what I have heard from Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Senator Boyhan, I do not believe anybody is saying otherwise.  Naturally, it is important to keep that commercial sensitivity with sites it is exploring.</p><p>Surely the Information Commissioner can do that in the context of the Freedom of Information Act.  Surely the existing exemptions in that Act are sufficiently robust.  There is a legitimate concern that if this organisation operates outside FOI and the lobbying register, it will be living in the shadows.  Based on Mr. Coleman's answer, I do not believe that is a space he wants his organisation to be in necessarily.</p><p> There was a description of freedom of information as burdensome.  Freedom of information exists in respect of the Houses of the Oireachtas, all Departments and many agencies to shed light on matters and to provide answers.  Sometimes those answers may be uncomfortable and may take up administrative time, but they are a good thing.  They maintain public trust in an organisation.  The LDA is a very important organisation and will be charged with considerable funding and resources.  Accordingly, there is great value of having it live within the realm of FOI.  From what I can hear, there is no great rationale for it living outside that realm.</p><p> Mr. Coleman has experience of working in NAMA and in an organisation that is outside FOI.  He correctly compared and contrasted the different natures of the two organisations.  Does he believe the core functions of the LDA would be able to exist if it were subject to an FOI regime and if head 39 were changed?  Would it infringe on the LDA's ability to work?</p></speech>

As Ms Graham mentioned, the Bill as drafted, replicates the most recent examples that have come through the Oireachtas and I guess that is the starting point.  The Bill, as drafted, does not exempt the LDA from FOI.  All basically non-business-related activities would be subject to the FOI.  Requests relating to whom I meet and the service providers we engage will still be part of that.  Obviously, if the committee has concerns that somehow that is inconsistent with what we are trying to do, I am sure we can take that away and pick up on that.  Ms Graham may wish to add to that.</p></speech>

Many moons ago, I was the Department's first FOI officer.  I was intimately involved in implementing the freedom of information legislation in the Department and was the champion of it in the Department.  I can assure the committee from that perspective.  I was trying to reflect that the FOI provisions are general in nature, trying to cover all the potential areas where there may be exemption.  Sometimes specific categories, such as confidentiality or commercial sensitivity, are known to impact on an organisation and that is reflected in its legislation.  Some organisations have confidential information or commercial information particularly identified.  That is so that based on the general exemption, rather than going through an exercise where the Information Commissioner will end up in that position, we know it from the outset.  That is purely the rationale, that there is a component of information that is held.  However, I indicated that we believe given the nature of the LDA it is important to have the appropriate balance of accountability and governance.  We are mindful of the discussion the committee has had on FOI and lobbying, the legislation relating to both of which is general in nature.</p><p>For that reason, they are not part of the Minister's legislation.  The Minister will look to the Government and discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for proposed alternatives.  I am simply signalling that we were conscious of the debate.  If we can find a measure that sits appropriately with what we are trying to do, we are open to it.  We are only trying to ensure that the LDA can work operationally with the appropriate level of transparency and accountability.  We are open to all ideas in that regard.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear that.  Ms Graham was a champion of freedom of information requests in a former life, and may be one in her present iteration.  My underlying concern comes from what the Information Commissioner said.  The Information Commissioner clearly has concerns with the current direction.  Those concerns should be noted and acted upon.  I am glad to hear the Department has an open mind in this regard.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to begin our deliberations on the topic of education and how it impacts the Traveller community.  We will meet representatives from the National Traveller Women's Forum and the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project, and Ms Catherine Joyce.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Eileen Flynn of the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Mr. Patrick Nevin of the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project, and Ms Catherine Joyce.</p><p>In accordance with procedures, I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of these Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  They also adversely affect the television coverage and web streaming.  I wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that witnesses have made to the joint committee will be published on the committee's website.  After the presentation there will be questions from members of the committee.</p><p>I call Mr. Patrick Nevin to make his opening statement on behalf of the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project.</p></speech>

We have almost come to the 100th anniversary of the Irish State's foundation.</p><p>From the beginning, Travellers were denied ownership of their identity and historical place in its foundation.  This is very obvious in the 1952 Irish Folklore Commission survey.  In this document we see how it was the sedentary members of society who were given the opportunity to speak as well as name, place and deny Travellers the ownership of their position in the broader sphere of Irish society.  This document is used as a key source by academics at home and abroad as a starting point in their academic discourse on Travellers.  We see how Travellers were to become either idealised or denigrated and made into objects of representation and investigation.  Yet, at no time do we hear the voice of the Travellers in this document.</p><p> From the 1960s onwards, we seen a deepening interest in the Traveller community and we see the State taking a more active role in the problem of Travellers.  I use the statement the "problem of Travellers" openly as this was how the State viewed the Traveller or tinker community.  This was to culminate in the Government publication of the report of the Commission on Itinerancy in 1963.  In this report we see again that the voice of Travellers is not represented.  The commission was made up of various representatives of official Ireland.  The opening statement by the chairman to the commission outlines what the commission was intent on doing.  The statement makes it clear that the solution to the Traevller problem was the complete absorption of the Traveller community and it follows that there can be no final solution of the problems created by itinerants until they are absorbed into the general community.  We must see this as the starting point when we are looking at the barriers and the key issues affecting Travellers, whether they are accessing education, accommodation, health or unemployment.</p><p> This open and transparent assault on the Traveller community way of life and identity must be acknowledged as a major contributory factor to the exclusion of Travellers from the State and its various institutions.  To respond to the serious issues Travellers face in their everyday lives we must accept that the State needs to look at the issue of reparations.  We have to acknowledge this injustice as we have acknowledged the injustice committed upon the women who were institutionalised in such places as the Magdalen laundries.  A total of 60 years of State-sponsored denial of Traveller identity and culture has not only impacted on their educational attainment but has created an internalised oppression, barriers and lack of self-worth within the Traveller community.  What I mean by reparations is that the State must remedy this at a structural level.  It could start by addressing the deficit of Traveller culture and history within the education system.  This must be a priority for the State if it is serious in trying to reverse six decades of assimilationist policies.  It must also put in place affirmative action programmes to mirror those in the United States, Canada and Australia.  While there are still major issues impacting on the various communities affected in these countries, the overall picture is one of positivity.</p><p> Since March 2017 our ethnicity has been acknowledged.  However, this on its own does not acknowledge or repair the damage that has been inflicted on the Traveller community by the State with its policies of absorption and assimilation.  The State and its institutions need to accept their direct role in the catastrophic damage to the Traveller community.  We must have an open transparent and honest discourse like we have had in recent years in regard to other State and institutionalised wrongs.  Our submission, Tallaght Travellers, has to some extent outlined several recommendations and ways that we can move forward in partnership and achieve a more equal and improved society.  While addressing education we must remember that State policies have also had a negative impact and created inequalities and poor outcomes for my community in other areas including health, employment accommodation culture and language.  My thanks to the committee.</p></speech>

We are not just second-class citizens as women, we are third-class citizens because of the intersectionality that goes with being a Traveller.  For many Traveller children, it is a struggle to get to school every day due to their living accommodation and schools and the system often do not understand that.  Traveller children have little or no support from the education system.  </p> <p>  I will have to call on Ms Joyce to do the presentation because I do not want to feck it up.

Earlier this year, we spoke to a Traveller woman who was making every effort to support her daughter in finishing her last two years of secondary school.  Her daughter is bright and well able for the academic work, but was lonely as there were no other Traveller girls in the school with her.  The advice of the principal at the time was that nothing could be done but that if she wanted, she could be put on a reduced timetable.  The mother told us that schools need to have a real understanding of the ongoing racism and exclusion experienced by Traveller students instead of burying their heads in the sand and pretending they believe that everyone is treated the same when they know that is not the case.  She went on to say that children respond well to honesty, so from the outset teachers should not be afraid to talk to Traveller children as Travellers.  Traveller children should not have to hide their identity in school and should be made to feel that school is a safe place to stay.  The context of that conversation and the statement from that mother was that three young Traveller girls that her daughter had been friends with at junior certificate level were put on reduced timetable.  Within months of that happening, they had dropped out of secondary school.</p> <p>  Every child in Ireland has a right to education.</p><p>It is enshrined in our Constitution but what about every child's right to go to a school in a safe environment that is free from racism where he or she will be treated with dignity and respect and have his or her culture recognised and valued?  </p><p> Every child should have an absolute right to equality of access, participation and outcomes.  This is not so for very many Traveller children and we cannot say this enough.  There needs to be equality of access, there needs to be equality in terms of participation and there certainly needs to be equality in terms of outcomes.  We know from anecdotal evidence that there is no longer a 100% transfer rate of Traveller children from primary to post-primary education.  We also know that the attainment levels of many Traveller children are lower than children from the settled majority.  Only 1% of Travellers are in third-level institutions and 82% of Traveller women are unemployed.  Our submission also references a range of statistics highlighting the inequality in outcomes from education for Traveller women and girls.  Racist bullying from their settled peers and educators is a daily experience for many Traveller learners.  Low expectations of Traveller learners on the part of teachers is a clear example of the bias and stereotyping that take place in our education institutions.  Discriminatory practices are still evident, for example, enrolment processes that exclude Traveller children and growing numbers of Traveller children being inappropriately placed on reduced timetables, which significantly impact on their educational opportunities and outcomes.  There was a real opportunity last year with regard to enrolment processes and the discriminatory and racist practice of giving a child first preference if his or her older siblings were in the school that adversely impacted some groups, including Travellers where there is no history of second-level education.  Unfortunately, it fell short.  All of these practices and more such as some schools' refusal to take Traveller children have a significant impact on the progression of Travellers in second-level education and engagement with third-level institutions.  </p><p> Regarding recommendations, the Department of Education and Skills needs to develop an action and implementation plan for all 14 actions for which it is responsible under the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy in partnership with Traveller organisations.  Outstanding recommendations from the education strategy that was launched in 2006 should be addressed in a similar manner.  A range of stakeholders, including Traveller organisations, put significant effort and time into developing that education strategy and there were really high expectations that it would have brought change.  Other than the fanfare on the day of the launch in the Department of Education and Skills in Marlborough Street, it fell flat and failed to address the failures of the system with regard to Traveller children in education.  Efforts must be made to ensure that a strong and robust inclusion of Traveller culture is present in curricula and the whole school environment.  The Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill should be passed without amendment and we hope it will.  There is a need for compulsory anti-racism and intercultural training pertaining to Travellers as part of pre-service and in-service teacher training and there is a need for visibility of Traveller culture in curricula.  Additional recommendations can be found in our submission to the joint committee, including recommendations on the use of reduced timetables in Irish schools made earlier this year to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, about which we are still very concerned.  We have written to the Department again as it is developing guidelines for schools with regard to reduced timetables.  There are a number of key points in our submission that need to be addressed, including the role of the inspectorate, to ensure this discriminatory and racist practice with regard to Travellers is stamped out.  </p><p> A final point I would like to leave the committee with is that while the Department of Education and Skills has made some efforts in the past two years, and I use the term "some efforts" loosely, to begin to address these issues, major institutional and systematic change is needed to ensure equality of access, participation and outcomes for Traveller children and learners in education.  As Ms Flynn said, when we were developing this presentation, it is essential that Traveller women and girls have real opportunities for success and outcomes from education.  I will leave the committee with that final thought.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019111200002#G00400"><p>I thank the committee and, indeed, Senator Kelleher, who I have met on a number of occasions, who has a particular interest in Traveller education.</p> <p>  My name is Catherine Joyce.  I am one of the managers of Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group.  Our area is Dublin 15 but we serve the surrounding areas such as Meath, Cavan and Fingal County Council.</p> <p>  As Ms Maria Joyce and Mr. Nevin have already said, education is not a luxury.  It is a right that all children have in this country.  However, it is as important to have the right to be treated equally within the education system and that cannot be achieved if the lived experience, culture and identify of Travellers is not reflected positively within schools.  For that to happen, we must look at the curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, how books are developed in relation to promoting aspects of Irish culture and identity within the system, and not being able to do that and reflect Traveller culture.  They are looking at it now but it is way overdue.  It is badly needed in terms of making sure that the curriculum reflects Traveller culture.</p> <p>  Every statistic one ever hears about education is a child, like my child, Johnny, who is 14 years of age, or the child belonging to those who are in this room.  It is the next generation that we are talking about in the Traveller community who are children, who are pupils, who are life-long learners and who are going through an educational system that, as Ms Maria Joyce stated, is racist towards our culture, identity and, indeed, community.  When we are thinking about it, we have to think about the individuals who are involved in these statistics that are getting thrown out left, right and centre.</p> <p>  In my catchment area, there are Travellers who live in a range of different types of accommodation.  There are Travellers who live in Traveller-specific accommodation - halting sites and group housing schemes.  There are Travellers who live in the private rented sector who live in mainstream housing.  There are also Travellers who, like a lot of people in this country, are homeless.  These Travellers have an added challenge of trying to get to school - when they might be in the geographical area of Dublin 15 but are travelling from Swords and other areas - to make sure that they adhere to their commitments in relation to their child's education.  They are detached from their extended family and community but they also have a logistical difficulty in terms of finances and distance in trying to get their child to school and in getting him or her to stay the correct school hours.  That causes great difficulty without schools forcing reduced hours on Traveller children and stating that, because one is a Traveller child, it is okay to miss a subject such as English, Irish or mathematics.  Whatever the subject, that limits their opportunities of being able to progress in education and into second-level education.  It also limits their employment opportunities in this country.  Projects, such as my own, spend a lot of time and energy trying to undo a lot of damage that was done in the educational system in this country where we are trying to re-educate Travellers who left at an early school age or who were forced into segregated classes in this country.  We spend a lot of time and energy educating people who have only had a limited number of years, if any, in mainstream education.  Considerable financial resources of the State have gone into doing that through a number of Traveller projects, such as our own, around the country.</p> <p>  When we are looking at education, we must look at the cuts.  We cannot go any further without saying that the cuts have been detrimental to education.  Up until the cuts in 2008 and 2009, we had 100% transition of Travellers in Blanchardstown from mainstream primary school education into second-level education.  We had all the challenges of trying to keep children in education.  We ourselves provided homework support clubs.  Other people provided breakfast clubs.  We had the resource teacher for Travellers, RTT.  We had the visiting teacher services.  We had all of those services, including transport, to maintain that 100% transition.  It only lasted for two years.  As soon as the cuts occurred, it was no longer the case that we had transition.</p> <p>  If one looks at the possibilities that could be open to Travellers if they transferred into second-level education and the opportunities they might have if they go on to college and further education or learning, that has been limited because of the State's cuts in Traveller education.</p> <p>  We have also got a situation where all of those people have gone through a school system that does not reflect their culture, identity or lived experience.</p><p>We have a position whereby the Traveller children are being taught by their parents and extended families.  When they are taught in that environment, they are also being taught to be guarded about how they expose their identity to people who are not Travellers.  They are taught to be guarded in how they conduct and present themselves to settled people in schools.  Travellers do not want their children to have to face racism and discrimination just because they are proud of their Traveller identity, their culture and their way of life.  We must ensure education is not just about educating Travellers about Traveller culture but also about educating settled people about Traveller culture.</p><p> Unfortunately, the State has neglected its duty in this area in a big way.  Projects like mine are trying to undo much of the damage with the education programmes we provide to schools and teachers, as well as some of the development work we do locally.  We are doing work that could have been done by the State 20 years ago in order to ensure that interculturalism would have included Travellers in the space where we could talk about different cultures and identity.  It is particularly important given the announcement in 2017 where the State recognised Traveller ethnicity that schools would start to take on that responsibility in a real way and ensure they teach all children in schools about the identity of Travellers, as well as the important role that Travellers have played in the economic survival of the country and in the area of traditional music.  There are also other elements of their contribution to consider, including the landscape of the country, farming, etc.  That is not reflected but it could be in the whole school curriculum rather than just one subject.</p><p> Travellers might have to endure teachers who do not know anything about Travellers teaching a subject in one class or one year.  Children like mine have excused themselves when the subject was taught and did not go into school for the day.  Other children belonging to me who sat in those classes when the topic was taught had to endure racism and discrimination from the other children in the classrooms and had to come to their own defence in challenging it.  Sometimes they got into physical arguments in the yard because of comments made in the classroom setting because a teacher was not able to handle the information coming through.  It was one subject and one piece of a curriculum.  It is a lot of responsibility to place on a 14 or 15 year old from the Traveller community if they must educate Travellers and settled people, including their friends, as well as teachers of the subject in the first place.</p><p> None of the Travellers in our area lives in a DEIS area so they do not have any special resources or significant support going into the schools.  They are treated the same as everybody else.  In an ideal world, we would like it to be the case that no other resources are needed but when people are targets of racism, discrimination and cultural erosion, there is an important need for DEIS schools to be expanded where there is a significant number of Travellers who could access such additional support.  As I stated, the visiting teacher service is gone and the loss of posts for RTTs has had a significant impact on Travellers.  There is also the question of significant other supports, including capitation grants to help Travellers in schools.</p><p> The national survey in 2017 indicated that four out of ten Travellers stated that their Traveller children had been bullied in school because of their identity.  I know that is the case as my children were bullied in school to the extent that they were called "knackers" in the school yard.  They were asked to pick up a tissue paper and this and that.  When a teacher tried to respond to the incident in the yard, the response was to ask my child to explain who Travellers were; my child had to come up with the solution when the other person should have been reprimanded.  It is an awful indictment of our school system if we are asking children to be judge, jury and executioner when a racist comment is made against Travellers.</p><p> Interculturalism is important and it is vital the whole school learns about Travellers.  It is important that non-Traveller children learn about different cultures that make up society and that we look at the historical context of Travellers.  We must also consider the contemporary context of Travellers and we do not want people learning about Travellers who lived in wagons 40 years ago.  My children do not even know what it is to live in a wagon.   We must look at contemporary Traveller culture and trying to reflect that in the school curriculum.  Any negative stereotypes or views in the wider society should not be reflected in either the delivery of teaching or books used in that delivery.</p><p>Some good programmes, such as the Yellow Flag programme, deal with interculturalism in school but, unfortunately, in some cases Travellers are a tag-on.  The programme looks at other cultures and new communities but does not necessarily put Travellers to the forefront.<br/><br/>A programme could be developed to ensure that the schools have a role in prioritising the Traveller culture within programmes, specifically where they are about cultural identity and look at the native culture of Travellers in this country.  Traveller culture and history are not visible in the preschool, primary school and post-primary curricula and there are no mandated guidelines for schools on this matter.  Schools can teach what they want.  Even in the Yellow Flag programme they can leave it to the pupils, the teachers or the parents of the children who are in the school to teach it.  Very often much will be hidden because they do not want to expose Traveller culture and identity and they do not want that to be a reflection on their children who may be attending the school.  We must get it right and use the experts who are there for doing that, and it must be across the school setting and not just in one area.<br/><br/>Many Traveller groups are doing this work <i>ad hoc</i>through music, theatre and dramas.  My husband is involved through a play he wrote about it.  It is a cultural thing and he has contacted many people, but it should not be the responsibility of Traveller organisations.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that the educational system is at least reflective of the native Irish people who live in this country, if not ensuring that we include the new people who have joined our society.<br/><br/>There is a need to monitor the data relating to Travellers in schools and, in particular, on why Travellers are leaving school early, the locations of those schools and what the impact is in terms of the user of the school.  There is a need to establish a new education strategy.  I was involved in the last one and I am sure it is a door stop for a room somewhere in the Department of Education and Skills because I have not heard it quoted by many Ministers or people who are involved in education.  It took a great deal of time to do that.  It is not about spending another five years on an education strategy.  It is about a strategy that has targets and goals and adequate resources to implement it.  The last time I was involved in a discussion about education with the Department, when the cuts took place in 2008, the first thing it did was cut Traveller training centres.  While Traveller training centres categorically needed to go, they did not need to go as the first port of call when cuts were sanctioned.  The impact of that must be addressed in terms of the adults who have gone through a system where there are no adult learning spaces available.They are coming back to us on community employment, CE, and other programmes, but they are not suitable for adult learning.  We must examine that.<br/><br/>We must resource Traveller organisations in respect of picking up the tab for education.  We have picked up the visiting teacher service and the roles of the after-school programmes and breakfast clubs, yet we do not have an education worker or a youth worker.  Our project is left with the fallout from the cuts and we are trying to respond and deal with that.<br/><br/>I realise I have gone over time so I will finish quickly.  The intercultural awareness programme should be mandatory for trainee teachers and all teachers, regardless of whether they are teaching Traveller children or children from other communities.  There must be a situation where there is mandatory intercultural and anti-racist teaching for the teachers who are teaching in these schools.  It does not matter who the pupil is.  They should be educating everybody who comes through the door about interculturalism and anti-racism in school life and in the school setting.<br/><br/>The Department of Education and Skills has called for the inclusion of Traveller history and culture.  I welcome that.  I realise many people are questioning why they must learn about Travellers and not all the other cultures.  They are questioning why Travellers are so important and asking why Travellers cannot teach their own children.  The reality is that Travellers have been recognised as an ethnic minority group.  The State did that after much campaigning on behalf of Traveller organisations.  There is a responsibility on the State to educate its pupils, regardless of whether they are in preschool, primary, secondary or third level education.  If it is a private school one can look at the logistics of doing that.  Regardless of the type of education, the State has a responsibility to ensure that whatever is taught in schools does not damage the life of the young person who is going through that educational system.<br/><br/>I am speaking as a mother and a grandmother.  Some of my grandchildren are of Traveller extraction and some are of settled extraction.  When they are going through the school system they will be further disenfranchised by a situation where a teacher does not know how to teach the pupils in the school who come from a different culture or race or come from two cultures or identities.  There will be more of that, and not just in respect of Travellers.  We will have it in respect of people who come from Africa, China and elsewhere in the world to live in this country.</p><p>It is vital that we do not do the same wrongs we did to Travellers to other settled people or people from other cultures.  Traveller children and young people should be as important to the State as they are to me and our community.  If I am forced to put my children into mainstream second level education, the least that I can expect is that the Government will out for my child and not damage their health or mental well-being by telling them that it is not good to be a Traveller.</p></speech>

It contained little with which I would disagree.  One of her first points was how education is a right.  Unfortunately, there are still people who do not have rights.  Rights can exist theoretically but where people come from communities which have never been in a position to facilitate, support or exercise their rights, and they do not have the avenues to demand them and feel as though they deserve them, do they really have those rights at all?  People feel as though they no longer deserve to be supported and helped because they have been excluded for so long.</p> <p>  I will open up for questions from the members, beginning with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.503" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019111200002#K00300"><p>Many issued have been raised, many of which are cross-cutting.  The very obvious one would be how a child in education might be living in very bad accommodation or moving in homelessness from one bed and breakfast accommodation to another, which is something I often encounter.  It is an impossible challenge for a child compared to one in a settled home, in a settled place in a settled school.</p> <p>   At the end of his presentation, Mr. Nevin said he had some suggestions for things we could do.  I am interested to hear a synopsis of those.  Ultimately, the committee will write a report.  It will have a page or two of recommendations at the beginning.  My experience is that if the recommendations are fairly tight there is a greater chance of delivering them.  If one includes everything that would solve the world, it is probably harder to get them to deliver.  Mr. Nevin made a very powerful submission.  His points are valid about what happened or did not happen in the past, that is the sins of omission and of action, as it were.  We have to say how we move forward from here, taking that into account.  </p> <p>  The reduced timetable seems a lazy way out.  On what basis, unless there was a health reason or some overriding issue why would it be a standard response to someone in the Traveller community to say that they cannot do the full curriculum rather than saying that they need more supports to do the curriculum?  That has been the response.  Some years ago, a Traveller woman came to me in Tipperary and asked if her child could study Irish.  An outrageous proposition had been put to her.  Obviously the school could not be bothered teaching a Traveller child Irish and thought that something that was their right was not their right and was suggesting that the exemption from Irish would be taken.  What they were saying is that the child had to take it and that a Traveller could not do Irish.  Of course, I said that the child could and if this woman wanted her child to do Irish that was her choice.  I believe that there is many a Traveller child who has lost out significantly because the more that a child does the full curriculum the more chances he or she will get in life.  Therefore, unless there was some reason equivalent to the reason a non-Traveller child would have for not doing Irish there was no reason to deprive them of something that was important to them.</p><p> We talk vaguely about teaching Traveller culture but there is no fixed curriculum, with every school paddling its own canoe.  Human beings are ingenious at finding ways not to do a thing as it should be done.  How do our guests believe Traveller culture should be delivered in schools so that it has the desired effect, and not the opposite effect?  DEIS status for schools which have a large proportion of Travellers was mentioned.  I was astounded that a school with a large number of Travellers is not guaranteed DEIS status.  Would we be better to focus funding on extra resources for the Traveller pupils in such schools or to give it to the school in general, which the school might disburse in a way that does not necessarily assist those from the Traveller community?</p><p> One issue that is raised continually in front of this committee is that disadvantage in education and health is interlinked and people in bad accommodation find it equally difficult to learn.  Travellers are in halting sites while we are sitting here talking about the issues around those sites.  We witnessed a kid trying to do homework.  The kid was amazing because they were complicated sums and every one of them was correct but I do not know how the child was meant to concentrate amid the hubbub going on in the vicinity.  Another child would have a room or space to themselves if they wanted to study.</p><p> We need to look at the challenges faced by the Traveller community.  If parents are denied access to education, directly or indirectly, they cannot be of as much assistance to children with the various tasks they have to complete.  Should resources be focused and guaranteed to reach Traveller children or is there a danger that, by giving DEIS status to a school, the funds will simply be dissipated throughout the school, notwithstanding the fact that DEIS status is given on account of the number of Travellers at the school?</p><p> I remember the day the announcement on ethnicity was made.  I was very pleased it was made but I was worried that official Ireland would think it had done its bit.  My experience has been that it has made very little real difference.  I would be interested in the comments of our guests on that point.  The settled community needs a huge amount of education.  Sociological surveys state that settled people's attitudes to all different ethnic groups across the world are prejudiced but that they are most prejudiced, by far, against Travellers.</p></speech>

Other speakers can come in on the delivery of Traveller culture and history and how this would be facilitated in a school setting.  They can also comment on ethnicity and indicate if that has had any impact.</p><p>Please also respond to the last point Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made about educating the settled community.  That topic loops back into the other question on the implementation of Traveller culture in schools in terms of our future adult population.  </p></speech>

I will leave our suggestions aside for a moment and explain what I meant by reparations.</p> <p>  We need to consider how the State responded to Travellers in 1963.  We cannot separate that starting point as it is one of the most seminal dates for Travellers in this country.  I say that because from 1963 to 1973 the Traveller community moved from a nomadic transient population to one that was forced to become sedentary and settle in urban centres within the State.  I made a point about the membership of that committee being made up of official Ireland and one will realise that when one reads the report.  </p></speech>

We have witnessed that in recent weeks in terms of what has happened in Oughterard, Ballymore and the fire-bombing of direct provision centres or hotels that were earmarked for direct provision accommodation.  To me, that points to the fact that we, tinkers or Travellers, were the template for all of what is happening at this moment and what is to come.  That must be acknowledged.</p> <p>  In terms of reparations, the State needs to take ownership of Traveller identity and culture.  It needs to acknowledge that we have been part and parcel of the State since its foundation in 1922 and long before then for the previous millennia; we have existed and coexisted.  It is now time for reparations.  I have submitted my ideas for reparations as we all have.  The State needs to hold up its hands and say, "We need to take cognisance of what we inflicted on the community".</p> <p>  In 2017, the ESRI compiled a report entitled A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, which showed the difference in improvements in educational attainment of the non-Traveller population from the 1960s onwards when compared with what happened to Travellers.  It is important to note from the research that from the 1960s onwards Travellers were subject to an assimilationist-absorption policy for Travellers yet for the majority population the policy was one of education and investment in its culture, identity, history and place.  That did not happen for Travellers. The State needs to acknowledge what happened and take ownership of its actions, which is what I am talking about in terms of reparations.  </p> <p>  Ms Catherine Joyce made the point, as we all have, that State acknowledgement is not just important to Travellers.  We are not here to educate the majority population.  It is up to the State and its institutions to provide such education.  They need to take ownership of that task, which is important for the new communities but also for what is happening with Brexit and Northern Ireland, and where we are going in a new Ireland, the new discourse and what we are attempting to do.  At the heart of this situation is that Travellers have been used as a template for everything else that has happened to the new communities.  The State has perfected its othering on the back of Travellers so now is the time for reparations and not willy-nilly projects.  The State needs to take on board what has taken place in Canada, New Zealand and other places.  Such initiatives have, by and large, not resolved the issues in those places but a real genuine attempt has been made to address past wrongs, which is what this State needs to do.  I will respond further, if needs be.     </p></speech>

Where an area has a large contingent of Travellers and schools are struggling to keep Travellers in school or to keep Travellers at the same attainment level as their settled peers, there should be a way of managing that.  I am not saying DEIS is the ideal scenario, but in the absence of the visiting teacher service, where the teachers were able to make a joint assessment of the need in a particular school, there must be some type of programme or a way of making sure that, particularly in DEIS schools that have Traveller pupils, they are resourced to include Travellers.  Where there are no Travellers in the DEIS schools that are available, there should be some way of monitoring that.  Again, it is to do with reviewing the current state of play on the ground.</p><p> In regard to the history of Travellers, there are many Travellers in this country who were put into a segregated classroom from as early as four years of age.  My husband is one of them and he was put into a prefab at the back of a girls school in Finglas.  He went through his school life in segregated provision.  There were two teachers in that classroom and they taught very basic mathematics and English.  There were no other subjects such as Irish and history taught in the classroom.  There was a range of ages in the classroom setting, and when they left school they could write their names and addresses.  They were well lucky after coming out of those schools.  The schools were provided by the Catholic Church and the State.  The development of those schools was a joint collusion.  We must get an apology for those adults, who are only in their 50s and some might be even younger, for the segregation and deliberate isolation of Travellers within the education system.  Those people need an apology on behalf of the State.  Some type of recourse must be made in respect of those people and their education.</p><p> Regarding the culture and identity of Travellers being taught in schools, I do not believe every settled person going through school needs to know everything about Traveller culture and identity, but there are certainly areas where there are gaps.  Consider the economic change in Ireland through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  We talk about the industrial revolution here and tinsmithing being done away with by the arrival of plastic and so forth.  There was a genuine role for the tinker in this country in mending pots and pans.  The experience of settled people who used that service was predominantly good.  It might not be the case for people who are sitting here, but their parents and grandparents certainly would have had tinkers calling to the door and mending pots and pans.  There are parts of that which could be put into the economic modules in the education system.</p><p> I am not an academic and I am certainly not a teacher so I am not in a position to go through every schoolbook and subject in the classroom, but there are people who can go through them and Traveller-proof them with the positive aspects of Traveller identity, the positive role Travellers played in Irish music and so forth, and the hawkers and sellers at the door.  Travellers were recycling in this country before it was popular.  They were involved in recycling on the tip heads and the dumps.  They were recycling in markets with old washing machines, lawnmowers, bicycles and the like.  Those things have been ignored in the education system and in the awareness of recycling in this country.  I got a glimpse of a programme on RT&Eacute; last night and there was no mention of the people who were recycling before recycling was popular and trendy.  They were the Traveller community.  They were recycling long before it was the thing to do.  There are ways in which we can go through the curriculum and include Travellers and the positive role we played in society.</p><p> Musicians in this country would not deny the contribution that Travellers made not only in creating a style of music but also in preserving Irish music at a time it was under severe threat by the English in this country.  When Travellers used to go from door to door selling ballad sheets, they used to bring the songs and stories from another county.  They could not be written down because if a person was caught carrying the papers, he or she was done for.  They kept them in their heads and passed them on from generation to generation.  Some very famous musicians always credit Travellers for the role they played in that.  There are many opportunities to include Travellers.  I am not just talking about the history of Travellers but also contemporary Traveller culture.</p><p> I have children who went through the education system and every year they had a new book because the previous year's was not useable.  Books are being developed all the time.</p><p>Why are we are not talking to the companies developing the books and saying that the books cannot go into schools unless there is Traveller-proofing of the books for the curriculum?  It can and should be done.</p></speech>

It is an important point around the delivery of Traveller culture and history and not a justification for the existence of Travellers in a country.  It should take in everything that Travellers have contributed to Irish life for a very long time.  It seeps into every one of our subjects but it is excluded from books.  It is a good place to start.</p></speech>

We are all very different but should be treated with equal value, including every child on the island of Ireland.  Why is it different for a Traveller child?  I struggled through the education system.  This was not because I lived on a halting site and had family around me.  That part of being a Traveller is absolutely lovely to me and living on a halting site was a great experience.  What was not lovely for me were the conditions we lived in.  We could go a week without heating.  In my family's home now, the roof has nearly collapsed on top of us.  We need to get landlords who can fix problems in our homes.  If this happened in the settled population, the services would be provided but they are not provided on halting sites.  There are challenges faced by young Traveller children.  On a Christmas morning, we could have Traveller children coming to the house for water at Labre Park, where I was born and reared.  It is not because we come from a close-knit community, although there is a lovely sense of community; it is not the halting site that is the problem but rather the living conditions and the services not being provided to the Traveller community.  This has a dramatic impact on education and health.</p> <p>  With regard to ethnicity, on 1 March 2017, Travellers were recognised as an ethnic minority group in Ireland.  Unfortunately, this was just a statement and off we had to go with that recognition.  The idea was that these were happy days for Travellers.  Unfortunately, those happy days have not yet come about.  It is one thing to say Travellers are recognised as an ethnic minority group but another to see action and for Travellers to feel valued.  I am a new mother and my child is 50% Traveller, 50% settled and she is 100% of both cultures.  My husband and I were chatting the other day about what will happen if our child gets called a knacker in school.  I had never thought of this before and I hope it does not happen to my child.  I hope she never has to go through the struggles I had in the Irish education system.  That was just 12 years ago and going through second and third level education was a real struggle because of cost, accommodation and not having the support at home that I needed.</p> <p>  My father was literate but my three older siblings were in segregated schools, unfortunately.  I am dyslexic and my family did not understand homework so could not help me with it.  With all those struggles I still managed to get a degree.  I was a very lucky Traveller woman who was able to get a degree with supports from some services but not every child in my community is that lucky.  We need schools to know that a Traveller girl or young man does not necessarily want to go off and get married.  Our children should be valued in the education system, especially as now times are changing, as my brother always says.  We should be normalising Traveller recognition and it should be okay to be different.  We should teach Traveller culture in the same way we teach maths.  There are great Traveller people who are qualified teachers and they can teach Traveller culture and be part of that educational change.</p><p>It needs to change in order that we can have a better future for our children.</p><p> Ms Joyce and others have spoken about history.  To know where one is going, one must know where one came from.  If I was a Traveller child in primary or secondary school and told that I was going to learn about Traveller culture, I would feel more valued in the education system.  I came through years of school not being valued and wondering who I was and why was there nothing in the books about who I am, or having others tell me who I am.  I always knew I was different because of my background but I do not want that for Billy or any other Traveller child and to go through what I went through in the education system, and I was very lucky.  There are worse stories in the education system than mine and we cannot have that in future.  We must change.  We can start with the people in this room and start today.  We are discussing recommendations.  Let us work together on the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 and pass it.  That could be the first step.</p></speech>

That is such a powerful thing.  Unfortunately, people sometimes think normalising something is about making us look and sound exactly the same.  That is not what it is at all.

In one short generation, we have gone from there being no homeless Travellers because of the way of life and the culture to greater numbers of children in homelessness being Traveller children.  There is also the wholly substandard quality of Traveller accommodation, particularly Traveller-specific accommodation.  There are low levels of provision and what is there is wholly substandard and unsafe because of overcrowding.  The numbers of Travellers living in unauthorised accommodation, without the most basic of services, is significant and growing.  All those factors combined makes it amazing that our children survive and come through an education system in anyway half intact.  That is testament to the strength of the culture and way of life but it does not take away from education and the State's responsibility towards and its failings of Traveller children.  When the committee looks at accommodation after Christmas, it could consider site visits to some of those accommodations.  That would be very useful and a big eye opener to anyone who has not been in those spaces.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked if reduced timetables being a lazy way out for schools.  The only answer to that is "Yes".  He asked about additional supports.  One response by an educator to the rationale for using reduced timetables in a school was that the child did need additional supports but they did nothing to make that happen, they just put a reduced timetable in place.  There is no way that child will stay in the education system.  They and many others will fall through the cracks.  The history of Traveller children in this State, even those within the system in schools, has been of exclusion.  Extra resources should follow children but it cannot be done in the same way as has been the case in the past.  Extra resources, when attached to children not just on need but on identity, ensured segregated provision for Traveller children and sustained itself until very recently.</p><p>As somebody who has come through what were then called special classes for Travellers, I can tell the committee that it does not meet the needs of Traveller children.  Yes, resources should follow the child where there is need, but there needs to be a real way of looking how that happens because otherwise it gets soaked into the schools.</p><p> Between 2008 and 2013, Traveller-specific supports were cut by 86.6%.  Those supports were in place to address the big gap between the educational attainment rates for Traveller children and the outcomes for settled children.  That has been rowed back on and we no longer have a 100% transfer from primary to post-primary education.  Given that it is a legal requirement in this country to be in school until 16, the State in itself is violating those rights.</p><p> In terms of ethnicity, it has already been done to some extent but there has been little progression.  It is not about needing to come up with a whole new strategy or way of doing things.  It is about implementing the policies and strategies that already exist across the board for Travellers in terms of health, accommodation and education.  The State's newest policy, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, makes a whole range of recommendations across all of those areas.  The Departments and agencies of this State that are responsible for those areas need to implement those recommendations.  Again, it is implementation, implementation, implementation.</p><p> On the final point about prejudice and racism against Travellers, that seems to be the greatest and most acceptable.  Research undertaken not just by Travellers but by wider bodies demonstrates that it is one of the most acceptable forms of racism and is not being challenged.  There is no leadership approach in this country, from a top down perspective, in relation to racism against Travellers.  We have seen again the most recent tweets about Travellers that have come out from people who want to fill the political space, and they are incredibly racist.  That has followed on from many examples over the years.</p></speech>

They are finding ways for that not to come up as much as it could if the reduced timetable issue were exposed more than it is.</p> <p>  I know Catherine wants to come back in, but she might just work her contribution in after Deputy Kenny asks some questions.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions.  It is always very enlightening to hear the history of the Travelling people and their suffering at the moment.  As public representatives, we want to highlight that a great wrong has been done to Traveller people over the past number of generations, and we want to right that wrong together.</p> <p>  I have a question for Eileen, and she has largely answered it very eloquently.  Obviously, 1% of the Traveller community go into third level education, so there is a huge deficit in terms of primary to post-primary and then to third level education.  I understand there are economic issues and reasons for that.  When I was growing up, the vast majority of people never went into third level education and went to work.  They had to because the economic reality was they had to go to work.  There are always different reasons people do not go into third level education.  Some people want to get a job and so forth.  What was Eileen's experience when moving from secondary to third level education?  I do not say this in isolation.  Did she encounter different attitudes than second level education when she entered third level education?</p><p>What was her overall experience?  I am sure many people look up to her.  Does Ms Flynn say to all Travellers, "This was my experience and you do not have to follow it"?  What initiatives would help to increase participation from 1% to 5% in the next few years?</p></speech>

I was trying to be professional. I started my studies at Trinity College 12 years ago.  It was such a struggle because I was in a big institution by myself and did not feel I had a place there.  I did not feel that I belonged but I was probably my own worst enemy.  I used to bunk on the Luas - I should not say that - and buy a cup of tea, which got me through my whole day in college.  Unfortunately, I had no supports in Trinity College but that was 12 years ago.  I did not enjoy the experience.</p> <p>  Next, I went to Ballyfermot College to do a post-leaving certificate, PLC, course on pre-nursing and caring for people with special needs.  I loved the smaller college.  Next, I went to Maynooth to get a degree because in Ireland one is nobody without a piece of paper.  Unfortunately, nowadays the leaving cert is not the norm, a degree is the norm.  Education has become more challenging for Traveller people and many of them do not want to get that piece of paper.  </p> <p>  As Ms Maria Joyce has said, between 2008 and 2013 Traveller education supports were cut by 86%.  Other costs include the cost of going to university and the cost of travel especially if one does not drive.  For the wider community, these things start at a young age and in primary school, and starts with the value placed on a young person within the school system.  To succeed in education all it takes is for one person to believe you can do it.  I only ever felt valued as a Traveller woman when I worked in the organisations of the Traveller community.  Previous to that I never felt valued as a Traveller woman in Ireland, and it was not that I was not good enough for society.  On reflection, as a 30 year old Traveller woman, I think that Irish society was never good enough for us.  Travellers need to live in a society where we feel we are valued.  We are not the same as everybody else but we need to be treated with dignity and respect.  If we are shown that in primary school and secondary school, and belief is shown to our young people, then our young people will progress to third level education.  If one gets a sense of not belonging then why would one put oneself through any more torture?</p></speech>

The issue of targeted measures for Traveller children in school and special measures is really important in terms of supports and resources across the board.  We also need Travellers as teachers.  There are some Travellers who are teachers but their number must be significantly supported to enhance the visibility of culture and how that is taught within schools.  It is important for a Traveller child to be taught in the classroom by a teacher who is a Traveller.  A significant number of measures must be put in place to ensure scholarships and supports are available across the board in terms of whatever choice of education Travellers go into.  Having more teachers who are Travellers would have a significant impact on changing some of this.</p><p>On ethnicity, it was a hard-fought battle through 30 or 40 years to achieve the recognition that came in 2017.  It was just a start.  Very little has been done since then.  There has been an overall lack of implementation of the recommendations within the existing strategies.  This issue needs to be taken in a serious and significant way by the State, which needs to ensure that the recommendations are rolled out because there is increasing disillusionment.  It was an incredibly important announcement, particularly for our young people in terms of their identity and self-esteem to which significant damage has been caused through the years.  Action is needed to deliver on the recognition and bring about the change in education and other policy areas that is needed for Travellers so that we do not continue to have these conversations in ten or 15 years.  The point made by Ms Flynn on what she wants for her daughter, Billy, in the education system is what we representatives wanted for our children because our experience in education was very negative.  The State failed us in that regard, as it has failed our children.  I want for my grandchildren what Ms Flynn wants for Billy.  I hope that they will not be damaged by the Irish education system.</p></speech>

A very small number of Travellers in relative terms do the leaving certificate.  Spaces could be opened up on every degree programme in the country and every bar or criteria such as the leaving certificate removed.  That is what happens for access programmes, through which successful applicants do an access year.  Every degree course in Trinity College must hold one or two spaces for mature students.  There is no reason there could not be targeted Traveller-specific spaces.  It is not always a matter of economics; it is often more to do with social and cultural factors and everything that has gone before.</p></speech>

Some Travellers have stated that it has made things worse because it created an expectation that Travellers would be accepted and our cultural differences would be promoted and recognised.  As Ms Maria Joyce pointed out, it took us 30 years to get that announcement made.  I was actively involved in that campaign, as were many others.  It was what it was - an announcement.  No programme was put in place to explain what ethnicity is, how it is developed or why it is important for wider society as well as the Traveller community.  Particularly in counties Kildare and Kerry, Travellers who had never been involved in Traveller organisations, protests or campaigns took cases against pubs and hotels in the expectation that the announcement would give them some standing and back-up in terms of challenging the people discriminating against them.  However, it did not do so.   Rather, it did the opposite and polarised the issue to a greater extent.  More focus was put on the difference between Travellers and settled people in a negative way.  Although the announcement was welcomed by Traveller organisations, Travellers on the ground may have a very different experience in terms of what it means to them.</p> <p>  Likewise, it is important that we consider the fall-out of any actions being taken in the education system - I acknowledge that issues other than education are also being considered - and ensure that they do not further disenfranchise the Traveller community.  We should not pursue a good idea or gesture or goodwill without putting in place programmes, as well as sanctions for discriminating against Travellers, and removing any discrimination against or marginalisation of Travellers by the State.  The recognition of ethnicity meant nothing to many Travellers.</p><p>That is the unfortunate truth.</p><p> I remember talking to a woman from the S&aacute;mi community about their ethnicity being acknowledged in the 1970s and the difference it made for them.  It did not make a difference overnight; it took 25 years of programmes, state intervention and rolling back on laws that prohibited the S&aacute;mi people from living as an ethnic minority group within Sweden and other Nordic countries.  Some of the by-laws that inhibited their traditional way of life were rowed back on.  One such by-law which is very relevant to the Traveller situation prohibited reindeer herders from travelling at particular times of the year or on particular paths that were traditional to the S&aacute;mi people, all of whom were reindeer herders.  Some of those laws were rowed back, which opened up those traditional ways for the S&aacute;mi people to retain and develop their reindeer herding culture.  It is a bit premature to ask what difference the 2017 announcement made.  In 25 years' time, after ten or 20 years of positive State intervention and undoing of the damage done to Travellers by the State, we might be able to see-----</p></speech>

To assess it now is premature.</p> <p>  The biggest obstacle to third level education for many Traveller children and many people with whom we deal who are no longer children and have come through the programmes we develop is their opinion of it.  Their opinion is that it is not for them, will not lead to a job in which they will not be discriminated against and is not something they can bring back and use in their community.  Unfortunately, that is the situation.  Many members of the Traveller community who go to third level - only 1% of Travellers do so - end up getting jobs in mainstream employment where they do not identify as Travellers.  There are Travellers who are garda&iacute;, nurses, teachers or working in mainstream employment and may even encounter Travellers in their everyday life but they do not identify as Travellers in their employment situation out of fear of what that would mean in terms of discrimination and racism in that employment.  Third level education is not in the psyche of many young Travellers.</p> <p>  On the possibility of attending third level, if one is discriminated against, marginalised and receives reduced hours in school, the possibility of progression through the second level education system and into third level is nil because one does not have the same academic achievement as one's settled peers.  Academic achievement is measured by points and marks and so on.  It will not happen for many Travellers.</p> <p>  Access programmes are brilliant when they work well for people, but there is a financial burden involved in going back to education at 24 years of age.  A 24 year old member of the Travelling community is probably married with children and may have additional issues such as homelessness or a lack of access to accommodation, services or goods.  All of those factors prevent a person from taking on third level education because, as a parent, they become more important than personal achievement.  I can categorically make that statement as a person who left school at 12 years of age.  Through the years, I had opportunities to go back to education but family life took over.  That is the situation for many people.</p> <p>  The reality is that adult Travellers miss out on such opportunities because our culture is different from that of settled people.  Settled people can go back to education at 20 years of age or 40 years of age.  Many go back to education as grandparents.  The role of Travellers has changed within Irish society.  I work with Traveller children who were in the foster care system.  One of the biggest challenges with those children is to try to promote their dual identity.  Many of them are placed in care with settled people; very few are placed in their own community.  I try to educate the foster carers to look after the dual identity of Traveller children.</p><p>Many of those families are really good, but many others are settled people with their own prejudices, experiences, and racist attitudes towards Travellers.  It is important to think of third level education as a practical thing which Travellers have a real possibility of accessing, progressing in and getting some kind of employment from.  We have to think of the lived experience of Travellers when discussing such matters.  It is okay to talk about hypothetical things and what positive impacts they could have, but we have to look at and acknowledge the lived experiences of Travellers when it comes to the developments or changes that need to happen in programmes and policies.</p><p> Finally, if a new educational strategy is to be developed, it must have measured and targeted goals as well as financial resources.  This Minister and the next one must address the cuts made to the Traveller education budget, which are having a detrimental effect on our community and our young people.  Their possibilities are being limited by the State.</p></speech>

Little more than 50 or 60 years ago, we were a self-sustaining, self-sufficient people who had a purpose and co-existed.  Within the space of 50 years, we have become, and are commonly accused of being, a parasitic people on the settled, sedentary system.  Some 50 or 60 years ago we were a sustainable, self-sufficient people with our own language, culture and history.  That has all changed in a short period, due to the monocultural mindset that came from the formation of this State in 1922.  It is a monoculture which was based on extreme nationalistic ideology.  I emphasise that because it is important.  We cannot underestimate the acceptable and open racism and discrimination that has been propagated against Travellers from the top down.  An episode occurred just yesterday which I will not go into, but it is there.  It comes from extremely educated people within official Ireland.  It is the feeding ground for the right-wing racism that we are now seeing with new communities.  The Irish State and those in positions of power within it must accept that they created that culture and othered Travellers.  They set about it.  All the research showing that is there, from both Traveller organisations and other institutions.  The only way forward is for the State to take ownership of that, acknowledge it, and make reparations.  "Reparation" comes from the word "repair", meaning "to mend what was broken", which is what they have done.</p></speech>

They have been very informative.  If I take one thing away from our parliamentary work, it will be that we must hold the State to account for the implementation of its various ongoing strategies.  It can often be difficult to get a sense of how a strategy, such as the inclusion strategy for 2017-2021, is going midway through it.  We might get a sense from witnesses at committees or whoever the strategy concerns, but it can often be difficult to get a sense based on updates from the Department.  We must hold the State and the Department to account for the implementation of such strategies.</p> <p>  I acknowledge what the witnesses have said about Senator Kelleher's Bill and the Civic Engagement Group of which Senator Ruane is a member.  I and others on this committee will do everything we can to get that Bill over the line before an election is called.</p> <p>  I was not great at school, but I always said it was not a gay place to be.</p><p>I primarily learned about history and politics through Irish music and songs, many of which were saved, collected, preserved and passed on by the Traveller community, as Ms Catherine Joyce mentioned.  I have previously mentioned John Reilly from Boyle in County Roscommon, who preserved many of the songs I know and sing.  I did not learn about him through leaving certificate music.  We should be looking at specific classes and a specific learning session should be embedded.  I should have learned about John Reilly in leaving certificate music.</p><p> I do not have much more to add.  I am interested in what Mr. Nevin said about reparations.  He mentioned open honest discourse.  I am sure his community does not have much trust in the media, which often informs these discussions, to have an open and honest discourse.  They might not have much trust in this place either, though I sometimes feel we do a better job than the media.  The dinner table is a great place for discussions, but I wonder in what kind of forums those appropriate, open honest discourses should be held.  I would welcome any comments on that.  How can we undo decades of assimilation?  I again thank everyone for their contributions. </p></speech>

Parity of esteem, recognition of cultural difference, recognition of dual identity, and recognition of place in society are all set out in that document.  That has never happened for Travellers.</p> <p>  Ms Catherine Joyce made a point about the S&aacute;mi people.  Legislation specifically targeting Travellers was introduced within a seven-year period, namely, the Control of Horses Act 1996, the Casual Trading Act 1995, and the trespass legislation in 2002.  That legislation was specifically targeted at Travellers.  No other state in western Europe has introduced such a number of targeted Acts since Nazi Germany in the 1930s.  People will say I am being melodramatic, but those three Acts culturally and economically target a people.</p> <p>  Ms Maria Joyce noted that we went from a nomadic people to a homeless people in a short period of time.  We were once self-sustainable and self-sufficient.  When I say we need an open and honest discourse, I mean that it has to come from the State and the powers that be.  They are the dominant norm and the single story or narrative.  The State needs to initiate that discourse and we need to look at what happened with other communities and how they changed the conversations.  We do not have to go very far to see an example.  The difference is that there are more of the guys up North than there are Travellers on the island of Ireland, and so they had much more power to play with.  That is the reason they have parity of esteem.  That is what I am talking about.</p></speech>

The legislation that has impacted detrimentally on Travellers needs to be reversed.  Those three pieces of legislation must be looked at seriously if the State is to take the impacts on Travellers seriously.  The State needs to look at those, and at the trespass legislation in particular.  We used to be a nomadic people, but it is now essentially illegal to be nomadic in this country.  That is the truth of it.</p><p>There needs to be real investment.  We need to get away from platitudes and small amounts of funding.  We need together to look at what has happened, and this process must include Travellers and Traveller representatives on an equal footing.</p><p> The root of the word "ethnicity" is the Greek word ethnos, meaning people or nation.  I would argue, as would many Travellers like me, that we are a nation in a nation and have been since the foundation of this State, but we have never been given the resources or the investment required to enable us to play an equal part in society.  There are quite a few Travellers who would agree with me on that.  We need and deserve our place and our recognition.  I studied Irish history in college.  Unless we take this seriously and acknowledge the wrongs that have been done to Travellers, we will perpetrate the same wrongs on the new communities.  We are witnessing some of that now, which is what makes this so serious.  We need to acknowledge what has taken place in recent weeks and the potential for it to get to another level.</p></speech>

We need political will and leadership if we are to see the necessary shift or change.  While there have been some positive policy developments since the task force was set up in 1995, the delivery of services to Travellers still takes place within a very negative policy context.  We have had an assimilation approach, but through segregation, which did not benefit Travellers.  Where there is positive policy development, we need to see implementation.  In the context of what Patrick was talking about, three specific pieces of legislation were introduced which had an adverse effect on Travellers.  The trespass legislation that was introduced, for example, has never been used against anybody but Travellers.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the need to hold others to account for their failure to implement policies.  Accountability in the context of Travellers and the implementation of positive policy developments has been in very short supply.  We need to see accountability.  Where Departments or State agencies have failed to deliver on key policies in areas like the environment or roads, responsibility has been taken from them.  Local authorities have been stripped of their responsibilities in a number of areas because they were not delivering, but that has not happened in the context of Traveller accommodation.  Not only have they failed to deliver, they have made the situation far worse in some areas.</p> <p>  Earlier we discussed third level education and the fact that adult Travellers cannot see themselves in third level education, but there is an onus on the State to address that.  There are examples of third level institutions that have put measures in place to improve access for Travellers and to increase their participation.  Some of these measures enable Travellers to enter third level as mature students, particularly Traveller women.  While participation levels are nowhere near where they need to be, those third level institutions that have introduced specific Traveller related measures have had more success than others.  Such measures need to be mirrored and captured.  I would argue that it is the responsibility of third level institutions to play their part.  The Higher Education Authority, for example, has an equality section and a gender section but the last two or three key strategic reports published by the authority did not mention Traveller women.  In that context, what is needed is both institutional and systemic change.</p></speech>

We are simply looking for equal access to opportunity.  Our community has craved equality for many years and we deserve it.</p><p>Young Travellers who use social media see racist comments being made about them by those who are better off.  That has a negative effect on them.  It makes them feel inferior and lowers their self esteem.  The Traveller community is not looking for special treatment.  Travellers have always valued education.  I want this committee to understand that it is not the case that Travellers do not value education.  What we want is to be able to get through the education system and feel that we belong.</p></speech>

We do not have the political voice that is needed to represent the issues affecting our community.  The committee members here and those members of other committees that examine Traveller issues are our voice.  We are relying on them to project the needs of our community in a positive way and to show the consequences of policy decisions in terms of how they affect our community.  When I think of policies, I think of the amount of work that Traveller organisations put into working with the State but we are unequal partners in that relationship.  At the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees and other national fora, we are giving information and providing whatever expertise we have but we are not equal partners at the table.  It is important that the members of this committee understand that.  Unfortunately, any individual in the settled community who has championed our cause at a political level has not been re-elected.  In that context, we are not asking individual committee members to stick their heads above the parapet but, as a collective, they have great strength.  The committee is able to look at these issues and at the State's responsibility to the Traveller community.  Members must take this on from the point of view of the parents and children who suffer at the hands of educators in this country.  I always look at my own children now when considering these situations.  I never used to do that because I was never one for telling personal stories.  However, since becoming a grandmother, I have realised that this is where it is at - the nuts and bolts of it.  When one looks at the treatment of one's children and grandchildren, one sees how much wrong is being done to them as individuals.  They are members of this society but they do not get treated as such.  Traveller children like my children and grandchildren have become the educators of the teachers in schools and of their peers.  They have become the educators by default because the State has not done its duty.  My children are answering questions that no child should ever have to answer.  They are taking on their shoulders the responsibility for and the weight of the entire Traveller community and the wrongs within it.  There are some wrongs in our community that we need to tackle internally.  We have to challenge some of the stuff that goes on in terms of racism, sexism and the racist views of some Travellers towards other communities.  At the end of the day, however, victims are not to blame for State persecution.  Unfortunately, in the areas of education and homelessness, it is the policies of the State that have negatively affected us and it is that negative impact that we are trying to undo.</p></speech>

I have had many conversations with Patrick in particular but have learned a huge amount from every person in the Traveller community who has been a part of my life since I was a child.  When I listen to the speakers here today, I realise that the onus should never have been on the Traveller community to be a part of my learning or understanding.  That is a huge amount of responsibility for anyone to have to carry.  No child should sit in a classroom and be made to feel that he or she has to find ways to justify his or her identity, community, heritage, family or peers.</p> <p>  We cannot finish this session without acknowledging the discourse that happened on Twitter over the last few days and that happens more generally and constantly on social media.</p><p>It is hard to have to be an observer and watch those conversations go back and forth between people who think or assume they know and start to speak for the Travelling community or think they are advocating for it when sometimes the advocates are in there taking up the space.  We can say or I can say that I care about Travellers' progress in education but sometimes the advocates need to move over too.  It is really only representative if people represent themselves here or in the educational system.  Our job is only done when we are not needed any more.  I hope that we and this committee can continue to get to a point where we facilitate not just consultation but equal partnership.</p><p> Mr. Nevin and Ms Joyce have raised questions about laws that exist that need to be amended or rolled back that have been part of that assimilation and the culture around horses etc.  My passion for horses as a child came from the Travelling community.  We would not have had so much access to animals in Tallaght if it was not for our Traveller friends teaching us how to ride horses up and down the Kiltipper Hill.  That was an important part of my childhood.  We have stood in the way of some of those natural cultural practices in the Travelling community and as a committee we need to seek a review of all that legislation.  That is very important. </p><p> I thank all the witnesses for everything that they have brought to this discussion. </p></speech>
