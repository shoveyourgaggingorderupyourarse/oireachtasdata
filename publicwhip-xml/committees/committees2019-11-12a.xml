    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I look forward to a good exchange of views.  I remind the committee of the Government's main priority in the framing of budget 2020, which is to help our economy and society to deal with the potential impacts of a disorderly Brexit.  As the committee is aware, on 11 September the Government agreed to base budget 2020 on the assumption of a disorderly Brexit at the end of October.  A primary reason for making this decision was to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario.  Although the risk of a disorderly Brexit in 2019 has clearly receded, considerable uncertainty remains with regard to the final outcome.  Consequently, assuming a no-deal Brexit ensures that the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to be able to meet this exceptional challenge, while preserving the longer-term sustainability of our public finances.  Those sectors and regions most affected by a disorderly Brexit will be supported through timely, temporary and targeted measures.  Before taking into account certain Brexit-related costs of &euro;1.2 billion and timing-related cash costs of &euro;169 million, the overall increase in core voted expenditure on public services and infrastructure in 2020 is estimated at more than &euro;3.3 billion</p><p>After taking account of discretionary revenue-raising measures of more than &euro;400 million, this results in a net budgetary package of more than &euro;2.9 billion.  This package is broadly in line with the amount of &euro;2.8 billion set out in the summer economic statement that would apply under the orderly Brexit scenario.  Further, taking into account commentary, including advice received from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in relation to in-year spending increases, two things have happened.  The first is that a significant effort has been made this year to reduce the level of Supplementary Estimates that are required, without jeopardising our ability to meet the public service needs of our citizens and, second, the additional funding increases for this year have been carried into our budget day package for next year.  This package is consistent with the advice we have received from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council but more broadly, is appropriate given the current position in the economic cycle and the risks in the external environment.</p><p> As outlined on budget day, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government will intervene to protect the impacted sectors and regions.  This funding will be borrowed money used to protect our economy.  If a no-deal Brexit does not happen, the money will not be borrowed for other purposes.  In the event of it happening, &euro;650 million of expenditure and funding will be available to be released in different waves and additional funding for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will be made available but that will only happen in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  Mitigating the effects of Brexit has been a feature not just of budget 2020 but also of the past three years' work.  This has included initiatives to increase competitiveness and put in place greater resilience in our economy.  For these ongoing initiatives, which are already in place, approximately &euro;200 million is included within the departmental allocations published on budget day.  This amount is additional to the &euro;1.2 billion noted earlier.</p><p> Since I published budget 2020 on 8 October, an extension of the EU's deadline for withdrawal to 31 January 2020 has been agreed.  As such, the risk of the UK departing the EU without a deal has been averted for now.  However, the ultimate outcome is still uncertain and a disorderly Brexit is still possible.  We hope that the UK's withdrawal will take place on the basis of the deal agreed between the UK and the EU at the October European Council, while also awaiting the outcome of the UK's general election.  The extension of the Article 50 exit point means there is likely to be some upside to my Department's forecasts.  However, if the withdrawal agreement is ratified, Ireland's position will improve with increased revenues and lower expenditure than forecast in budget 2020.  Growth could be expected to be in the order of 3.1% for next year, approximately 2.5% higher than forecast.  In addition, the general Government balance could be around 0.5% of national income or gross domestic product in 2020.</p><p> Furthermore, I want to indicate to the committee, because of the distinct possibility of stronger corporation tax receipts, it is conceivable that the fiscal position for this year could be better than assumed at budget time.  However, that depends on the continued careful and improved management of public expenditure.  As such, I will make a call on the end-year position following the publication of the November fiscal monitor, given that November is the single most important month of the year for tax receipts.  In addition, the Government is committed to running surpluses over the medium term, to reduce our debt and guard against risks such as the possible transient nature of some corporation tax receipts and potential reductions in revenue as a result of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project.</p><p> Our public finances continue to move in the right direction and this is testament to the right policies in recent years.  However, Brexit is not the only risk we face.  Due to the highly open nature of the economy, our public finances are always vulnerable to potential knock-on impacts from a shift in tone in global trade.  Should these risks not materialise, the principal risks then relate to potential overheating if the economy approaches full employment and changes in other jurisdictions affect the competitiveness of our corporation tax regime.</p><p> Going forward, we must continue to build on the hard-won gains of recent years and ensure our public finances remain on a stable and secure footing.  Some of the policies I have implemented in this regard include the establishment of the rainy day fund, which I will say a word about now, and, in addition, we must continue to maintain a broad and stable tax base to ensure the State's finances continue to be financed properly.</p><p> I am happy to tell the committee that I commenced the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund or the rainy day fund on Thursday, 31 October.  On foot of commencement and the necessary delegation order to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, regarding the management of the fund, I then directed the NTMA to transfer &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to the rainy day fund by 30 November.  In preparing budget 2020, I set out that a disorderly Brexit was the baseline scenario for budget planning purposes, and therefore a budget deficit was in prospect.  On that basis, I decided that there would be no transfer of &euro;500 million from the Exchequer in 2019 to the rainy day fund.  That will remain as a cash balance and, in particular in the context of a no-deal Brexit, will be used to meet the Exchequer funding requirement that would arise, which in turn will then be used for public spending priorities.  However, on budget day, I also set out that the funds transferred to the rainy day fund can be deployed in the event that the economic impact of a disorderly Brexit is larger than assumed.</p><p> I will now turn to the fiscal position.  Our economy has performed well in the year to date.  Gross domestic product growth of 5.5% is expected for 2019, which is generating for now a planned surplus of 0.2% of national income.  It is worth noting that this surplus could have been in the region of 1% to 1.25% of national income had the Government not increased capital expenditure from levels prevailing in 2016.  Public capital investment will increase this year by 22%.  Unemployment, at 4.8%, is now at its lowest level since 2012.  The end-October Exchequer returns indicate that tax revenues are up 6.7%, driven by broad-based buoyancy in all major tax heads.  We expect to meet our tax revenue target of &euro;58.6 billion by year end.  This represents a &euro;200 million increase on the stability programme update, SPU, forecast.</p><p> Turning to the outlook for next year, the economy is forecast to grow by just over 0.7% if we have to deal with a disorderly Brexit.  However, even in that scenario, our economy will grow.  It will be a two-speed economy with continued growth in the multinational-led sectors but a much more difficult situation in UK-facing sectors.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, my Department is forecasting a deficit of 0.6% of national income and we also expect to see a slower increase in the rate of employment.  However, as I stated on budget day and, as outlined by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, there is much more uncertainty regarding short-term prospects than is normally the case.</p><p> I will now turn to expenditure and give a brief overview of the outturn.</p><p>At the end of October total gross voted expenditure was just over &euro;53.5 billion, made up of &euro;48.9 billion in current expenditure and &euro;4.7 billion in capital expenditure.  The amount is &euro;3.6 billion, or 7.2%, ahead of the outturn for the same period in 2018.  Of this, &euro;2.7 billion relates to current expenditure, while just over &euro;900 million relates to capital expenditure which, as I stated, will be up by over one fifth by the end of the year.  This is broadly in line with the projections set out on budget day when the need for additional spending was announced for 2019 in a number of areas.  </p><p> The biggest pressure remains in the health sector, with the 2020 expenditure report outlining the potential scale of the Supplementary Estimate.  In recognition of the risks arising in health expenditure in recent years, a new health budget oversight group was established this year, incorporating members from the Department of Health and the HSE and chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The purpose of the group is to monitor health spending and staffing against the current budget allocation and act as an early warning mechanism for any deviation.  It is fair to say that while further progress is required in 2020 on health expenditure, the expenditure management position in 2019 is very different from what it was when I appeared in front of the committee last November.</p><p> In recent years the Government's priority has been capital investment.  We have seen a 90% increase since 2016.  Making large strategic capital investments was the right course of action in recent years, given the large fall-off during the crisis period.  Given the scale of investment in recent years, the growth rate is set to decline to more normal levels from 2022 onwards. </p><p> From a debt perspective, an important milestone is in prospect for this year, namely, that the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, GDP, is projected to fall below the 60% threshold set in the Stability and Growth Pact for the first time in the post-crisis period.  Having said that and as I stated on a number of occasions, our debt burden remains highly elevated and is forecast at 100.2% of GNI* for 2019, albeit declining to 97.4% in 2020.  Reducing the nominal level must be our priority.  In that context, at budget time my Department projected a surplus in headline terms of 0.2% of national income for this year.  However, given that the external economic outlook is deteriorating and the remaining uncertainty surrounding Brexit, our policy approach should be to run budget surpluses into the future if the economy continues to perform strongly and to use them to reduce the national debt.  Furthermore, windfall receipts that arise from the State reducing its involvement in the banking and financial sectors will be used to reduce the level of public debt.  We must continue to prepare for the inevitable slowdown, ensuring we do not spend money we might not have in the future and building on the achievements thus far. </p><p> Corporation tax revenue has been growing strongly, driven by increased company profitability.  Receipts to the end of October stand at 10.6% ahead of target.  November is the largest collection month of the year and we expect receipts to be stronger than forecast.  Ireland has been very successful for several decades in attracting leading multinationals.  Given the size of these multinational firms and our high level of integration with the global economy, we have seen the corporation tax base become somewhat concentrated, with the ten largest firms accounting for approximately 45% of all corporation tax receipts. </p><p> While Ireland's corporation tax receipts as a proportion of economic activity are broadly in line with those of other small, open, trading European economies, the Government is still acutely aware of the risks associated with the concentration of receipts.  That is why we will continue to broaden the tax base, prioritise the reduction of debt and run Exchequer surpluses in the future and for now.  In addition, on budget day my Department published a scoping paper entitled, Addressing Fiscal Vulnerabilities, to identify possible solutions and initiate a discussion on how best to mitigate our increasing reliance on corporation tax receipts.  The paper also sets out several proposals to ensure our fiscal rules will not contribute to budgetary imbalances.  I am considering them.  My Department will undertake a further assessment of corporation tax receipts in the context of the OECD process.  It will be published next March.</p><p> I will turn to specific matters I understand the committee wants to discuss.  On our expenditure review, a sustainable expenditure policy needs to meet certain key requirements, including ensuring the overall level of expenditure remains affordable and delivering sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  Consequently, this requires that expenditure growth be set at a level that is consistent with the longer term growth potential of the economy and that there be an ongoing focus on the quality of expenditure.  In that regard, spending review papers provide an evidence base for departmental spending that informs budgetary choices.  The spending review process is aligned with the Estimates process as most papers are published in July or August each year.  In addition, given the rolling nature of the spending review process, the analysis produced in one year can help in other years.  The findings of spending review papers feed into the policy process by providing evidence to make well informed decisions in the relevant policy area. </p><p> I wish to comment on the demographic pressures and their impact on the budget.  The population is young, but this will change in the coming decades.  Last September my Department published a report entitled, Population Ageing and the Public Finances in Ireland.  It outlines that the ratio of retirees to workers is set to more than double by 2050.  There are around five persons of working age for each person aged 65 years and over.  By 2050, the equivalent figure will be just over two.  The greying of the population will have an adverse impact on the public finances, with age-related expenditure expected to rise by 6% of GDP by 2070.  Accommodating demography-related costs was a feature of budget 2020.  As with previous budgets, budget 2020 includes &euro;500 million for demographic pressures in the areas of health, social protection and education.  These allocations are informed by the paper Budgetary Impacts of Changing Demographics 2017&ndash;2027 which was published by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  An updated paper was published alongside budget 2020. </p><p> While we are potentially heading into choppier economic waters, we do so from a position of relative strength.  We do not have the imbalances that marked the economy a decade ago.  There is no credit-driven bubble, for example, but there is still uncertainty about the final outcome of Brexit.  Consequently, we must seek to continue to manage our finances next year within the parameters set out on budget day, with borrowing to fund the Brexit contingency measures to be triggered only in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  </p><p> I again thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak today.  I will be happy to address questions members may have.</p></speech>

He stated towards the end of his contribution that we were potentially heading into choppier economic waters.  He spoke about uncertain times and the hopes for an orderly Brexit.  He also flagged the issue of overheating.</p><p>The Supplementary Estimate for health will be limited to &euro;335 million.  The fiscal monitor continues to show health expenditure below profile, which we know is not reflective of the true picture.  Are there plans to make the fiscal monitor more reflective of the actual in-year health position?  Will the Minister update the committee on the status of the health budget oversight group to which he referred?  The committee has previously called for the minutes of the group meetings to be published.  Are there plans to do this?  Aside from health, are there other areas of expenditure about which the Minister is concerned?  What is being done to manage overruns in other areas?  What is the updated position on Brexit?  The Minister has mentioned the various deal and no deal possibilities.  If there is a Brexit deal and the UK remains in the EU until the end of 2020 will additional resources be available for allocation next year?  Will an additional transfer be made to the rainy day fund should a Brexit agreement be finalised?  I will come back to ask further questions later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#G00300"><p>I will work through each of them in turn.  I do not expect my Supplementary Estimates to vary from what I indicated on budget day.  I expect they will be broadly in line with what we announced on budget day.  Sometimes there is a degree of change because there are technical issues in various Departments that require an intervention but I am confident the figures I outlined on budget day, and where we will stand with those figures, will be in line with what I indicated, which is a figure of approximately &euro;660 million.  That figure includes the funding needed for the Christmas bonus.  I do not expect a significant change beyond what I have indicated.</p> <p>  I am confident the health Supplementary Estimate will be in line with what I indicated on budget day.  With regard to the November fiscal monitor and the Deputy's point on the lag between it and the figures coming out of the HSE, which show a difference in the budgetary position, I have asked Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials to inquire into this matter.  While in previous years we saw a gap between the published HSE position and the fiscal monitor that we publish each month, it is fair to say that for this year the gap is wider than we saw in other years.  The officials will look into the issue as we close out this year.  It is worthwhile saying the Supplementary Estimate we have agreed with the Department of Health looks potentially large in the context of the November fiscal monitor but we have it at that level with an expectation of convergence between our fiscal monitor and the HSE figures when we move into December and January.  It is predicated on the basis of careful planning that stretches beyond the fiscal monitor.  I do not propose to introduce other significant Supplementary Estimates.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on the minutes of the health budget oversight group, given that they are released through freedom of information requests I see no reason not to publish them on the Department's website and we will begin to do that.</p> <p>  With regard to Brexit and likely outcomes, it is fair to say at this point that the risk of a no-deal Brexit for 2019 has clearly receded.  Given all the experience I have built up as, I am sure, has the Deputy, of trying to predict what will happen with Brexit and then other things going on to happen, I will only reach a view on what will happen with Brexit once I see a withdrawal agreement pass through the House of Commons, we are completely clear on the content of that withdrawal agreement and we see it ratified.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit with additional money being made available for other priorities, while I know the priorities are great in many parts of society, I do not plan to change the budget in the event of the country avoiding a no-deal Brexit.  When we get into the first half of next year, the stability programme update, which we will do by 31 April, and the economic statement, which we will do in May, June or July, will give us a perspective and opportunity to assess where the economy stands if a no-deal Brexit is avoided.  We have done one budget for 2020 and it is my strong view there should not be another budget until October 2020.</p></speech>

Regarding his final point, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill is before the D&aacute;il this week and the bulk of social welfare recipients, who are often to the pin of the collar trying to survive, did not get increases in what was another austerity budget.  Who can predict what will happen in British politics but if 2020 turns out to be like 2019, is there not a strong case to target more resources at people dependent on pensions and social protection?  Should that be the case, we would be able to afford it so is there not a strong case to have another budget, given that the Minister did not have a budget worth talking about.  It was a non-budget last month.</p> <p>  In the spending review cycle how do Departments decide on what topics will be included in the spending review?  How has it turned out with regard to what was planned when the review on particular areas was taking place?  Have the findings of the review been incorporated into policy in various expenditure areas?</p> <p>  Following up the questions that have been asked about health, we all saw a lengthy interview last Sunday with the CEO of the HSE, in which he seemed to indicate the overspend of &euro;335 million and that we will have a Supplementary Estimate for it.  Has the Minister received his plan?  He spoke about publishing it yesterday or at the weekend.  Does he have his operational plan for 2020?  I know it has a specific technical name.  Some people thought we did not have a plan for 2019.  How do we know what resources the CEO of the HSE and all of his 120,000 staff will need in 2020 when we do not know what they are planning to do with regard to acute hospital beds, waiting lists, the treatment fund, more consultants, more GPs and all of the issues we hear about day in and day out?</p> <p>  With regard to corporation tax, the Minister has been speaking all the time about broadening the tax base but what exactly has he done to do so?  He mentioned the 45% dependence on corporation tax from these large companies that have headquarters not too far away from this building.  How does he see that panning out as time goes on?  With regard to stamp duty and capital taxation in the October fiscal monitor, stamp duty seems to be cumulatively well behind by &euro;100 million.  What is the Minister doing in this territory?</p> <p>  With regard to the topic of the hour, besides Brexit, namely, climate change, are Departments working intensively on the overall packages that will be needed to retrofit all homes in the country?</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has given some figures for different areas relating to decarbonising transport, such as with cycling and using electric vehicles.  Car taxes and excise duties were traditionally a huge bedrock of revenue, but do we have a master plan for the next five years to enable us to make up for the gaps in duties while providing the necessary funding to decarbonise this country seriously from 2030 onwards?</p></speech>

A Department may recommend a topic to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or we may recommend one to it.  The topics tend to be worked on between both Departments.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about health.  I understand that the Department of Health has received the HSE service action plan for next year and is considering it.  There was a HSE service plan for this year.  I was also asked what I had done to broaden the base of corporation tax, and I can point to five measures in this area.  First, I have reversed the lower VAT rate on the hospitality and services sector.  Second, I increased betting duty.  Third, I changed the taxation on commercial property.  Fourth, I have increased carbon tax and, fifth, I have left the entry points for USC and income tax unchanged, as I have done in all my budgets.  The Deputy is correct about the decline in stamp duty up to October.  That has been driven by a decrease in the number of share transactions, upon which stamp duty is paid.  We will have to look at what is driving that and see if the trend continues into November.  The underperformance of stamp duty on share transactions has been the key issue this year.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how we were engaging with different Departments on climate change.  The process is being led by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, with my active support, and all our engagement in this area takes place through the climate action plan.  Yesterday, I visited Lough Ree and was reminded of the many changes we have to make to deal with the huge challenge of climate change.</p></speech>

Work has also been done by industry bodies.  I do not have the figure for the total budget for this at the moment, but we can write to the committee with details.  Some &euro;13 million from the change in carbon pricing is going into the warmer homes scheme run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give the committee an update on the provisions that were made in the budget for a Brexit contingency fund?  Given that there has not yet been a deal, I assume the fund will not be drawn down.  What is the provision for the funding in that case?  Is it returned to the rainy day fund?  What amount is contingent on a no-deal Brexit?  Given that a decision is not likely until the end of January, is that section of the budget on hold pending developments in the UK?</p></speech>

If a no-deal Brexit does not happen, the money will not be used for any other purpose and would transfer into an improved surplus position for next year of 0.5% of our national income.  We would see a swing from an expected deficit next year of 0.6% of national income to a surplus of 0.5%.  We have discussed this kind of surplus and we have responded to issues raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We need to bring the issue of corporation tax receipts more onto our horizon.  Last week, the OECD published its public consultation paper on global minimum effective tax rates, and change is coming in this area.  That change will begin to take shape in 2020, and in order for Ireland to maintain and further build its reputation from the point of view of legitimacy, we need to be inside the OECD framework and we need to get ready for the change by continuing to run budget day surpluses.</p></speech>

Our reputation will be best served by supporting and agreeing to the OECD setting a minimum corporate tax rate and, even if it is higher than the current 12.5% rate, it is our duty as a responsible country.  In Europe, &euro;1 trillion is lost through tax avoidance measures, so we need to support such a move.  Does the Department have any sense of what a potential rate might be if the OECD did this?  Does it have anything to suggest that, as I suspect, adherence to a minimum tax rate would actually increase our corporate tax revenue?  This would mean we should support it not just for reputational reasons but for fiscal gain.</p></speech>

Pillar 1 relates to taxing where value is created and pillar 2 refers to the requirement for a global minimum effective tax rate.  The Deputy referred to our responsibility and Ireland has not received the recognition it has merited for the scale of change we have made to our tax code.  Looking forward, I am clear that to continue to be legitimate in using corporate tax policy to make ourselves competitive, we need to be inside an OECD framework.  I favour pillar 1 as the way we can craft a potential landing zone that manages the different priorities we have.</p><p> Within the OECD we depend on influence and negotiation.  Many big countries within the OECD will be looking to ensure their national interests are protected.  I do not have a rate in mind.  If a rate is created, it is work for the OECD to do.  It is not my place to speculate on what the figure could be, given that I believe the bedding in of that principle could present a challenge for Ireland.  I do not believe we are likely to face a revenue gain as a result of such a change.</p><p> I believe we will see corporation tax receipts increase again this year as I indicated in my statement to the committee.  It is very likely that they will increase again next year.  I believe our corporation tax receipts will plateau and then decline at some point.  That could be for any one of a number of reasons, but I will highlight three.  First, the phase of corporate profitability many large companies are going through could begin to change in the future.  The second is the effect of OECD measures on our share of global tax profits.  The third is that we could see other countries begin to adopt more competitive attitudes towards corporation tax rates.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the greying of the population.  I am one of the people to whom he was referring.  I recognise that he has allocated &euro;500 million to address these demographic changes and the committee is working on examining them.  Will he commit to supporting that work and provide the detailed information that will be requested by us to carry it out?  I have three questions about the pressures mentioned.  What challenges will the demographic changes present to the public finances?  Will any major policy change be required in the immediate term to mitigate any of the risks?  How do those increased allocations made in budget 2020 to meet the cost of demographic changes compare to what the Departments requested?</p> <p>  The second element is equality budgeting.  Why was the equality budget statement not produced in announcing budget 2020?  When will the Minister be in a position to produce an equality budget statement?</p></speech>

For 2020 we have provided a sum of &euro;451 million; for 2021, &euro;455 million; and for 2022, &euro;455 million.  In my statement to the committee I outlined some of the medium-term consequences of demographic changes.  I have made the point that in coming years we will see a really big change in the ratio between the numbers of people at work and not at work.  That will have an impact on the amounts we will raise in tax and the amounts spent.</p> <p>  We have defined demographics in terms of the age profile of citizens.  Particularly as a result of my engagement with the Department of Health, I have become increasingly aware that because, thankfully, people are living for longer, related expenditure is growing.  We will need to be able to respond to conditions such as dementia and others that are likely to be prolonged the longer people live.  We will need to reconsider this issue in the medium term to ensure we will have the correct level of provisioning for it.</p> <p>  On equality budgeting, I have been informed that we did not publish the statement on budget day because we had received quite a significant report on it from the OECD.  It contained ten recommendations that it asked us to take into account in the development of our equality budgets.  We are studying the report.  I will come back to the Deputy with a date by which we expect to be able to publish a response to the report.</p></speech>

At one time there used to be three or four pages in the budget day document, but on this occasion there was no such information as far as anybody could see.</p> <p>  The Minister has said he anticipates that we will receive at least the same amount in corporation tax in 2020.  Obviously, international trade wars, Brexit, etc. could have a major impact on what might happen, but is there any indication as to when the corporation tax yield might plateau?</p></speech>

We have since published the information we had available on the distributional analysis of budget 2020.  It is to be found on the Department's website at <i>budget.gov.ie</i>.  I will outline the figures for the Deputy.</p><p>It is estimated that 29% of households will benefit as a result of the announced direct tax and welfare measures announced.  A total of 71% of households are due to experience no change in the level of their disposable income.  They are the headlines figures.  The key reason is that the changes were very small and focused.  As the Deputy said, the social welfare changes were focused in targeted measures as opposed to changes in broad rates.</p><p>The Deputy asked what I expected to see happen with the corporation tax yield.  I expect to see them grow again next year, as published in our tax forecast for 2020 which was published on budget day.  At this point it is difficult to specify the timing of the change I indicated because one of the key variables is what will happen in the OECD's work which will not conclude until the end of next year at the earliest.  It will only be possible to give an informed answer to the Deputy's question once we are clear on the impact of that work and when the findings will be implemented.  We will not be clear on it until this time next year.</p></speech>

It is overseen by both Secretaries General and that will continue to be available and will be made available in advance of any election.  This is just a practical matter but if big and exciting new proposals are being developed, the quicker they are shared with the two Departments, the quicker the Departments will be able to give the committee an informed cost.  However, I can assure the committee that the Departments will not be sharing those ideas with me.  </p></speech>

In light of the European element and Brexit in general, does the Minister see our contribution to the EU budget increasing significantly in a post-Brexit world?  When we look at things we want to protect like CAP, this has put us in a position where we have made a commitment to consider increasing that contribution.  Has the Minister received feedback on this from other European countries?  When one looks at the scale of the promised spending that seems to be planned in the UK in its preparations for a post-Brexit scenario, is there a case for us to consider the same scale of spending?  I do not necessarily subscribe to this view.  They think it is a good idea in the UK in light of much of the fallout from Brexit.  What impacts on them will impact on us.  What is the Minister's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019111200002#K00600"><p>Regarding the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, we will be contributing more to the budget.  Later on in the D&aacute;il this week, I will outline some of the issues and questions regarding all of this.  The tone among my fellow finance ministers on the topic is very mixed.  Many colleagues are resolutely opposed to any increase while a small number are willing to see some increase and quite a few are looking for a decrease in the contribution they make.  A smaller number is looking for a decrease in the scale of some parts of the EU budget.  The scale of national contribution to the EU budget is a major topic of political debate in a number of other EU countries.  Ireland has only recently become a net contributor, as the Deputy is aware.  Ireland has now become the third highest contributor <i>per capita</i>.  One of the main reasons why we have become a net contributor so quickly is because of the scale of national income growth here in a post-crisis period.  The EU uses gross national income in a modified way to calculate a country's budgetary contribution.  I expect that it will increase in the future.  I will be making the case that an increased contribution from Ireland in terms of maintaining our current percentage contribution but seeing our national income grow in the future is something we should consider doing because the Single Market is of incalculable value to Ireland.  Putting measures in place to support its development across the European Union is very much in our long-term national interest.  The flip side of it is increased budget contributions to the EU.  As that means we cannot spend that money on other things in Ireland, we need to get that balance right.  The next question that tends to be put to me concerns the figure.  It is a negotiation in which we are involved and it is not appropriate to lay out that figure at the moment.  Even if we were to maintain the tab unchanged, it would mean that Ireland will pay more in the future for the simple reason that our national income is growing.</p><p>As for what is happening in other countries, for example, the current debate in the UK, there has been a hint of that in the questions I have received to date from other members of the committee.  There are three things to be aware of as we look at where we are.  The first is the huge scale of capital expenditure growth that has already occurred in Ireland.  In 2016, we were spending &euro;4.2 billion per year in capital expenditure.  For 2020, that equivalent figure will be nearly &euro;8.2 billion.  We have seen a really big increase in capital investment across the past number of years, which I decided was the appropriate response to a post-crisis society and all of the challenges we face in terms of housing, homelessness and investment in carbon change in our economy.  We have implemented the capital expansion that is being debated elsewhere in Ireland and it is under way.  </p><p>The second point is that our level of national debt is still very high when looked at in the right way for Ireland and we need to be aware of the challenges we may face in the future regarding corporation tax receipts.  This is why running surpluses would be so important.  Let us bear in mind that in the pre-crisis period a decade ago, we were running surpluses and we still got into awful difficulty.  This was for many different reasons and lots of those other reasons are not present in our economy but it still shows the need to have surpluses because I believe that as we move into future years, we will face challenges that will be different to those we faced a decade ago.  </p><p>The Deputy will be well aware of the third point, which is that the UK has its own currency and central bank and will be running higher deficits in the future if it makes this decision.  We have our own currency but we share it with hundreds of millions of other people.  We have our own Central Bank but key monetary policy decisions are made by the European Central Bank.  We forget all of that at our peril and we forgot it previously.  </p></speech>

I propose, in my opening statement, to pick up on some of the key themes from our perspective and provide some further clarifications to assist the committee in its work.  Of course, as part of the drafting of the Bill, there will be a thorough and detailed consideration of the committee's report on the general scheme.  </p> <p>  As appropriate for a general scheme dealing with the establishment of a new body, the debate to date has focused on the role and functions of the LDA and its governance.  These are matters that I might briefly address.  Regarding the role and functions of the agency, it is important to recall that the national planning policy statement, which was published in 2015, recognised the importance of creating sustainable communities by ensuring that the right development takes place in the right locations and at the right time.  Following on from this, Project Ireland 2040 through the national planning framework, NPF, and national development plan, NDP, provide for the alignment of spatial and investment policy to ensure future developments are plan-led rather than developer-led.</p> <p>  The LDA is being established in this context and responds to the need for more active land management by the State, which has been articulated in many policy documents over the years, including the 1973 Kenny report and various reports of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  Indeed, in its latest report on this issue, report No.1451, NESC stated that Project Ireland 2040 provided the perfect moment to transition to a new system of urban development and land management.  In this regard, the council strongly supported the concept of a national regeneration and development agency as proposed in the NPF, and now established under secondary legislation as the LDA. </p> <p>  The LDA's immediate focus is on managing the State's own lands to develop new homes and regenerate underutilised sites.  In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land banks from a mix of public and private lands making these available for housing in a controlled manner, bringing essential long-term stability to the housing market.</p> <p>  Allied to this, the LDA will also act as a national centre of expertise, supporting and complementing the ongoing work of local authorities, public bodies and other interests to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment, and to achieve compact, sustainable growth with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.  The general scheme seeks to ensure that the primary legislation provides for both the immediate and longer-term roles of the agency. </p> <p>  State intervention in this manner invariably gives rise to considerations regarding potential state aid.  In developing the legislative approach, we are working both with the Office of the Attorney General and the LDA's legal team to ensure the evolving model is compliant with all aspects of EU law.</p><p>The advices to date have informed our approach to setting out the functions within the general scheme.  In particular, head 9 draws a distinction between a range of non-economic<b></b>functions, the LDA will carry out on behalf of the State in support of the NPF and management of public lands such as the proposed register of public lands and an advisory role to the Minister, and the core economic functions it is intended will be undertaken on a commercial basis without providing an advantage to either the LDA or other parties under State aid rules. <br/><br/>As the legislative process evolves, including having regard to proposals that may emerge from the committee, we will continue to examine the various legal dimensions, including matters of EU law such as state aid and will engage with the European Commission. <br/><br/>The Commission was informed about the LDA at the time of its establishment in August 2018.  The next step will be a structured engagement with the Commission through its informal preliminary procedure.  This will be based on information from the agency on its business model as well as the draft LDA Bill, outlining the nature and role and functions of the agency.  This structured engagement is consistent with the approach taken in respect of other commercial state bodies and reflects the specific nature of the LDA.<br/><br/><b></b>An important function of the agency will be the delivery of affordable housing on public lands, both through activation of the lands transferred from Ministers to the agency and through the services it provides in partnership with local authorities in respect of the activation of local authority lands.<br/><br/>While the nature of the provision on local authority lands is as matter for the respective local authorities, in the case of public lands, the Government has decided that a minimum of 30% affordable housing should be provided in addition to the 10% social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts.  This has been articulated to the LDA and other public bodies, as a matter of policy, but the Minister is open to exploring if this requirement should be placed on a statutory footing.<br/><br/>I turn now to the issues of governance and accountability of the LDA.  Having regard to the proposed roles and functions of the agency, it is important that its legislative framework provides the appropriate balance between the commercial freedom to fulfil these functions and the accountability to the State as the owner of the agency.  A key document in this regard is the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  This code was updated and revised in 2016.  It is designed to ensure that both commercial and non-commercial State bodies meet the highest standards of corporate governance.  The code is based on the underlying principles of good governance: accountability, transparency, probity and a focus on the sustainable success of the organisation over the longer term. <br/><br/>The LDA will have to comply with this code, and this will include the issuance by the relevant Ministers of a shareholder expectations letter, which will outline both policy, corporate governance and financial expectations.  This letter will be developed with the support of NewERA.<br/><br/>In addition, key components of governance and accountability are reflected in the general scheme, based on the most recent legislative approaches for other similar bodies.  Head 6 refers to the development of the constitution of the LDA, such documents are required under the Companies Acts, and were previously known as memorandum and articles of association, which will set out the powers of the agency consistent with its governing statute and the actions that will require ministerial consent.  Head 10 deals with board of the agency, which will be appointed through the <i>stateboards.ie</i>process.  Head 27 deals with borrowing by the agency, with the limit to be set in statute.  Head 29 deals with the financial statement of the agency and provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General will audit the agency.  Head 30 deals with accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Head 31 deals with reporting arrangement.  Finally, head 36 specifically provides for a review of achievement of the agency's purposes by the Minister. <br/><br/>I am aware that, in the context of the governance of the LDA, the discussions have focused on the approach to both freedom of information and lobbying.  The approach currently being adopted aligns with the general norms for commercial bodies as set out in legislation, which is generally a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister is open to proposing alternative approaches to Government where measures are identified that would enhance accountability without compromising on the LDA's capacity to execute its proposed statutory role.  We will, therefore, consider any recommendations of the committee in this regard.</p><p>I thank the Chairman and members for offering us the opportunity to update them on the general scheme of the Bill and I hope I have clarified many of the issues raised in previous sessions.  As always, the Department's team will be happy to clarify any further issues.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague Mr. Phelim O'Neill, head of land at the LDA.</p> <p>  During my previous appearance before the committee, in early October, I provided a progress update on the sites in the LDA's initial portfolio and on the wider progress we have made since inception a little over a year ago.  I also outlined our plans for the remainder of 2019 and 2020.  Our engagement with the committee that day was very constructive and informative.  I thank the committee for that and for the wider support it has shown for the LDA and the concept behind it. </p> <p>  On a more general note, I thank the committee for the extensive and detailed work it has done on pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of this Bill.  The contributions made by members and the many attendees before the committee recent weeks, which have included people with considerable experience of, and insight into, the issues and constraints facing the housing sector, are essential and valuable steps in the process of designing this legislation.  It is clear that the committee's work is making a significant contribution to enabling the LDA to provide effective, tangible and durable measures that will improve housing supply in the short term and bring much-needed stability to the housing market over the long term.  </p> <p>  In a similar vein, I am grateful to local authorities throughout the country for the quality of their engagement with the LDA since it began operating.  The support they have shown, as well as the detailed knowledge and innovation that they have brought to their discussions with us, augurs well for our collective ability to address the problems that we share and that we want to resolve together. </p> <p>  Ultimately, the LDA cannot succeed without the support of its key stakeholders.  I have been greatly encouraged by the strong commitment, collaborative approach and shared desire for solutions that I have seen at first hand among members of this committee, local authorities and our other stakeholders.</p> <p>  I will use my opening statement today to give the agency's perspective on some of the issues that the committee's work has identified in recent weeks.  In particular, I would like to talk about the need for the agency to be established as a commercial body; the importance of enacting the legislation so that the agency can make the financial commitments it needs to make; our commitment to accountability, governance and transparency; and the delivery of affordable housing on State lands. </p> <p>  On the need for the LDA to be established as a commercial body, there have been some suggestions in recent weeks that it should not be established as such, or that if it were, it would in some way act in a manner that was not in the interest of addressing our housing issues.  I reassure the committee that there is no conflict at all between being established as a commercial body and the provision of much-needed housing.  My strong view is that operating as a commercial body offers the best way to ensure the sustainability of the LDA's resources and the sustainability of the agency through economic cycles.</p> <p>  I can assure the committee that the agency and its board, including me as CEO, are clear that our primary objective is to ensure that homes, including affordable homes, get built and delivered to people and families on the land we gain access to.  Many State bodies have a commercial mandate while, at the same time, being committed to achieving important social and economic objectives, which include providing electricity, public transport, operating ports, health insurance and many other essential services.  The LDA is no different, and while it will be commercial, pending the outcome of the legislative process, its mandate is clear.  The mandate is to accelerate the provision of homes and supporting development on State and other lands.  </p> <p>  We see ourselves as custodians and stewards of the &euro;1.25 billion in taxpayers' money that the Government has earmarked for the agency.  Our job is to use that money in a way that strikes the right balance in achieving all our objectives &ndash; improving housing supply, delivering long-term stability in the housing market, using State lands more effectively and freeing it up to deliver new homes wherever that is appropriate.  We must do this in a way that preserves the sustainability and long-term impact of the agency.  My fear is that if we do not get the balance right, we will be at risk of using valuable State resources inefficiently or unsustainably, and hence running out of these resources early.</p> <p>  Acting as a commercial operator will also help us to deliver housing in the good times, when Exchequer funding is available to support this activity, and future-proof the agency so that it can be just as effective in bad times, when the Exchequer does not have access to resources to invest.  Establishing the LDA as a commercial body will enable it to raise finance and invest in housing provision in times when the Exchequer is simply not in a position to do this.</p><p>This will mean that the agency will be able to act countercyclically, which will achieve important wider economic benefits in stabilising housing supply and achieve best value for money by enabling it to procure land and buildings when the housing market is weaker.</p><p> When we talk about the desirability of the LDA being a commercial body, it is not because we are seeking to make profit for the sake of profit; it is about ensuring the agency can be an all-weather contributor to the State and housing market, irrespective of how the wider economy is performing.  By way of example, if we consider the extreme financial pressures on the State ten years ago, as we were on the verge of a troika bailout, it is not realistic to believe that had the LDA been in place at the time, it could have sought money from the Exchequer to buy land or perform any of its other activities.  If we are to be successful as a countercyclical operator that can take advantage of long-term opportunities for the taxpayer, we have to create the conditions that will allow us to achieve this.  Establishing the LDA as a commercial body is the best way to do this. </p><p> Let us consider the importance of enacting the legislation so that the LDA can make the financial commitments it needs to make.  There has been some public discussion on its ability to operate in the absence of the legislation.  While we are operating effectively on the basis of a statutory instrument signed by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, last year and this has been sufficient for what I would term the "start-up phase" of the LDA's operations, I am conscious that we are approaching the end of this phase.  As I told the committee last month, we have made significant progress on the sites in the agency's initial portfolio, which have the capacity to deliver approximately 3,000 homes, and we are working well with local authorities in respect of these and other potential sites, including at Shanganagh in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area.  We have been able to achieve this progress on our existing statutory basis.  However, the more progress we make, the closer we come to a stage where we will need the provisions of the proposed legislation to continue to deliver on these sites as expeditiously as possible.  In particular, we are approaching a point where we will have to make significant financial commitments in the middle of 2020, as our work evolves from valuable preparatory work to the nuts and bolts of active construction on the sites.  This creates a natural time constraint for the enactment of the proposed legislation.  While we do not envisage any delays in progressing our projects based on the current timelines, the existence of this constraint highlights the value of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny process and the importance of getting this legislation right within a defined timeframe.  I assure the committee that we will continue with our existing approach of working closely and collaboratively with it to ensure its concerns are addressed to its satisfaction and to facilitate the efficient and timely passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas.</p><p> I assure committee members and other stakeholders that we share their desire to create an organisation that is the best in its class in terms of its accountability, governance and transparency.  As CEO of a State agency, I am aware of the importance for the LDA not only of doing our job to the best of our ability but also of being able to demonstrate to citizens and public representatives that we are doing our job to the best of our ability, and, indeed, to the highest standards, which people have every right to demand and expect from agencies such as the LDA.  I regard exposure to public scrutiny as an essential part of our mandate and something that my colleagues and I should, and do, welcome.  We want significant levels of oversight and accountability built into our operations, and the proposed legislation and governance frameworks for State bodies set out measures to achieve this. </p><p> Under the proposed legislation, the LDA is accountable to our ministerial shareholders and the Committee of Public Accounts, and it will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, it will appoint an external statutory auditor under the Companies Acts and an internal auditor.  Since the inception of the agency last September, we have set out to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance.  The agency's nine-person board comprises experienced professionals with a diverse mix of both public and private sector expertise.  The board was established in January 2019 and provides ongoing strategic direction and oversight in regard to the agency's activities.  We have established an audit-and-risk committee with responsibility for overseeing the assessment and management of the strategic risks facing the LDA that could result in financial, reputational or other loss to it.  We have also provided for an investment committee, which will have responsibility for assisting the board in the control and management of the agency's investment activities.  The agency will adhere to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, as required and as mentioned by Ms Graham.  In summary, the LDA will be accountable to its ministerial shareholders and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will have three separate auditors.  It has an experienced independent board with audit-and-risk and investment committees.  It will publish a comprehensive annual report and will be subject to the code of practice.  I assure the committee that the LDA has been committed to continuing to place accountability, corporate governance and transparency at its core.</p><p> I draw the committee's attention to our commitment to delivering affordable homes on State lands.  This has been, and will continue to be, one of our top priorities.</p><p> The affordability requirement on State lands is a separate policy matter set by the Government.  The requirement sits outside the LDA and applies to any party accessing State lands, be it the LDA or anyone else.  The LDA will implement the requirement as a party that will seek to access State lands on an ongoing basis.  While it is ultimately a policy matter for the Government, in my view the policy strikes a balance in providing significant amounts of social and affordable housing while leaving open the option to lever the initial funding of &euro;1.25 billion provided for the LDA.  This is particularly important when one considers the context that if no third party funding was added to the LDA's mix, the &euro;1.25 billion would be used in its entirety by our initial site portfolio when our ambitions go much further than that.  To frame it another way, the 150,000 homes which have been targeted for the LDA to facilitate their delivery in a 20-year period would have a total delivery cost of well in excess of &euro;45 billion, which I do not believe it is feasible to be funded entirely by the State.  Furthermore, it provides for flexibility in particular areas which may need a diversity of housing tenures, including social, affordable and private.</p><p> As I said to the committee last month, we see the figure of 40% for the number of social and affordable homes to be provided as a minimum, not a maximum.  We anticipate that we will be able to deliver social and affordable homes to a figure of 100% on individual sites where the circumstances are right.  I am conscious that the provision of social and affordable housing is a major focus for the committee and that it is entirely understandable that many stakeholders want to highlight the importance of not missing any opportunity to deliver in this space.  What I say to these stakeholders is that we share that sense of urgency and commitment to delivering on the requirement to provide all types of home, including social and affordable.  We are confident that this can be achieved through a range of delivery options, including developments where 100% of the homes provided are social and affordable and developments in which there is a mix of private homes alongside social and affordable homes.  </p><p> In my opening remarks I hope I have provided greater clarity on some of the issues raised in recent weeks.  I am happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

The reoccurring themes in our deliberations have been good governance, accountability, transparency, probity and a focus on sustainable management and structure.  That is really important because it is one of the biggest things about which the public is talking.  It is one of the issues that arises concerning the LDA when one sees media commentary and letters to various newspaper editors.  I do not suggest it is correct, but some people make an analogy between it and NAMA or say they are similar.  That is not the case, but the reality is that many see it that way.  People will have a greater understanding as the pre-legislative scrutiny ends, the report is made and the Bill published.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on a few issues.  I acknowledge that we have had two really important papers which provide great clarity.  In particular, I like the tenor of Mr. Coleman's document.  I get a sense from it that there is greater partnership and understanding with local authorities, a group with which I work especially closely.  An issue arises about the figures of 30% for affordable housing and 10% for social housing.  We all know what the mandate will be for the LDA.</p> <p>  Ms Graham referred to the allocation of &euro;2.3 billion for housing.  She stated: "While the nature of the provision on local authority lands is a matter for the respective local authorities, in the case of public lands Government has decided that a minimum of 30% affordable housing should be provided ... [and] 10% social housing requirement under Part V".  We are familiar with this.  I am encouraged by the following line that reads: "This has been articulated to the LDA and other public bodies as a matter of policy, but the Minister is opening to exploring if this requirement should be placed on a statutory footing."  Will Ms Graham, please, refer to this when she responds to me because I think people would like it to happen?  I personally would like it to happen.  I do not wish to be too restrictive, but there is an issue.  We are in a housing crisis.  We know the reason the LDA has been set up, especially in accessing lands, about which I would like to hear more.  I have been talking to other parties as part of my work on the Bill prior to it being brought to the Seanad.  It is an area on which I am focusing and one on which a number of my colleagues want to focus.  Therefore, I am flagging it here.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to two or three other points.  On page 3 of his statement Mr. Coleman refers to timelines and says we are approaching the end of the first phase.  He also says, "In particular, we are approaching a point where we will have to make significant financial commitments."</p><p>That is clearly telling us that there are timelines.  As he is flagging concerns, perhaps he might tease them out with me and the committee.</p><p> Mr. Coleman is familiar with the lead agencies, as well as the development agency, particularly in the context of a strategic development zone such as that in Cherrywood.  I might be wrong about this, but I read correspondence from IDA Ireland in which it flagged a concern.  Does Mr. Coleman consider the LDA should be given power in this legislation to be a developer and take the lead in a strategic development zone?  I would like to hear his views on that matter.  I think it should, as I am familiar with the strategic development zone in Cherrywood.  The issue is very clear.  We should remember that at this point the planning application has gone through and that we have a master plan for a strategic development zone.  Very little deviation is possible once a strategic development zone is approved and ultimately sanctioned by the Government.  I am especially interested in hearing Mr. Coleman's views on that matter.</p><p> I seek clarity in situations where the LDA acquires land and on how it will pay another State agency for the land acquired from it.  This was an issue of concern in the context of EU competition rules.  What is Mr. Coleman's view on that issue which has been flagged for me by elected members in many local authorities?</p><p> The disposal of land under section 183 is a reserved statutory function of the elected members of a council, not the executive.  How will the LDA overcome this issue?  Does Mr. Coleman think it should be addressed in the legislation?  Should there be special exemptions in the disposal of State or local authority lands, particularly where it can be demonstrated that they are required for the roll-out of the critical mandate of the LDA in the delivery of housing in most cases, although I am aware that it also has a commercial remit?  I refer to situations where there is a strong case to be made for bringing local authority lands into play.  We know that there are local authority lands sitting idle throughout the country that are not being developed.  In many cases, they have been zoned for residential purposes.  Does Mr. Coleman believe we should look again at how we can fast-track the release of local authority lands to the LDA, specifically for housing development, and how will local authorities be compensated for the land which, in many cases, they bought with resources from their own reserves?  I am particularly keen to hear what he has to say because it will perhaps be one of the most difficult issues in accessing State and local authority lands.  I expect Mr. Coleman to speak about partnership, but the reality is that there are commercial issues involved concerning offers and acceptance, about which I would like to hear more.</p></speech>

I will start with the first point he made concerning what I might most appropriately talk about, namely, the financial commitments made and the need for legislation in advance.  The funding source of the LDA is to be a transfer of funds from the ISIF which will be taken by the Minister for Finance and then invested in the LDA.  The NTMA Act requires an amendment to facilitate this which will follow on the back of this Bill.  That is the turning point for the LDA in accessing finance.  On how it will co-ordinate with our on-the-ground activity, as the sites to which we have access and of which we have control come on stream with the granting of planning permission, we are constantly looking to take time out of the process for an obvious reason, namely, to have homes provided.  One of the things at which we have started to look is direct delivery, similar to what is anticipated in Shanganagh, whereby we will have to procure a contractor.</p><p>To do that, we cannot enter contractual arrangements with a contractor until we have visibility on our funding to honour the financial commitments that will arise.  That is where my point was focused.  As the projects come on stream, they will need money or funding sources triggered by the Bill being enacted.<br/><br/>On how the LDA acquires land and how it is paid for, the way I think about it is that there are, broadly, three ways we can gain access to land, namely, through centrally controlled Government bodies, commercial semi-State bodies and local authorities.  I distinguish between the three categories because they have individual governance requirements and infrastructure.  Naturally, the Government controls centrally controlled Government bodies.  For the local authorities, as was outlined, it is a reserved matter as to what is done in the sale or transfer of land in section 183 decisions.  Commercial semi-State bodies are independent bodies with independent boards that have to make decisions as opposed to being centrally controlled, for plenty of good reasons.<br/><br/>We might acquire land from local authorities through negotiation with the local authority, subject to the approval of its elected members.  How the land will transfer will depend on the commercial arrangements.  As for the payment for the land, typically, local authorities are not necessarily as interested in making money from the land, given that they will often have their own financial constraints.  Rather, the provision of affordable housing tends to be their primary concern.  It is perhaps less of a material issue for local authorities.<br/><br/>We have to deal with commercial semi-State bodies as if we were dealing with any private market player.  A commercial semi-State body, which has a company to run, services to finance and obligations as board members, will typically seek the best deal and, therefore, it will be as if we were dealing with any other party.<br/><br/>In the case of centrally controlled Government bodies, the thinking is that the lands will transfer from the relevant Ministers as an equity investment, or an <i>in specie</i>consideration for shares, in the LDA in order that the agency would not necessarily have to transfer money out.  That makes sense given that, otherwise, our funding would just be distributed to various State bodies from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which was not the intention.  The intention was for the money to be used to fund the agency's activities.  The consequence of that would be that land from centrally controlled Government bodies would sit on the agency's balance sheet at the correct market value.  That would ensure we would have to preserve, maintain and deal with the asset in the most efficient and financially sustainable way, which would take account of the affordability requirement, namely, a valuation of 30%.</p></speech>

As he noted, local authorities own their land and dictate how it is used.  Similarly, Ministers own their land and the Government can dictate the practice it wants associated with its disposal, which is what has been done to date.  The Government has been firm about the additional dividend of affordable housing on the disposal of land.  The Minister has written twice to colleagues to ensure that the matter has been highlighted.  It would be a step forward, to which the Minister is open, to put it on a statutory footing.  A number of elements must be considered when putting something onto a statutory footing, which is slightly different from just articulating policy.  For example, when drafting legislation and the evidence base for it, it must be decided whether a number will be hardwired in the legislation or whether it will be a provision prescribed by a Minister.  Such elements ensure that legislation will be future-proofed.</p><p>An important consideration at the backdrop is the new housing needs demand assessments that local authorities will carry out, following on from the national planning framework.  They will examine the nature of the demand and the various types of housing required, and including that in development plans.  It will give a good evidence base for the future that will build on the overall quantum of affordable housing.</p><p> It is in the context of examining two elements.  The approaches are whether there should be a requirement for the disposal of public land or whether there should also be a requirement for the LDA, across its portfolio, to achieve a certain percentage of housing.  The options would have to be examined.</p></speech>

I am conscious that it would be a variation on this legislative vehicle if it is to be used for it.  I acknowledge that the committee, on the previous occasion, discussed matters that would arise on Committee Stage, but I am sure that if that is to be the case, the committee will examine it then.  We will probably examine it during the drafting of the Bill.<br/><br/>The Senator also referred to strategic development zones, SDZs.  I might deal with the matter from a general perspective and Mr. Coleman might like to comment on some of the practical aspects.  We have learned quite a bit from the operation of some of the SDZs and how delivery can be affected by changes in the development cycle.  In the longer term, one of the purposes of the LDA is site assembly, which allows us to be more robust and the State to be ready before the market can respond.  We had hoped activity would be faster for a number of SDZs but it was a matter of market conditions.<br/><br/>The other element is infrastructure provision.  Quite often, SDZs were put in place but there may not have been sufficient infrastructure provision, or the cost of infrastructure provision hampered them somewhat.  The urban regeneration and development fund, which will account for &euro;2 billion over the period of the national development plan, will provide a useful vehicle for supporting such activity in the future.  Under the first call, both Cherrywood and Waterford SDZs received some funding, which was to bridge the gap.  From a policy perspective in any event, we seek to learn from experience and ensure that the SDZs work more efficiently.<br/><br/>While one role of the LDA is activating, assembling and working on transferred land, there are also the services it may assign local authorities for master planning and other aspects.  Mr. Coleman might like to comment on that aspect and how it might work in an SDZ context.He covered the elements of how land is acquired, which addresses the underlying way we approach the transfer of land as an <i>in specie</i>investment, to address the point the Senator raised about ensuring that the LDA will act as an economic operator and that there will not be an issue from a competition perspective.<br/><br/>We probably dealt with the issue of elected members disposing of land.  It is their land.</p></speech>

The bit of this project which I like, the active land management, will be far weaker than we need.  The part with which I was always uncomfortable, that is, the residential development, is probably worse than I thought it was going to be.  I will keep an open mind as we go through the legislative process but I want to be upfront about that.  A broad range of people raised significant concerns, most of which have not been addressed in any detail by either the Department or the Land Development Agency today.</p> <p>  Mr. Coleman says the Land Development Agency has been set up as a commercial entity to allow it to operate countercyclically.  The opposite is the case.  The point of countercyclical interventions is that at a time when the market dries up, in a recession when there is an investment strike by private investors, then State bodies which are reliant on borrowing or rainy day funds directly intervene as non-market operators counter to the cycles of the market.  In my estimation, a disadvantage of setting the LDA up as a designated activity company is that it will be cyclical.  After the first tranche of investment by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, the LDA will be dependent on accessing market finance and investment and market operators.  It will fall foul of recessions and slumps when they come.</p> <p>  This will also dramatically undermine the ability of the State to deliver the volume of social and affordable housing that is needed.  To keep it off balance sheet, one has to have a majority of units, whether it is 60% or not, as open market price commercial units.  We are using public land and a majority of the units will not be for social and affordable housing.  At a core level, my view is, and everything I have heard to date suggests, that it will not do the things I genuinely believe Mr. Coleman wants it to do.  I am not in any questioning his desire to do what he is saying.  I just do not see how it will work.  There are two contradictory things in what he keeps tells the committee.  On one hand, 40% is a minimum and he hopes to increase it.  On the other hand, as Mr. Coleman rightly points out at the end of his presentation, the more one increases the percentage of social and affordable housing, the less one has open market sale houses, and the more liability will be on the State.  I will question Mr. Coleman's &euro;45 billion figure in a second.  In some senses, he is telling us something that we want to hear, which is that there will be more social and affordable housing.  At the same time, he is telling us why that will not really be possible outside of a small number of peripheral projects at the outset.</p> <p>  The figure of &euro;45 billion is not correct.  That is for all units but the State is not in the business of building units to sell at open market prices.  It funds social and affordable housing.  If 40% is the rough benchmark, the Land Development Agency will only deliver 60,000 social and affordable homes over the lifetime of the Land Development Agency.  On the basis of Mr. Coleman's calculations, that is a capital investment of &euro;18 billion, or &euro;900 million a year, which is eminently possible for the State.  I know it is rough stuff, but the LDA is pricing its units at &euro;300,000.  The State currently delivers good quality two and three-bedroom homes at an average price of &euro;216,000.  Mr. Coleman is coming to the committee and giving us figures which are back-of-the-envelope calculations.  I know it is hard to predict cost over 20 years but it would be better not to give us figures that just are not accurate than to give them.</p> <p>  If I was asked by a councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown for my advice with regard to section 183, I would say that the first question is to ask what would be the added value of the LDA becoming involved.  The purpose of the LDA is to try to access land that cannot currently be used for housing, including land held by the HSE, transport companies or whatever.  If lands are held by the Housing Agency and local authorities, they and the Department can develop it now, as they are on Enniskerry Road and elsewhere.  Involving another layer of bureaucracy makes this much more complicated.  What added value can the LDA bring to Shanganagh that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, with its very competent staff and with advice from the Housing Agency and Department, cannot deliver today?  I do not get the value of involving the LDA in residential projects that should be progressing already and in a sense are only being delayed because the land cannot be transferred until the LDA is set up on a statutory footing.</p><p> I welcome Ms Graham's comment to the effect that there will be a structured engagement.  That is important because, as we know from NAMA, these are tricky and complex areas of EU law.  Will she indicate when that will happen?  Why did some level of engagement not happen in the context of the general scheme?  On an issue as tricky as this, I would have thought that the earlier the engagement started, the better it would have been.  Ms Graham talked about the general scheme separating economic and non-economic areas of activity, which is true.  From my limited understanding of state aid law, that is not the distinction that matters.  The distinction that matters is between services of economic interest, which are fully commercial, and services of general economic interest, which are more public services.  In order to not fall foul of or to get exemptions under state aid rules, those two activities have to be kept separate, yet here we are, creating an entity that will mix services of economic interest and those of general economic interest, such as commercial, open-market-price homes and social and affordable homes that are in some way subsidised by the State.  Are our guests concerned about that mix?  Has there been a discussion in the Department about how to separate those two or whether there is a need to separate those two elements?  From my limited knowledge of these issues, if one does not find a way of successfully separating those, one could fall foul of state aid rules and therefore not be able to achieve the off balance sheet status that is sought.</p><p> My biggest concern with the legislation is the limited compulsory purchase order powers that it seems will be introduced at some point, whether when we get the Bill or later.  NAMA was given very limited compulsory purchase order powers for small strips of land which are often called ransom strips, to gain access to other developments.  Those would clearly be helpful to have.  I would have thought that if the LDA sits down with the HSE, Dublin Bus or a port authority to negotiate a transfer, while it does not have the ability to threaten to issue a compulsory purchase order for a large parcel of land, it will not get very far in those negotiations or it will have a very weak hand with regard to the eventual outcome.  Will our guests provide more information on the kind of compulsory purchase orders that they hope to see catered for in the Bill?  Can they give any reassurance that there will be broader powers than those that NAMA has, which would clearly not be sufficient for active land management?  I agree with Mr. Coleman that we desperately need active land management in the State.</p><p> The price at which the LDA acquires the land from public agencies is an issue.  Land can have one of three values.  It can have the original book value for which the public authority bought it, it could have the existing use value for whatever purpose the land is currently zoned or planned for and if the land is not currently zoned or planned for commercial residential development, it could have a full market value.  The ability of the LDA to do its job well means that, inasmuch as possible, it has to try to acquire land at the first or second of those values if possible.  To comply with state aid rules and to ensure that the LDA, as a commercial operator, does not have an economic advantage over other commercial operators, it will have to buy the land at full market price.  If the LDA, as a statutory agency, buys Donnybrook Garage, for example, at anything less than full market price, many developers will queue up and ask why it is getting the land for an amount below the market price they would have paid.  If the LDA has to pay the full market price, it has to ask if that is what it is trying to do.  Does that not go back to inflating land values or limit the LDA's ability to deliver genuinely affordable units because it has to factor in the full market land value to the prices of homes to buy or to rent on the affordable side?</p><p> To return to the matter of social and affordable housing, the Economic and Social Research Institute and National Economic and Social Council are reputable bodies that are not radical hotbeds of socialist thinking or critics of the Government.  They are mainstream bodies funded by the State to provide expert advice to the witnesses.  It was clear from what they were saying that the quantum of social and affordable housing being proposed here is nowhere close to enough.  Both indicated, on the basis of substantial bodies of evidence, that it has to be much more than that.  I am not reassured by the language being used that 40% is a minimum.</p><p>What we really need to see is what the full scope of this will deliver for the needs that are there.</p><p> In terms of the land from the Housing Agency, will Mr. Coleman confirm whether this will be transferred before the LDA becomes a statutory body or after?  If it is transferred after, will the Housing Agency still have the ability to insist on covenants of use, as it currently does, for the lands it transfers to other bodies?  Does the ability of the Housing Agency to constrain what happens with that land change if the LDA is a full statutory body?</p><p> I know it is not Mr. Coleman&rsquo;s responsibility but a Government policy area.  However, we keep on talking about affordable housing to buy or rent.  The only examples of this under way are developments in Enniskerry Road and O'Devaney Gardens.  In the main, they are not affordable for households earning between &euro;35,000 and &euro;75,000.  If we want to deliver homes to rent for between &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,600 a month, or homes to buy at &euro;320,000, that may not be affordable for the cohort locked out of the private market.  My main concern is that, ultimately, the market will set the price for so much of it.  This means that we will end up with many developments like O'Devaney Gardens rather than Poppintree in Ballymun.  Is there anything that Mr. Coleman can tell the committee that will convince us otherwise?  Will we all be here several years from now complaining that, while the LDA built homes, they are not accessible for those households above the thresholds for social housing and below &euro;50,000 for single households or &euro;75,000 for couples?  That is who that housing must be accessible for.</p></speech>

One way to think about is if one thinks about the extreme situation back in 2009 and 2010 when there was no money for anything and everything was being cut.  If the LDA had been set up then, dependent on the Exchequer, would money have been there for the LDA to buy land and develop housing?  My view is that it would not have been.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that we would be dependent on market funding outside the &euro;1.25 billion.  That is a significant amount of money which could come into play.  If that was capitalised with that equity capital at a point in time when we enter a downturn - we are now nearer the next downturn than we were at the last one - I expect the LDA would be quite well positioned if it were not dependent on Exchequer funding and had its &euro;1.25 billion to acquire land and so forth.  That could be countercyclical if it was done during a downturn.</p> <p>  On the accuracy around the &euro;45 billion remark, the Deputy is correct.  That was applying a rule of thumb of around &euro;300,000 delivery costs per home.  This takes into account that we will be focused significantly in line with the national planning framework on compact development which implies more expensive typologies to deliver such as apartments.  These are coming in a bit more than the &euro;216,000 referred by the Deputy.</p> <p>  On the &euro;18 billion versus the &euro;45 billion, the point I was making was the affordability requirement at 40% and the ability to invoke private housing at 60%.  This probably increases the amount of market participation that could happen and money from the market as opposed to perhaps money from the State that would have to go towards funding the &euro;18 billion.</p><p>A 100% social and affordable housing requirement would become a &euro;45 billion burden on the State in that situation.  That is the point I was making around the balance that is achieved with the current affordability level.<br/><br/>On compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers, we are <i>ad idem</i>in respect of the powers we hope to obtain in this regard.  That is a work in progress with the Attorney General in terms of working through some of the technical issues around those.  The Deputy mentioned that if one does not have extensive broad-reaching powers, they are not worth the paper on which they are written.  The Deputy may not have said it that starkly but the point is that we need strong powers.  If one looks at examples further afield, for example, in the Netherlands, the existence of CPO powers as a negotiating and bargaining chip, rather than having to use them, is often the most significant impact of them in those situations.  I am just drawing the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to that point.  I am in agreement with him on our need for CPO powers, as is the LDA board.<br/><br/>On the point the Deputy made about land values coming across from, say, commercial semi-State bodies, if there was an affordability requirement through Government policy or, for instance, shareholder expectation letters that may be sent through to commercial semi-State bodies, the land values should take account of the affordability requirement which would have the effect of lessening or reducing the land values where there is affordable housing delivered on those sites.</p></speech>

Part V of the Planning and Development Act allows the State to acquire units and the land value calculation on those is existing land use value, not the full market value.  My main concern is that even if the LDA gets the CPO powers, in order to be fully compliant with state aid rules, in particular the requirement where the State does not give one an economic advantage over others, it will have to acquire the land at full market value if some of that land is going to be used for the sale of houses sold at open market prices.  The reason the State gets away with it through Part V is because it is using it for non-market social housing.  My concern is that even if the LDA gets the powers, which I would like it to have in terms of the CPO, it will still be locked into the requirement to pay full market value for it.  The State then will have to find some other way to subsidise the affordability, not necessarily in a way that is good for the taxpayer or the home purchaser</p></speech>

If the HSE sold a site, according to Government policy at the moment, there would be an affordability requirement on that site, even if it sold it to a private market player.  That would apply to the LDA as well.  That has an impact on the value of the private market player would pay.  Similarly, it would impact on the value the LDA would pay.  It is a level playing field for any market player which will, hopefully, help avoid those issues the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

The site has been undeveloped for quite some time.  We helped the council's departments to work on co-ordination and project management.  That went well.</p> <p>  Another issue is the funding structure for affordable housing on the site that we invoked.  Our mandate is to deliver affordable housing on sites to which we gain access, be they from local authorities or elsewhere.  To deliver affordable housing, we will need a funding structure, which we have been developing.  The application of that structure to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where more than half of the homes that are anticipated for development are to be affordable, including affordable rental or cost rental, is a major added value that could not be achieved elsewhere.</p></speech>

I welcome and understand Deputy &Oacute; Broin's support of the concept of and need for active land management.  The countercyclical piece was touched on.  I might add to Mr. Coleman's explanation and say that many of our commercial companies had sufficient credit ratings to borrow in 2009 when the State was not able to.  Unfortunately, we know the impact of those hard times.  The companies were able to continue their investment programmes when the State did not have that capacity.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about engagement with the European Commission.  In drafting the legislation, there was an iterative process of developing the operational model through the prism of different elements of EU law, including those that the Deputy touched on - the transfer of land and the structuring of various functions.  We need to be ready to show the Commission a formed idea of the CPO powers.  We want them to be as strong as possible while also compliant.  That is the balancing act that is required.  The draft Bill will take account of all of the discussions.  Some technical reports, including benchmarking, and the business plan also need to be done.  We are nearly there, but we would not find it fruitful to approach the Commission so early in the iterative process that we needed to come back because, for example, we were now thinking of putting the affordable housing component on a statutory footing.</p><p> The Deputy touched on the two different components.  That is why we have structured the Bill in this way.  He correctly pointed to the economic and non-economic functions.  We believe that we can do both within the organisation.  We are developing an organisation that will have certain capabilities to perform its core function, that is, active land management.  We should spin off that centre of excellence to give support, as required, to local authorities and other agencies.  It is a matter for us to define this clearly within the draft legislation so that the terms of the two elements are quite clear.  One is not in state aid territory and the other has to demonstrate that it is compliant.</p><p> This relates to the discussion on affordable housing.  It is a complementary and new add-on to the suite of affordable housing activities.  It is not substituting for local authorities, but will instead be available to local authorities if they wish to use the centre of excellence to support them in their role.  It will not supplant the affordable housing activity that they should engage in as housing authorities.  The quantum of affordable housing coming through other streams should be enhanced by this.  Local authorities do not have to use the LDA.  It is a question of choice.  If the State develops an agency with those kinds of capability, it is important that it be used as a shared service to deliver benefits.  From the LDA's perspective, this fits into the overall affordable housing policy, which is a matter for the Department.</p></speech>

I remain to be convinced that an exemption is necessary.  We received correspondence from the Information Commissioner in this regard.  He stated that the exemptions contained in the FOI Act were sufficiently robust to ensure the protection of records whose release would be likely to give rise to any of the harms against which the exemption seeks to protect.  Mr. Coleman mentioned how many State bodies had a commercial mandate while being committed to achieving important social and economic objectives, including the provision of electricity, public transport, etc.  Public transport bodies are under the auspices of the FOI Act, though.  I can submit an FOI request to Dublin Bus, the National Transport Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I am curious about the logic.  I will ask both witnesses why head 39, which provides for an exemption, exists in the Bill.  Is it not the case under the FOI Act that commercially sensitive information can be redacted while still being subject to FOI?  Is it not also the case that the Information Commissioner could adjudicate on such matters?  Are robust and significant protections not built into the Act?  I invite Mr. Coleman to answer first, then Ms Graham.</p></speech>

My understanding is that commercial bodies that were recently set up have received similar exemptions.  This question is probably best dealt with by Ms Graham from the Government's point of view, but-----</p></speech>

I do not need to name the bodies - people know what I am talking about.  Any blanket exemption poses significant concerns.</p><p>I am curious as to the logic behind empowering the LDA with them again.  Surely the exemptions in the Act with regard to commercial sensitivity are significant enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Coleman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111200002#W00200"><p>The exemptions in the Act are helpful in terms of commercial sensitivity.  When I consider the impact on the LDA of freedom of information issues, it is purely to protect the LDA and the taxpayer resources going into it, for instance, regarding information on how we analyse sites or sites we are interested in acquiring in future.  It is about commercial sensitivity and commercial operations.  Deputy O'Broin made a good point on the general exemptions that exist under the Freedom of Information Act and this just follows recent precedents and precedents from elsewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111200002#W00300"><p>The genesis for the provision in the general scheme follows closely on what was done in the most recent body established, which was Home Building Finance Ireland.  The concept is that the information will be excluded by nature of the commercial provisions anyway and there is a considerable element of administration and consultation with people.  It was for operational reasons.</p> <p>  As I indicated my opening statement, the Minister is open to examining the issues that might be raised by the committee with regard to freedom of information and lobbying to see whether we can strike a balance to increase the accountability people want without being unnecessarily burdensome to the LDA or infringing on its commercial freedom.  If measures come forward that can achieve this balance, we are perfectly willing to take them.  We were following the most recent legislative vehicle in the housing domain, which was with regard to lending to developers and protecting that commercial role.  We will consider whatever comes from the committee in this regard.</p></speech>

I do not want to go back to the countercyclical issue because it is important to acknowledge that the difficulties the State had after 2008 were not because of a lack of borrowing capacity or a lack of Exchequer revenue; they were because of decisions taken to use the borrowing capacity and Exchequer revenue to hand to do something else.  For example, we had the National Pensions Reserve Fund with &euro;30 billion.  That money was available for a range of measures but the Government made policy decisions to use the money to recapitalise banks.</p><p>Likewise, with regard to the borrowing capacity of the State, in 2008 our debt-to-GDP ratio was 42%, which was well below the Stability and Growth Pact rules.  The State had a capacity to borrow and, in fact, it took on the liabilities of Anglo Irish Bank with the promissory notes.  The only reason I say this is not to rehearse the history of it but to state that at that point in time, economic difficulties notwithstanding, the State had significant borrowing and spending capacity but chose to use it for something else.  It is not the case that because we are in a recession, we cannot borrow or pump prime the economy.  We just chose to pump prime and borrow for the banks rather than for housing.</p><p>I ask witnesses to look at what is happening with the approved housing body sector in the UK.  It has taken on an increasingly commercial <i>modus operandi</i>, whereby it is engaged in building open market price houses and using the sale of those houses to cross-subsidise mid-market affordable houses as well as social houses.  I attended a major conference in London recently where these bodies said clearly that they are nervous about the dip into recession and how it will constrain their ability to generate revenue to invest countercyclically.  In fact, the one model that is not unlike that of the witnesses, albeit without the land element, is telling us very clearly there is a danger to this model and I do not hear this being recognised.</p><p>To go back to the added value, if I get it right, good local authorities can co-ordinate among themselves and it is about the &quot;financing structure&quot;, to use Mr. Coleman's words.</p><p>This really refers to the LDA's ability to find affordable rental and purchase properties off-balance sheet.  The nub of the matter is that is what it brings to the table; therefore, rather than a local authority or an approved housing body having to borrow, as happened in the case of the project on Enniskerry Road, off-balance sheet development is the key.  That is my interpretation of what Mr. Coleman said.</p><p> My point about the economic and non-economic bits of the Bill is that they are not with what state aid rules are concerned; rather, they are concerned with two types of economic activity.  They are economic activities which are commercial and general economic activities which are non-commercial.  Market price housing is in the first category, while social and affordable housing is in the second.  Is there a concern that mixing the two and having one agency overseeing the development, delivery and sale or allocation of the housing will fall foul of state aid rules?  Is this something at which the LDA is actively looking?  In my limited knowledge of these matters, this will be one of the big hurdles the agency will faces when it comes to engage with the Commission.</p></speech>

The distinction I was making was that the commercials were able to stick to their statute and investment plans.  They were not dependent on the choices made by the Government.  That was the element to which I was trying to refer.  We have been looking at that model which includes both affordable housing and private housing, with reference to the tests we have been undertaking from a state aid rules perspective.  It takes account of both components and what they mean.  Part and parcel of it is the issue to which Mr Coleman referred.  We are speaking about the use of public lands in the first instance and the fact that the transfer of those sites, irrespective of whether it was to the LDA or a private operator, would encompass the provision of social and affordable housing.  That is the landscape on which all of this is set.  I confirm that we are looking at both angles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Coleman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111200002#X00300"><p>To follow up on the counter cyclical point about the approved housing bodies sector in the United Kingdom, registered providers and the models for private housing with a subvention or a way to fund social and affordable housing, I am not sure it would be a sustainable model through a downturn when private housing development might suffer or the profits from it might be lower than what would be required to subvent social and affordable housing.  I do not believe it is on what the LDA should rely in its model, although I agree that it should seek ways to deal with the issue of affordable housing provision, in particular.  Social housing will always be a function of its service in the interests of the general public.  We should seek ways for affordable housing to be deliverable without a subvention through a downturn.  It is something for which we should strive.  In time, it might be decoupled from private housing delivery.  Something else we would love to do through a downturn is buy land, particularly for the longer term, that obviously would not be tied to private housing production.</p> <p>  On whether the value added in Shanganagh would be solely due to the financing model the LDA might be able to invoke, it is a significant part of it.  Developing something that would be sustainable through a downturn will be very important.  If the LDA can sponsor and lead on it, it would be of benefit to the markets and the local authorities.  It would also help us to deliver on our obligations through downturns if we still had an affordability requirement to meet on our sites.  It is not as simple as purely being about the financing model.  On a practical basis, we have been working well with the local authority on project management in Shanganagh, as well as with other local authorities.</p><p>It is not purely the financing model.  We are collaborating well on other aspects.</p></speech>

With Mr. Coleman's previous experience with NAMA, what was the experience there on the freedom of information, FOI, thing?  There are some similarities between NAMA and the LDA.  Clearly, FOI will be a big issue.  Mr. Coleman got a taste of it this morning.  We talked earlier about probity, transparency, openness, open government and accountability.  This will be a big issue.  Many things were learned from NAMA.  There was considerable disquiet in the public domain.  I genuinely wish the LDA well, but it must have the confidence of the public at large.  That will be critical in setting the foundations for its success.  I ask Mr. Coleman to share with the committee his experience of how the FOI thing was dealt with in NAMA.  Does he see any similarities?  Could that type of situation be transposed into the LDA?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Coleman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111200002#Y00300"><p>It is a really good question.  One way to think about that is to consider the different context that applied in NAMA as opposed to the LDA.  NAMA was of a time.  The nature of its work was highly controversial.  There were many people tied up in NAMA who did not want it to succeed in its objectives, which may have been against their interests.  It is a different beast from the LDA.  The LDA is generally dealing with State assets, certainly in its initial guise before it starts acquiring land on the private market at the appropriate time.  It will probably be more of a force for positivity as opposed to the difficult and sometimes unpopular job that NAMA had to do.</p> <p>  That applies a different context to the FOI requests that come in.  We have had a number of FOI requests and our approach to FOI so far would be to err on the side on the side of transparency and releasing as much as we can.  We try to engage with inquirers and FOI requesters to work with them to establish what exactly they are looking for and see if we can get to the nub of the issue they are trying to uncover etc.  That would be our bias towards doing that and I do not see why that would change.  Irrespective of whether the provisions of the Bill carry through, we will still be subject to FOI.</p> <p>  I would rather not speak too much about NAMA because it was a different context.  I would see the LDA having a bias towards releasing as much as we can without it impacting on the commercial sensitivities of the LDA and ultimately taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

An FOI would confer an obligation rather than a generous disposition.  Personnel may change, as can the focus and ethos of an organisation.  If it is underpinned by a legislative certainty where FOI has hold in an organisation, that is far better than the current situation.  While I accept the LDA may be erring on the side of transparency right now, in future it may not and that is at the discretion of the organisation.  That gets to the nub of my line of questioning.</p> <p>  I have not seen any logic that would override the exemptions already within the Freedom of Information Act and that would override the prerogative of the Information Commissioner to adjudicate on any commercially sensitive issues.  In their answers, both the LDA and the Department have indicated the need to maintain and preserve commercial sensitivity.  Based on what I have heard from Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Senator Boyhan, I do not believe anybody is saying otherwise.  Naturally, it is important to keep that commercial sensitivity with sites it is exploring.</p><p>Surely the Information Commissioner can do that in the context of the Freedom of Information Act.  Surely the existing exemptions in that Act are sufficiently robust.  There is a legitimate concern that if this organisation operates outside FOI and the lobbying register, it will be living in the shadows.  Based on Mr. Coleman's answer, I do not believe that is a space he wants his organisation to be in necessarily.</p><p> There was a description of freedom of information as burdensome.  Freedom of information exists in respect of the Houses of the Oireachtas, all Departments and many agencies to shed light on matters and to provide answers.  Sometimes those answers may be uncomfortable and may take up administrative time, but they are a good thing.  They maintain public trust in an organisation.  The LDA is a very important organisation and will be charged with considerable funding and resources.  Accordingly, there is great value of having it live within the realm of FOI.  From what I can hear, there is no great rationale for it living outside that realm.</p><p> Mr. Coleman has experience of working in NAMA and in an organisation that is outside FOI.  He correctly compared and contrasted the different natures of the two organisations.  Does he believe the core functions of the LDA would be able to exist if it were subject to an FOI regime and if head 39 were changed?  Would it infringe on the LDA's ability to work?</p></speech>

As Ms Graham mentioned, the Bill as drafted, replicates the most recent examples that have come through the Oireachtas and I guess that is the starting point.  The Bill, as drafted, does not exempt the LDA from FOI.  All basically non-business-related activities would be subject to the FOI.  Requests relating to whom I meet and the service providers we engage will still be part of that.  Obviously, if the committee has concerns that somehow that is inconsistent with what we are trying to do, I am sure we can take that away and pick up on that.  Ms Graham may wish to add to that.</p></speech>

Many moons ago, I was the Department's first FOI officer.  I was intimately involved in implementing the freedom of information legislation in the Department and was the champion of it in the Department.  I can assure the committee from that perspective.  I was trying to reflect that the FOI provisions are general in nature, trying to cover all the potential areas where there may be exemption.  Sometimes specific categories, such as confidentiality or commercial sensitivity, are known to impact on an organisation and that is reflected in its legislation.  Some organisations have confidential information or commercial information particularly identified.  That is so that based on the general exemption, rather than going through an exercise where the Information Commissioner will end up in that position, we know it from the outset.  That is purely the rationale, that there is a component of information that is held.  However, I indicated that we believe given the nature of the LDA it is important to have the appropriate balance of accountability and governance.  We are mindful of the discussion the committee has had on FOI and lobbying, the legislation relating to both of which is general in nature.</p><p>For that reason, they are not part of the Minister's legislation.  The Minister will look to the Government and discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for proposed alternatives.  I am simply signalling that we were conscious of the debate.  If we can find a measure that sits appropriately with what we are trying to do, we are open to it.  We are only trying to ensure that the LDA can work operationally with the appropriate level of transparency and accountability.  We are open to all ideas in that regard.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear that.  Ms Graham was a champion of freedom of information requests in a former life, and may be one in her present iteration.  My underlying concern comes from what the Information Commissioner said.  The Information Commissioner clearly has concerns with the current direction.  Those concerns should be noted and acted upon.  I am glad to hear the Department has an open mind in this regard.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to begin our deliberations on the topic of education and how it impacts the Traveller community.  We will meet representatives from the National Traveller Women's Forum and the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project, and Ms Catherine Joyce.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Eileen Flynn of the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Mr. Patrick Nevin of the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project, and Ms Catherine Joyce.</p><p>In accordance with procedures, I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of these Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  They also adversely affect the television coverage and web streaming.  I wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that witnesses have made to the joint committee will be published on the committee's website.  After the presentation there will be questions from members of the committee.</p><p>I call Mr. Patrick Nevin to make his opening statement on behalf of the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project.</p></speech>

We have almost come to the 100th anniversary of the Irish State's foundation.</p><p>From the beginning, Travellers were denied ownership of their identity and historical place in its foundation.  This is very obvious in the 1952 Irish Folklore Commission survey.  In this document we see how it was the sedentary members of society who were given the opportunity to speak as well as name, place and deny Travellers the ownership of their position in the broader sphere of Irish society.  This document is used as a key source by academics at home and abroad as a starting point in their academic discourse on Travellers.  We see how Travellers were to become either idealised or denigrated and made into objects of representation and investigation.  Yet, at no time do we hear the voice of the Travellers in this document.</p><p> From the 1960s onwards, we seen a deepening interest in the Traveller community and we see the State taking a more active role in the problem of Travellers.  I use the statement the "problem of Travellers" openly as this was how the State viewed the Traveller or tinker community.  This was to culminate in the Government publication of the report of the Commission on Itinerancy in 1963.  In this report we see again that the voice of Travellers is not represented.  The commission was made up of various representatives of official Ireland.  The opening statement by the chairman to the commission outlines what the commission was intent on doing.  The statement makes it clear that the solution to the Traevller problem was the complete absorption of the Traveller community and it follows that there can be no final solution of the problems created by itinerants until they are absorbed into the general community.  We must see this as the starting point when we are looking at the barriers and the key issues affecting Travellers, whether they are accessing education, accommodation, health or unemployment.</p><p> This open and transparent assault on the Traveller community way of life and identity must be acknowledged as a major contributory factor to the exclusion of Travellers from the State and its various institutions.  To respond to the serious issues Travellers face in their everyday lives we must accept that the State needs to look at the issue of reparations.  We have to acknowledge this injustice as we have acknowledged the injustice committed upon the women who were institutionalised in such places as the Magdalen laundries.  A total of 60 years of State-sponsored denial of Traveller identity and culture has not only impacted on their educational attainment but has created an internalised oppression, barriers and lack of self-worth within the Traveller community.  What I mean by reparations is that the State must remedy this at a structural level.  It could start by addressing the deficit of Traveller culture and history within the education system.  This must be a priority for the State if it is serious in trying to reverse six decades of assimilationist policies.  It must also put in place affirmative action programmes to mirror those in the United States, Canada and Australia.  While there are still major issues impacting on the various communities affected in these countries, the overall picture is one of positivity.</p><p> Since March 2017 our ethnicity has been acknowledged.  However, this on its own does not acknowledge or repair the damage that has been inflicted on the Traveller community by the State with its policies of absorption and assimilation.  The State and its institutions need to accept their direct role in the catastrophic damage to the Traveller community.  We must have an open transparent and honest discourse like we have had in recent years in regard to other State and institutionalised wrongs.  Our submission, Tallaght Travellers, has to some extent outlined several recommendations and ways that we can move forward in partnership and achieve a more equal and improved society.  While addressing education we must remember that State policies have also had a negative impact and created inequalities and poor outcomes for my community in other areas including health, employment accommodation culture and language.  My thanks to the committee.</p></speech>

We are not just second-class citizens as women, we are third-class citizens because of the intersectionality that goes with being a Traveller.  For many Traveller children, it is a struggle to get to school every day due to their living accommodation and schools and the system often do not understand that.  Traveller children have little or no support from the education system.  </p> <p>  I will have to call on Ms Joyce to do the presentation because I do not want to feck it up.  I have just had a baby and I did not realise it would be so difficult.  I am really sorry.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, we spoke to a Traveller woman who was making every effort to support her daughter in finishing her last two years of secondary school.  Her daughter is bright and well able for the academic work, but was lonely as there were no other Traveller girls in the school with her.  The advice of the principal at the time was that nothing could be done but that if she wanted, she could be put on a reduced timetable.  The mother told us that schools need to have a real understanding of the ongoing racism and exclusion experienced by Traveller students instead of burying their heads in the sand and pretending they believe that everyone is treated the same when they know that is not the case.  She went on to say that children respond well to honesty, so from the outset teachers should not be afraid to talk to Traveller children as Travellers.  Traveller children should not have to hide their identity in school and should be made to feel that school is a safe place to stay.  The context of that conversation and the statement from that mother was that three young Traveller girls that her daughter had been friends with at junior certificate level were put on reduced timetable.  Within months of that happening, they had dropped out of secondary school.</p> <p>  Every child in Ireland has a right to education.</p><p>It is enshrined in our Constitution but what about every child's right to go to a school in a safe environment that is free from racism where he or she will be treated with dignity and respect and have his or her culture recognised and valued?  </p><p> Every child should have an absolute right to equality of access, participation and outcomes.  This is not so for very many Traveller children and we cannot say this enough.  There needs to be equality of access, there needs to be equality in terms of participation and there certainly needs to be equality in terms of outcomes.  We know from anecdotal evidence that there is no longer a 100% transfer rate of Traveller children from primary to post-primary education.  We also know that the attainment levels of many Traveller children are lower than children from the settled majority.  Only 1% of Travellers are in third-level institutions and 82% of Traveller women are unemployed.  Our submission also references a range of statistics highlighting the inequality in outcomes from education for Traveller women and girls.  Racist bullying from their settled peers and educators is a daily experience for many Traveller learners.  Low expectations of Traveller learners on the part of teachers is a clear example of the bias and stereotyping that take place in our education institutions.  Discriminatory practices are still evident, for example, enrolment processes that exclude Traveller children and growing numbers of Traveller children being inappropriately placed on reduced timetables, which significantly impact on their educational opportunities and outcomes.  There was a real opportunity last year with regard to enrolment processes and the discriminatory and racist practice of giving a child first preference if his or her older siblings were in the school that adversely impacted some groups, including Travellers where there is no history of second-level education.  Unfortunately, it fell short.  All of these practices and more such as some schools' refusal to take Traveller children have a significant impact on the progression of Travellers in second-level education and engagement with third-level institutions.  </p><p> Regarding recommendations, the Department of Education and Skills needs to develop an action and implementation plan for all 14 actions for which it is responsible under the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy in partnership with Traveller organisations.  Outstanding recommendations from the education strategy that was launched in 2006 should be addressed in a similar manner.  A range of stakeholders, including Traveller organisations, put significant effort and time into developing that education strategy and there were really high expectations that it would have brought change.  Other than the fanfare on the day of the launch in the Department of Education and Skills in Marlborough Street, it fell flat and failed to address the failures of the system with regard to Traveller children in education.  Efforts must be made to ensure that a strong and robust inclusion of Traveller culture is present in curricula and the whole school environment.  The Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill should be passed without amendment and we hope it will.  There is a need for compulsory anti-racism and intercultural training pertaining to Travellers as part of pre-service and in-service teacher training and there is a need for visibility of Traveller culture in curricula.  Additional recommendations can be found in our submission to the joint committee, including recommendations on the use of reduced timetables in Irish schools made earlier this year to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, about which we are still very concerned.  We have written to the Department again as it is developing guidelines for schools with regard to reduced timetables.  There are a number of key points in our submission that need to be addressed, including the role of the inspectorate, to ensure this discriminatory and racist practice with regard to Travellers is stamped out.  </p><p> A final point I would like to leave the committee with is that while the Department of Education and Skills has made some efforts in the past two years, and I use the term "some efforts" loosely, to begin to address these issues, major institutional and systematic change is needed to ensure equality of access, participation and outcomes for Traveller children and learners in education.  As Ms Flynn said, when we were developing this presentation, it is essential that Traveller women and girls have real opportunities for success and outcomes from education.  I will leave the committee with that final thought.  </p></speech>

Reduced timetables come up a lot.  The witnesses have been very generous with their time with regard to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills.</p><p>Reduced timetables have been used as a tool to reinforce inequality and to further increase the level of racism and segregation that is happening in schools.

I am one of the managers of Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group.  Our area is Dublin 15 but we serve the surrounding areas such as Meath, Cavan and Fingal County Council.</p> <p>  As Ms Maria Joyce and Mr. Nevin have already said, education is not a luxury.  It is a right that all children have in this country.  However, it is as important to have the right to be treated equally within the education system and that cannot be achieved if the lived experience, culture and identify of Travellers is not reflected positively within schools.  For that to happen, we must look at the curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, how books are developed in relation to promoting aspects of Irish culture and identity within the system, and not being able to do that and reflect Traveller culture.  They are looking at it now but it is way overdue.  It is badly needed in terms of making sure that the curriculum reflects Traveller culture.</p> <p>  Every statistic one ever hears about education is a child, like my child, Johnny, who is 14 years of age, or the child belonging to those who are in this room.  It is the next generation that we are talking about in the Traveller community who are children, who are pupils, who are life-long learners and who are going through an educational system that, as Ms Maria Joyce stated, is racist towards our culture, identity and, indeed, community.  When we are thinking about it, we have to think about the individuals who are involved in these statistics that are getting thrown out left, right and centre.</p> <p>  In my catchment area, there are Travellers who live in a range of different types of accommodation.  There are Travellers who live in Traveller-specific accommodation - halting sites and group housing schemes.  There are Travellers who live in the private rented sector who live in mainstream housing.  There are also Travellers who, like a lot of people in this country, are homeless.  These Travellers have an added challenge of trying to get to school - when they might be in the geographical area of Dublin 15 but are travelling from Swords and other areas - to make sure that they adhere to their commitments in relation to their child's education.  They are detached from their extended family and community but they also have a logistical difficulty in terms of finances and distance in trying to get their child to school and in getting him or her to stay the correct school hours.  That causes great difficulty without schools forcing reduced hours on Traveller children and stating that, because one is a Traveller child, it is okay to miss a subject such as English, Irish or mathematics.  Whatever the subject, that limits their opportunities of being able to progress in education and into second-level education.  It also limits their employment opportunities in this country.  Projects, such as my own, spend a lot of time and energy trying to undo a lot of damage that was done in the educational system in this country where we are trying to re-educate Travellers who left at an early school age or who were forced into segregated classes in this country.  We spend a lot of time and energy educating people who have only had a limited number of years, if any, in mainstream education.  Considerable financial resources of the State have gone into doing that through a number of Traveller projects, such as our own, around the country.</p> <p>  When we are looking at education, we must look at the cuts.  We cannot go any further without saying that the cuts have been detrimental to education.  Up until the cuts in 2008 and 2009, we had 100% transition of Travellers in Blanchardstown from mainstream primary school education into second-level education.  We had all the challenges of trying to keep children in education.  We ourselves provided homework support clubs.  Other people provided breakfast clubs.  We had the resource teacher for Travellers, RTT.  We had the visiting teacher services.  We had all of those services, including transport, to maintain that 100% transition.  It only lasted for two years.  As soon as the cuts occurred, it was no longer the case that we had transition.</p> <p>  If one looks at the possibilities that could be open to Travellers if they transferred into second-level education and the opportunities they might have if they go on to college and further education or learning, that has been limited because of the State's cuts in Traveller education.</p> <p>  We have also got a situation where all of those people have gone through a school system that does not reflect their culture, identity or lived experience.</p><p>We have a position whereby the Traveller children are being taught by their parents and extended families.  When they are taught in that environment, they are also being taught to be guarded about how they expose their identity to people who are not Travellers.  They are taught to be guarded in how they conduct and present themselves to settled people in schools.  Travellers do not want their children to have to face racism and discrimination just because they are proud of their Traveller identity, their culture and their way of life.  We must ensure education is not just about educating Travellers about Traveller culture but also about educating settled people about Traveller culture.</p><p> Unfortunately, the State has neglected its duty in this area in a big way.  Projects like mine are trying to undo much of the damage with the education programmes we provide to schools and teachers, as well as some of the development work we do locally.  We are doing work that could have been done by the State 20 years ago in order to ensure that interculturalism would have included Travellers in the space where we could talk about different cultures and identity.  It is particularly important given the announcement in 2017 where the State recognised Traveller ethnicity that schools would start to take on that responsibility in a real way and ensure they teach all children in schools about the identity of Travellers, as well as the important role that Travellers have played in the economic survival of the country and in the area of traditional music.  There are also other elements of their contribution to consider, including the landscape of the country, farming, etc.  That is not reflected but it could be in the whole school curriculum rather than just one subject.</p><p> Travellers might have to endure teachers who do not know anything about Travellers teaching a subject in one class or one year.  Children like mine have excused themselves when the subject was taught and did not go into school for the day.  Other children belonging to me who sat in those classes when the topic was taught had to endure racism and discrimination from the other children in the classrooms and had to come to their own defence in challenging it.  Sometimes they got into physical arguments in the yard because of comments made in the classroom setting because a teacher was not able to handle the information coming through.  It was one subject and one piece of a curriculum.  It is a lot of responsibility to place on a 14 or 15 year old from the Traveller community if they must educate Travellers and settled people, including their friends, as well as teachers of the subject in the first place.</p><p> None of the Travellers in our area lives in a DEIS area so they do not have any special resources or significant support going into the schools.  They are treated the same as everybody else.  In an ideal world, we would like it to be the case that no other resources are needed but when people are targets of racism, discrimination and cultural erosion, there is an important need for DEIS schools to be expanded where there is a significant number of Travellers who could access such additional support.  As I stated, the visiting teacher service is gone and the loss of posts for RTTs has had a significant impact on Travellers.  There is also the question of significant other supports, including capitation grants to help Travellers in schools.</p><p> The national survey in 2017 indicated that four out of ten Travellers stated that their Traveller children had been bullied in school because of their identity.  I know that is the case as my children were bullied in school to the extent that they were called "knackers" in the school yard.  They were asked to pick up a tissue paper and this and that.  When a teacher tried to respond to the incident in the yard, the response was to ask my child to explain who Travellers were; my child had to come up with the solution when the other person should have been reprimanded.  It is an awful indictment of our school system if we are asking children to be judge, jury and executioner when a racist comment is made against Travellers.</p><p> Interculturalism is important and it is vital the whole school learns about Travellers.  It is important that non-Traveller children learn about different cultures that make up society and that we look at the historical context of Travellers.  We must also consider the contemporary context of Travellers and we do not want people learning about Travellers who lived in wagons 40 years ago.  My children do not even know what it is to live in a wagon.   We must look at contemporary Traveller culture and trying to reflect that in the school curriculum.  Any negative stereotypes or views in the wider society should not be reflected in either the delivery of teaching or books used in that delivery.</p><p>Some good programmes, such as the Yellow Flag programme, deal with interculturalism in school but, unfortunately, in some cases Travellers are a tag-on.  The programme looks at other cultures and new communities but does not necessarily put Travellers to the forefront.<br/><br/>A programme could be developed to ensure that the schools have a role in prioritising the Traveller culture within programmes, specifically where they are about cultural identity and look at the native culture of Travellers in this country.  Traveller culture and history are not visible in the preschool, primary school and post-primary curricula and there are no mandated guidelines for schools on this matter.  Schools can teach what they want.  Even in the Yellow Flag programme they can leave it to the pupils, the teachers or the parents of the children who are in the school to teach it.  Very often much will be hidden because they do not want to expose Traveller culture and identity and they do not want that to be a reflection on their children who may be attending the school.  We must get it right and use the experts who are there for doing that, and it must be across the school setting and not just in one area.<br/><br/>Many Traveller groups are doing this work <i>ad hoc</i>through music, theatre and dramas.  My husband is involved through a play he wrote about it.  It is a cultural thing and he has contacted many people, but it should not be the responsibility of Traveller organisations.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that the educational system is at least reflective of the native Irish people who live in this country, if not ensuring that we include the new people who have joined our society.<br/><br/>There is a need to monitor the data relating to Travellers in schools and, in particular, on why Travellers are leaving school early, the locations of those schools and what the impact is in terms of the user of the school.  There is a need to establish a new education strategy.  I was involved in the last one and I am sure it is a door stop for a room somewhere in the Department of Education and Skills because I have not heard it quoted by many Ministers or people who are involved in education.  It took a great deal of time to do that.  It is not about spending another five years on an education strategy.  It is about a strategy that has targets and goals and adequate resources to implement it.  The last time I was involved in a discussion about education with the Department, when the cuts took place in 2008, the first thing it did was cut Traveller training centres.  While Traveller training centres categorically needed to go, they did not need to go as the first port of call when cuts were sanctioned.  The impact of that must be addressed in terms of the adults who have gone through a system where there are no adult learning spaces available.They are coming back to us on community employment, CE, and other programmes, but they are not suitable for adult learning.  We must examine that.<br/><br/>We must resource Traveller organisations in respect of picking up the tab for education.  We have picked up the visiting teacher service and the roles of the after-school programmes and breakfast clubs, yet we do not have an education worker or a youth worker.  Our project is left with the fallout from the cuts and we are trying to respond and deal with that.<br/><br/>I realise I have gone over time so I will finish quickly.  The intercultural awareness programme should be mandatory for trainee teachers and all teachers, regardless of whether they are teaching Traveller children or children from other communities.  There must be a situation where there is mandatory intercultural and anti-racist teaching for the teachers who are teaching in these schools.  It does not matter who the pupil is.  They should be educating everybody who comes through the door about interculturalism and anti-racism in school life and in the school setting.<br/><br/>The Department of Education and Skills has called for the inclusion of Traveller history and culture.  I welcome that.  I realise many people are questioning why they must learn about Travellers and not all the other cultures.  They are questioning why Travellers are so important and asking why Travellers cannot teach their own children.  The reality is that Travellers have been recognised as an ethnic minority group.  The State did that after much campaigning on behalf of Traveller organisations.  There is a responsibility on the State to educate its pupils, regardless of whether they are in preschool, primary, secondary or third level education.  If it is a private school one can look at the logistics of doing that.  Regardless of the type of education, the State has a responsibility to ensure that whatever is taught in schools does not damage the life of the young person who is going through that educational system.<br/><br/>I am speaking as a mother and a grandmother.  Some of my grandchildren are of Traveller extraction and some are of settled extraction.  When they are going through the school system they will be further disenfranchised by a situation where a teacher does not know how to teach the pupils in the school who come from a different culture or race or come from two cultures or identities.  There will be more of that, and not just in respect of Travellers.  We will have it in respect of people who come from Africa, China and elsewhere in the world to live in this country.</p><p>It is vital that we do not do the same wrongs we did to Travellers to other settled people or people from other cultures.  Traveller children and young people should be as important to the State as they are to me and our community.  If I am forced to put my children into mainstream second level education, the least that I can expect is that the Government will out for my child and not damage their health or mental well-being by telling them that it is not good to be a Traveller.</p></speech>

It contained little with which I would disagree.  One of her first points was how education is a right.  Unfortunately, there are still people who do not have rights.  Rights can exist theoretically but where people come from communities which have never been in a position to facilitate, support or exercise their rights, and they do not have the avenues to demand them and feel as though they deserve them, do they really have those rights at all?  People feel as though they no longer deserve to be supported and helped because they have been excluded for so long.</p> <p>  I will open up for questions from the members, beginning with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019111200002#K00300"><p>Many issued have been raised, many of which are cross-cutting.  The very obvious one would be how a child in education might be living in very bad accommodation or moving in homelessness from one bed and breakfast accommodation to another, which is something I often encounter.  It is an impossible challenge for a child compared to one in a settled home, in a settled place in a settled school.</p> <p>   At the end of his presentation, Mr. Nevin said he had some suggestions for things we could do.  I am interested to hear a synopsis of those.  Ultimately, the committee will write a report.  It will have a page or two of recommendations at the beginning.  My experience is that if the recommendations are fairly tight there is a greater chance of delivering them.  If one includes everything that would solve the world, it is probably harder to get them to deliver.  Mr. Nevin made a very powerful submission.  His points are valid about what happened or did not happen in the past, that is the sins of omission and of action, as it were.  We have to say how we move forward from here, taking that into account.  </p> <p>  The reduced timetable seems a lazy way out.  On what basis, unless there was a health reason or some overriding issue why would it be a standard response to someone in the Traveller community to say that they cannot do the full curriculum rather than saying that they need more supports to do the curriculum?  That has been the response.  Some years ago, a Traveller woman came to me in Tipperary and asked if her child could study Irish.  An outrageous proposition had been put to her.  Obviously the school could not be bothered teaching a Traveller child Irish and thought that something that was their right was not their right and was suggesting that the exemption from Irish would be taken.  What they were saying is that the child had to take it and that a Traveller could not do Irish.  Of course, I said that the child could and if this woman wanted her child to do Irish that was her choice.  I believe that there is many a Traveller child who has lost out significantly because the more that a child does the full curriculum the more chances he or she will get in life.  Therefore, unless there was some reason equivalent to the reason a non-Traveller child would have for not doing Irish there was no reason to deprive them of something that was important to them.</p><p> We talk vaguely about teaching Traveller culture but there is no fixed curriculum, with every school paddling its own canoe.  Human beings are ingenious at finding ways not to do a thing as it should be done.  How do our guests believe Traveller culture should be delivered in schools so that it has the desired effect, and not the opposite effect?  DEIS status for schools which have a large proportion of Travellers was mentioned.  I was astounded that a school with a large number of Travellers is not guaranteed DEIS status.  Would we be better to focus funding on extra resources for the Traveller pupils in such schools or to give it to the school in general, which the school might disburse in a way that does not necessarily assist those from the Traveller community?</p><p> One issue that is raised continually in front of this committee is that disadvantage in education and health is interlinked and people in bad accommodation find it equally difficult to learn.  Travellers are in halting sites while we are sitting here talking about the issues around those sites.  We witnessed a kid trying to do homework.  The kid was amazing because they were complicated sums and every one of them was correct but I do not know how the child was meant to concentrate amid the hubbub going on in the vicinity.  Another child would have a room or space to themselves if they wanted to study.</p><p> We need to look at the challenges faced by the Traveller community.  If parents are denied access to education, directly or indirectly, they cannot be of as much assistance to children with the various tasks they have to complete.  Should resources be focused and guaranteed to reach Traveller children or is there a danger that, by giving DEIS status to a school, the funds will simply be dissipated throughout the school, notwithstanding the fact that DEIS status is given on account of the number of Travellers at the school?</p><p> I remember the day the announcement on ethnicity was made.  I was very pleased it was made but I was worried that official Ireland would think it had done its bit.  My experience has been that it has made very little real difference.  I would be interested in the comments of our guests on that point.  The settled community needs a huge amount of education.  Sociological surveys state that settled people's attitudes to all different ethnic groups across the world are prejudiced but that they are most prejudiced, by far, against Travellers.</p></speech>

I will leave our suggestions aside for a moment and explain what I meant by reparations.</p> <p>  We need to consider how the State responded to Travellers in 1963.  We cannot separate that starting point as it is one of the most seminal dates for Travellers in this country.  I say that because from 1963 to 1973 the Traveller community moved from a nomadic transient population to one that was forced to become sedentary and settle in urban centres within the State.  I made a point about the membership of that committee being made up of official Ireland and one will realise that when one reads the report.  </p></speech>

We have witnessed that in recent weeks in terms of what has happened in Oughterard, Ballymore and the fire-bombing of direct provision centres or hotels that were earmarked for direct provision accommodation.  To me, that points to the fact that we, tinkers or Travellers, were the template for all of what is happening at this moment and what is to come.  That must be acknowledged.</p> <p>  In terms of reparations, the State needs to take ownership of Traveller identity and culture.  It needs to acknowledge that we have been part and parcel of the State since its foundation in 1922 and long before then for the previous millennia; we have existed and coexisted.  It is now time for reparations.  I have submitted my ideas for reparations as we all have.  The State needs to hold up its hands and say, "We need to take cognisance of what we inflicted on the community".</p> <p>  In 2017, the ESRI compiled a report entitled A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, which showed the difference in improvements in educational attainment of the non-Traveller population from the 1960s onwards when compared with what happened to Travellers.  It is important to note from the research that from the 1960s onwards Travellers were subject to an assimilationist-absorption policy for Travellers yet for the majority population the policy was one of education and investment in its culture, identity, history and place.  That did not happen for Travellers. The State needs to acknowledge what happened and take ownership of its actions, which is what I am talking about in terms of reparations.  </p> <p>  Ms Catherine Joyce made the point, as we all have, that State acknowledgement is not just important to Travellers.  We are not here to educate the majority population.  It is up to the State and its institutions to provide such education.  They need to take ownership of that task, which is important for the new communities but also for what is happening with Brexit and Northern Ireland, and where we are going in a new Ireland, the new discourse and what we are attempting to do.  At the heart of this situation is that Travellers have been used as a template for everything else that has happened to the new communities.  The State has perfected its othering on the back of Travellers so now is the time for reparations and not willy-nilly projects.  The State needs to take on board what has taken place in Canada, New Zealand and other places.  Such initiatives have, by and large, not resolved the issues in those places but a real genuine attempt has been made to address past wrongs, which is what this State needs to do.  I will respond further, if needs be.     </p></speech>

Where an area has a large contingent of Travellers and schools are struggling to keep Travellers in school or to keep Travellers at the same attainment level as their settled peers, there should be a way of managing that.  I am not saying DEIS is the ideal scenario, but in the absence of the visiting teacher service, where the teachers were able to make a joint assessment of the need in a particular school, there must be some type of programme or a way of making sure that, particularly in DEIS schools that have Traveller pupils, they are resourced to include Travellers.  Where there are no Travellers in the DEIS schools that are available, there should be some way of monitoring that.  Again, it is to do with reviewing the current state of play on the ground.</p><p> In regard to the history of Travellers, there are many Travellers in this country who were put into a segregated classroom from as early as four years of age.  My husband is one of them and he was put into a prefab at the back of a girls school in Finglas.  He went through his school life in segregated provision.  There were two teachers in that classroom and they taught very basic mathematics and English.  There were no other subjects such as Irish and history taught in the classroom.  There was a range of ages in the classroom setting, and when they left school they could write their names and addresses.  They were well lucky after coming out of those schools.  The schools were provided by the Catholic Church and the State.  The development of those schools was a joint collusion.  We must get an apology for those adults, who are only in their 50s and some might be even younger, for the segregation and deliberate isolation of Travellers within the education system.  Those people need an apology on behalf of the State.  Some type of recourse must be made in respect of those people and their education.</p><p> Regarding the culture and identity of Travellers being taught in schools, I do not believe every settled person going through school needs to know everything about Traveller culture and identity, but there are certainly areas where there are gaps.  Consider the economic change in Ireland through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  We talk about the industrial revolution here and tinsmithing being done away with by the arrival of plastic and so forth.  There was a genuine role for the tinker in this country in mending pots and pans.  The experience of settled people who used that service was predominantly good.  It might not be the case for people who are sitting here, but their parents and grandparents certainly would have had tinkers calling to the door and mending pots and pans.  There are parts of that which could be put into the economic modules in the education system.</p><p> I am not an academic and I am certainly not a teacher so I am not in a position to go through every schoolbook and subject in the classroom, but there are people who can go through them and Traveller-proof them with the positive aspects of Traveller identity, the positive role Travellers played in Irish music and so forth, and the hawkers and sellers at the door.  Travellers were recycling in this country before it was popular.  They were involved in recycling on the tip heads and the dumps.  They were recycling in markets with old washing machines, lawnmowers, bicycles and the like.  Those things have been ignored in the education system and in the awareness of recycling in this country.  I got a glimpse of a programme on RT&Eacute; last night and there was no mention of the people who were recycling before recycling was popular and trendy.  They were the Traveller community.  They were recycling long before it was the thing to do.  There are ways in which we can go through the curriculum and include Travellers and the positive role we played in society.</p><p> Musicians in this country would not deny the contribution that Travellers made not only in creating a style of music but also in preserving Irish music at a time it was under severe threat by the English in this country.  When Travellers used to go from door to door selling ballad sheets, they used to bring the songs and stories from another county.  They could not be written down because if a person was caught carrying the papers, he or she was done for.  They kept them in their heads and passed them on from generation to generation.  Some very famous musicians always credit Travellers for the role they played in that.  There are many opportunities to include Travellers.  I am not just talking about the history of Travellers but also contemporary Traveller culture.</p><p> I have children who went through the education system and every year they had a new book because the previous year's was not useable.  Books are being developed all the time.</p><p>Why are we are not talking to the companies developing the books and saying that the books cannot go into schools unless there is Traveller-proofing of the books for the curriculum?  It can and should be done.</p></speech>

It is an important point around the delivery of Traveller culture and history and not a justification for the existence of Travellers in a country.  It should take in everything that Travellers have contributed to Irish life for a very long time.  It seeps into every one of our subjects but it is excluded from books.  It is a good place to start.</p></speech>

We are all very different but should be treated with equal value, including every child on the island of Ireland.  Why is it different for a Traveller child?  I struggled through the education system.  This was not because I lived on a halting site and had family around me.  That part of being a Traveller is absolutely lovely to me and living on a halting site was a great experience.  What was not lovely for me were the conditions we lived in.  We could go a week without heating.  In my family's home now, the roof has nearly collapsed on top of us.  We need to get landlords who can fix problems in our homes.  If this happened in the settled population, the services would be provided but they are not provided on halting sites.  There are challenges faced by young Traveller children.  On a Christmas morning, we could have Traveller children coming to the house for water at Labre Park, where I was born and reared.  It is not because we come from a close-knit community, although there is a lovely sense of community; it is not the halting site that is the problem but rather the living conditions and the services not being provided to the Traveller community.  This has a dramatic impact on education and health.</p> <p>  With regard to ethnicity, on 1 March 2017, Travellers were recognised as an ethnic minority group in Ireland.  Unfortunately, this was just a statement and off we had to go with that recognition.  The idea was that these were happy days for Travellers.  Unfortunately, those happy days have not yet come about.  It is one thing to say Travellers are recognised as an ethnic minority group but another to see action and for Travellers to feel valued.  I am a new mother and my child is 50% Traveller, 50% settled and she is 100% of both cultures.  My husband and I were chatting the other day about what will happen if our child gets called a knacker in school.  I had never thought of this before and I hope it does not happen to my child.  I hope she never has to go through the struggles I had in the Irish education system.  That was just 12 years ago and going through second and third level education was a real struggle because of cost, accommodation and not having the support at home that I needed.</p> <p>  My father was literate but my three older siblings were in segregated schools, unfortunately.  I am dyslexic and my family did not understand homework so could not help me with it.  With all those struggles I still managed to get a degree.  I was a very lucky Traveller woman who was able to get a degree with supports from some services but not every child in my community is that lucky.  We need schools to know that a Traveller girl or young man does not necessarily want to go off and get married.  Our children should be valued in the education system, especially as now times are changing, as my brother always says.  We should be normalising Traveller recognition and it should be okay to be different.  We should teach Traveller culture in the same way we teach maths.  There are great Traveller people who are qualified teachers and they can teach Traveller culture and be part of that educational change.</p><p>It needs to change in order that we can have a better future for our children.</p><p> Ms Joyce and others have spoken about history.  To know where one is going, one must know where one came from.  If I was a Traveller child in primary or secondary school and told that I was going to learn about Traveller culture, I would feel more valued in the education system.  I came through years of school not being valued and wondering who I was and why was there nothing in the books about who I am, or having others tell me who I am.  I always knew I was different because of my background but I do not want that for Billy or any other Traveller child and to go through what I went through in the education system, and I was very lucky.  There are worse stories in the education system than mine and we cannot have that in future.  We must change.  We can start with the people in this room and start today.  We are discussing recommendations.  Let us work together on the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 and pass it.  That could be the first step.</p></speech>

In one short generation, we have gone from there being no homeless Travellers because of the way of life and the culture to greater numbers of children in homelessness being Traveller children.  There is also the wholly substandard quality of Traveller accommodation, particularly Traveller-specific accommodation.  There are low levels of provision and what is there is wholly substandard and unsafe because of overcrowding.  The numbers of Travellers living in unauthorised accommodation, without the most basic of services, is significant and growing.  All those factors combined makes it amazing that our children survive and come through an education system in anyway half intact.  That is testament to the strength of the culture and way of life but it does not take away from education and the State's responsibility towards and its failings of Traveller children.  When the committee looks at accommodation after Christmas, it could consider site visits to some of those accommodations.  That would be very useful and a big eye opener to anyone who has not been in those spaces.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked if reduced timetables being a lazy way out for schools.  The only answer to that is "Yes".  He asked about additional supports.  One response by an educator to the rationale for using reduced timetables in a school was that the child did need additional supports but they did nothing to make that happen, they just put a reduced timetable in place.  There is no way that child will stay in the education system.  They and many others will fall through the cracks.  The history of Traveller children in this State, even those within the system in schools, has been of exclusion.  Extra resources should follow children but it cannot be done in the same way as has been the case in the past.  Extra resources, when attached to children not just on need but on identity, ensured segregated provision for Traveller children and sustained itself until very recently.</p><p>As somebody who has come through what were then called special classes for Travellers, I can tell the committee that it does not meet the needs of Traveller children.  Yes, resources should follow the child where there is need, but there needs to be a real way of looking how that happens because otherwise it gets soaked into the schools.</p><p> Between 2008 and 2013, Traveller-specific supports were cut by 86.6%.  Those supports were in place to address the big gap between the educational attainment rates for Traveller children and the outcomes for settled children.  That has been rowed back on and we no longer have a 100% transfer from primary to post-primary education.  Given that it is a legal requirement in this country to be in school until 16, the State in itself is violating those rights.</p><p> In terms of ethnicity, it has already been done to some extent but there has been little progression.  It is not about needing to come up with a whole new strategy or way of doing things.  It is about implementing the policies and strategies that already exist across the board for Travellers in terms of health, accommodation and education.  The State's newest policy, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, makes a whole range of recommendations across all of those areas.  The Departments and agencies of this State that are responsible for those areas need to implement those recommendations.  Again, it is implementation, implementation, implementation.</p><p> On the final point about prejudice and racism against Travellers, that seems to be the greatest and most acceptable.  Research undertaken not just by Travellers but by wider bodies demonstrates that it is one of the most acceptable forms of racism and is not being challenged.  There is no leadership approach in this country, from a top down perspective, in relation to racism against Travellers.  We have seen again the most recent tweets about Travellers that have come out from people who want to fill the political space, and they are incredibly racist.  That has followed on from many examples over the years.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions.  It is always very enlightening to hear the history of the Travelling people and their suffering at the moment.  As public representatives, we want to highlight that a great wrong has been done to Traveller people over the past number of generations, and we want to right that wrong together.</p> <p>  I have a question for Eileen, and she has largely answered it very eloquently.  Obviously, 1% of the Traveller community go into third level education, so there is a huge deficit in terms of primary to post-primary and then to third level education.  I understand there are economic issues and reasons for that.  When I was growing up, the vast majority of people never went into third level education and went to work.  They had to because the economic reality was they had to go to work.  There are always different reasons people do not go into third level education.  Some people want to get a job and so forth.  What was Eileen's experience when moving from secondary to third level education?  I do not say this in isolation.  Did she encounter different attitudes than second level education when she entered third level education?</p><p>What was her overall experience?  I am sure many people look up to her.  Does Ms Flynn say to all Travellers, "This was my experience and you do not have to follow it"?  What initiatives would help to increase participation from 1% to 5% in the next few years?</p></speech>

I was trying to be professional. I started my studies at Trinity College 12 years ago.  It was such a struggle because I was in a big institution by myself and did not feel I had a place there.  I did not feel that I belonged but I was probably my own worst enemy.  I used to bunk on the Luas - I should not say that - and buy a cup of tea, which got me through my whole day in college.  Unfortunately, I had no supports in Trinity College but that was 12 years ago.  I did not enjoy the experience.</p> <p>  Next, I went to Ballyfermot College to do a post-leaving certificate, PLC, course on pre-nursing and caring for people with special needs.  I loved the smaller college.  Next, I went to Maynooth to get a degree because in Ireland one is nobody without a piece of paper.  Unfortunately, nowadays the leaving cert is not the norm, a degree is the norm.  Education has become more challenging for Traveller people and many of them do not want to get that piece of paper.  </p> <p>  As Ms Maria Joyce has said, between 2008 and 2013 Traveller education supports were cut by 86%.  Other costs include the cost of going to university and the cost of travel especially if one does not drive.  For the wider community, these things start at a young age and in primary school, and starts with the value placed on a young person within the school system.  To succeed in education all it takes is for one person to believe you can do it.  I only ever felt valued as a Traveller woman when I worked in the organisations of the Traveller community.  Previous to that I never felt valued as a Traveller woman in Ireland, and it was not that I was not good enough for society.  On reflection, as a 30 year old Traveller woman, I think that Irish society was never good enough for us.  Travellers need to live in a society where we feel we are valued.  We are not the same as everybody else but we need to be treated with dignity and respect.  If we are shown that in primary school and secondary school, and belief is shown to our young people, then our young people will progress to third level education.  If one gets a sense of not belonging then why would one put oneself through any more torture?</p></speech>

The issue of targeted measures for Traveller children in school and special measures is really important in terms of supports and resources across the board.  We also need Travellers as teachers.  There are some Travellers who are teachers but their number must be significantly supported to enhance the visibility of culture and how that is taught within schools.  It is important for a Traveller child to be taught in the classroom by a teacher who is a Traveller.  A significant number of measures must be put in place to ensure scholarships and supports are available across the board in terms of whatever choice of education Travellers go into.  Having more teachers who are Travellers would have a significant impact on changing some of this.</p><p>On ethnicity, it was a hard-fought battle through 30 or 40 years to achieve the recognition that came in 2017.  It was just a start.  Very little has been done since then.  There has been an overall lack of implementation of the recommendations within the existing strategies.  This issue needs to be taken in a serious and significant way by the State, which needs to ensure that the recommendations are rolled out because there is increasing disillusionment.  It was an incredibly important announcement, particularly for our young people in terms of their identity and self-esteem to which significant damage has been caused through the years.  Action is needed to deliver on the recognition and bring about the change in education and other policy areas that is needed for Travellers so that we do not continue to have these conversations in ten or 15 years.  The point made by Ms Flynn on what she wants for her daughter, Billy, in the education system is what we representatives wanted for our children because our experience in education was very negative.  The State failed us in that regard, as it has failed our children.  I want for my grandchildren what Ms Flynn wants for Billy.  I hope that they will not be damaged by the Irish education system.</p></speech>

A very small number of Travellers in relative terms do the leaving certificate.  Spaces could be opened up on every degree programme in the country and every bar or criteria such as the leaving certificate removed.  That is what happens for access programmes, through which successful applicants do an access year.  Every degree course in Trinity College must hold one or two spaces for mature students.  There is no reason there could not be targeted Traveller-specific spaces.  It is not always a matter of economics; it is often more to do with social and cultural factors and everything that has gone before.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.177" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019111200002#S00300"><p>On ethnicity, it is important to note that Travellers have various opinions on the impact of the announcement in 2017.  Some Travellers have stated that it has made things worse because it created an expectation that Travellers would be accepted and our cultural differences would be promoted and recognised.  As Ms Maria Joyce pointed out, it took us 30 years to get that announcement made.  I was actively involved in that campaign, as were many others.  It was what it was - an announcement.  No programme was put in place to explain what ethnicity is, how it is developed or why it is important for wider society as well as the Traveller community.  Particularly in counties Kildare and Kerry, Travellers who had never been involved in Traveller organisations, protests or campaigns took cases against pubs and hotels in the expectation that the announcement would give them some standing and back-up in terms of challenging the people discriminating against them.  However, it did not do so.   Rather, it did the opposite and polarised the issue to a greater extent.  More focus was put on the difference between Travellers and settled people in a negative way.  Although the announcement was welcomed by Traveller organisations, Travellers on the ground may have a very different experience in terms of what it means to them.</p> <p>  Likewise, it is important that we consider the fall-out of any actions being taken in the education system - I acknowledge that issues other than education are also being considered - and ensure that they do not further disenfranchise the Traveller community.  We should not pursue a good idea or gesture or goodwill without putting in place programmes, as well as sanctions for discriminating against Travellers, and removing any discrimination against or marginalisation of Travellers by the State.  The recognition of ethnicity meant nothing to many Travellers.</p><p>That is the unfortunate truth.</p><p> I remember talking to a woman from the S&aacute;mi community about their ethnicity being acknowledged in the 1970s and the difference it made for them.  It did not make a difference overnight; it took 25 years of programmes, state intervention and rolling back on laws that prohibited the S&aacute;mi people from living as an ethnic minority group within Sweden and other Nordic countries.  Some of the by-laws that inhibited their traditional way of life were rowed back on.  One such by-law which is very relevant to the Traveller situation prohibited reindeer herders from travelling at particular times of the year or on particular paths that were traditional to the S&aacute;mi people, all of whom were reindeer herders.  Some of those laws were rowed back, which opened up those traditional ways for the S&aacute;mi people to retain and develop their reindeer herding culture.  It is a bit premature to ask what difference the 2017 announcement made.  In 25 years' time, after ten or 20 years of positive State intervention and undoing of the damage done to Travellers by the State, we might be able to see-----</p></speech>

To assess it now is premature.</p> <p>  The biggest obstacle to third level education for many Traveller children and many people with whom we deal who are no longer children and have come through the programmes we develop is their opinion of it.  Their opinion is that it is not for them, will not lead to a job in which they will not be discriminated against and is not something they can bring back and use in their community.  Unfortunately, that is the situation.  Many members of the Traveller community who go to third level - only 1% of Travellers do so - end up getting jobs in mainstream employment where they do not identify as Travellers.  There are Travellers who are garda&iacute;, nurses, teachers or working in mainstream employment and may even encounter Travellers in their everyday life but they do not identify as Travellers in their employment situation out of fear of what that would mean in terms of discrimination and racism in that employment.  Third level education is not in the psyche of many young Travellers.</p> <p>  On the possibility of attending third level, if one is discriminated against, marginalised and receives reduced hours in school, the possibility of progression through the second level education system and into third level is nil because one does not have the same academic achievement as one's settled peers.  Academic achievement is measured by points and marks and so on.  It will not happen for many Travellers.</p> <p>  Access programmes are brilliant when they work well for people, but there is a financial burden involved in going back to education at 24 years of age.  A 24 year old member of the Travelling community is probably married with children and may have additional issues such as homelessness or a lack of access to accommodation, services or goods.  All of those factors prevent a person from taking on third level education because, as a parent, they become more important than personal achievement.  I can categorically make that statement as a person who left school at 12 years of age.  Through the years, I had opportunities to go back to education but family life took over.  That is the situation for many people.</p> <p>  The reality is that adult Travellers miss out on such opportunities because our culture is different from that of settled people.  Settled people can go back to education at 20 years of age or 40 years of age.  Many go back to education as grandparents.  The role of Travellers has changed within Irish society.  I work with Traveller children who were in the foster care system.  One of the biggest challenges with those children is to try to promote their dual identity.  Many of them are placed in care with settled people; very few are placed in their own community.  I try to educate the foster carers to look after the dual identity of Traveller children.</p><p>Many of those families are really good, but many others are settled people with their own prejudices, experiences, and racist attitudes towards Travellers.  It is important to think of third level education as a practical thing which Travellers have a real possibility of accessing, progressing in and getting some kind of employment from.  We have to think of the lived experience of Travellers when discussing such matters.  It is okay to talk about hypothetical things and what positive impacts they could have, but we have to look at and acknowledge the lived experiences of Travellers when it comes to the developments or changes that need to happen in programmes and policies.</p><p> Finally, if a new educational strategy is to be developed, it must have measured and targeted goals as well as financial resources.  This Minister and the next one must address the cuts made to the Traveller education budget, which are having a detrimental effect on our community and our young people.  Their possibilities are being limited by the State.</p></speech>

Little more than 50 or 60 years ago, we were a self-sustaining, self-sufficient people who had a purpose and co-existed.  Within the space of 50 years, we have become, and are commonly accused of being, a parasitic people on the settled, sedentary system.  Some 50 or 60 years ago we were a sustainable, self-sufficient people with our own language, culture and history.  That has all changed in a short period, due to the monocultural mindset that came from the formation of this State in 1922.  It is a monoculture which was based on extreme nationalistic ideology.  I emphasise that because it is important.  We cannot underestimate the acceptable and open racism and discrimination that has been propagated against Travellers from the top down.  An episode occurred just yesterday which I will not go into, but it is there.  It comes from extremely educated people within official Ireland.  It is the feeding ground for the right-wing racism that we are now seeing with new communities.  The Irish State and those in positions of power within it must accept that they created that culture and othered Travellers.  They set about it.  All the research showing that is there, from both Traveller organisations and other institutions.  The only way forward is for the State to take ownership of that, acknowledge it, and make reparations.  "Reparation" comes from the word "repair", meaning "to mend what was broken", which is what they have done.</p></speech>

They have been very informative.  If I take one thing away from our parliamentary work, it will be that we must hold the State to account for the implementation of its various ongoing strategies.  It can often be difficult to get a sense of how a strategy, such as the inclusion strategy for 2017-2021, is going midway through it.  We might get a sense from witnesses at committees or whoever the strategy concerns, but it can often be difficult to get a sense based on updates from the Department.  We must hold the State and the Department to account for the implementation of such strategies.</p> <p>  I acknowledge what the witnesses have said about Senator Kelleher's Bill and the Civic Engagement Group of which Senator Ruane is a member.  I and others on this committee will do everything we can to get that Bill over the line before an election is called.</p> <p>  I was not great at school, but I always said it was not a gay place to be.</p><p>I primarily learned about history and politics through Irish music and songs, many of which were saved, collected, preserved and passed on by the Traveller community, as Ms Catherine Joyce mentioned.  I have previously mentioned John Reilly from Boyle in County Roscommon, who preserved many of the songs I know and sing.  I did not learn about him through leaving certificate music.  We should be looking at specific classes and a specific learning session should be embedded.  I should have learned about John Reilly in leaving certificate music.</p><p> I do not have much more to add.  I am interested in what Mr. Nevin said about reparations.  He mentioned open honest discourse.  I am sure his community does not have much trust in the media, which often informs these discussions, to have an open and honest discourse.  They might not have much trust in this place either, though I sometimes feel we do a better job than the media.  The dinner table is a great place for discussions, but I wonder in what kind of forums those appropriate, open honest discourses should be held.  I would welcome any comments on that.  How can we undo decades of assimilation?  I again thank everyone for their contributions. </p></speech>

Parity of esteem, recognition of cultural difference, recognition of dual identity, and recognition of place in society are all set out in that document.  That has never happened for Travellers.</p> <p>  Ms Catherine Joyce made a point about the S&aacute;mi people.  Legislation specifically targeting Travellers was introduced within a seven-year period, namely, the Control of Horses Act 1996, the Casual Trading Act 1995, and the trespass legislation in 2002.  That legislation was specifically targeted at Travellers.  No other state in western Europe has introduced such a number of targeted Acts since Nazi Germany in the 1930s.  People will say I am being melodramatic, but those three Acts culturally and economically target a people.</p> <p>  Ms Maria Joyce noted that we went from a nomadic people to a homeless people in a short period of time.  We were once self-sustainable and self-sufficient.  When I say we need an open and honest discourse, I mean that it has to come from the State and the powers that be.  They are the dominant norm and the single story or narrative.  The State needs to initiate that discourse and we need to look at what happened with other communities and how they changed the conversations.  We do not have to go very far to see an example.  The difference is that there are more of the guys up North than there are Travellers on the island of Ireland, and so they had much more power to play with.  That is the reason they have parity of esteem.  That is what I am talking about.</p></speech>

The legislation that has impacted detrimentally on Travellers needs to be reversed.  Those three pieces of legislation must be looked at seriously if the State is to take the impacts on Travellers seriously.  The State needs to look at those, and at the trespass legislation in particular.  We used to be a nomadic people, but it is now essentially illegal to be nomadic in this country.  That is the truth of it.</p><p>There needs to be real investment.  We need to get away from platitudes and small amounts of funding.  We need together to look at what has happened, and this process must include Travellers and Traveller representatives on an equal footing.</p><p> The root of the word "ethnicity" is the Greek word ethnos, meaning people or nation.  I would argue, as would many Travellers like me, that we are a nation in a nation and have been since the foundation of this State, but we have never been given the resources or the investment required to enable us to play an equal part in society.  There are quite a few Travellers who would agree with me on that.  We need and deserve our place and our recognition.  I studied Irish history in college.  Unless we take this seriously and acknowledge the wrongs that have been done to Travellers, we will perpetrate the same wrongs on the new communities.  We are witnessing some of that now, which is what makes this so serious.  We need to acknowledge what has taken place in recent weeks and the potential for it to get to another level.</p></speech>

We need political will and leadership if we are to see the necessary shift or change.  While there have been some positive policy developments since the task force was set up in 1995, the delivery of services to Travellers still takes place within a very negative policy context.  We have had an assimilation approach, but through segregation, which did not benefit Travellers.  Where there is positive policy development, we need to see implementation.  In the context of what Patrick was talking about, three specific pieces of legislation were introduced which had an adverse effect on Travellers.  The trespass legislation that was introduced, for example, has never been used against anybody but Travellers.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the need to hold others to account for their failure to implement policies.  Accountability in the context of Travellers and the implementation of positive policy developments has been in very short supply.  We need to see accountability.  Where Departments or State agencies have failed to deliver on key policies in areas like the environment or roads, responsibility has been taken from them.  Local authorities have been stripped of their responsibilities in a number of areas because they were not delivering, but that has not happened in the context of Traveller accommodation.  Not only have they failed to deliver, they have made the situation far worse in some areas.</p> <p>  Earlier we discussed third level education and the fact that adult Travellers cannot see themselves in third level education, but there is an onus on the State to address that.  There are examples of third level institutions that have put measures in place to improve access for Travellers and to increase their participation.  Some of these measures enable Travellers to enter third level as mature students, particularly Traveller women.  While participation levels are nowhere near where they need to be, those third level institutions that have introduced specific Traveller related measures have had more success than others.  Such measures need to be mirrored and captured.  I would argue that it is the responsibility of third level institutions to play their part.  The Higher Education Authority, for example, has an equality section and a gender section but the last two or three key strategic reports published by the authority did not mention Traveller women.  In that context, what is needed is both institutional and systemic change.</p></speech>

We are simply looking for equal access to opportunity.  Our community has craved equality for many years and we deserve it.</p><p>Young Travellers who use social media see racist comments being made about them by those who are better off.  That has a negative effect on them.  It makes them feel inferior and lowers their self esteem.  The Traveller community is not looking for special treatment.  Travellers have always valued education.  I want this committee to understand that it is not the case that Travellers do not value education.  What we want is to be able to get through the education system and feel that we belong.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-12a.197" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019111200002#X00200"><p>This committee is our voice.  We do not have the political voice that is needed to represent the issues affecting our community.  The committee members here and those members of other committees that examine Traveller issues are our voice.  We are relying on them to project the needs of our community in a positive way and to show the consequences of policy decisions in terms of how they affect our community.  When I think of policies, I think of the amount of work that Traveller organisations put into working with the State but we are unequal partners in that relationship.  At the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees and other national fora, we are giving information and providing whatever expertise we have but we are not equal partners at the table.  It is important that the members of this committee understand that.  Unfortunately, any individual in the settled community who has championed our cause at a political level has not been re-elected.  In that context, we are not asking individual committee members to stick their heads above the parapet but, as a collective, they have great strength.  The committee is able to look at these issues and at the State's responsibility to the Traveller community.  Members must take this on from the point of view of the parents and children who suffer at the hands of educators in this country.  I always look at my own children now when considering these situations.  I never used to do that because I was never one for telling personal stories.  However, since becoming a grandmother, I have realised that this is where it is at - the nuts and bolts of it.  When one looks at the treatment of one's children and grandchildren, one sees how much wrong is being done to them as individuals.  They are members of this society but they do not get treated as such.  Traveller children like my children and grandchildren have become the educators of the teachers in schools and of their peers.  They have become the educators by default because the State has not done its duty.  My children are answering questions that no child should ever have to answer.  They are taking on their shoulders the responsibility for and the weight of the entire Traveller community and the wrongs within it.  There are some wrongs in our community that we need to tackle internally.  We have to challenge some of the stuff that goes on in terms of racism, sexism and the racist views of some Travellers towards other communities.  At the end of the day, however, victims are not to blame for State persecution.  Unfortunately, in the areas of education and homelessness, it is the policies of the State that have negatively affected us and it is that negative impact that we are trying to undo.</p></speech>

I have had many conversations with Patrick in particular but have learned a huge amount from every person in the Traveller community who has been a part of my life since I was a child.  When I listen to the speakers here today, I realise that the onus should never have been on the Traveller community to be a part of my learning or understanding.  That is a huge amount of responsibility for anyone to have to carry.  No child should sit in a classroom and be made to feel that he or she has to find ways to justify his or her identity, community, heritage, family or peers.</p> <p>  We cannot finish this session without acknowledging the discourse that happened on Twitter over the last few days and that happens more generally and constantly on social media.</p><p>It is hard to have to be an observer and watch those conversations go back and forth between people who think or assume they know and start to speak for the Travelling community or think they are advocating for it when sometimes the advocates are in there taking up the space.  We can say or I can say that I care about Travellers' progress in education but sometimes the advocates need to move over too.  It is really only representative if people represent themselves here or in the educational system.  Our job is only done when we are not needed any more.  I hope that we and this committee can continue to get to a point where we facilitate not just consultation but equal partnership.</p><p> Mr. Nevin and Ms Joyce have raised questions about laws that exist that need to be amended or rolled back that have been part of that assimilation and the culture around horses etc.  My passion for horses as a child came from the Travelling community.  We would not have had so much access to animals in Tallaght if it was not for our Traveller friends teaching us how to ride horses up and down the Kiltipper Hill.  That was an important part of my childhood.  We have stood in the way of some of those natural cultural practices in the Travelling community and as a committee we need to seek a review of all that legislation.  That is very important. </p><p> I thank all the witnesses for everything that they have brought to this discussion. </p></speech>
