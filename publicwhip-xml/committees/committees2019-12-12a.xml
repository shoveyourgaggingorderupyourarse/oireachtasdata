    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#B00200"><p>We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  No apologies have been received.  I propose that we hold over the minutes of the meeting last week to our next meeting.  We will deal with anything related at that point.</p> <p>  There is one item I wish to bring up relating to last week's meeting.  I will bring it up at this stage.  It relates to the national paediatric hospital.  As part of our meeting we circulate to all members follow-up items relating to the session.  It is not formally part of the minutes but it is a follow-up note for members.  I want three other items put onto the list from last week's meeting.  We did not get to clarify everything we had intended on the day because of time and everything else.</p> <p>  The first thing is the big issue relating to the design and extras.  I want to write to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board seeking confirmation that the design works are now fully completed, all design work drawings have been given to the builder, and there is no ongoing design work at this stage.  If there is, then by definition it could lead to extras.  We want to know the position of the paediatric board in respect of managing the builder and all obligations.  The builder is on the site building phase 2 at this stage.  I want absolute confirmation that the builder has completed all works and that, a year and a half into the project, it has completed the design of the hospital.  If it is not completed at this stage, no one can talk about the estimated future cost.  Have all drawings and estimates been given to the builder?</p> <p>  We got the report with the figure of &euro;1.433 billion last January or thereabouts.  That was the figure at that stage.  We want a summary of any changes to the design that have been made since that date.  Have all changes been agreed with the builder as feasible?  We want an estimate of any design work that was completed since we got the final gross price of &euro;1.433 billion.  That is reasonable.  We need to know whether the builder is free to build it out or whether is he waiting every month for new designs and different aspects.  That matter has to be clarified.</p> <p>  The second matter I wish to clarify is whether there is a confidentiality agreement in the contract.  We hear about commercial confidentiality every time we raise an issue.  This matter has come up.  Is the board bound by any confidentiality agreement?  If so, what are the constraints to what it can say?  We had quite a discussion at this committee on certain aspects, including inflation.  It dawned on me that perhaps there is a confidentiality agreement and there may be limits on what the board can tell us or otherwise.  I would be concerned if the largest capital project in the country has a confidentiality agreement and the contract is completed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#B00400"><p>Yes, we should clarify it.  I agree.  The board mentioned the claims that are put in every month.  I gather there is a monthly system.  Is that in line with the contract?  We mentioned the windows.  I think ten or 12 are in now.  Will there be a claim for the windows?  I am using that as an example since it is the most visible aspect of the building.  What if something comes up relating to claims for windows?  I am using that example because it is obvious.  I am sure it will take months to complete all the windows and fenestration of the building.  Is a claim put in every month for the windows being put in?  Is that part of the contract?  Should there be a claim for the thing <i>in toto</i>?  We want to get a feel for how the process is running.  I am sorry that they are small points but they are issues that I had meant to mention the previous day.  We will include that on the list of items for the paediatric hospital board.</p></speech>

Does the Chairman remember the itemised list we had?  I am keen that we get it because while the overall figure may well stay the same, there may be movement within it.  It is important that we keep an eye on that.</p></speech>

We have the list of a dozen points.  It might well be on the list.  If it is not, we will add it to the list.  It is such a big project.  Those are the few items that dawned on me as the meeting came to an end.  We did not formally put them on the note completely.</p> <p>  We are on to correspondence.  The first category is the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting with Pobal.  We have correspondence items 2616 A and 2630 A.  We will note and publish these and discuss them with Pobal shortly.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  I will say at this stage for people watching that comprehensive correspondence is sent to us by various Departments.  We will move through it as promptly as possible.  Some of it is significant and merits discussion.</p> <p>  The first item is 2592 B from Mr. Ray Mitchell.  We discussed it here the last day.  It relates to the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Cuisle holiday resort.  We never published it but we will formally publish it as we discussed it the last day.</p> <p>  The next item is 2598 B from Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary, Department of Education and Skills, dated 29 November.  It relates to our request for the Department's position on the Minister appointing an investigator under the relevant legislation to examine matters in the Comptroller and Auditor General Special Report No. 104.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#B00900"><p>I wish to take a couple of minutes on this because it is an important issue that we have followed over the course of approximately two years.  I was speechless when I read the letter and I want to make a number of recommendations.</p> <p>  I will give some context to the letter.  We had a report or examination of the commercialisation of intellectual property from 2009 to 2011 carried out by Peter McLoone on behalf of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  We know that it is an unpublished report.  The Attorney General has said that the HEA had operated outside its remit and for that reason the report could not be published.  I understand more than 50 people contributed to the process, including whistleblowers who had concerns about the process and, to be fair, others who had an alternative view.  Having said that, there was a report but it was not published.</p> <p>  We had asked the Department to use its powers.  A Minister could appoint an examiner or investigator and the examiner could look at the functions of the board and the governance, oversight and management of potential conflicts of interest between 2009 and 2011, including Aceno mobile technologies.  That would have been covered under the examination.  It looks like the Minister had signed off on it and procurement was put in place to allow it to happen.  This needs to happen to ensure that we follow this process through fairly for all of those who have come forward and made submissions for the previous report.</p> <p>  Bizarrely, the Department is saying that it met the board of Waterford Institute of Technology on 24 October.  The board informed the Department that it is carrying out its own external expert review looking at "governance procedures currently in place".  These are two completely different issues.  Whatever is currently in place is great.  We know there have been improvements in some areas since the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Accounting Officer accepted many of the recommendations and points in the report.  We know improvements have been made in governance of this area since these issues first came to light.</p><p>An external examination by Waterford Institute of Technology of current arrangements is not the issue here.  While that will be of value, it does not in any way supersede, and should not interfere with, the process that looks back at 2009 and 2011.  They are two entirely separate processes.  I do not see any overlap whatever here.</p><p> I will put a question to the Comptroller and Auditor General, although I will not ask him to comment on the response of the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has experience of producing reports.  Does he see an overlap between the two examinations that will now be done?  In other words, if the board is appointing an external contractor to examine current procedures and the Department had an examination done of a different time period, is that an overlap?  Would there be a difficulty in conducting the two processes at the same time?  Are the two examinations doing two different things?  Would the Department's review, as set out here, do something entirely different from what the external contractor appointed by the board of Waterford Institute of Technology is doing, namely, examining contemporary issues and what is in play at the moment?  Are they two separate processes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#C00200"><p>I suppose the key risk that I would see in a situation like this where the same subjects are being looked at but in different time periods is that one would have different standards and different criteria being applied.  However, that is then a debate about what is the appropriate set of criteria to examine.  Looking at a process that is currently in place and a process that applied a decade ago, it should be capable of being managed in a way that there would not be an unmanageable overlap.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#C00300"><p>That is how we should proceed.  Other members of the committee may take a different view but I utterly reject the content of the letter and the proposal made by the Department.  It is not acceptable.  I would also go a bit further than the Comptroller and Auditor General because the two processes are entirely different.  A review of what is happening now will not examine anything that happened in 2009 and 2011.  The review is looking at what procedures are in place now to oversee potential conflicts of interest when intellectual property is commercialised in the here and now, as opposed to what happened in 2009 and 2011, which is entirely different.  That was the basis of the McLoone report, which was never published.  We cannot throw whistleblowers under the bus, which is what the Department would be doing here.</p> <p>  The Department's letter also states that, following the Waterford Institute of Technology external review of what is currently in place, "a decision will be made as to whether it is necessary to re-engage with the HEA".  Of course, that is necessary because two different issues are being examined.  This is a case of kicking the can down the road and conflating issues.  It is completely and utterly wrong and it is doing an injustice to all of those who have come forward.</p> <p>  The president of Waterford Institute of Technology has asserted a number of times that much of the commentary in this committee in respect of WIT is unfair.  I have rejected that view in the past.  I want to be fair to everybody concerned, namely, Waterford Institute of Technology, those who were in place in the research bodies in 2009 and 2011 and those who came forward.  The only way to do that is to have a proper independent process appointed by the Minister in which there is a proper examination of the issues.  Whatever that report says, it says.  All we are interested in are the facts of what happened at that time.  That is fair to everybody.</p> <p>  We need to tell the Department there is no overlap and the Minister's recommendation on this review should proceed forthwith.  If the Department is not agreeable to that, we should ask Mr. Beausang, who is acting on behalf of the Secretary General who had to recuse himself from dealing with this issue due to a conflict of interest, to appear before the committee in January, if necessary.  We will see what his response is but I put Mr. Beausang on notice that I am not happy with the response the committee has received.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#C00400"><p>I support Deputy Cullinane's position.  I would not be as <i>au fait</i>with the minutiae as the Deputy but I followed this case when representatives of Waterford Institute of Technology, including its president, appeared before the committee.  I had concerns at that time about intellectual property rights and spin-out companies.  I know now that there are also spin-in companies.  There were issues with the college itself and then bigger issues that we need to look at in the future.</p><p>The third paragraph on page 3 of the letter states that the Minister for Education and Skills recently approved a recommendation for a review.  He made that recommendation with the usual caution that there should not be any comment on the actions of any individuals.  However, a sensible decision was made that &quot;a review should be carried out of the performance of the Governing Body of WIT of its functions concerning the governance, oversight and management of potential conflicts of interest arising in relation to commercialisation activities of TSSG in WIT between 2009 and 2011&quot;.  That is a sensible, practical decision referring to a specific period of time and looking at governance issues.  The letter goes on to state that the terms of the review had been finalised and the Department had initiated a procurement process for a reviewer.  This is followed by the caution.  However, the next paragraph bears no connection with that paragraph.  It starts with the word &quot;Finally&quot;, which just does not make sense here.  The Minister makes a decision, sets the terms of references, decides the period of time and then the next paragraph states, &quot;Finally, the Department met with representatives of the GB of WIT on 24th October&quot;.  It goes on to advise that the Chair told the Department of Education and Skills that the board was doing its current review now.  Suddenly, the Department rolls over and says that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#C00500"><p>However, there is no review of that period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#C00600"><p>I understand that.  The review is of the current position.  The use of the word "Finally" at that point is disingenuous and wrong and does not mean anything.  A follow-on paragraph should have been included explaining that when the Department met the governance board of Waterford Institute of Technology, it decided to give in or that the board's arguments were stronger.  It should have given some reason for the Department deciding to give up with regard to its decision to have an independent review.  This does not make sense.  I doubt the Chairman has ever seen a letter like that.  I certainly have not seen one, certainly not with regard to the two paragraphs I have cited which have no connection with each other.</p> <p>  This has serious implications for the committee in terms of when issues emerge or members have concerns.  We took a moderate approach and we did not go overboard.  We raised concerns and tried not to personalise the issue.  The provocation was not on our part.  We could have ended up personalising the issue but we resisted that temptation and tried to stay with the issues.  This has serious implications beyond this issue.  It also has serious implications for intellectual property rights generally and how the universities and third level institutions are dealing with them and what the State is getting back.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputies Cullinane and Connolly.  What is clear is the long saga of these so-called spin-out companies-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#C00900"><p>We are informed there is no legal definition of a spin-out company but they have characteristics which help to identify them.  These issues occurred in Waterford Institute of Technology between 2009 and 2011.  Deputy Cullinane outlined the history of the reports that were to be carried out and that have not been completed for legal reasons.  The Higher Education Authority did not have the authority to do so.  It is clear, however, that the Department had agreed to examine these matters.  According to the letter, the terms of reference for the review had been finalised and the Department had initiated the relevant procurement process to appoint a reviewer.  Therefore, the Department had committed money to this process by commencing the procurement process.  It was well down the road of doing this.  It had decided to do it and had commenced the process of appointing the reviewer.  That report will be in relation to 2020.  The board is conducting a review, which is fine and good.  We welcome that and the board should do that because it should be happy with the current arrangements.  However, that has no relevance to what happened in 2009 and 2011.  I do not accept the statement in the letter regarding a "clear potential for overlap".  I cannot see for the life of me the overlap between something that happened in 2010 and something that might happen this year or next year.  If there is potential for overlap between two different groups looking at a particular topic, they should be able to manage any conflict or overlap.</p><p>If the Department is saying it is not capable of managing an overlap, I would be very worried about it.  We have the Accounting Officer from the Department of Education and Skills in this committee to ensure there is governance right down the system in terms of the &euro;1.7 billion spent on third level education.  It went down a road to do this review and, as has been said, it capitulated to the board of Waterford Institute of Technology.  We will note and publish this letter but we are sending a copy of it back to Mr. Beausang stating that the view of this committee is that they are to complete the road they had gone down in commencing procurement and that we will hold the Department to account if it walks away from the process it stated it was necessary to do without an adequate explanation.  We will ask Mr. Beausang to have a letter confirming that the Department will reconsider the matter in light of this discussion, that both reviews can proceed and that any conflict or overlap will be managed.  We want to have that letter for our next meeting in January and if we do not, we will discuss the letter we receive from him at that stage and invite him back in if the Committee of Public Accounts is not satisfied with the response.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

The problem is that this is a repeated failure among many of the colleges.  It struck us in this committee that in many ways we were doing the work the Department of Education and Skills should have been doing.  Permanent oversight, rather than an individual reviewer, is required.  Otherwise, this committee will continue to repeat the same piece of work.  It is clear that there is conflict between the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department of Education and Skills in terms of remit.  If the Department does not want to do it, it should give the HEA the authority and broaden its powers because there is a process failure here.</p></speech>

I think we have dealt with that and it is clear where we are going on it in January.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 2599 from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, referenced 29 November, relating to information requested by our committee.  There are three issues dealt with, one of which is the review recommendations in respect of a report that was carried out some years ago.  There is a comprehensive report and the actions taken in respect of that previous report.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  On another item of interest, we asked about the number of material contraventions of local development plans that arose as a result of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision.  They state, which is interesting because it means the Committee of Public Accounts is doing its work, that they do not have any statistical information on this and that they are now making arrangements for statistical recording of planning decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la which materially contravene the relevant planning authority development plan.  They state: "This protocol is being developed with a view to implementation in relation to Board decisions made on or after the 1st of January, 2020 with a view to having a complete data set on this for 2020 which would be included in the Annual Report ...".  They are now commencing the process for the first time ever to gather this information.  We felt it should have been a basic function but at least they are now doing it now as a result of the matter being raised here.</p> <p>  The other item in that letter is the integrity of the appeals issue where a Deputy commented in the previous meeting on a particular planning matter.  Some of the objections were not from people whose names were on the letter.  They were fake objections that resulted in an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  They say that they take the person's name in good faith.  They ask the applicant to comment on the objections.  Essentially, they are putting the onus on the applicant to verify the identity of the objectors to determine if they are bona fide people.  If they are satisfied as a result of that process, they have the statutory authority to dismiss or otherwise determining such appeals but they are saying there has been only a very small number of such incidents over the years.  I believe there is a weakness in the system in that regard.</p></speech>

They state that they have clarified that the board is satisfied that the existing statutory provisions enable it to address these issues and so on.  They further state: "In addition, it is the experience of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that doubts over the identity and/or the existence of named appellants have arisen only in a very small number of appeals over the years."  It is important that An Bord Plean&aacute;la clarifies that because there is a certain narrative and we will hear more of that narrative when the planning and development Bill comes before us in January and February relating to serial objectors.  It is not my experience on the ground.  I believe it is time we began to have discussions around planning based on evidence and facts.  That is a beginning in terms of it.</p></speech>

We may be getting only a partial look at material contraventions.  They do not have to be in compliance with local area plans or county development plans.  For example, the national planning framework requires phasing in particular locations.  That can be thrown out the window with strategic housing development.  We can take it that they are non-compliant as well but they will not feature in that categorisation.</p></speech>

There are many offices and other big developments also.  We will ask them to incorporate a figure on any planning applications that went directly to the board and not through the local authority.  I am sure they would look at the development plan anyway and include those figures with this also.  That is an improvement.</p><p>The next item is correspondence 2620 from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which draws attention to a small error in document 2599 that we have just discussed.  We will note and publish both of those.  The correct version is 2620.  That is the one we will publish.</p><p><b></b>The next item is 2600B from Ms Dee Forbes, director general, RT&Eacute;, dated 29 November 2019, providing the update we requested regarding the implementation of the Eversheds Sutherland review on the use of freelancers-contractors.

The whole point is they were never freelance or contract staff in their eyes or should not have been.  As a number of them have now been offered contracts, it was a vindication of the issues we raised.  </p><p> To outline the difficulty, a number of staff who have contacted me have been offered what they would describe as very low grades.  For example, without naming names, somebody might have been on a contract for seven or eight years.  When RT&Eacute; considered what grade and contract to allocate a person, its terms of reference stipulated they would only look at the years of 2017 and 2018 and yet some of these people were on contracts as long ago as 2012 to 2016.  Therefore, these people have been put at a disadvantage.  They believe that they have been offered grades and salaries that are simply unsustainable for them to work in Dublin.  That is the reality for many of them, about which they are very sore.  An issue has been corrected but, according to these people, it has been unfairly corrected.  Yes, these people have been put on contracts and moved away from freelance contracts they should never have been on but they have been put on low grades, which is unfortunate.</p><p> RT&Eacute; does not come under the purview of this committee, which arose when it came before us.  We can return to RT&Eacute; again and ask questions on this matter or we can ask the sectoral committee to take up this matter.  One way or the other, these staff have issues that must be dealt with by the Oireachtas.  If it is a case that we cannot do so because it falls outside of our remit and if the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the appropriate committee, we should ask it to consider this matter.</p><p> I welcome the fact that it has been acknowledged that people were on contracts they should not have been on.  That is a step forward.</p></speech>

Essentially, RT&Eacute; says that as a result of the Eversheds report, 157 individuals were highlighted as in need of further review.  They have met those people since the report was done.  They have issued contracts of employment in 81 cases, 58 of which have been accepted, 21 are expected to be accepted or rejected between now and the end of the year, and two have not been accepted to date.  The issue of backdating has not been mentioned.  We will send this matter to our colleagues, as RT&Eacute; fairly regularly appears before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate and Environment.

We will ask the secretariat to forward the matter to the other committee for its ongoing consideration.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 2603B, from John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 2 December 2019, providing information we requested after meeting him on 7 November.  He gave a very comprehensive response and I will touch on the topics.  He supplied a 42-page document that contains outstanding information.  I am saying to the public, and especially to other Accounting Officers, that this is how Accounting Officers should deal with the Committee of Public Accounts when asked questions.  Mr. McKeon was given a list of 20 follow-up questions, provided good information on the day, and answered everything that was possible on the day.  There was openness and candour from them.  We gave them a list of 20 questions and they have come back within a number of weeks with a 42-page response to each of the 20 questions.  They are to be admired for doing so.  Other Accounting Officers should follow suit because it falls into the point whereby people say that people often get a hard time at these meetings.  Witnesses who come prepared and offer information have no trouble at this committee.  Other people who do not have a level of information do not find our meetings as easy but that is our job.</p> <p>  I shall call Deputies Munster and Cullinane to speak but first I shall give people a flavour of the contents of the letter.  First, it includes information on the number of fraud cases identified in 2018, and the figures to date for 2019.  There were 32 last year and 16 to date.  </p> <p>  There is a note on outsourced training and retained courses by Turas Nua and Seetec. </p></speech>

I suggest that the Deputy marks the points that he wants to deal with because there might be more than one.</p> <p>  There is a note on the number of people participating in back to work initiatives.  They include the figures which add up to about 50,000 people, and that is on page 5.  Most of those people are on community employment, rural employment schemes, back to education allowance scheme, and T&uacute;s schemes.  Whereas there is only about 5,000 people on back to work enterprise allowance schemes, short-term enterprise allowance or the part-time job initiative.  It is good to get that information.</p> <p>  There is a profile of the debt written off.  A sum of &euro;32 million was written-off in 2010 with, I think, values of under &euro;10,000.  There is a detailed schedule there of what was written off by the Department and written off by the Social Insurance Fund - &euro;35 million.  We discussed that at the meeting and asked for a breakdown. </p> <p>  We asked about the cost-effectiveness of An Post's banking charges, and to include the difference with standard banking fees.  They say that approximately 60% of payments in 2018 were by electronic funds transfer, 40% were where the payee presents to the post office and about 1% were where cheques were issued in the post.  There is detailed information.   </p> <p>  There is a breakdown of all payments that were made by the Department that directly support families.  We were given very detailed information on that.  </p> <p>  There are details on prepayments at the year end.  </p> <p>  There is further information on the public services card, the contract and everything relating to that.  </p> <p>  There is a note on Turas Nua and Seetec.  Deputy Cullinane wants to comment on that. </p> <p>  There is a note on the number of refusals that were subsequently appealed and their decisions and they gave a complete breakdown.  The appeals office allowed approximately 32% of appeals, partially allowed 2% and made a revised decision in 21% of the cases and in about 37% of cases, the appeals were disallowed by the appeals office.  It is roughly 60% where there was some improvement for the applicant and about 40% where the decision of the Department was fully upheld.</p> <p>  There is a note on the requirements for a qualified adult allowance in the context of the State contributory scheme.  I raised this issue myself.</p> <p>  While people will find this interesting, I will not read out the note.  We asked for a breakdown of the reasons claims are rejected based on the means of the applicant and those rejected based on a lack of contributions or other reasons.  The Department gave the reasons for all of their major schemes as to whether it was means or a lack of information.  A full breakdown consisting of three pages was given and it is important that people take a look at that.  I know many people will want to read the note in detail.</p> <p>  There is a note on the review of the 94,000 cases by the Department, to include a breakdown by gender.  That refers to people who had left the workplace early.  The Department gave all of the figures and we mentioned that.</p> <p>  There is a note on the five contracts not subject to competitive procurement.  The details have been supplied.</p> <p>  I wish to highlight the note that we received on the school meals schemes, to include the number of eligible schools which did not receive a payment in the first term and an update on the operation of the scheme for 2019 and 2020.</p><p>If I read it correctly it gives the number of pupils on a county by county basis for the DEIS schools not participating in the school meals programme.  There are 3,317 children in DEIS schools which have not put in place the school meals programme.  That is dreadful.  Those children should be getting those meals.  We will ask the Department in the first instance to communicate with the chairman of the board of each of those schools to find out why the children are not getting what they are entitled to in those DEIS schools.  In Mayo, there are 408 children entitled to this scheme who are not getting it.  That is not acceptable.  Some other counties have much fewer.  The Mayo figure appears to be the highest.</p><p> The Department had a separate initiative for non-DEIS schools and there are 6,455 children eligible in schools to receive the school meals programme and those schools have not yet put that in place.  That is approximately 10,000 children entitled to the school meals programme but for some reason the schools are not providing it.  We want the Department to follow up on that and contact each of the schools because it is not fair to the children involved and we want a report on that by the end of March.  We will give them a couple of months to make progress on that but it is something people should know about.</p><p> We mentioned fraud cases earlier and in the interest of balance I always ask for the top five settlements, in this case for 2018, pertaining to the Social Insurance Fund to include the amounts recovered.  This refers to employers in respect of redundancy and insolvency payments and in one case the debt was &euro;2.882 million and the Department recovered &euro;2.871 million.  There are other cases for &euro;252,000, &euro;258,000, &euro;313,000, and another employer owed &euro;1.069 million but the Department recovered only &euro;227,000.  A lot of money has to be recovered from employers as well as individual claimants.  We want always to maintain the balance.  It also gives a detailed breakdown of the customer debt where the figures were less than &euro;10,000 and which were written off.  Some go back to 1984, a long time ago. </p><p> There are other items in respect of the back to education allowance and exceptional needs in the housing support which will be relevant to the housing topic.  There is also a detailed note on the free travel scheme, the travel pass and the integrated ticketing system. I am just highlighting points.  There are 42 pages which I ask people with an interest to study.  I have only touched on the topics. </p></speech>

Could failure of the person to show up for the process be considered fraud?  In some cases people might have got a job before the appointment date.  The facial matching process detected 220 cases of suspected fraud over six years.  That equates to 0.004% of the overall social welfare budget of &euro;20 billion.  I seem to recall in the hoo-ha about the public services card at the time it was announced the Minister said it would stamp out fraud.  That seems a minuscule percentage.  We recall the billboard campaign that almost demonised people who were unemployed as welfare cheats.  Do we know how much was spent on that campaign?  Was it more than we got back from the facial recognition fraud detection?</p></speech>

I had asked questions about whether people were referred more than once, in fact twice, three or, in some cases, four times.  I am not saying the Accounting Officer misled us but he was of the view at that meeting that referrals for a third time were very unlikely and I think he used the words almost impossible for a fourth time.  I furnished this committee with a response to a parliamentary question from the Minister which showed that there were people referred for a fourth time, and a substantial number for a third time.  We asked the clerk to get that information.  Is that breakdown in this submission or did it give just the overall amount?  We need to go under the bonnet on this.</p></speech>

We all know that job activation schemes are important but it is &euro;200 million.  That is a lot of money.  If people are being referred a second, third and fourth time it seems there is something wrong.  Every time somebody is referred the payment is made.  That is how the companies get paid so there is an advantage to the companies to have people referred more than once.  These are private companies making an exceptional amount of money from the taxpayer.  I am not saying they are doing anything wrong.  I would be looking for a much more detailed breakdown of that &euro;206 million.</p></speech>

The document says there are a small number of jobseekers - eight in total - for whom the Department has paid a fourth engagement fee.  Eight people have been paid the fourth engagement fee.  That figure is at the end of page 16.</p></speech>

It is not so much the fourth referral, because the fourth in itself is extraordinary.  I suppose to have only eight would be correct, although there should not be any.  Anyway, thousands were in the third category and more again in the second referral category.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#G00300"><p>I want to pick up on the same table because it jumps out at us.  I would have thought there was correlation between the unemployment rate and the number of people going through the schemes.  In 2016, when there was a higher rate of unemployment, the cost was &euro;25 million.  The unemployment rate began to fall after that.  In 2017, the scheme cost &euro;57 million.  The unemployment rate fell again in 2018 but the cost was &euro;71 million.  To the end of October, the figure is &euro;51 million.  It strikes me that there is no relationship between the falling unemployment rate and the amount these companies are getting.</p> <p>  This means there is a smaller cohort of people and there has to be multiple referrals.  That matches our experience.  It corresponds with what people are telling us.  For example, a person may do a year on a T&uacute;s scheme, then come back in and be referred again.  Then the person goes to sit at a computer and looks at something she could examine at home and there is little intervention.  That is what people are telling us.  I guess other things can be said on another side but that is certainly what we are routinely being told.  There is something out of synchronisation with the unemployment rate and the transfer of funds when we drill down into it.  We should match it against the unemployment rate in each of those years.</p> <p>  Another issue is cropping up with the appeals or outcomes of appeals.  This is why it is useful to get these tables.  Let us consider page 19.  There are two areas where I expect the figures to be high.  We have live examples by virtue of the fact that we are assisting people when they come to our constituency offices.  The domiciliary care payment and the invalidity pension are the two I would examine first.  Where the number of reversals of decisions on appeal is high, we have to ask whether the job is being done correctly in the first place or whether there is a waste of money on administration.  I tell people applying for the domiciliary care payment that if they get it first time the should treat it as a bonus, but that they should expect to have to appeal it.  That has been the experience.  This is borne out by the figure of 47% allowed under appeal.</p> <p>  For invalidity pension, a person has to be presumed to be ill for at least a year into the future to be considered.  A medic puts that in a letter but it is rejected.  Then we see 36% get it on appeal.  It may well be that the applicant is not giving enough information, but if that is the case, then the Department needs to up its game in terms of the information sought to make a decision on an application.  These schemes require a high level of administration.  This imposes a cost on the Department.  There is a value for money issue apart from the fact that community welfare officers have to discharge a separate function while something is being decided under appeal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#G00400"><p>In some of these cases, like those referred to by Deputy Murphy, the applicant has gathered more information for the appeal.  Perhaps certain information was unavailable to the Department in the first place.  I always tell people that if they are going for an appeal, they have to have new information to justify a reversal of the decision.  However, that should be done early in the process rather than people having to go through the Department, go for review and then get a file under freedom of information provisions.  I always tell people anytime they get a refusal to put in a freedom of information request.  This allows us to see the reason an application has been refused before appealing it.  We need to know what the Department is thinking.</p> <p>  It takes several months to get all of that.  There is nothing in the document about how long people are waiting.  They could be waiting 12 months in some of these cases.  That is a big issue as well in terms of how long the process takes.  The Deputy's comments are totally correct.  If the Department had a better way of getting information earlier, it might obviate the need for so many appeals having in the first place.</p></speech>

I echo the Chairman's comments on the detail given.  I thank the Department for giving us all the details.  Page 4 relates to Seetec and Turas Nua.  There were 500,000 referrals to educational and training interventions as advised by both contractors.  The document goes on to say what these are.  Predominately, they relate to internal courses delivered about interview skills and CV preparation.  However, of this figure, some 31,201 programmes were delivered by providers external to JobPath contractors.  There is a breakdown for the two companies, Turas Nua and Seetec.  It seems 31,201 programmes were delivered by providers external to JobPath.  I am unsure why that is necessary.  Is more intensive or specialist training required?  Is that an additional sum?</p></speech>

Whether a person is referred back to the local ETB for a course or goes to a programme that is delivered and paid for by the contractor I do not know, so we need clarification on that point.  It is in paragraph 2 on page 4.  We will move on.  We note that.  There is good information.  The Department is to be complimented on responding comprehensively to all our questions on the day.</p> <p>  No. 2606 B is from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president, University College Cork, dated 2 December 2019, providing the information regarding non-compliant procurement.  We note this and hold it over as part of our work programme for early next year.</p> <p>  No. 2613 B is from Ms Angela Denning, chief executive, Courts Service, dated 4 December, providing follow-up information requested by our meeting on 14 November.  The correspondence includes the cost of the development of the Hammond Lane.  There is detailed information.  There is a reference to temporary use of the site.</p> <p>  Reference is made to the number of people convicted of being in possession of drugs with a minimum value of more than &euro;13,000.  Most people thought there was to be a ten-year mandatory prison sentence or a certain minimum sentence for those caught over that value or a certain number of sentences.  The document gives the breakdown of the 142 people convicted in this category in 2018.  A total of 39 got over five years and four got over ten years while 61 got over three years.  It makes the point that of the 142 persons some 98 of those convicted had part of their suspended by the court.  That is a matter for the judges but often parts of sentences are suspended.  People have asked about the length of sentences.  Sometimes the prison term is part of it and the suspended sentence is part of it too.</p> <p>  We asked about the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act.  A chart is highlighted in the document and the Courts Service gives us the figures.  The document states the number of fines where the due date has passed as a percentage of the total number of fines imposed in the period before the commencement of the Act was 17%.  After the Act was brought in, the figure jumped to 46%.  The value of those payments was 20% before the commencement of the Act.  This relates to the where the fines were paid where the due date has passed.  The figure is now 50%.  The Courts Service is saying that the data suggests more people are waiting longer to address the fine imposed than was the case under the old regime.  The document makes the point that the new regime is not speeding up the collection of fines.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2614B is from Ms Anne Marie Walshe, tax division, Department of Finance, providing a note on the VAT rate of food supplements.  This was raised at our meeting and the matter was clarified by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  There is a note for the public accounts.  The figure is now 13.5% confirmed as part of the Finance Act.</p></speech>

I know that a new system is being put in place, but the longer that takes to put in place the more this will have to be unpicked.  One of the questions I am fairly sure I asked was what the process would be.  As for moving people to the new system, would they initially be the people who would present before the court or would they be people involved in the hard cases that already exist?  It was not very clear.  A parliamentary question might be a way of getting that information, but-----</p></speech>

I asked it on that day and I welcome the fact that the Courts Service has given us the information.  I had since got it in any event by means of a parliamentary question.  It is unacceptable, though.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed by the D&aacute;il in 2015, and here we are four years later and there is absolutely no certainty as far as anyone can see.  Regarding the process of making someone a ward of court, which is really the end result, it is all unnecessary.  The whole purpose of the Act was to stop that.  One can see that the figures have risen but with a little dip, I think.  A process is going ahead that we decided, or the previous D&aacute;il decided, was unacceptable after a very long campaign and people suffering and bringing it to the House's attention.  The previous D&aacute;il finally did the right thing back in 2015.  The current D&aacute;il is going to fall, however, and we will still have not implemented that.  This matter has also arisen at meetings of the justice committee as well.</p></speech>

We will write to it directly as well.</p> <p>  No. 2614B is correspondence from the Department of Finance confirming the VAT rate for food supplements.  There was quite a discussion on this, but the Finance Bill makes it 13.5%.  We know that.</p> <p>  No. 2615B, from Mr. Gerard Dollard, CEO of the Irish Greyhound Board, is correspondence responding to a query regarding tenders for care centres.  Mr. Dollard also advises that the Indecon report is completed and that he expects it to be published shortly.  He will arrange for copies to be sent to members.  There is a note on this and we will note and publish it.</p> <p>  No. 2619B is correspondence from NAMA and is dated 4 December 2019.  It provides the information we requested on non-compliant procurement.  There is a lot of it now that we are following it.  That is all I can say.</p> <p>  No. 2625B, from Mr. Cathal Marley, chairperson and CEO of Irish Water and Ervia, is correspondence providing information requested by the committee on global valuation apportionment together with the latest estimates of the local authority multipliers and estimates of the rates payable to each local authority for 2020.  We will note and publish that.  People can see the figures.  This ties in with the previous item.</p></speech>

Some counties have done well out of this and some have been left bereft of funding.  I tabled another parliamentary question this week to the Minister asking how this would be addressed in the long term.  The Department is working on the short-term situation, with funding streams for some of the affected counties, such as Wicklow, Waterford and so forth.  However, this goes back to the central point of the sustainability of the books in the long term.  When we raised this matter earlier in the month, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated that there was the chapter on local government.  I will look to try to touch on this again in the new year as part of our work programme if we are here long enough to look at it because I would certainly like to revisit it in a substantial way.  It is worthy of that.</p></speech>

We will note and publish this and hold it over because when we come back to the procurement issue in the new year, this is one of the seminal documents from which we will work.</p> <p>  No. 2629B is correspondence from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, dated 9 December 2019, providing information requested by the committee regarding the business case for the DART expansion programme.  The note states that previous business cases were either for the tunnel only or for the full DART extension programme inclusive of the Phoenix Park tunnel.  In line with the public spending code, a comprehensive business case must be prepared for the non-tunnel elements of the DART expansion programme.  Demographic factors have changed in recent years.  Regarding internal expertise, the note states that a multiskilled team is required for a large infrastructure project and that it is not feasible for a single organisation to retain all the required specialties over the coming period.  We will note and publish that.  We can see what has been said.</p> <p>  No. 2632B is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and provides the information we requested on the oversight and governance of Irish Water.  We will note and publish that.  It is clear.  Following our previous discussion, we wrote directly to the Department and there is the reply on the public record.  People are free to use that item and follow up on it.</p><p> The next item is 2634 B from Ms Anne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority, NTA, dated 9 December 2019, providing the information we requested about the National Transport Authority's income from advertising on bus shelters.  In a nutshell, prior to this, Dublin Bus had its contractual arrangements and Bus &Eacute;ireann had its contractual arrangements.  When the NTA came in, it took over responsibility of the bus shelters from those two organisations.  It is detailed how that has worked out on page 2.  The advertising revenue in 2017 was &euro;5.4 million for the NTA, but it would have passed back &euro;4 million of that to Dublin Bus and &euro;634,000 of it to Bus &Eacute;ireann, totalling &euro;4.634 million that was passed back.  The figures are broadly similar for every year and it looks like the NTA keeps about &euro;1 million of the approximately &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million that comes from that advertising.  The NTA says it uses that for the provision of new bus shelters, the replacement of corroded bus shelters, refurbishment and other sustainable projects.  That is where the money from advertising on bus shelters goes.  We will note and publish this item.</p><p> The next item is 2635 B from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, OPW, dated 10 December 2019, providing a response on its involvement in matters related to the new Oireachtas printer.</p><p> The next item is 2636 B from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General, Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, dated 10 December 2019, providing a further report on the purchase of Oireachtas printing equipment and related matters.

We will discuss it in the afternoon at a provisional time of 3 p.m.  The voting in the D&aacute;il is scheduled for 1.50 p.m. and that will take approximately an hour so it will be 3 p.m. before we are ready to resume.  We can put people on notice that they are expected to be here for 3 p.m.  I was about to say we will note and publish this but that document has been well publicised and discussed before now.  As a formality, we will note and publish it, notwithstanding it has been well publicised before now by various people.  We will come back to those two matters at approximately 3 p.m.  We note and publish those items.</p> <p>  The next item is 2637 B from the Charities Regulator, providing information on various queries we put to it at our recent meeting.  We asked for the following information: a note on any cases involving funds that were not administered in an appropriate manner or used for the purpose for which they were intended, and there is a detailed note on that; a note on the amount of funds that went through each third level educational foundation that were registered as charities, and the figures are printed on page 4, some of which are familiar and they have been referred to in the committee previously; a breakdown of the concerns raised with the regulator, to include the State bodies involved, and there is a full list of the number of concerns received, and out of 686 cases, in 585 cases the concerned person gave a name, whereas in 101 cases the concerned person remained anonymous; a breakdown of the prepayment of &euro;410,000 for IT services and the schedule for that is on page 6; a copy of the organisational structure, which has been provided; a breakdown of the &euro;39.7 million fund being managed by Davy Asset Management, to include details of the 331 groups involved in the fund, including whether they are registered or unregistered charities, and this details the entities that have applied to be registered with the Charities Regulator and it also details the beneficiaries of the registered charities; a note on the relationship between the Charities Regulator and Davy Asset Management, which is a commercial arrangement to manage a fund on behalf of the Charities Regulator; and a point of clarification on the third level education foundations, as detailed on page 15.  We will note and publish that.  Members are free to follow up on those items in any way they choose.  There is a lot of interesting information in that correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is 2638 B from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We have already discussed this in conjunction with the large document from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection we discussed a few moments ago.  Essentially, it covers a point that had already been covered.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item is 2639 B from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing a response to the committee on the following matters: an up-to-date note on the contributions of Irish Water to the Local Government Fund; the level of funding that will be available for each local authority; details of any Government subvention that will be available; an update on the review of the baselines set for each local authority; and an information note on the arrangements in the Department for monitoring the effects of changes to global valuations on funding of local authorities.  The baseline valuation is referred to on the bottom of page 3 and going on to page 4.  The correspondence says there was a review of local property tax conducted by the Department of Finance that was submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which is considering it.  When that review is completed, the review of the baseline will be recommenced and referred to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  On the local property tax, I understand from the committee that the work is completed.</p></speech>

We have been getting the same response for almost a year.  Some of that work was complete at the beginning of this year and it is likely to have significant positive impacts for some parts of the country and it will have negative impacts.  There will be a cost associated with that transition as well.  Some of those baselines go back to 2000 and do not take any account of the growth in population in places such as Kildare, Meath, Fingal and the fringes of Cork and Galway cities.  That feeds into the matter of Ervia because some of the local authorities are functioning on fumes at this stage.</p></speech>

In the meantime, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight was examining the report on local property tax and I am advised the committee has completed its work.  We hope this baseline review will go to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The correspondence does not say that but our understanding is the committee has completed its work on the local property tax.  It was held over until the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's review of the local property tax-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#J01400"><p>I want to pick up on a point the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government referred to.  He said he read the transcript of the committee's discussion and that he interpreted that the main issue was the change in the Irish Water payments.  That completely misses the point.  In October 2018, there had been a pointed reference to the fact there had been an increase in local government funding and espousing the virtue of same.  This year, when the figure dropped by &euro;35 million, there was no reference to that whatsoever apart from one line.  I remember that stood out like a sore thumb and I followed that up in the context that this emanated from that change.  This goes to the heart of the matter, but the Secretary General's remark misses the point completely.</p> <p>  The subvention has gone off the books and it is akin to the local property tax.  When the local property tax was introduced, the requisite amount of Exchequer funding dropped by some &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million in that case as well.  The money is coming directly out of the Exchequer funding and county councils are moving towards an ideology of self-financing.  That goes to the core of the matter.  The interventions by the State are dropping and there is a focus on county councils becoming more reliant on their income strands, whether that be off the back of commercial rates, property owners or service charges.  That is the key point.  We need to drill that down into where we find the equilibrium and the balance, because to my mind there has been a rapidly decreasing intervention from the central Exchequer in recent decades and that is not allowing local government to perform to the standards it should be doing.  That is the heart of the matter and that reference from the Secretary General misses the point completely.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#K00100"><p>I suspect it is probably a political decision.  I concur with the point Deputy Cassells makes that it was really a three-card trick.  The expectation was that local property tax would be additional to the Local Government Fund.  In fact, what happened is that the local property tax was substituted for it and there was a growth in commercial rates to fill up the shortfall.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to the complexity of local government funding, which those of us who have been in local authorities know.  I do not think it is appreciated by the public, as there was an expectation that there would be some additionality.  That is part of the problem, but it is reinforced by virtue of the fact that new needs are not counted at all, and that is where the baselines come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#K00200"><p>We will note and publish that and we will ask for a timescale from the Department.  That is as much as we can do at this stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next we will deal with category C correspondence.  We will deal with No. 2595 C, dated 29 November, which is from an individual who makes some points concerning the Oireachtas printer.  Members can read that, and those matters can be discussed in the afternoon.  No. 2597 C is dated 29 November and is from an individual about the public services card.  The individual makes some corrections to previous correspondence.  We agreed to provide details of who was at the meeting when the individual's previous item was considered.  He is unhappy with the level of consideration he believes the committee gave to his correspondence.  It is important to point out that we have given the matter of the public services card considerable attention to date and we may return to it in the future.  Members are free to raise matters referred to in the individual's correspondence if they so wish.  We do not publish category C correspondence.  We have discussed the matter at length and, no doubt, we will probably come back to it again.  Is it agreed that we note this item?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2617 C is further correspondence from the individuals who call themselves B and C, dated 5 December 2019, providing a link to an item on social media regarding matters at the University of Limerick.  Is it agreed that we note this item?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2618 C is from Deputy Alan Kelly, dated 3 December 2019, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding Cork Institute of Technology.  There is a detailed list of approximately 60 specific questions to which he wants replies.  I have not read the details, but I think we will have to hold over the matter because the Deputy is not here.  I understand the content, but in any event we would want the secretariat to be happy with the format, wording and appropriateness of the phraseology of any letter going out from the Committee of Public Accounts, rather than from an individual Deputy.  I do not argue with the points Deputy Kelly raised but we would want a response to meet the norms of committee correspondence.  Is it agreed that we hold over this matter because Deputy Kelly is not here?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2621 C is from an individual dated 14 November 2019 with further queries regarding wards of court.  We wrote to the individual recently providing information that was requested from the Courts Service and providing a link to the transcript because some matters in relation to the wards of court were dealt with during the meeting.  We have advised the correspondent that the matter can best be dealt with elsewhere and we do not intend to pursue the matter further.  Our discussion on the wards of court today is about transitioning to the new arrangement.  As we already know, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality did publish a report on wards of court which was debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il some time ago.  Given those debates that have taken place the Committee of Public Accounts cannot revisit the matter because we are subsidiary to the D&aacute;il not above it.  Is it agreed that we note the item?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2622 C is from an individual dated 26 November 2019, who is making some points about procurement in the HSE.  The individual is advocating for the publication of award notices on foot of contracts as it could encourage SME participation in the tender process.  That is a valid point.  It probably arises from the person watching our discussion on the national children's hospital last week.  We will be returning to procurement matters in the new year. Is it agreed that we note the item?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2623 C is from an individual dated 1 December 2019, who is requesting the committee to investigate the disbursement of EU funds by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and alleges that the authority is operating a confidential payroll.  However, no details are given.  I propose that with the individual's permission, we forward the item to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as it is a transport issue, to provide a response regarding the disbursement of EU funds.  The IAA is a wholly-owned commercial semi-State company.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is the main shareholder in the company.  We will progress the matter once the person gives consent to forward the letter, because that is the era we are in now.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2624 C is from an individual dated 4 December 2019, who is making some points regarding the procurement of chaplaincy services in the third level sector.  The individual alleges that a number of institutions are not compliant with procurement rules when it comes to chaplaincy contracts.  With the individual's permission, I propose we forward the item to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, for a response.  We have to go back and get permission to forward the person's details to the HEA for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The first one is from the Health Research Board, which got a clear audit opinion except for the normal reference by the Comptroller and Auditor General that the cost of superannuation entitlements are accounted for as they become payable rather than in the year entitlements are earned, which is standard in the health bodies.  The Environmental Protection Agency got a clear audit opinion for its 2018 accounts.</p> <p>  Interestingly, the next one is the regulator of the national lottery.  In 2018 it had an income of &euro;1.5 million.  The first thing that strikes me is that its accounts were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 17 June and it has taken almost six months for them to be laid before the Oireachtas.  We will write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The national lottery legislation was sponsored by the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, so it comes under the remit of that Department.  We will ask the reason for the delay.  Next, is the national lottery fund.  I presume that is the prize fund of &euro;494 million that is disbursed.  Again, the accounts were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 18 June and it has taken almost six months for them to be laid before the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I know the matter of the regulator is being discussed by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach so we will not get into any unnecessary duplication.  The only point I will make is that the National Lottery Act 2013 stated the regulator shall be appointed by the Minister on such terms and conditions, including remuneration, as the Minister may determine.  That is in section 7(2).  It also states that the accounts are to be submitted not later than four months from the year end for certification by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I take it if Mr. McCarthy had his work done by 17 June that he received the accounts in good time.</p></speech>

I believe so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#K01000"><p>It would seem reasonable that the timescale for submitting accounts has been met.  Because there is an issue in terms of how the regulator performs its functions, I think we should ask about the process involved in appointing the regulator by the Department.  We will write to the Department to ask about two issues: first, to ask the reason it took the regulator of the national lottery and the national lottery fund almost six months to lay the accounts before the Oireachtas and; second, the process of appointing the regulator.  All too often, as people have said in the past, regulators are asleep at the wheel.  I do not suggest that is the case here, but we must be satisfied as to the process for appointing the regulator and the competence of the regulator.  We can hand it over to the other committee then.  We will not be holding any hearings on it but it would be remiss of us not to ask the question given that the accounts are before us today.</p> <p>  Next, we have the accounts for the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT.  It is the cessation account for the 16-month period up to the end of December 2018.  There was a clear audit opinion.  The statement on internal control discloses non-compliant procurement.  Who is going to answer that question for us?  Has DIT merged with Dublin City University, DCU?</p></speech>

It is now the Technical University Dublin and that body has responsibility for any follow-up.  It prepared the financial statements for the three institutions that merged.</p><p>We will write to Technological University Dublin seeking full and detailed information on the non-compliant procurement of &euro;1.63 million by the then Dublin Institute of Technology.</p><p> The Dublin Dental Hospital received a clear audit opinion but a statement on internal control disclosed non-compliant procurement of &euro;677,000.  We will write to the hospital seeking a detailed analysis and breakdown of the reasons for that non-compliant public procurement.</p><p> The Trade and Business Development Body, which is a North-South body, receives a clear audit opinion.  A statement on internal control discloses that the board is at risk of being unable to meet its quorum due to board vacancies.  We will note that. </p><p> The next items relate to Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board and An Bord Bia, both of which receive a clear audit opinion.</p><p> The next item on the agenda is the work programme.  Several items are scheduled for January.  Suggestions have been made regarding work to be carried out in the new year if we are still here.  We will plan our work programme such that we are not caught when we come back in the new year.  The secretariat can make the necessary arrangements.  Deputy Cassells will be pleased to hear that our first meeting in the new year will be with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, although that is subject to confirmation.  It is scheduled for 16 January.  The next meeting will take place on 23 January and involve representatives of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  On 30 January, we will meet representatives of the Department of Education and Skills regarding its appropriation account, Vote 26, chapter 7 - purchase of sites for school provision and special report No. 107 on the delivery of capital projects in the higher education sector.  The committee has not yet examined the latter report.  We agreed at our most recent meeting that we would have the Office of Public Works, OPW, in on 6 February to deal with chapter 6 - expenditure under a maintenance contract.  It has been suggested that we meet the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as well as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I do not think we have had representatives of TII before the committee recently.  There are plenty of suggestions for meetings up to February, although the secretariat may have some work to do regarding some of the suggestions.</p></speech>

We can move ahead with some of the other suggestions in order to have a work programme and if events happen, so be it.</p> <p>  On any other business, there are two issues I wish to highlight as Chairman.  Members saw the volume of replies with which we dealt today.  I ask the secretariat to ensure that any outstanding departmental replies to requests for information since we returned after the summer recess be obtained for our first meeting in the new year.  It has several weeks to do that.  Many replies have been received.  I am not suggesting there is a problem, but I wish to ensure we receive all replies.</p> <p>  I do not recall whether we received a response from the Minister regarding the periodic report previous to the one we issued a fortnight ago.  I ask the secretariat to check whether we received such a reply.  There might be a reply outstanding.  We do not yet expect a response to our most recent report.  If an earlier one is missing, I ask the secretariat to ensure it is obtained before we resume in the new year.</p></speech>

The clerk to the committee is preparing a breakdown of costs involved.  As the committee will not meet again until January and the trip may take place in February, approval by email may be required in order to enable travel arrangements to be made as early as possible.  Is it agreed that the secretariat will circulate the breakdown of costs to members and seek agreement thereto such that arrangements can be put in place?  I make that proposal on the basis that the committee will have an opportunity at its meeting in January to confirm the specific details on the public record prior to the trip in February.  It will allow travel arrangements be put in place during the recess such that there are no hiccups.  That is agreed.</p></speech>

I propose that the secretariat work on producing a periodic report to cover the period up to the end of today's meeting.  It should be launched early next year.  We should set out a reasonable timetable.  The committee will not produce a periodic report for January or February if an election is called before St. Patrick's Day.  I suggest that if an election is not called before then, we aim to issue our next periodic report in mid-March.  It might not be ready before St. Patrick's Day but it would be ready soon thereafter.  If there is an election, so be it.  If there is no election, we will be ready to launch a report as soon as possible after St. Patrick's Day.  I acknowledge I am putting pressure on the secretariat but a fundamental part of our work is to follow up on our public meetings and correspondence.  There is a couple of months in which to produce the report.  We will agree to that general timetable.</p></speech>

We are joined this morning by Ms Anna Shakespeare, chief executive officer.  She is new to the position having joined in August.  You are very welcome to your first meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Ms Shakespeare is joined by Mr. Jerry Murphy, deputy chief executive, and Mr. Brian Lehane, chief financial officer.  They are also joined by Richard Deane and Gerard Sellars.  We are also joined by Mr. Paul Geraghty, principal officer, Department of Rural and Community Development, and Mr. Gordon Gaffney, principal officer, Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>I wish to advise members, witnesses and everyone in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off in their entirety or put in airplane mode, as merely setting them to silent mode can still cause interference with the recording system.  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.</p><p>If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that they shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  We will begin by inviting Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Pobal is a State-owned not-for-profit company limited by guarantee.  The company was originally established in 1992 by agreement with the European Commission to manage an EU grant scheme to support local development.  Over time, the functions of Pobal have expanded significantly.  It now functions as an agent for a number of Government Departments and EU bodies providing administration, management and support services for around 25 programmes in the areas of social inclusion and equality, inclusive employment and enterprise and early years education and childcare.  In 2018, Pobal issued grants totalling around &euro;695 million.  As indicated in the figures now on screen, almost 70% of the payments were in relation to childcare programmes funded by the Vote for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Other significant areas of grant payment related to community employment schemes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and community services grants funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Pobal recoups its administration costs under the terms of service agreements with the funding Departments.  In 2018, Pobal spent a total of &euro;35.1 million in administration costs and other programme supports.  This comprised &euro;21.7 million in respect of payroll and &euro;13.4 million in non-pay costs.<br/><br/>My audit report on the financial statements drew attention to the statement on internal control which disclosed that in 2018 Pobal incurred expenditure to the value of &euro;1.15 million on goods and services, the procurement of which was not compliant with the relevant procedures.  This mainly related to ICT and project management services required to deliver the national childcare scheme.  I also drew attention in the audit report to Chapter 16 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018<i>,</i><b><i></i></b>which examines the delivery of early learning and childcare funding programmes.  This deals with Pobal&rsquo;s role in administering the schemes and in ensuring compliance with scheme conditions.  The statement on internal control summarises Pobal&rsquo;s compliance activity in that regard. </p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Jerry Murphy, our deputy chief executive who has been with the organisation since 2005, and Mr. Brian Lehane, our chief financial officer who joined Pobal in July 2018.  I was appointed as chief executive of Pobal in August this year.  I joined Pobal from St.Michael&rsquo;s House where I was chief executive since 2015.</p> <p>  Pobal values the role of this committee and we are here to account for and apply the lessons of this process.  Pobal is a not-for-profit, registered charity and a company limited by guarantee without share capital.  Pobal&rsquo;s board is appointed by the Government under the aegis of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Established in 1992, Pobal has developed in response to Government priorities over 27 years.  On behalf of Government, our work supports valuable services in marginalised communities.  Our core role is to deliver an effective programme and grant management service in order to create an inclusive society where Government and communities work together.</p> <p>  In 2018, Pobal managed 25 programmes, primarily for four Government Departments.  The areas, groups and communities we support are outlined in the briefing document we submitted to the committee.  In managing these programmes in 2018 Pobal disbursed &euro;694.7 million, an increase in expenditure of &euro;79.7 million over 2017.  We supported 2,500 community groups and almost 32,000 individuals through the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP.  We channelled funding to 4,832 early learning and care services, supporting approximately 81,899 families with reduced fees through the community subvention programme.  We also approved 19,000 participants for the seniors alert scheme.</p> <p>  In 2018 Pobal employed 442 staff in 2018, with 46% based outside Dublin.  We operate our programmes efficiently.  Our administration spend for 2018 was &euro;29.94 million or 4.10% of budget.  Pobal&rsquo;s budget has evolved to deliver programmes of work in line with Government policy and requirements which make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  Funds disbursed moved from &euro;257 million in 2011 to &euro;695 million in 2018.  This reflects changes in Irish society and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting civil society with these changes.</p> <p>  As CEO, my vision for Pobal is to deliver a value for money service for Government and to make a difference for people and communities.  The landscape of Irish society has altered significantly, redefining who we are and how we live.  Working with community and voluntary organisations, Pobal aims to build capacity locally and to support sustainable, resilient communities.  In a world increasingly fraught with social challenges, the importance of a strong network of natural community supports is a critical component of individual and collective well-being.  It enables us to meet the challenges of the future.</p> <p>  Pobal is committed to ensuring our processes deliver verifiable management of taxpayer&rsquo;s money, while offering user friendly and effective support to all stakeholders.  Our supports assist community organisations to meet their legislative, governance and financial management requirements.  We also provide practical help such as helping hands workshops and managing better guides.  Where possible we utilise information technology to reduce the administrative burden on community organisations.  We have seen remarkable changes across the early learning and care and the school age childcare sector in Ireland in recent years, including the development of the First 5 strategy and the national childcare scheme, of which Pobal is scheme administrator.</p> <p>  We are proud of our work but we know we do not always get things right.  We welcome the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.  This process is important in reminding us of our purpose and in identifying areas for improvement and learning.  The committee is aware the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted two issues in our 2018 annual financial statements.  I accept that there is a need for improvement in our procurement processes, with non-compliance on a proportion of expenditure on goods and services in 2018.  I take this matter extremely seriously, as does the organisation.  A corrective action plan is in place with targets and timelines for completion.</p> <p>  The second note to the accounts relates to Chapter 16 of the 2018 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which examined the administration by Pobal of early learning and childcare funding programmes.  Two of the recommendations in the chapter were directed to Pobal.  However, we understand this chapter will be considered in greater detail at a future meeting of this committee.</p> <p>  Looking ahead, in 2020 the Department of Rural and Community Development will undertake a periodic critical review of Pobal under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  This is the first such review under the 2016 code.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also indicated it will undertake a major operational review of all its early years programmes and the operating model in the early learning and care sector.  We look forward to both reviews and implementing any recommendations for change and improvement.  The entire team at Pobal works hard to deliver for the communities from which we come and where we live.  It is an important part of our organisational culture that we exist for families and communities who not only need the services and programmes we administer but who also, in real terms, pay for these services.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear today and my colleagues and I are happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I wish her well in her new role and thank her for the comprehensive briefing documents that were provided to the committee prior to this meeting.  The total amount of money going through Pobal is substantial, amounting to &euro;695 million in 2018.  The largest element comprises grants from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, totalling &euro;506 million.</p><p>Are all of those moneys distributed to programme supports or do some administration and salary costs come out of them?  Ms Shakespeare mentioned the administration cost of &euro;29.4 million.</p></speech>

Until 2006 the funding for childcare infrastructure came from the EU under the equal opportunities childcare programme, EOCP.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Can Ms Shakespeare explain to me the need for Pobal now as the middleman, considering that change in 2006?  Could the Department not do this work?  We needed the middleman to draw down the EU funding but then we moved to Exchequer-based funding.</p></speech>

Pobal was party to the original investigations around the needs for childcare and much of that started with particular needs in disadvantaged communities but as we moved through that cycle there was a tendency to divide responsibilities so that the more administrative elements of the role came to Pobal.  These include significant elements of policy making, design, standard setting and oversight that traditionally lie with the Department but because of the intricacies of managing these flows of moneys to so many individual groups the decision was made that there were advantages in having a specialist organisation with the knowledge and infrastructure to do that.  Over many years we have developed staff teams with the experience of the local bodies and how things work, with experience in financial management, compliance and people who are available to interact directly with groups whether in a support role or dealing with issues such as financial compliance.  We also developed a series of expertise around matters such as monitoring and reporting to the Department.  We feel we have developed a set of skills distinct from what would normally be within a Department.</p></speech>

Am I correct in saying it was the original parent body in 1992?  I am trying to understand why Pobal, which was established to manage EU grants, is administering childcare grants now.  It had a different sphere.  Is that why the Department of Rural and Community Development is here today too?</p></speech>

There is a strong governance methodology with a service level agreement and an annual programme of works.  Pobal is better suited to undertake the type of work because it has an in-depth knowledge of the early years sector.  It has strong relationships.  We believe there is strong governance in place between us and Pobal.  It is fair to say, however, that it has grown out of EU schemes into Exchequer schemes and over the past five years there has been a 141% increase in funding in the scale of the schemes under administration by Pobal.  Our Minister is about to undertake a review of systems and structures to consider Pobal and the city and county childcare committees to see if there are improvements that can be made to the system.</p></speech>

She cites the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, the higher capitation applications.</p> <p>  I note the high profile launch of the new national childcare scheme this week but a woman contacted my office who, during the soft launch, was twice provided with an invalid Chick code.  She eventually got the correct code yesterday but here's the rub: she was a mum returning to the workforce, she had applied on 7 November and was commencing work shortly after that but due to the glitch in the system her application was processed only yesterday, 10 December.

As part of our verification process to ensure proper oversight of the financial controls and that the system was working correctly we have had to do some manual exercises around identifying individuals going through the income assessment.  That means we need to connect with the data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and from the Revenue Commissioners to calculate the income assessed value of the subsidy that will be awarded to an individual such as the Deputy's constituent.  It is regrettable that it has taken a little time to get through that.</p><p>However, we needed to balance the piece of making sure that, on the one hand, when an individual gets his or her income assessed value, the payment he or she is going to get is absolutely correct because an individual might make, as the Deputy's constituent obviously did, life-changing decisions to go back into the workforce or into education and, on the other hand, it is about balancing the approach to ensure probity in Exchequer spend of money.</p></speech>

It should be noted, and the Comptroller and Auditor General noted it in his report, that in 2010 just 11% of ECCE room leaders had a degree qualification and the figures available for 2018 show that this has risen to over 50%.  That is very positive.  Will Ms Shakespeare explain the problems with the payment of higher capitation since September?  My office has been contacted by providers since then and the verification process by Pobal in many cases is still ongoing, meaning that the higher capitation is not paid and the providers are out of pocket.  They have higher qualified room leaders who must be paid and who command a higher wage.  The verification process is still ongoing for many of the people who contacted me.  Can Ms Shakespeare explain why the delays are occurring?  If there is a change in the opposite direction and the provider goes down from a room leader who has a degree qualification, I presume the provider will owe a refund of moneys.  Will she discuss that?</p></speech>

The application process opened in August to allow service providers ample time to submit applications.  It involves the Pobal employees verifying the qualifications and verification of the qualifications of all those individuals.  What happened is that when we went to seek the verification of the qualifications of some of the individuals and when the qualification confirmation and verification came back, they went back to the end of the queue so we had to revise our process.  I again acknowledge that was a learning point for us.  Those individuals subsequently have been moved further up the queue.  In some respects that has contributed to the delay in that regard.</p></speech>

She referred to that as a learning point but this organisation has been on the go since 1992.  We are dealing with a very fragile industry.  I attended a briefing with providers last month and many of them have become exasperated as to whether they would even continue in the profession.  There are major pressures in counties such as Meath, Kildare and Dublin with even attaining places for children, such is the dearth of places in urban areas, yet providers are at the end of their tether.  Despite people's perception of this being an industry flush with cash because of the high fees that are charged, many providers are on the breadline and the delay in the processing of payments, where Ms Shakespeare said people go to the end of the queue, is causing many of them to be on that line.  It is coming up to Christmas and it is still not resolved.  Will the situation be remedied or will we see it continue in 2020?</p></speech>

I should add that by agreement with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, an initial preliminary payment was made and a second preliminary payment has been made while we work our way through the higher capitation application verification exercises.  My colleague, Mr. Murphy, might wish to add to that.</p></speech>

What that means for us is that often we intentionally manage our processes in a way that gives us very little time for things like turnarounds, to ensure that payments are done as quickly as possible.  It puts a significant amount of pressure on our side but it is in recognition of the fact that moneys need to flow.  While we have been involved in this for a long time, it is reasonably recently that the higher capitation grants were transferred to us.  We opened the process early to allow people to make submissions early, but it was always flagged by us that the assessment process would not start until significantly later than that.  We are conscious that this was translated by the sector as an expectation that the assessments would begin shortly after the applications were sent in.  I know learning points are not as important as delivery, but that was equally a lesson for us.</p></speech>

I have cited two examples - a parent who is out of pocket because of the glitches in the system and, second, the industry providers who are facing financial hardships as well.  Both the administration of the scheme by Pobal and the glitches in the system are causing these pressures on a very fragile industry.</p> <p>  Childcare in the early years has been hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons this year, unfortunately.  The Department has to develop a quality service.  As part of that, in the annual report the Department outlines its better start programme, which is a national early years quality development service for the early learning and care providers working with children from birth to six years of age.  When the controversy with the Hyde &amp;amp; Seek cr&egrave;ches in Dublin was uncovered by RT&Eacute;, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister to ask if the early year specialists under the better start programme had visited this cr&egrave;che.  I was told in the reply that the better start programme visited the cr&egrave;che and that the quality development service assigned an early years specialist to work with this service from November 2015 to September 2016.  The early years specialist visited the Hyde &amp;amp; Seek cr&egrave;che on 13 occasions during this time and made recommendations to the service on ways to improve quality.  There were 13 visits to this service, which was exposed on RT&Eacute;, on ways to improve quality.  Was none of the shortcomings that were subsequently exposed by RT&Eacute; highlighted by the early years specialist, who visited it on 13 occasions, to Pobal and what actions were taken?</p></speech>

Any time our staff are in a situation where they are aware of any such issue, there is an immediate process for passing on that information to Tusla, which is the regulatory agency there.  Our supports through the better start programme are related to the learning environment, the mechanisms that are used by individual staff members to ensure they are carrying out their roles properly and the standard of their care service.  It is an unfortunate reality that one can work successfully with a series of individuals but there is still the wider context of the management system of a cr&egrave;che, which was uncovered there.</p></speech>

Pobal had people going in but they were dealing with the learning environment.  There is a plethora of people involved in early years childcare.  As Mr. Murphy mentioned, there is Tusla, which has its sphere of work to do.  There is Pobal, which has its sphere of work and then there is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as the overarching body.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is involved.  The Comptroller and Auditor General when doing reports on local government will say it is complex, but the area of childcare is even more complex in terms of the plethora of people involved, including the Health Service Executive, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  There are so many that things fall between the cracks.  There were 13 visits to this cr&egrave;che, but Mr. Murphy said Pobal's sphere was to deal with the learning environment.  A significant amount of money is being spent on the better start early years specialist programme.  It is &euro;7.9 million this year.</p><p>Next year that will rise to &euro;9.7 million, an increase of nearly &euro;2 million.  Did no one look at the broader picture rather than looking at the learning environment only and leaving everything else to Tusla?  Tusla also looks at certain aspects only.  It defies belief.  Things get missed when everyone works in silos.</p></speech>

Better Start staff are clearly instructed to report any child protection or welfare issues they notice.  No child welfare or protection issues were identified in their visits to those cr&egrave;ches and locations.</p></speech>

The compliance visits which happen under the early years programmes consist of Pobal staff looking at record-keeping within each childcare centre to see whether it complies with the rules that are in place for early years education.  The main issue found with regard to what the Deputy raised was around attendance records.  Under the subsidised schemes, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs pays money based on the attendance of a child at a service.  The services charge Pobal for those schemes.  Our compliance team checks records to ensure the child's attendance matches what we are being charged for.</p></speech>

The first is that we did, unfortunately, have a financial failure.  Some &euro;11.5 million of payments did not issue as a result of an ICT failure.  That is one part.  The second part relates to the higher capitation payments.  I can absolutely confirm that much has been learned from this in respect of timing and the amount of work entailed in verifying the qualifications of providers seeking that additional funding.  We have put in place two interim payment plans to ensure the sustainability of those organisations in the interim.</p></speech>

It may be cheaper.  That is obviously something one would want to look at in regard to a lease.  It strikes me that the note that is presented here would be improved if the duration of the lease was given as well because, obviously, if it is a short-term lease, such as a five-year lease, one would not be looking at a break clause.  The extension on Adelaide Road is to 2024, so that is five years, and one would not expect a break clause on such a short lease.</p></speech>

I think of Galway, where we became very aware of the number of rented buildings.  I think of one HSE building which was almost &euro;1 million per year.  I do not need to exaggerate because it was so high - more than &euro;800,000 or almost &euro;1 million per year for 25 or 30 years, and when they broke it, there was a penalty of &euro;1 million.  I am very conscious of rented buildings.  Has there ever been a discussion at board level in regard to a permanent building or the purchase or construction of a building?</p></speech>

The nature of Pobal is that we are dependent on programmes of work that are finite of duration and nature and related to a performance delivery agreement and a service arrangement.  Therefore, the continuance of Pobal into the future is something the board would definitely be mindful of when investing heavily in assets.  It is certainly something we can take back to the board from this committee.</p></speech>

Non-compliance is a big problem in the sector.  In 2018-2019, we concentrated on those schemes with the highest risk of over-claims and focused their attention on those in order to minimise the level of over-claims that would be occurring had we not undertaken compliance activities in those areas.</p></speech>

The scheme has been designed to address weaknesses in previous schemes.  Looking at working towards a formal risk-rating methodology is a difficult task and it will take time.  With the introduction of NCS, it affords us the opportunity to do that on a proper basis.</p> <p>  In the meantime, compliance visits and compliance activities are targeted towards the areas of the highest risk.  Under our formal risk-rated model, it has recognised that those schemes where we are targeting or focusing attention are the ones with the highest level of over claims.</p></speech>

However, it is a specific recommendation.  Pobal has accepted the recommendation.  What has happened as a result?  A committee has been set up with a view to setting up a formal risk-rating model.

In November this year, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs agreed with Pobal that we would engage with governance reviews or governance audits of some early learning and care providers.  It is a pilot programme of governance checks to a sample of a number of community-based services.  That has commenced.</p></speech>

We are in the process of recouping a total value of &euro;1.1 million on behalf of the Exchequer that resulted from those over-payments.  We have &euro;690,000 still outstanding as part of an agreed repayment process with providers and &euro;400,000 has been received back on behalf of the Exchequer.</p></speech>

I have asked the school whether I can use its name, and while I am not especially interested in doing so, it does not mind.  A school in Galway cannot secure DEIS status, even though on every level it should have it.  That is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills, but the decision is made based on Pobal maps, and the level of deprivation in the area and various other criteria.  As a result, the school cannot secure DEIS status.  Does Pobal just take raw data from the CSO or does it conduct its own analysis on the ground?</p></speech>

That identifies a series of the key components that, as a total, point to the reality of the life of an individual community.  The schools issue is separate and distinct from us.</p></speech>

Having talked to people on the other side who engage with it, although not from the childcare perspective, I note that its services are targeted and focused on outcomes, and that it certainly puts organisations through their paces to ensure there will be good outcomes.  That is definitely a positive in Pobal's work on, for example, community employment schemes and community services.  Nevertheless, in other countries, the delivery arm of such work is local government, whereas we have a centralised, fragmented system.</p> <p>  As has been noted, a plethora of organisations deal with childcare.  There are not only the individual childcare providers but also the State providers.  Local authorities provide planning permission and ensure that the ratio of childcare provision in buildings is as is set out in high-level policies.  There are also county childcare committees, Tusla and so on.  It is fragmented.  It is interesting when one hears from somebody on a reception desk at a local authority that if non-Irish nationals ask for services, they expect the services to be delivered at the local authority level but they are not.  We should accept that the service is fragmented to begin with.  We are not especially good at organisation building.</p> <p>  How are Pobal's staff levels determined?  There were 442 members of staff in 2018.  In its briefing document, Pobal stated its current challenges have resulted from rapid growth over a short period.  What certainty has Pobal about staff?  What has been the profile of the staff growth over a couple of years?</p></speech>

While there will be different programme rules and guidance, the principle remains the same in the context of our role in verification, checking compliance, following through with audits or requiring agencies to submit documentation to Pobal to demonstrate the outcomes focus, on the one hand, and probity in respect of Exchequer funding, on the other.</p></speech>

Almost one in five, or 19%, were non-compliant in a major way.  Can Ms Shakespeare describe what major non-compliance looks like?</p></speech>

Compliance visits are only conducted on funded programmes from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The early learning and care sectors are subject to compliance visits.</p></speech>

Is it a question, for example, that children are enrolled and then do not turn up?  Is it up to the provider to then notify Pobal?  What happens in such cases?</p></speech>

Children are enrolled or registered with the programme and they may not attend.  While the compliance visit officers look at a snapshot in time, they are proportionate in their review of that attendance.  For example, it is only when it relates to a pattern of non-attendance that it becomes a non-compliance issue.  We recognise the fact that family circumstances need to be flexible and that a mother or father might need to take a day off, for example.  It is only when that is a sustained pattern in that snapshot period that it then becomes an issue of non-compliance.  The registration is amended as a result of the compliance visit and non-compliance is addressed in that context going forward.</p></speech>

The provider can then end up being non-compliant and, at the same time, somebody else requires the place.  An element of fair play has to involved in this.  Is there a financial penalty, for example, for people who are non-compliant having signed a child up or is it all on the provider?</p></speech>

The money follows the child and the service is funded on the basis of the registration and the subsequent attendance of the child.  If the child is not attending, the money does not flow.  Before we reach that scenario, we work with the provider involved to support it to ensure and maximise attendance.</p></speech>

It is often the community providers, especially those in disadvantaged areas, that have particular difficulty with issue.  This is often because they are working in difficult circumstances.  It is not that there is a casualness on the provider's side.  If, however, a provider is working in an area with a lot of families that fact particular challenges etc., as opposed to working in an area where family circumstances are generally more advantaged, it can be difficult.  There are patterns and there are real challenges for particular sets of providers, which is why there is flexibility, the importance of which Ms Shakespeare mentioned.</p></speech>

Pobal and the Department have worked together, including being co-located in a single office in respect of the development of the national childcare scheme over the past two and a half years.  A significant amount of the attention in the development of that scheme has been directed at learning from the existing schemes and amending the rules, the way matters work and the processes to try to bring more business reality to the scheme, including with this issue.</p></speech>

I echo some of the points that were made earlier in the context of not having delays and simplifying the process because the overheads of administration can be reduced.  It is important to do that in respect of such an important programme.  On that programme, primary school teachers will say that the differentiator that used to be noticeable, whereby people could afford to send their children to preschool, is not that noticeable now and they will say there is a strong educational advantage to the programme that is being run.</p> <p>  On the recovery process to which our guests referred, where a grant is repayable, what is involved?  The longer a debt stands, the more likely it is that payment will not be made.  Some of these debts have stood for up to one year, some for more than one year, some for up to five years and some for more than five years.  I suspect that when it goes beyond five years, the chances of getting a repayment are almost nil.  What is Pobal's recovery process and what effort does it put into getting early resolutions?</p></speech>

We are mindful of the fragile environment in which early learning and care providers are working.  We have an integrated case management team that works on an individual basis with each early learning and care provider to agree the repayment.  In the current community childcare subvention programme, prior to NCS, and many individuals are choosing to remain on some of those legacy schemes.  We have an opportunity, because there is a prepayment in advance, to work with that provider to agree a repayment plan that is proportionate and reasonable in circumstances where they may have over-claimed.

In addition, where providers find themselves in difficulty with that funding from a sustainability perspective, there is also a sustainability fund to which applications can be made.  That goes through an approval process with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and we go back and work with the provider involved in order to achieve full repayment in respect of the over-claim that may have occurred.</p></speech>

Sometimes grantees will respond and we enter into a repayment plan with them.

My first question relates to the charitable status of community cr&egrave;ches.  The witnesses are probably aware that I was going to bring this up because Revenue was in here.  I understand that the status is granted because it is an education provider, so it falls under that category.  Why do community cr&egrave;ches have charitable status while non-community cr&egrave;ches that engage with, and are compliant with, the early childhood care scheme cannot avail of that?  Is there a reason?  I understand the not-for-profit element.  It seems an unfair advantage.  If there was a community cr&egrave;che down the road and a private operator, it would be unfair for competition.  Do the witnesses think that all cr&egrave;ches should be granted charitable status if they want it or that the way that we are going, with community cr&egrave;ches having charitable status, is okay?  If there is a profit, do community cr&egrave;ches use surplus money to employ additional staff?  Are they eating into their profits and, therefore, having better ratios and better services?  Do they provide a better service than the person up the road who is trying to operate a business?  It is about fairness in the system.  In parts of Dublin, there can be a community cr&egrave;che that appears to have an advantage over nearby private providers.</p></speech>

I have three children and happened to have them when this all came in.  Private cr&egrave;ches are very specific about signing forms and when the child will be in.  It is very easy to monitor who is in a cr&egrave;che each week.  I do not understand how this situation could emerge.  There is &euro;400,000 from this particular group.

By the way, there were issues involved here that were referred to the Garda.  When Pobal audited the group, it realised that there were significant problems with record-keeping.  I need to be careful in this regard because the case was referred to the Garda.  There were significant issues with record-keeping.  When the board of the group considered these issues, it decided to cease activity and subsequently went into liquidation.  This meant that any of the approaches to recovery that we would normally take was simply impossible.</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy a guarantee that the problems in these areas did not begin before the years in question.  This was a classic case.  Obviously, such amounts of money are very significant.  I remind the Deputy that the major capital investment that was made by the State in some cases resulted in a significant set of cr&egrave;ches in west Clare that was not previously available.  Our role was to engage with local communities and groups to ensure these facilities were brought back into use as quickly as possible.  That has resulted in a series of contracts being put in place.  New providers in each location are using these facilities and making these services available to the people of west Clare.</p></speech>

Almost &euro;500,000 that should have been used to help children to be educated has gone missing, essentially.  It was overclaimed and was not used for the purpose it was supposed to be used for because the children were not even there.  I would like to ask about the other entities that are going to pay back money.  How can they pay back money if they are non-profit entities?  How are they going to manage the reality of this?  My understanding is that there is not much margin in this business for childcare providers that are legitimately claiming for children who actually exist in the cr&egrave;che.  If this money is going to be paid back, how will that be managed by non-profit entities?  Is the reality that none of this money will come back?</p></speech>

As I have said, we are very mindful of the need to work with the provider to repay, while balancing that with our duty to ensure the early learning and care facility is sustainable into the future.  We work with providers across a number of strands to improve governance and the service.  There is a general stream of seven different types of support that we provide to providers when they are in repayment mode.  We are very mindful that we have agreed a sustainability fund with the Department in circumstances in which there are going concerns, or might be going concerns.</p></speech>

Pobal really needs the childcare providers.  If it had another option, it would not generally deal with the provider that took it for a ride for two years.  We need the places because there is a shortage of places.  It seems to me that because these operators have the places, they have been let away with it to some extent.  The repayment process seems to be quite passive.  If this was in the private sector, they would not get away with this sort of carry-on.  This is fraudulent, as far as I am concerned.  If someone is overclaiming in respect of children who are supposed to be getting a service, that is clearly and obviously fraudulent.  I have had to sign forms for children as they have gone in in the morning and as they have come out.  When cr&egrave;ches are inspected at any point, the headcount needs to be right.  That brings me on to my next question about the 13 inspections that took place before the "Prime Time"-----</p></speech>

Given current technology, PPS numbers and so on, it is hard to understand that this could happen and so much money could be taken out of the system.  Do we have any information with regard to how the money was being spent or is that a matter for the Garda?  Why did the services need the extra money?  Is it that these were private companies, as in the case in Clare?  Where was the money spent?  If it was spent on children, that would be grand.

At the same time, we want to ensure probity for public money and recoupment where there has been an attendance and registration differential.  One of the flexibilities that will be built into the national childcare scheme makes this much clearer.  As we go forward in fully implementing the national childcare scheme across all the early learning and care providers, it builds in a degree of flexibility where mam and dad are not available to drop the child to the cr&egrave;che or whatever for family reasons and so on.  It will also allow for greater oversight and greater compliance as we move forward with that programme.</p></speech>

I recently attended an event which was a celebration of the work of T&uacute;s.  It has been brought to my attention that for many people who engage in this scheme it takes three or four months to familiarise themselves with the work and that on completion of their time on the scheme they tend to end up in jobs in the retail sector, including charitable shops and so on.  Many of the participants are people who come from complex situations and have not managed to get employment and are given this pathway to work.  However, the scheme expires in 12 months, which is relatively short given it takes participants three or four months to become familiar with the work.  I have raised with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, a request for the scheme to be extended to 18 months or two years such that participants can remain in it and be more useful or move to another job.  The view of T&uacute;s and those who take on participants under the scheme is that the period of transition is too short.  In many cases they are just settling in when they are moved somewhere else.  Is there scope to extend this scheme?</p></speech>

It is a pattern we are seeing as well, particularly now as the economy has improved.  The people who avail of many of these schemes have greater depths of need than would have been the case three or four years ago.  From our point of view, there is very good reason to review the design of a number of schemes to try to reflect the greater intensity of need among individual participants.</p></speech>

It is regrettable for the person who was long-term unemployed and got this opportunity that there is no scope to extend it.</p> <p>  On mandatory vaccinations, I understand there are constitutional issues around making vaccination mandatory.  There does not appear to be a constitutional issue with child care providers insisting that children registered in a scheme must be vaccinated.

The UK has lost its measles-free status.  In the context of the administration of the child care schemes, can we insist that all children registering with a child care provider that is in receipt of State funding must be vaccinated?  I do not believe there is a constitutional arising in that regard.</p> <p>  In regard to the 13 inspections that were carried out prior to the "Prime Time Investigates" programme, it is a matter of concern that premises would be inspected and obvious welfare issues would not be identified.</p><p>Inspectors can sometimes look in the wrong place.  Has Pobal updated or changed its inspection regimes to look in the right places?  If a certain amount goes into a State scheme, there is an expectation, especially with our history in Ireland, that we would have the most robust child protection and we would not return to anything like the past.  It is very disheartening to see many parents so distressed.  It is a major decision to go back to work and put one's child into a cr&egrave;che.  Has Pobal made its inspections more robust and fit for purpose so that it can weed out problems and we do not have another "Prime Time Investigates" incident? </p></speech>

The Better Start access and inclusion model, AIM, service, which we host on behalf of the Children and Youth Affairs, does not have a statutory basis.  It does not run an inspection regime.  The inspection regime for early learning and care services is managed and run by Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills.  This goes back to the point made by Deputy Cassells about fragmentation and providers' experience in that context.  However, the primary role of the Better Start AIM staff is to support an active implementation of service improvement in the context of early education and care around the S&iacute;olta and Aistear curricula.  In addition to that, their job is to carry out a classroom-based assessment to identify services that might benefit from additional funding associated with AIM, that is, cases where children with additional support needs might benefit from additional supports.  The work of the Better Start AIM staff employed by Pobal is very different from the statutory function undertaken by Tusla and Department of Education and Skills staff.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

We contract with the county childcare committees and agree a work plan with them.  The idea is that they are locally-based groups that are immediately available to childcare centres.  In terms of the roll-out of the national childcare scheme, for example, we trained all of the county childcare committees who in turn train all of the local providers.  The idea is that if a local provider needs to pick up the phone about an issue, the county childcare committee should be the first point of contact.  Issues get escalated to us if they are of a more difficult nature.</p></speech>

We are dealing here with non-compliance with procurement rules, an issue with which this committee deals all of the time.  Reference is made to a sum of &euro;693,000 for software development, &euro;350,000 for ICT business analysis and &euro;105,000 for project management.  We want a detailed note on all of those.  The headings are included in the accounts but we want detailed information on each of these items.  We want to know how the expenditure arose, why it arose, whether the contracts have ceased and where we are in 2019 in relation to same.  The Committee of Public Accounts has been addressing similar issues with every organisation that has come before it in the last six months.  We want a detailed note.</p></speech>

We recently brought to our partnership committee, which is our employee engagement committee, a proposal to incentivise employees below a particular grade to come forward with candidate suggestions.  This would be a cost-reduction measure in the context of recruitment agency fees.  Obviously the normal rules would apply and the individuals in question would have to go through a thorough and robust recruitment process.  The candidates would not have an edge as such and that is made extremely clear to everyone.  A small token is given to the individual in the context of incentivising-----</p></speech>

Pobal refers to the scheme in page 10 of its briefing note.  It says that the growth of the seniors alert scheme was very positive, with over 19,000 applications approved in 2018, representing an increase of 163% on 2016 levels and 52% on 2017 levels.  It is mentioned again on page 18.  Pobal points out that funding is available towards the purchase of equipment including personal alarms and pendants.  Is that a wrist alarm and a pendant that hangs from the neck?  In the first year the cost of monitoring by a registered monitoring provider is also provided free of charge under the scheme from 1 November, when a range of changes were made to the scheme.  I read somewhere else in the briefing note that 10,000 people joined the scheme last year.  Who does Pobal deal with in the provision of this service?  What companies are involved in the scheme?</p></speech>

What is the incidence of maternity leave?  I am pleased to hear it has been provided for, given that it is a fact of life.  If women are to be in the workforce, they have to be provided for.  I have no difficulty with maternity leave being provided for.  I recently met a group from the HSE and was told that maternity leave staff accounted for approximately one third of its workforce.  Is the breakdown for Pobal similar?  It might relate to the age profile of the HSE's staff.</p></speech>

A male member of that team is unusual.  We build in a percentage of the staff turnover to support and ensure that the service continues.  The maternity leave staff might change location based on the particular profile of individuals on maternity leave at any one time.</p> <p>  As for other employees, with respect, it becomes obvious when an individual has impending maternity leave.  We work to ensure there is a service continuity plan with a replacement.  As of September 2019, we had 39 staff on maternity leave.  I would expect that a high number of those individuals were part of our access and inclusion model, Better Start, based on the profile of the employees, their gender and their relative age profile.</p></speech>

When Ms Shakespeare made the point earlier, I was struck by the beautiful way she put it as taking account of employees' gender.  I thought that if only the HSE had a similar policy, life would be wonderful.  The HSE comes immediately to mind for many reasons, but other organisations, too, could benefit from the template that Pobal has drawn up.  I acknowledge that it had to build it into its planning, but it could be useful for other organisations to learn from.</p> <p>  Finally, how many protected disclosures has Pobal received and what is their status?

We received a report two weeks ago from the Accounting Officer in the Houses of Oireachtas Service, Mr. Peter Finnegan, who is also Clerk of the D&aacute;il, on difficulties experienced and a number of significant additional costs incurred following the purchase of a new printing press.  We received from Mr. Finnegan a second report, to which we referred this morning under correspondence No. 2636B, on Tuesday with further clarifications.  We also discussed and considered the related item of correspondence from the Office of Public Works, No. 2635B.</p><p>We are joined this afternoon by the following people: from the Houses of the Oireachtas Service, Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General, and Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Devlin, Office of the Commission and Secretary General; from the Office of Public Works Mr. John McMahon, commissioner, heritage and building services, and Mr. Jim O'Sullivan, assistant chief engineer, mechanical and electrical services.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  That means putting them onto airplane mode as merely putting them onto silent can still interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>May we have Mr. Finnegan's opening remarks, please?</p></speech>

I am in a slightly different position from the position I was in on 11 July in that my knowledge of this matter is many times greater than it was then as a result of three weeks I have spent looking at various documentation and speaking to the relevant parties that were involved in this purchase of the Komori printing press.  It is important to put the narrative on the record because it will contextualise some of the questions and may indeed answer some of them.</p> <p>  The story starts with the business cases that were developed for the purchase of the printing equipment and the printing press in 2017.  A business case was developed which was put before the management board of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The fundamental reason for buying the Komori printer was twofold: first, the age of the existing machines-----</p></speech>

If it is of help, I have that information in the appendix to the report, so they can see that there.  The management board is the board of senior managers within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is chaired by me as Clerk of the D&aacute;il and Secretary General.  On the board we have our four assistant secretaries, the Clerk of the Seanad, a representative of our PO group and, finally, one external member.  The management board meets monthly and its meetings feed into the commission meetings.</p></speech>

The Chairman is correct.</p> <p>  The management board received a business case on 6 November.  As I said, two main reasons were advanced for the purchase of the Komori printing press.  First was the age of the existing equipment.</p><p>In 2017, the equipment we had on hand at that stage was 12 years old.  The equipment was purchased in 2004 and I believe it went into operation in 2005, so we were looking at equipment that was fully depreciated.  It was also proving increasingly unreliable so in terms of the maintenance costs we would incur on equipment of that age, we were spending probably about &euro;45,000 per year on maintenance.  In addition to that, we were incurring about &euro;20,000 in spare parts when repairs were needed.  I am advised by the print manager that it was not an infrequent occurrence to have a mechanic out repairing the two printing presses.</p><p> If we look at it purely in cost terms over five years and ask if the argument for buying a printing press stacks up, we note the cost of maintenance and repairs comes in at around &euro;65,000 a year.  If we multiply that by five, we are at &euro;325,000.  In addition, we were faced with a decision that if we were to continue with the Heidelberg printing presses, we would have to do a major overhaul of them because of their age.  That was expected to cost &euro;170,000.  In very round terms, therefore, the cost of retaining the Heidelberg printing press over five years was somewhere of the order of &euro;500,000.  When we look at that in the context of the purchase of a new machine, and the new Komori printing press came in at &euro;848,000, we can see the financial sense in terms of moving from the old Heidelberg to the new machine.</p><p> The second point to note is the volume of the printing.  We have a significant printing operation.  Last year, the Oireachtas produced, and I have produced the statistics in the report, of the order of 16 million print impressions.  The year before that it was 21 million.  If we go back to 2015, we produced 26 million print impressions, so the Oireachtas printing unit is quite a sizeable operation.  In the circumstances, we need good, robust, versatile, well-built equipment.  That was the reason we went out to tender.</p><p> In addition to the printing press, we needed a number of other items of printing equipment.  We produced a tender and split it into five lots.  The reason we split it into five lots was to maximise competition, and particularly to enable small and medium sized enterprises to compete for the business.  That is something we like to do as a matter of policy in the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  The tender was published on 5 March 2018.  The records we have obtained show that 12 companies downloaded the tender documentation from eTenders so there was a fair degree of interest, naturally enough, in the contract.  That is not surprising, given the expected value.</p><p> The site visits during the tender period, which would be a normal activity during tendering, took place on 21 March.  At that stage, people could go and look at the print unit.  On foot of those site visits, clarifications were received on 29 March.  All of those clarifications were answered and the results circulated to all of the parties concerned.  The closing date for the tender was 5 April 2018.</p><p> In terms of what the request for tenders document sought in respect of the printer, the precise wording was that the tender must be able to fit into a room 12 m by 5.8 m by 2.5 m.  The most important measurement is the last one, the 2.5 m, which would have been the ceiling height of the printing unit.  We also stipulated that there needed to be an acceptable work area around the press.</p><p> When the tenders were subsequently received we only got one tender in, despite the initial level of interest, for the printing press.  That came from Komori.  In the tender response document, which I reviewed as part of the preparation of the report, Komori ticked the box saying that it met the minimum specification in that the printing press could fit into the room with those dimensions, with an acceptable work area around it.  Underneath the box with the minimum specifications a note was included.  The words of that note are important.  They state that the headroom from the press foot boards to the ceiling is limited.  </p><p> During the tender period, one of the clarifications received was from Komori.  Komori asked the print facility if there was a false ceiling and, if so, if there was a height greater than 2.5 m available.  The response they got back from the print facility was that there was a false ceiling and that there was an extra 35 cm available.  That increased the available height from 2.5 m to 2.85 m.</p><p> To give the members a sense of the Komori printing press, it is a big machine.  It is 7.4 m long, 3.2 m wide and 1.98 m in height.  I spoke to somebody in the print industry recently about it and asked him how he would describe this type of machine.  This would be a very experienced person in the industry.  He said it was a very versatile machine.  It is the type of machine one would buy if one is doing short runs, long runs and if one has many different types of print requirement, which is exactly the position we are in.  He also said it was a well-built machine.  He said that the company he runs has a number of different makes of printing press and that the Komori is the best of the ones he has; that is his personal view.  The third comment he made was that it is economical in terms of the purchase price of the press and that it was an economical press to run.  The evidence I have received is that it is a good, solid printing press.</p><p> The other point to remember about printing is that most commercial printing is a 24-7 type of operation.  A printing press like this one gives us greater capacity in that area.  At the moment, we run two shifts in the print unit but, going forward, there are other options as well.</p><p> Following the submission of the tenders, the evaluation team looked at them.  I have listed the members of the evaluation team in an appendix.  Would the Chairman like me to read it out for the record?</p></speech>

The project manager, who is basically the head of the evaluation team, is the print manager.  We had the print supervisor from the print facility.  The project sponsor was a principal officer who is the head of communications.  We had a procurement unit representative, and we also had an external procurement consultant who has done a substantial amount of work with the Houses of the Oireachtas over the years.</p> <p>  The evaluation team looked at all of the tenders, including the one on the Komori printing press.  As I said in my report, the evidence I got was that they missed the statement on the bottom of the page, which said that the head height was limited.  They proceeded to arrange a clarification meeting with Komori, being the single tender, which would be standard practice.  Five Oireachtas staff members attended that meeting and three representatives from Komori - the managing director, the project director and also the managing director of their Irish agent.  A variety of issues were discussed at that meeting.  I have looked at the report.  Interestingly, head height did not come up at that meeting.  At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that Komori would submit various documents by way of clarification.  Standard things one would expect in any type of procurement process would be the engineering team, the software support, the organisational chart and so on.</p><p>Those papers were submitted on 25 April 2018 and included among them was a drawing, which I think I have included as an appendix to the report.  Committee members can see it is a drawing by a professional engineer or draughtsperson.  It is Appendix B of the report on the machine.  I have spoken to the managing director of Komori's Irish agent who told me the submission of such a drawing would be standard during a procurement process, particularly at that stage.  That drawing recommended a minimum ceiling height of 3.16 m.  As I said in my report, that drawing was sent to the procurement unit.  I cannot find any evidence that it was sent to the print facility.  In fact, the issue does not actually turn on that, as will become evident in a minute.</p><p> The next stage in the process was for the Oireachtas contracts committee to meet and consider the matter.  I have listed the Oireachtas contracts committee at the very bottom of the Appendix C.  It is chaired by a principal officer who works in the committee secretariat.  It includes two assistant principal officers, one from the ICT unit and one from the Debates unit.  It includes higher executive officers from the Library and Research Service, the Finance unit and the Journal Office and the secretariat is provided by the procurement team.  The committee has a role in a number of areas.  It is charged under its terms of reference with reviewing contracts where it is proposed for exceptional reasons not to have a competitive process, and this did not apply in this instance, or where only one tender was received in response to an advertisement or invitation to tender and the contract value is in excess of &euro;65,000 exclusive of VAT.  This is the heading under which this tender was referred.  The third reason, which is not relevant but I will say it for the record, is where it is proposed not to accept the lowest priced tender.  The Oireachtas contracts committee considered the tender and signed off on it.  That day, Komori was informed by letter that it was the preferred bidder for the contract.</p><p> The next important event in the narrative was on 21 May when a team from Komori came in and took measurements.  I spoke to the managing director of the Irish agent who was present on that day.  His evidence to me was the issue of head height was absolutely discussed at it but everybody in the room was happy there was sufficient head height to install that printer.  He said they then moved on to other technical issues related to the installation of the printer.  He also said that one of the reasons they were satisfied with it was that 90% of the work on the printer is done from the very lowest platform and in the case of the lowest platform head height is not an issue because the 2.1 m clearance can be achieved when standing on the lowest platform.  He said in relation to the tasks that must be carried out from higher platforms they can also be done from the lower platform.  There was no real concern in the room or no sense that head height was a particular issue.  The measurements were done and a number of days later Komori sent in the drawing that was submitted on 25 April to the print facility manager.  The drawing was sent in connection with discussions being had on installation.  Essentially, this was how the new printing press would be delivered and installed in the Oireachtas printing unit.</p><p> The next most significant date is 31 May.  On that date the contract was signed.  The day before that, the print facility emailed our facilities unit stating it had procured a new printer, that it reckoned certain work needed to be done including removing doorframes, which would be pretty standard, and asking the facilities unit look to at the matter.  That process got under way.  On 14 August 2018, the OPW came back and said it reckoned more significant work was required because of the head height requirement.  The OPW architect at the time had done her own research and came to the view that the height available in the print room was insufficient to meet the various regulations, including machinery directives and building regulations.  At that stage, further investigations had to be done and Mr. McMahon will fill in the committee on the detail of these investigations.  From the files I have reviewed there appears to have been quite a lot of over and back.</p><p> The other thing that is very evident is that in parallel with what was happening in the printing unit we were also working on the historic Leinster House restoration project.  There was pressure on the time of architects and engineers and all of that had to be managed as part of the process.</p><p> In December, the printing press had been delivered from Japan and it was being held in storage.  A decision was made by the project sponsor that we should pay for it because we had the money set aside in our budget for 2018; there were no funds earmarked for 2019; 60% of the cost of the press was due anyway on delivery; and the delays in terms of installation were very much down to problems on the Oireachtas side.  The project sponsor went to our Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and asked them to draw up an addendum to the contract which would give the Oireachtas full title over the machine.  That was done and the addendum was signed.  I received a submission on 12 December from the project sponsor setting out the issue.  When I was satisfied as Accounting Officer that there was a legal obligation to pay the money and that the title was secured I authorised the payment.</p><p> I should say in relation to the addendum that the expectation at that time was that the printing press would be installed at Easter 2019.  It was anticipating somewhere of the order of three months before the printing press was installed.  As it turned out, it took considerably longer than that.  The works eventually got under way in the middle of July 2019.  They were handed back to the print facility on 12 November.  In the meantime, the printing press was delivered on 28 September.</p><p> That brings the story up to date in terms of the issues initially of concern.  I have set out in the report where we are now.  It is pretty much as is in the report from two days ago.  We are doing our health and safety assessments.  We have a health and safety adviser who does a lot of this for us.  He is doing that in terms of his workflow and also doing some workflow assessments that were raised by the staff.  The expectation is that those assessments will be ready by 20 December, which is Friday week.  That is the objective.  Subject to everything being okay from a health and safety point of view and in terms of workflow, at that point it should be possible, in conjunction with the staff, to start the process of training and operation of the printing press.</p><p> As I said in my report at the end of my opening remarks, there is absolutely no doubt that mistakes were made in this project.  A series of mistakes was made.  My investigations included reviewing documents and speaking to the personnel involved.</p><p>In fairness to them, they were very forthcoming.  It is difficult for people who find themselves in a situation where they have made a serious error but I commend them on the way they have faced up to it.  It is my conclusion that the mistakes that were made were honest mistakes and that is the expression I used in my report.  Ultimately, the staff were trying to do their best for Members.  They were trying to improve the quality of the services that we provide to Members by upgrading the printing equipment which, as I said, was 12 years old and was going to be very costly to keep on the road.  The aim was to replace it with a new, modern, well-built and versatile printing press.  That is the narrative.  On the building side, I would have to defer to Mr. McMahon if anyone wants to know about the detail of some of the construction works.  Essentially, that is the position as I found it when I conducted my investigation and drew up my report.  </p></speech>

I should declare at the outset that I am also member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission which had a robust exchange on this issue recently.  It is fair to say that as a consequence of that exchange, there will be exceptional reporting so that matters such as this will be brought to the attention of the commission.  The issues of insufficient head height in the building and significant additional works having to be carried out to fit the machine in were as much of a surprise to the commission as they were to anyone else.</p> <p>  A number of issues arise relating to procurement.  There was a single response to the printer tender.  Was the tender published on a Europe-wide basis?  There was only one bid for the printing press contract.  Was there more interest in supplying the other machinery that was purchased?</p></speech>

One asks if the tender meets the requirements.  Then, under our governance structure, one submits the tender to the Oireachtas contracts committee.  That is the process.<br/><br/>It was unusual to get just two responses.  It was advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union </i>but that was the level of interest from the market at the time.  </p></speech>

I said that there were a number of lessons that stand out and these will be addressed as a matter of priority.  The very first one is that all of the project teams must include specialist architectural expertise where a project could involve structural modifications and where appropriate, legal external subject matter and health and safety expertise.  In reality, if this project had been run the way one would have expected, we would have had an architect on the team.  Discussions would have taken place at a very early stage and those discussions would have been reflected in the nature of the business case.  The business case that was received referred to the purchase of an asset but did not make any reference whatsoever to ancillary works.  This was looked at by a range of people within the Oireachtas, not just the project team.  At the time, we had a committee that looked at business cases of this nature.  That committee examined the business case.  The committee in question is the business and strategy committee which was headed by the then Superintendent.  It also included the head of communications at principal level, a principal from committees, a principal from the Office of Parliamentary Legal Adviser, a principal from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, the principal and head of finance of the Office of the Commission and Secretary General, the chief translator and an assistant principal at the Office of the Commission and Secretary General.  All of those people looked at it.  In actual fact, three or four of the members of that business and strategy sub-committee went over to the printing unit.  They went into the rooms where the printer was going to be installed but the issue of height never actually came up.  There was no sense at all that height was an issue.  When one looks back at the papers and the evidence, one sees that the perspective was that the project involved the purchase of an asset and the complexities around the installation of that asset were not considered at all.  It was just assumed that the asset that we were purchasing, the new printing press, could replace the old Heidelberg printing presses.  That was how it was at the time.</p></speech>

One thing we needed to do was to replace the old Heidelberg printing presses.  They were 12 years old and were going to cost us a further &euro;500,000 over the next five years.

When one receives an invitation to attend the Committee of Public Accounts, it is one of the most important things that one will do as a Secretary General.  A Secretary General is statutorily responsible for expenditure in the organisation that he or she leads.  It is a very important engagement that one gives one's full energy and attention to in the run-up to it.  As part of the preparations for it, one will receive various briefing notes.  The reason that a Secretary General makes sure to have as much information as possible is that he or she knows, when coming into this room, that he or she could be asked literally anything by anybody.  There are no limits on the questions that can be asked.  On the previous occasion on which I was here, there were no limits on the questions that were asked of me.  I was asked about matters that were not my financial responsibility at all.  In order to be helpful to the committee, I answered them as well as I could.</p></speech>

The primary focus of the Committee of Public Accounts when an Accounting Officer such as myself attends is to examine the account.

I will explain why.  A challenge that we face in the Oireachtas is accommodation.  The print unit is installed and operates from Kildare House.  In Kildare House, we not only have a significant number of staff who run our committees and do translations for us, but we also have a broadcasting unit, a cr&egrave;che-----</p></speech>

We have a broadcasting unit, a cr&egrave;che, a gym and a print facility.  The reality that we face as an organisation is that when we have to do a piece of major equipment installation it invariably involves structural works.  I looked back, just to satisfy myself, to see what was the scale of the works that were done in 2004 when the original print equipment went in.  The cost of the works in 2004 was twice the cost of the works that took place in connection with the Komori printer.  That gives some sense of the scale of what has to be done when equipment needs to be installed in the Oireachtas.  We are not an organisation that has the luxury of installing equipment in a greenfield site.  We are not Google down in the docks.  We are an organisation that functions from Dublin 2 in very cramped conditions and invariably costs arise as a result of that.</p></speech>

The business case was designed to purchase equipment to service the printing requirements of Members.  That is a statutory obligation that the organisation has.  In my view, it is very difficult to argue that the replacement of a printing press at &euro;850,000, with additional costs for adaptations, etc., is not a better option than continuing with 12-year old machinery and investing more than &euro;500,000 in that.  If I did that, I would also be here before the committee and members would be rightly challenging me on whether or not I had made the right decision.</p></speech>

He said that when one comes before the Committee of Public Accounts as an Accounting Officer that one could be asked anything by anybody.  I think that is fair.  One can be asked a wide range of questions, even questions that may not be material to the accounts at hand.  On the day Mr. Finnegan was in, he was not asked anything by anybody, he was asked a question by me specifically in relation to office equipment and ICT services.  The question was specifically regarding what was not an overspend but bringing forward expenditure in the region of &euro;9.7 million.  He mentioned on the ICT side the replacement of laptops and he also mentioned the printer, which he said cost &euro;1.3 million.  Mr. Finnegan then said he could only answer the question he was asked.  The problem is if we are not given the information we cannot ask the questions.  I will get to the point in a moment.  Mr. Finnegan said there is one line in the report which said there may have been some difficulties.  Does he not accept it would have been better at that meeting to say there were issues attached to the cost of &euro;1.3 million and to draw our attention to page 3 of the document which sets them out?  Perhaps then we would have been in a better position to ask questions.  I was not aware at that meeting that issues arose concerning head height or major works that had to be done to fit the printer but Mr. Finnegan was aware of them.  I think the Comptroller and Auditor General was aware of them.  When there is a vacuum of information in a room, there is a difficulty.  I put it to Mr. Finnegan that it would have been better at that meeting had he just said that as well as the &euro;1.3 million, there are some difficulties he wanted to alert the committee to and that the expenditure will form part of next year's budget.  Does he not, first of all, accept that it would have been better at least?</p></speech>

Like Deputy Cullinane, I have looked at the transcript as well.  The exchange we had was very much around subhead 1(a) and the components of subhead 1(a).  That is very much one's focus when one is answering questions.  It is just the way it is for an Accounting Officer coming in.  There was no intention on my part to withhold anything or anything like that.</p></speech>

I am just saying that for us to do our job, it would be better to tell us if there are major complications with a project.  In this case, Mr. Finnegan was furnished with a report in December which we then read coincidentally in <i>The Irish Times</i>a week after he was before the committee.  The timing was very coincidental but it happened to be a week after Mr. Finnegan was here that we read about it in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Mr. Finnegan specifically mentioned the cost of the printer.  What I am saying is that it would have been better if he had said that in addition to the &euro;1.3 million, there are potentially additional costs and he wanted to alert us to those and then at least that would have been on the public record.</p></speech>

That is what I did on that day to the best of my ability.  I had basically flagged this in the appropriation account.  There was a note on the account regarding prepayments.  That note was note 2.5.</p><p>When any group of people are looking at accounts &mdash; there are a number of accountants here in the room today &mdash; the first thing they do is read the notes.

It does not jump out that there was a major complication.  The cost was &euro;1.169 million.  Mr. Finnegan had given me a cost of &euro;1.3 million.  It does not jump out at me, even with the benefit of hindsight, that that was resulting in a problem.  What I am saying to Mr. Finnegan is not to catch him out or say he did anything wrong or purposely withheld information.  We actually acknowledged that he is a very experienced and highly regarded civil servant.  He is here as an Accounting Officer to answer questions.  It would have been better had he just told us.  He has now had to follow up with two separate reports to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The second, which I will come to an a second, recognises and acknowledges a series of mistakes that were made.  It would have been better had Mr. Finnegan told us.  Does he at least accept that it would have been better had he alerted us to the potential problems?</p></speech>

That note reflects the level of knowledge we had.  The date of the accounts is June 2018.  There is a completely different level of knowledge about this project today.

While there is a different degree of knowledge now, Mr. Finnegan had a very significant memo at his disposal in December, well in advance of his coming in.  It set out that there were difficulties and challenges.  Mr. Finnegan has given his view but I will finish with this topic by stating it is my view that he should have given us more information.  He has his view.  I will let the public decide who they believe is right on that one.</p> <p>  Let me move on to the business case for purchasing.  On page 1 of the second report, Mr. Finnegan states the business case for purchasing is still sound.  Does he stand over that?</p></speech>

The rationale for purchasing the printer was sound.  Nobody here is disputing the rationale or need for the printer.  He went into a lengthy discussion he had with some expert &ndash; I do not know who this person is.  It is irrelevant and not material to this committee.  I believe he said it was a good solid printing press.  I am sure it is but it just did not fit.  That was the problem.  Regardless of that, on the second page Mr. Finnegan refers to lessons learned.  Could he read for me the second lesson he says was learned?</p></speech>

It states business cases must include an estimate of the cost of ancillary works and items.  To me, that is an acknowledgement that the business case did not include an estimate of the cost of ancillary works and items.  One cannot say on one page that the business case for purchasing was sound and on the following page acknowledge that one of the lessons learned was that the business case did not include certain elements.  Maybe Mr. Finnegan can enlighten me as to why that is the case.</p></speech>

The reference to the business case on the first page essentially means the business proposition for the purchase of the printer.  The arguments for purchasing it from a business point of view are still sound.  The reference on the second page is to the specific matter of business cases that are part of our governance structure here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-12a.919" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019121200002#SS01400"><p>I am sorry but I am going to have to disagree with Mr. Finnegan again on this.  The Comptroller and Auditor General educates us and has done so for a long time on the importance of business cases.  One element of a business case is the rationale.  The other element is that one lines up one's ducks and that everything is, as much as possible, anticipated.  That certainly was not done in this situation because Mr. Finnegan went on to say and acknowledged that there were serious mistakes.  It would be better in this report if Mr. Finnegan had said the rationale for the purchase was sound but that mistakes were made in relation to the business case.</p><p>Mr. Finnegan said there was a series of mistakes.  This was glaringly absent in the first report.  In the first report, there was no reference at all to mistakes that were made.  The second report states:</p> <blockquote> 	Ther<font color="#2F2F2F">e is absolutely </font>no deny<font color="#2F2F2F">ing that a series of </font>mista<font color="#2F2F2F">kes were made </font>during <font color="#2F2F2F">the project.  These are outlined and exp</font>lained in <font color="#2F2F2F">this report. </font>However<font color="#2F2F2F">, I am satisfied, that </font>the <font color="#2F2F2F">mistakes arose from human error. </font>They <font color="#2F2F2F">were </font>honest <font color="#2F2F2F">mistakes and made by staff who were seeking to im</font>prove <font color="#2F2F2F">the printing services for Members.</font> </blockquote> <p>I have no issue whatsoever with the view that the mistakes were honest.  If honest mistakes are made and people put their hands up and say that made them, we have to accept that.  There is human error but it took us an awful long time to get to an acknowledgement that serious mistakes were made.  I would like to know not the individual or even the department he or she worked in but whether the mistakes Mr. Finnegan states were made as a consequence of human error were made by the company selling the printer, the OPW or the people who were developing the business case?  When Mr. Finnegan states there were human error and mistakes, he at least has an obligation to tell us where they were made.  In what area?  Was it in procurement?  In what area were the mistakes made?  Was there a combination of different areas?</p></speech>

On the Monday morning when I came into work, I sent an email to the clerk of the committee.  I told him I was going to do a report and that I would aim to have it for the committee on the following Thursday, which was 28 November.  On Monday, 25 November, Tuesday, 26 November, and Wednesday, 27 November, we basically collated all the information we could in that short period.  I had a team of people working with me.  They worked incredibly hard pulling together the report.  The first report was based on the level of knowledge we had at that time.  There were certain unanswered questions that I actually could not answer at that particular time.  It was not that I did not want to answer them but I actually did not have the answers.<br/><br/>I obviously had more time to produce the second report.  I went through as many of the emails as I possibly could.  I had the opportunity to sit down and do a full debrief with particular individuals.  I had the opportunity to have a telephone conversation with the managing director of Komori's Irish agent.  A lot more went into that.  The additional time I had reflects the difference between the two reports and why I was able to say a series of mistakes were made.<br/><br/>With regard to the mistakes, from the very beginning the first and fundamental mistake was the absence of architectural input on the evaluation team.  That was absolutely critical.  If we had had architectural input on the evaluation team, in my view the issue of head height would have been identified right at the very start.  That, in turn, would have had an impact on the business case.  The second recommendation that I have is that the business cases must include an estimate of the cost of ancillary works and items.  We would have had a truer cost for these works, which would have been incorporated in the business case.<br/><br/>The other issue relates to issues that arose during the course of the procurement process.  Mistakes were made in terms of not picking up on the drawing that was submitted but, on the flip side of that, it would have been helpful had attention been drawn to that drawing by the Oireachtas parties.  There was just no sense of the head height issue and therefore the drawing did not trigger or ring any alarm bells.  Other mistakes that were made included the fact that the statement in the RFT response was missed.  That was a further mistake.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in this project, as I said in my report, basically there was a series of mistakes.</p><p>As the Deputy generously acknowledged, they were honest and human mistakes.  That is what happens occasionally.  It is regrettable that it does happen.  However, as long as one has humans involved in a project, there is always the possibility of a human error.  One just tries one's best to eliminate or reduce that possibility as far as one can.</p></speech>

Those mistakes are now being acknowledged.  I do have a view about what information should have been given at a previous meeting.  As part of the commentary on this issue, there was a point made that somehow the staff in the printing presses were holding up progress with this printer going live because of pay.  That is not my view.  There are no issues with staff looking for extra money.  No pay claims are being made by staff.</p> <p>  Mr. Finnegan mentioned the actual room.  In the first report he gave the committee, he said it was due to go into printing room No. 1 but ended up in printing No. 2.  He also mentioned earlier the pile turner.  Will he confirm how this printer will work?  Is it correct that the pile turner is in a different room?</p></speech>

It has to go into the front of the machine.  It prints one side and comes out the other end.  The person has to bring the lift over to the other side and load up the printer.  They have to go out of room No. 1 into room No. 2 over to the pile turner.  It then turns the paper back on to the lift again, back in and the process is repeated.  To me, that is a bit complicated.  It raises genuine health and safety concerns which staff would have.  That is why I am making the point.</p> <p>  We need to be fair to the staff in the printing presses.  There was some media commentary that there were issues regarding a pay claim for operating this printer.  Will Mr. Finnegan dispel that this is not the case today?  Is it correct that there is no additional pay claim being made by the staff for operating this printer?  Is it correct that there are genuine health and safety concerns that the staff have about operating the machine and the tight space of the room in which the printer is located?</p></speech>

I was told that there is no requirement for forklift trucks.  A trolley is required.  In actual fact, the trolley that is going to be used in connection with the new printer is slightly smaller than the trolley that was in use with the old printer.  That is the information I have been given.</p> <p>  On health and safety issues, a range of issues are being addressed with our health and safety consultant.  In addition to that, we are looking at the workflow issues in terms of the print unit.  The information I have been given is that the report from the health and safety expert is due on Friday week, 20 December.</p> <p>  On the pay claim, on the basis of information I have been given, I am advised that on 12 November SIPTU wrote stating that following a general meeting with staff, it did not believe the current remuneration package is adequate to compensate members for the planned changes and wishes to enter into further negotiations.  That is the most up-to-date position on that.</p></speech>

Mr. Finnegan is referring back to the prepayments note.  The note states &ndash; which you gave to us but we did not query in detail &ndash; was that the print equipment had been purchased in 2018 at a cost of &euro;1.169 million.  In this chart, he is telling us the figure was &euro;1.369 million, out by &euro;200,000.  It had been purchased.  Accordingly, he knew the price.  Why did he put in a figure of &euro;1.169 million when the cost of the equipment purchased was &euro;1.369 million?  Will he explain the two figures to me?</p></speech>

There is a figure of &euro;1.169 million in the account that Mr. Finnegan referred to a number of times.</p><p>That is not the figure he has given us today for what was actually purchased.  It is out by &euro;200,000.  That is the first point I am making.  I thought we would conclude this matter today but I cannot allow that until we get an explanation for the difference of &euro;200,000.  My second point is that Mr. Finnegan said they did not pursue that issue in greater detail.  That was July.  Print equipment was listed at &euro;1.169 million: "A delay in delivery and installing the printing equipment was due to a requirement (not originally anticipated) to upgrade the print room to meet health and safety standards which will be completed in July 2019."  That is the month we were here.  There is a reference there to &euro;1.169 million.  The figure Mr. Finnegan has given us today for completing all the works done, including the OPW work, is &euro;2.02 million.  That is an increase of 73%.  I know he did not have the full figures for the &euro;2 million in July but even if we had questioned that, we would only have been halfway to the figure.</p><p> The issue here is not that we did not pursue the accounts and the accounts Mr. Finnegan produced refer to &euro;1.169 million.  The public now knows that the final cost, which was not known to Mr. Finnegan fully on the day, is &euro;2.02 million.   The figures being quoted here today, 12 December, have risen by 73% versus those that were quoted here on 11 July.  They have gone up from &euro;1.169 million to &euro;2.02 million.  That is the issue.  There is no indication in that text that structural work is required.  The phrase "upgrade of print room" indicates that a new printer is coming in.  It looked a reasonable figure.  There was no suggestion it required structural works to the extent that it did.  The point is that figure is nowhere near the complete figure because Mr. Finnegan did not have it.  It is not fair to say we did not pursue it.  The figure is 73% higher today than was reported by Mr. Finnegan in July.  That is where the public have the concern.  There was a budget at the beginning and the Houses of the Oireachtas Service was within the budget at that point in time, according to this.  However, as the year progressed what was indicated to be &euro;1.169 million turned out to be &euro;2.02 million when all the other work was done.  That 73% increase is why the public is concerned.  Does Mr. Finnegan get that?</p></speech>

They come to a total of &euro;123,000 and &euro;78,000, respectively.  That is the difference of &euro;202,000 between those two figures.  That explains it.  I would respectfully point out that both the figure in my report and the figure in the note to the account are both correct.</p></speech>

A reasonable person reading those figures will see &euro;200,000 of a difference.  If we did not extract that, we would be none the wiser and we might be accused of not asking the right question.  It would have been helpful had that been explained.  Regardless of that, the figure has gone from &euro;1.69 million last July to &euro;2.02 million today.</p></speech>

At no point does it say there that this will result in additional costs.  That is the issue.  If we had seen that, we would have asked.  It appears as if there is no difficulty here.  There is a delay in installing it but it does not say there is going to be additional costs.  </p></speech>

Mr. Finnegan wants to come back in as well.  Because there were a couple of references to the accounts presented and the questions being asked and not being asked, I am stopping the meeting at this point for this intervention, to compare what was in front of us then with what is in front of us now.  There is a 73% increase.  That is all I am saying.  Mr. Finnegan need not go through it.  The schedules explain the figure we are at today and we know where we were then.</p></speech>

Just to explain as a point of information, the figure the Chair is quoting is &euro;2.02 million.  The figure that will ultimately be recorded in our accounts in respect of the upgrading work is &euro;314,000.  I am advised that figure will be reimbursed to the OPW in 2020.  It will, therefore, feature in the 2020 appropriation account.  The other figure that relates to the legacy works carried out by the OPW is on page 10.  That is &euro;221,000 and is paid from the Vote of the Office of Public Works, not the Vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.</p></speech>

When everything is added in, to pick up on a point that I noted the Deputy made when she was considering my first report, we had inadvertently left out the storage charge of &euro;12,000.  The other thing which we have included, to give an accurate picture, is the cost of outsourcing since this problem arose.  We have included a figure of &euro;100,000.  A true cost of the equipment, the works, storage and outsourcing costs is approximately &euro;1.8 million inclusive of VAT.</p></speech>

We had a risk register at the time but it was never put on the risk register.  If I may briefly explain, we have done a lot since then.  We appointed a chief risk officer last year.  Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Devlin fulfils that role.  We have a new draft risk management strategy, a risk management framework, that has been to our audit committee.  That will be formally adopted in the first part of next year.</p></speech>

In the public sector, we do an awful lot of printing and that machine is capable of doing certainly some of that printing.  We can optimise the value of that machine.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on that point.  The area I want to touch on is the role of Komori in all this.  We have had an extensive discussion of nearly two hours and we have not really mentioned the role of Komori.  Given the detail that has been provided by Mr. Finnegan on that site visit on 21 May 2018 by its representatives, including the managing director, the project director and the managing director of its Irish agent, to the print facility at Kildare House and given that height was specifically discussed and that from the evidence available to Mr. Finnegan everyone expressed satisfaction with the head height, has there been any admission of liability on behalf of Komori in respect of this in terms of the conversations that there have been?  As a follow-up question, from the legal point of view for the Houses of the Oireachtas, has that avenue been explored given that three of the senior staff within that company expressed satisfaction that everything was okay with the dimensions of the room in their physical site visit, leaving aside the drawings?</p></speech>

One is an admission of liability by Komori in respect of this, given that its representatives conducted a site visit and expressed at least satisfaction or did not even indicate that there were any problems from that.  Two, has that been followed up?  Given that Mr. Finnegan has had discussions with the managing director, MD, of the Irish agent, has Mr. Finnegan explored whether there are legal avenues open to the Oireachtas in that context given that it is such a capital asset and that the company had staff on the ground examining the area in which it would be placed?</p></speech>

I asked him to look at the facts of it.  His position is, as he stated back to me in response, that from his point of view, his company flagged the fact that there was limited head height in the tender response, that the company sent a drawing to us also and that, ultimately, as a company, it would take the view of the available height, which it said was 2.85 m, that it would have installed printing presses in printing works at and below that height.  He said to me that, as a company, Komori would take the view - he was careful to stipulate that he is only the agent and that I would need to speak to the managing director of Komori itself - and the general approach it would take would be that if the customer was happy, Komori would supply the machine and that the legal obligation would be on the customer.  I went back and I checked that with our legal people.  Our legal people advised me that given the warnings, given the fact that there was limited head height, and given the fact that the drawings were sent in etc., we would not be in a position to argue that Komori breached its contract.  That, unfortunately, is the reality.<br/><br/>I am exploring other avenues in terms of speaking to our legal advisers to see if there is a possibility that we would set out in writing what happened, the concerns, how we feel the procurement and the provision of the machine were dealt with, and whether they would be prepared on an <i>ex gratia</i>basis to make some contribution or gesture to the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of this machine.  That is something that I am pursuing.</p></speech>

We would be in an even worse position because we would have a machine that was fully installed, the machine would have to have been removed from the print unit, and we would have had to do those works.</p></speech>

Had they examined that previous piece of work in 2004 given that substantial works had to be done as well to complement the installation of machines at that point?  If they did so, what was costed in terms of work?  Was there anything costed for this particular work prior to the issues emanating?  Beyond the removal of door frames, was there any substantial work costed for the original piece?</p></speech>

The decision, ultimately, was of 2007.  The machines were moved from their old locations around Leinster House - they were in different locations - and we did the works in Kildare House that are there today.  The print unit that we have at the moment is, I suppose, specifically geared towards printing and that is where the costs arose.</p></speech>

With regard to the 30 May phone call or email that he referenced in terms of the facilities unit contacting the OPW to say that the contract had been agreed, was that the first contact between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the OPW?</p></speech>

That is the puzzling thing about it.  I cannot explain it but that is what happened.  I have asked two of the people that were present on the day and they did not realise it was there until this issue arose.  They pulled out the RFT, looked at it saw that note.  It was a major oversight.</p></speech>

Did they acknowledged it then?  Again, I ask this from the point of view of whether they had the expertise.  If they had seen that and referenced it, and had it not been missed, would the people involved have had the expertise to realise the importance of what was being flagged?</p></speech>

There was absolutely no sense whatsoever that height was an issue.  Even if they had seen that note - this is just my own opinion but it is based on the general conversations I have had over the past number of weeks - I think they still would have gone ahead with it.  It was just a major blind spot and that is what comes across time and time again, no matter where I look and who I speak to on this project.  I am really sorry about the way this project worked out but there was just a big mistake made.  It was human error.  That is all I can say.</p></speech>

I have not read in any of Mr. Finnegan's statements or in his two reports that he went directly to printing firms and asked whether they wanted to look at this tender, when he only got one tender back.  He stated under questioning that he went to European companies.  As Komori is a Japanese firm, I presume it has an office somewhere here.  My point is that for something so significant, did Mr. Finnegan not think to go, or did he not go, directly to firms and ask whether they had machines which would be suitable in the context of the tender?</p></speech>

Another member asked if this process was rushed.  I feel that it was and that it was rushed unnecessarily.  I appreciate that there were escalating costs but, ultimately, I feel the process was rushed and it was an unnecessary rush.  Notwithstanding his two reports and the apology contained within them - and the lessons learned, which are very important - the installation was not considered in the context of cost, to paraphrase Mr. Finnegan.  For example, on the costs relating to the air condition unit, the machine was supposed to be installed in one room but it ended up in another.  I presume that was due to its size.  What I would like to know is whether the air conditioning was not already present.  Was this an upgrade?  Was it necessary because of the machine or was it due to happen in any event?  I direct that question to Mr. Cahill.</p></speech>

Komori was responsible for the installation and gave us a drawing of how that would fit and what needed to be taken down to do that.  In the context of the area we are talking about, when we talk about structure, it is not the structure of the building, it is all the structure which went in in 2004, which holds all the plant above it and allows access to the air conditioning, which my colleague, Jim O'Sullivan, can talk about.  It is about the amount of air conditioning because these machines produce heat and there is a need for fresh air and all the rest of it.</p></speech>

The current printer is 14 or 15 years old and was probably designed four or five years prior to purchase.  It is, therefore, 20 year old technology and quite old.  I suspect there will be long-term cost savings.  I would like the committee to receive a projection cost for the printer versus the operating cost of an inferior printer.  That will be difficult to do because only one quote was received.  However, there are other machines out there.</p> <p>  I understand where Mr. Finnegan is coming from in relation to his previous appearance before this committee.  I understand that he has an account of what happened and members have been provided that account.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does his thing with his office and, ultimately, members of the committee ask questions.  I will highlight the point made by the Chairman, which is a worthy one, that there are only two accountants on this committee, both of whom happen to be chartered accountants.  This makes life interesting for Secretaries General and other Departments.  It is important that when we ask a question the witness answers the question to the best of his ability and in his words, and also that he could sometimes provide us with a bit more information.  I think that in July, when Mr. Finnegan appeared before the committee, he knew some of what he knows now and, notwithstanding the fact that the note was missed, there were additional costs that were not included in the account to the reader.  I know Mr. Finnegan has said these were provided further down in the notes and the Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that.  Pulling everything together and providing the committee with as much information as possible is absolutely critical when a witness comes before us.  I thank Mr. Finnegan.</p> <p>  After the other members have spoken, it would be interesting to hear the Comptroller and Auditor General's view.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to forgive me as I was not present during the previous hearing and did not hear his commentary.  I would be interested to know, on foot of today's meeting, what his views are. </p></speech>

We were aware of that.  It was a charge in the 2018 account.  We were aware that there was a problem.  Our understanding of it was that it was a health and safety consideration in relation to the capacity of the floor to carry the machine.  We were not at all aware of an issue with head height.  When there was any reference to structural works we presumed it was strengthening a floor.  We would have received the financial statements at the end of March.  I reviewed them in May and that was the first I heard that there was an issue around a recognition of a capital asset.  The team had already been talking to the Houses of the Oireachtas about whether or not it was appropriate to recognise capital assets.  We felt it was not and we said that assets that are not even on the premises cannot be recognised as assets on the balance sheet.  We proposed a prepayments note to deal with a number of classes of assets.  We were aware that there might be additional costs associated with the installation of the machine as a result of the floor strengthening, as we understood it, but it was inevitably going to be a 2019 expense.  We were not thinking of it being a 2020 expense.  Therefore, my feeling was that we will look back at this when we come to do the 2019 account and if at that stage there was something that was worth reporting, we would consider making a reference in the audit certificate.  In fact, our first preference and expectation in a situation like this where it is a relatively small-scale expenditure but with a weakness in controls and so on would be that sufficient detail would be given in a note to the accounts to explain what had happened.  Obviously, however, it was all overtaken by events.  Without prejudice to whether I will report anything or encourage any further reporting in relation to the matter for 2019, it has obviously been very well ventilated here, which may mean that I do not need to draw further attention to it in the 2019 accounts or the 2020 accounts when they come to be presented.</p></speech>

My knowledge of what was going on was limited but one of the things that struck me when reading through the documents was the way this evolved over time.  I would defer to my colleagues from the OPW but one of the initial things that took up so much time was the whole load-bearing capacity of the floor.  That was a very big issue in February, March and April of this year.  When one looks at the history of the project, from the time the OPW said there was actually more to this than we had thought to the time the works commenced, that was over the course of a year.  A lot of works took place over that year.  From looking at the documents, we can see that the floor was a big issue.  The architect brought in Ove Arup, the structural engineers, to look at the floor.  Now that the project is over, there appear to be clear dimensions to the project.  During the course of the year, however, it was actually quite unclear at stages as to what was going on.  That is just the way it was.  That is just how the project unfolded, unfortunately.</p></speech>

The car park originally had a slope, but work was carried out in 2004 to level it, and the question was whether that was sufficient to take the load.  That was the initial query our engineers had.  They were looking at the loads coming in, the size of the boxes, whether they could come down the ramp and how to manage them and get them in.  The next issue was whether there would be enough capacity on the floor when the machine was operating.  It turned out we did and the load could be spread out, but we had to do that exercise to inform the amount of work that was needed.</p></speech>

While the Heidelberg printing press could have gone on for another while, it is clear that the Houses would have needed a new machine at some point in the near future to fulfil our needs.  I bring this up in respect of health matters all the time, but was leasing ever considered?  I know from my own operations and the large Mitsubishi printing units I use for printing photos quickly and so on, that normal business practice is not to pay the costs up front, but to sign a lease agreement with maintenance included.  That way, if the machine blows up, the company will provide another one.  Was that option ever considered as part of the business case, or was it a clear-cut decision to buy a new machine?</p></speech>

I do not think the leasing option was ever considered.  That is another lesson.  There are so many lessons from all of this for everyone involved.  The other options apart from purchasing should be explored in business cases, and the calculations should be done to see what the bottom line would look like.  At the end of the day, one is looking is to get the very best value one can for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is simpler when dealing with other people's money, those other people being the taxpayers.  We have to be conscious of that in our decision-making in the future.</p> <p>  Mr. Finnegan mentioned that Komori ticked two boxes when it came to the height.  Is there a legal basis for getting money back, given that Komori ticked those boxes?  If height was not the company's issue, why did it send someone to the site?  What is the point of a site visit?  Is it about making friends, or looking at the dimensions of the room?  I am not having a go at Mr. Finnegan.  I am just wondering why anyone came out if he or she was not going to measure anything.</p></speech>

I will send the witnesses a note afterwards.  I just wonder why the plant had to be directly above it.  The first lesson learned is that one should have a specialist architect involved.  I suggest that having someone who can measure would help.  Is it the case that, despite all these teams and project managers, nobody was 100% in charge?  Was that the problem?  No one was responsible for the ultimate decision, checking that boxes were ticked, and checking the height.  Nobody said that this was very expensive, very big or very heavy and asked to make sure things were 100% right before it was bought.  Is it fair to say that is a failing in the system?</p></speech>

Mr. Finnegan has been asked every question possible and all of the questions I was going to ask but because it is so serious I want to add a few comments and questions.  I will begin by saying I accept the business case.  I am half a businessman myself and the Oireachtas did the right thing in purchasing the machine.  There is no question about that.  The public in general will accept the existing printers were old, they were reaching the age where they had to be decommissioned and the Oireachtas bought a new machine.  Everyone accepts this and the reasons.  Are there any recovery costs from the old machines?  When the new machine is up and running will there be any moneys to be recovered from the old machines?</p></speech>

The new machine was &euro;848,000 excluding VAT and we got &euro;40,000 for the old machines so we paid &euro;808,000.</p></speech>

I do not know why.  It is probably because of the national children's hospital and broadband.  There is a general feeling out there in the public.  This is a general feeling I am getting as a politician, that politics, politicians, civil servants and public servants are playing with taxpayers' money and they do not take accountability.  This is the general feeling out there.  This is another comedy of errors that is happening, whether in Dublin or wherever, and people are very angry over it.  They are angry because we have a housing crisis, a trolley crisis and a health crisis and they see what they feel is a waste of money.  I hear it myself at meetings in my area.  They see it as a waste of money with no accountability.  I do not want anyone's head to roll but there must be lessons learned and there must be responsibility taken for it.  Mr. Finnegan named out a litany of people and various bodies involved in this over the past two years but it happened again.</p> <p>  I know Mr. Finnegan said there should have been an architect giving advice and that it was a mistake by someone that an architect was not brought in at the beginning.  An architect had to be brought in later.  I have several questions I want to ask for the public.  How much does Mr. Finnegan feel could have been saved if an architect had been involved at the beginning?  We hear different figures.  We have heard &euro;1.169 million, &euro;1.369 million, &euro;2 million and now that the OPW is involved it has gone to &euro;2.5 million. There were figures of &euro;1.169 million and &euro;1.369 million at the beginning and now it has gone to &euro;2.5 million.  This is what people see and they ask how someone can stand over this type of an increase with all of the different things that went wrong.  Will Mr. Finnegan show where we could have saved that money that was spent because of the mistakes that were made?</p></speech>

I understand the public anger over this.  It is a matter of deep personal regret that it happened.  We speak about accountability and as the head of this organisation I am here today to account and answer every question I can.  I have tried to help in every way possible in terms of preparing reports and being transparent about the process but I genuinely understand public anger.  I have heard it myself.  It is an awful lot of money.  There is a perception, and it is correct, that the project was not well managed and nobody can deny this.</p> <p>  In terms of what would have happened had this project run according to plan, let me make the assumption, if I may, that the Komori printing press is the correct machine.  I have no evidence whatsoever that it is not so I will make this assumption.  An architect would have been brought in on day one.  The architect would have advised the project team that a machine of the type it was purchasing would require significant architectural works.  The cost of those works would have been very similar to the costs that turned out.  Ultimately, the big costs we would not have incurred were the level of outsourcing and the storage costs.</p></speech>

They are the actual costs that we incurred where we should not have incurred them; &euro;112,000 is an awful lot of money, it really is.  I understand why people are very annoyed over it.  I have worked through this myself over the past three weeks.  I have been very annoyed over it myself.  I have worked through all of this process.  Ultimately, when we look at this in the round and go back to 2004 and see the costs incurred then and the costs incurred now, they are not dramatically out of line.  The cost of the equipment, I think, came in at &euro;1.8 million.  If we take out the outsourcing and storage, the costs are around &euro;1.7 million.  For me, this is a 15 year investment.  It is &euro;1.7 million over 15 years.  If we do the sums it is somewhere in the order of &euro;100,000 per year for printing.  That is probably a reasonable sum, at &euro;2,000 per week, if we were to look at what the cost would be if we were to outsource.  Let us suppose the Oireachtas did not do printing at all.  One of the other things that has come out of this is that Members have legitimate printing needs in terms of communicating with their constituents.  This is an essential and fundamental role of public representatives.  It is something we try to support Members in doing.  If Members were to communicate with their constituents via an outsource model the cost would be substantially more.  In the same way as doing an analysis of leasing versus buying, if we do a further analysis of just outsourcing instead of doing something I suspect that would be the most expensive option of all.</p></speech>

Some of my colleagues here today have made statements such as "shopping sprees", as if Mr. Finnegan is going off spreading the money.  I do not accept that either.  I do not want to be associated with stating Mr. Finnegan was on a shopping spree as if he is going out buying for Santy Claus.  That is not a remark that I agree with.  What we need to bring back into the whole system, including us as politicians, is that the public has confidence in us to handle public money and handle taxpayers' money right and spend it accordingly.  Our job on the Committee of Public Accounts is to follow the money and make sure everyone is accountable for what money they spend and that it is not being wasted.  This is the most important thing.  This is why I agree with the Chairman that in his remarks today Mr. Finnegan came across badly.</p></speech>

I am sure there are health and safety issues and perhaps there will be union issues regarding extra pay or extra moneys for handling the machine.  Are all the costs finished with or could there be more than the &euro;2.5 million when all of this is seen through?  The machine might not be up and running as soon as Mr. Finnegan thinks.  There might be further storage costs.  What are the storage costs since 2018?</p></speech>

There is no question of that ever having been Mr. Finnegan's intention.  What got people is that the equipment ultimately cost &euro;1.369 million.  Then, because work had to be done on the building after the machine had been purchased, it ended up costing &euro;1.8 million or thereabouts.</p></speech>

Where the Oireachtas was caught was that there was an earlier figure out there that we mentioned in the accounts, of &euro;1.69 million.  We find, however, six months later, that to complete the process, which was still evolving at a time of Mr. Finnegan's last appearance here, it ended up being closer to &euro;2 million.</p> <p>  It was the way in which the information became known.  Nobody doubts the value of the work that was done by OPW and the necessity of the national Parliament to have its own printing works and not to have to outsource it and to rely upon private sector printers somewhere out on the M50 to get material in and out to it.  A Parliament has to have control over certain aspects of its own activities.  That is why I would say, as Chairman, that it would be important to have these facilities in-house and that they be up to scratch.  Because of our location here in Dublin 2, we are fairly restricted because of space, something we understand.</p></speech>

If that had been addressed earlier, when the printer was being purchased, we could have waited six months because of the need to do some structural works, and things might have unfolded substantially differently.  The cost might not have been significantly different, however, if we had known about the costs that would be involved in the structural work earlier in the play, rather than later.  People will always understand when one is initiating any project that is going to cost &euro;1 million and ends up costing more that if one had known at the outset that it would cost a larger figure, people would have been prepared for it and would have understood it.  Nobody is suggesting there was waste of any money but it is the sequencing of the way the information came out.</p> <p>  I acknowledge, which I also said at our earlier meeting, that Mr. Finnegan went to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in November 2017, which is over two years ago, and said that this was going to cost approximately &euro;1.5 million.

When all is said and done, the current position is not that far from that ballpark figure.

There may be a facility to get some value out of this printer during the quieter periods when the D&aacute;il is in recess and there is not the same printing demand.  Neighbouring public bodies in the public service, or other aspects or activities of the D&aacute;il might be directed in that way.  I will throw that suggestion out there.</p> <p>  At this stage, I thank all the witnesses from the Houses of the Oireachtas for coming in.  Coincidentally, I believe Mr Finnegan was present at the last meeting before the summer recess and he is here now at the last meeting before the Christmas break.  I also want to thank our colleagues in the OPW, as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.  Mr. Finnegan will be pleased to know we have finished our public discussion on this except for whatever information we have requested that might be worked through to us in the weeks ahead.  In fairness to the public who want this thing explained, we have done our best to clarify all the issues out there and I believe we have done a good job for the public service-----</p></speech>
