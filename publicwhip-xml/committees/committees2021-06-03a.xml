I thank the committee for the work it did on this Bill at pre-legislative stage, which was more extensive than any previous pre-legislative process and was effectively akin to Committee Stage, given that there were so many amendments in written draft form rather than just the heads of a Bill.  The amendments, most of which were incorporated in a revised draft of the Bill, that the committee proposed were beneficial in strengthening the Bill.  The work that the committee did was exemplary in that regard and I thank its members.</p><p>The first of my four amendments reflects a commitment in the programme for Government to end the issuing of new licences for exploration and extraction of gas.  A similar decision was taken by the previous Government in 2019 in respect of oil exploration and extraction.  My Department is no longer accepting new applications for exploration licences for either natural gas or oil.  The amendment in this Bill will implement that decision.</p><p>Subsection (1) in amendment No. 230 repeals the Minister's power to grant petroleum prospecting licences, licensing options, exploration licences, lease undertakings and petroleum leases under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, subject to certain saving provisions to which I will refer shortly.  This subsection is drafted to ensure that the Minister's power to revoke licensing options and lease undertakings is maintained.</p><p>Subsections (2) to (6) provide for the limited situations in which further authorisations may be granted.  Existing authorisations will not be affected by the repeal of the provisions of the 1960 Act, in that they will continue to be able to apply to progress through the licensing stages.  This is necessary to allow existing authorisations, some of which have been in place for more than ten years, to reach a natural conclusion in accordance with their existing terms and conditions, given that the State and the companies involved entered into those agreements in good faith.</p><p>We have already seen the effect of recent changes in policy.  At the end of September 2019, shortly after the then Taoiseach's announcement that new exploration for oil would end, there were 55 authorisations under regulation.  In the latest quarterly acreage report published by my Department, which set out the position at the end of March 2021, there were only 29.  I expect this number to decline further as authorisations expire or are relinquished, with no new authorisations for exploration and extraction replacing them.</p><p>The saving provisions also provide for petroleum prospecting licences, PPLs, to be granted to the holders of other authorisations.  We are doing this because, as in the case of licensing options and lease undertakings, the licensing terms require the holders of those authorisations to also hold a PPL.  Holders of exploration licences and petroleum leases may also require a PPL in certain special circumstances where it may be necessary for the authorisation holder to acquire data outside the boundary of its authorised area in order to inform fully any work directly relevant within its authorisation.  In the case of a petroleum leaseholder, it is not uncommon during the lifetime of a producing field for new seismic data to be acquired for purposes that include monitoring changes to the field through time as a result of production.  However, it is important to note that holding a PPL does not entitle the licensee to any further petroleum authorisation.  It is also important to remember that any application for follow-on authorisation or applications to conduct activity in the Irish offshore under existing authorisations will remain subject to ministerial consent and will continue to be required to meet environmental, technical and financial standards.</p><p>These amendments will ensure that no petroleum authorisations for new exploration can be granted while allowing existing authorisations to apply to progress, with the applications remaining subject to assessment by my Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#D00900"><p>I wonder about some of these amendments in terms of where along the schedule they will have implications for existing licences.  Do they apply to all existing licences or tentative ones?  At what stage of the licensing process will licences be caught by these provisions or excluded?</p> <p>  We have discussed energy security in the D&aacute;il Chamber in terms of ensuring that we do not have blackouts.  The Sunday newspapers wrote much about the concerns in that regard at the weekend.  This brings me to the issue of assessment.  We have an energy review.  It is important that we see that information so that there can be confidence in the security of our energy supply for the years ahead and that we are not facing a cliff edge, as some call it.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed amendments to deal with future situations where this legislation, including the Minister's amendment, might be contested.  They related to dispute settlement and the likes of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  That they were ruled out of order was disappointing.</p> <p>  We did not get to discuss amendment No. 1, but a point that will run through this debate is people having confidence that we are making decisions based on sound and up-to-date information that is made publicly available and to which communities and different sectors can contribute.  This is an important matter that relates to this amendment and will arise time and again during our discussions on this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#D01000"><p>I will give the Deputy the details.  Of the 29 existing authorisations, three are petroleum leases, only one of which is currently producing.  That is the Corrib gas field.  Four are lease undertakings, 18 are exploration licences, two are licensing options and two are petroleum prospecting licences.</p><p> The issue of energy security was debated extensively in recent years at hearings of previous Oireachtas committees.  We must remember that, statistically, our success rate in terms of the number of offshore wells drilled has been very low, even if there are 29 authorisations.  The strike rate in terms of discovering commercially recoverable oil or gas has been very low.  Anyone who argues that we will be energy secure on the basis of oil and gas exploration is mistaken and promoting false security.  The issue of security on our grid system is a completely different issue.  The Sunday newspapers were correct that we have an issue with gas-fired power generation being out of commission at present.  That will present a challenge for the coming winter.  We will have to manage our supply and demand very carefully in the coming years.  In many ways, that is a separate issue and it is not related to the issue of offshore oil and gas exploration.</p><p> With regard to the analysis of the switch away from oil and gas and the ending of new authorisations for oil and gas exploration, Mr. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, stated when presenting the agency's world energy outlook at recent conferences and in giving its assessment of what we need to do for climate that every country needs to acknowledge the need to stop exploration for new oil and start cutting off the supply line of new fossil fuels.  The Government and that which preceded it have probably been ahead of others in doing this.  I have met representatives of the very small number of countries, including Costa Rica and Denmark, that have taken similar policy approaches.  The number is growing and will continue to do as I have described.  The Danes will be continuing with extraction and production for quite some time but they are taking a similar approach in that while they are not stopping existing authorisations, there are stopping new ones.  That is the approach we are taking.  What we are doing is very much in line with the leading-edge countries in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#E00200"><p>I confirm I am on the campus of Leinster House.  This is an historic move by the Minister.  It is exceedingly welcome.  Ireland will be among a handful of countries across the globe that will be banning oil and gas exploration.  I worry, however, why the Minister has felt the need to double down in this Bill on existing legislation, thereby allowing companies that have licences to move on to the next level.  While it is welcome that the Bill will prevent future licensing, why does the Minister want to double down on what is already in legislation?  I find that slightly worrying although it is very welcome news that several of the licences have expired and are not being renewed.  Why does the Minister want and feel the need to double down on what is already written into legislation?  Would enshrining it in this Bill, by way of a double whammy, not give reassurance to the fossil fuel industry that regardless of circumstances and if we failed to meet our targets and something awful happened on the planet, we would allow it to?  I agree with the Minister that we do not want a native fossil fuel industry.  We have moved beyond that.  Time is running out.  We need to move away from fossil fuel extraction.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the mass movement that pushed this issue.  It repeatedly stated we need system change, not climate change, and that fossil fuel should be kept in the ground.  That was the main slogan.  It is a great tribute to those people, mainly the young, who fought so hard to get us to this point.  It is welcome but I have questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#E00300"><p>I agree that it is a significant and positive development.  The Deputy introduced legislation in this area four years ago.  At the same time, almost on the same day, we had similar legislation.  There was one variation or difference in that we accepted from the start that in any move of the kind in question, existing authorisations would work through to their conclusions.  The Deputy's legislation sought to stop the authorisations at the point of enactment.</p> <p>  One reason for our approach is that the State acts in good faith in terms of abiding by contracts it enters into and meeting expectations.  We do not have a stop-start approach to legislation and policy if we have initiated a process.  That is important because we are now turning the Department's and State's resources for the issuing of prospecting licences and the regulation of the development of energy at sea towards the development in future years of offshore wind, tidal and wave energy.  There are very similar mechanisms of authorisation, prospecting, licensing and planning.  We need to provide very complex legal certainty on the environment for the development of that critical resource for us to tackle climate change.</p> <p>  The State has done well in the context of the integration of wind power.  One reason for this, according to people in the industry, is that we do not change course.  When we have set ourselves on a course, we try to stick to it.  That is important because, considering the major investment required for the climate transition, we do not need a stop-start approach.  For that reason, among others, we are allowing the existing authorisations to work through to their conclusions.  I expect that my commentary will not lead to production but we will have to watch out for that.  At the same time, we will have to ramp up the development of offshore wind energy in particular.</p></speech>

It is a bit like crossing our fingers and hoping it will not.  It is a real shame that the provision is being included in the Bill because we have not, in fact, entered into contracts with any of the relevant companies.  They have licences, which is quite different.  What the Minister is saying is that, regardless of how circumstances pan out, we are the gentlemen of the industry and honour our agreements with companies in the industry.  That is just not good enough.  If, for example, Providence or the Chinese corporations were to find oil and started to drill for it, would that not leave us with considerable egg on our face and make a negative contribution to the battle to stop the overheating of the planet?  I just do not regard this as necessary.  The companies already have licences and the Minister has the right to stop the progression of those licences.  He just admitted he will retain that right.  Why, therefore, is he doubling down on existing legislation if not to reassure what must be a nervous fossil fuel industry instead of letting it know that we are very determined about this?  I do not believe it is about gentlemen's agreements and it is certainly not about contracts because the companies are only owners of licences, nothing else.</p></speech>

There is uncertainty in exploration and drilling for oil and gas but it is certain that Ireland is one of the windiest places on the planet.  The wind, particularly in the north and west of the country, blows with consistency.  I want to use the resources, expertise and capability of the companies to tap into that energy resource.  Working with them in a predictable way is one of the most important ways of securing that investment, particularly for our western, north-western and southern coasts.  That is why it is important that we get this right.</p></speech>

It is important that we outline that the Government needs to carry its weight, that it must do what it needs to do and that it must do what needs to be done on the basis of just transition and equity.  It is important to specify that at the start and within the objective of the Act.  The amendment is as it is and it is relatively simple.</p></speech>

We all know that climate change is not an isolated situation in Ireland alone.  The actions we take have worldwide consequences and it is important to recognise that.  That is why it is important that it should be there in the objective of the Act and why the intentions of the Bill should be specified and broadened out.</p></speech>

It should be supported.  Broadening the objectives of the Bill and strengthening it in that way are very welcome.  It would be a sign of good faith for the next 56 pages of amendments to if the Minister is open to the strengthening of the Bill in this regard.  I look forward to seeing that and although I am unable to vote, I am supportive of the amendment.</p></speech>

It is important that we start and continue through the Bill acknowledging that the point of all of this is to limit the increase in global average temperatures by 1.5&deg;C.

I want to cite where the objective is included in the Bill and is set out clearly in section 5, in the proposed section 3(3), which is probably the most critical section of the legislation:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister and the Government shall carry out their respective functions under sections 4, 5, 6, 6B, 6C and 6D [of this Act] in a manner&mdash;  	(a) that is consistent with the ultimate objective specified in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change done at New York on 9 May 1992, and: <blockquote> 	(i) any mitigation or adaptation commitments entered into by the European Union in response or otherwise in relation to that objective;<br /><br />(ii) the steps specified in Articles 2 and 4(1) of the Agreement done at Paris on 12 December 2015 to achieve that objective ... </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>That is the overarching and most critical international legal course that we are set on and by committing Ministers and Government to carry out all their functions with respect to that, achieves the objective that is contained in this amendment.  That is probably one of the most critical sections in the legislation.</p></speech>

It is fundamental that we base it on science and the technologies we know are relevant to climate change.  I will not go through each of the elements but it is a matter of ensuring that each of those elements is recognised, addressed and acknowledged within this legislation and that when the criteria are being set, each of those elements is considered.</p></speech>

It is important that they are clearly laid out in order that everybody in the future will know what was taken into account and what decisions were made.  It is important that people know what goes into making a decision, on every side of the argument.  That is why the criteria are laid out so specifically in the amendment.</p></speech>

There are already target-setting criteria established in the Bill, which provide that any carbon budget plan or strategy the Government adopts will take account of a number of limited but crucial considerations, such as our EU and international obligations, including the Paris Agreement commitments, as well as the calculated national and voluntary projections.  Those matters are clear and cannot be disputed.  We need to be wary of introducing conflicting considerations that might make it impossible to reach agreement on what is a fair budget for Ireland.  We do not want any conflict with the process of bringing forward carbon neutrality objectives by 2045.</p> <p>  The Bill already includes target-setting criteria and considerations when determining how to distribute the budget across relevant sectors and what actions and measures are necessary to achieve the budget and ensure it is economically and socially just.  That is critical.  Ministers must have regard to the extensive list of matters set out under section 4(8) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as inserted by section 6 of the Bill, which is the more appropriate place to set out those criteria.</p></speech>

It is more appropriate to deal with targets in section 6, which amends section 4 of the 2015 Act, where we get down to detailed actions and considerations Ministers must take.  That is the place where we take into account the more specific criteria.</p></speech>

However, the discussion thus far is not encouraging.  We have all gone to the bother of spending time putting amendments together to try to improve the Bill.  There is a huge amount of overlap in wording, in some instances, and certainly in the spirit of what is being proposed in the various amendments.  Many of them have been ruled out of order and that is an issue.</p> <p>  I support this amendment and the other amendments coming forward that look and sound like it.  They are all trying to do the same type of thing, which is to make the legislation more explicit in terms of targets and accountability for those targets, and ensuring the process of getting to those targets is fair and equitable and that the voice of communities and sectoral representatives are heard.  We need to see more from the Minister in this regard or we will have a problem with the Bill every step of the way.</p></speech>

I am doing so on the basis of extensive advice from my Department.  The Bill has been significantly scrutinised and redrafted on the back of this committee's engagement and it has gone through incredibly extensive legal analysis and further redrafting.  It is a redrafting of existing 2015 legislation.  It is not fresh ground we are going over; it is something that has been carefully examined.  It is hugely significant politically, with huge consequences in terms of the roll-out and the structures of the public service.  It is not a Bill that will be easily further amended.</p> <p>  I mean no disrespect to the committee in saying that.  It reflects the amount of work that has been done and the balancing that has been achieved within Government and within Departments and elsewhere to get it right.  I think we have a very good Bill.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about trying to improve it further and so on, but I also have to take into account the many other considerations in terms of the broad agreement we have on what is already hugely significant and consequential legislation.</p></speech>

It seems, in effect, that all these amendments are a waste of time because, as far as he is concerned, he has done an adequate consultation on the Bill.  The advice he has is that nothing can be changed and he has gone as far as he can in terms of making the Bill work.  It looks like we are going to have nothing more than a few days of banging our heads against the wall.</p></speech>

Is he open to accepting any of them?  If not, and if Government members are going to vote against each of them, I have other things I could be doing today and on the two days scheduled for this debate next week.  It would be good if the Minister could clarify his position now.</p> <p>  I am absolutely baffled by the decisions regarding some of my amendments.  I made the point earlier that writing to the Ceann Comhairle will not deal with the fact they were ruled out of order.  I cannot for the life of me understand how bringing forward a target date from 2050 to 2045 will incur any additional expense for the State.  At this stage, it would be really beneficial to everybody who is giving up their time today to this debate to have clarification as to whether the Minister is open to accepting any amendments.</p></speech>

To answer Deputy Whitmore's question, this is critical legislation and it is critical that it gets passed quickly because we want to include this year in the first of the five-year plans.  We want to go to Glasgow being as far advanced as we can be in terms of our climate action plans.  The critical work for this committee, in my mind, will come in delivering the provisions that are already set out in the legislation.  There is a real, significant and important role for the committee as we go into the sectoral analysis and review of the carbon budget, the strategy and the climate action plan.  At every stage in that process, I would like to see as extensive an engagement as possible with members.  The work published today by the committee on the transport sector, to give an example, is hugely significant and very well considered.  We need to do more of that type of work.  That will happen in the autumn, if we can get this legislation through both the D&aacute;il and Seanad in advance of the summer recess, which is the timeline I am hoping to make.</p> <p>  There is no disrespect to the committee on my part, or lack of recognition of the important work it has to do.  I am working on the basis of the advice from my Department and the Attorney General's office.  We have considered every single amendment.  I do not want to give false expectation that there is a strong likelihood of amendments being agreed.  That is not the case.  My approach is on the basis of an assessment of each amendment on its merits and considering, as I said, the balancing act we have to do in terms of what is already very well-amended legislation.</p><p>I will refer to my speaking notes a lot because this is highly complex in many instances.  There is no expectation within those speaking notes that we will be accepting the amendments.  At the same time, we will listen and adjust if a compelling argument is made.  However, as we set out I should be honest with members that this is the recommendation I am getting from my Department.</p></speech>

This is the first Committee Stage debate I have been through.  When we started out in the committee, and started reviewing the climate Bill initially, the recommendation from the Minister and the Department was that we would not have pre-legislative scrutiny.  We pushed back against that and had very extensive pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Minister will agree that the Bill and the amendments were much stronger as a result.</p> <p>  We are now at another point where the committee has a role.  We should be allowed conduct that role and the Minister should engage with us in good faith.  I am disappointed to hear that does not appear to be the case and we will not have that opportunity.  This is really just a listening exercise for the Minister where we talk and he listens, but he still goes ahead with the Bill as it currently stands. </p></speech>

Good faith also means not giving a false picture.  I will say to Deputy Whitmore that we are usually very open to accepting amendments.  We were involved in legislation last year on the establishment of the carbon fund from the National Oil Reserves Agency levy.  The Deputy may recall there was a provision in that, on Committee or Second Stage, where she made the case to amend that legislation to include investment in, and protection of, biodiversity and community investment for this transition.  I was not able to make the amendment in that legislation but I committed to come back to it in this legislation and we have already adjusted it.</p> <p>  It is no lack of willingness to listen and adjust but, to reiterate the point I made, there has not been such significant legislation before the Oireachtas in my time, which goes back to 2002 with a short interval out.  It has major implications for the operations of the State in every aspect of its work.  The work done during pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was, to my mind, highly unusual.  It is very unusual that a draft Bill goes for pre-legislative scrutiny where it is drafted line by line.  In effect, what this committee did in the pre-legislative scrutiny process was akin to Committee Stage, in that line-by-line amended recommendations went back to Government.  We listened and amended, quite significantly, the legislation to reflect that.  There is no disrespect to the committee.  I have engaged in this process very much in good faith, but part of that is being honest about the belief within my Department, and my own view, that the legislation as drafted is very well structured, thanks to the committee as much as anything else.</p></speech>

It is because this Bill is so important that so much effort and dedication was put into these amendments.  There are two streams of amendments to this Bill.  One stream of people genuinely wants to take what we believe is a good Bill and make improvements.  We are coming to a section that will deal with climate justice and just transition.  Much very good work has been done in preparation for this Stage.  It is bitterly disappointing to think that none of the amendments will be accepted. </p> <p>  I am agnostic as to which climate justice amendments will be accepted, or what parts of them will be accepted but there is a very real need to improve that area and that language in this Bill.  As groundbreaking as the pre-legislative scrutiny was for this Bill, we should not consider it an outlier and something that will not happen too often.  It should be the basis for future legislation and not treated as something that happened this one time and probably will not happen again.  It should be built upon through all Stages.  </p> <p>  The danger is that the goodwill and engagement built up through pre-legislative scrutiny and carried through to Second Stage will be lost now.  We could end up having quite a testy, negative experience when this returns to the Chamber.  That is not something that anyone on the committee, any of the spokespeople or anyone passionate about this wants to see.  I hope between now and the meeting this afternoon, and the scheduled meetings next week, the Minister might reconsider his approach and what is written in the speaking notes.  He has the expertise and the experience, going back many years, to be able to judge what can and cannot be put in and what concessions and compromises can be made.  I ask at this stage that he revisits that.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Whitmore, my assessment is that of my officials, the Office of the Attorney General and the whole of Government, which has paid razor sharp attention to this legislation as it affects every Department.  I also have to listen to them and heed their advice.  That is something I will do.</p></speech>

That is not fair to us.  We all have a lot to do and if the Minister is going to reject amendments we should know that from the outset, rather than go through these things one by one.</p> <p>  The impact of this will mostly be on activists.  Many seasoned activists, people the Minister knows very well, will be very disappointed by the rejection of these amendments.  The amendments are not coming from just anywhere. They are not frivolous or meaningless but are there to try to strengthen what the Minister states is very important, seismic and historic legislation.  We agree with him on that, but seasoned campaigners and, indeed, eminent scientists are worried about the weaknesses in the Bill.  They want to see issues like climate justice, just transition, carbon budgets and carbon capture and storage considered in more detail and done better.  </p> <p>  The Minister is not just rejecting the representations of Deputies on the committee but also a huge tranche of the movement, who sat around for endless hours, as the Minister probably knows, scrutinising the Bill and suggesting amendments that will now be rejected.  It that is what the Minister is going to do, it is important for us to know and he should tell us early on.  As has been said, we can all have a big row when it gets to Fifth Stage in the D&aacute;il but we are not really going to strengthen this Bill.  It will be left with gaping holes and historic weaknesses. </p></speech>

The Bill is not strong enough and needs to be improved.  I do not care whether the amendments come from the Opposition or the Minister.  This process needs to be about taking the Bill back to the Minister's colleagues and partners in government, the Attorney General or whoever, and saying he is hearing, loud and clear, that we need to improve on this Bill.  It was improved in the previous pre-legislative, PLS, stage and can be improved on again.</p> <p>  My concern is that the Minister sounds deaf to the deep concerns being expressed by communities throughout the country, which he surely heard loud and clear during the debate on Second Stage.</p><p>There are deep concerns the Bill does not provide protections for our most vulnerable and those who will be worst affected by these climate measures.  The Bill does not go nearly far enough in terms of definitions, commitments and the principles of just transition.  They want, we want and I certainly want more explicit detail on this and commitments from the Government spelled out in legislation.  This would serve two purposes.  It would strengthen the Bill and provide protection for communities.  It would also allay the fears of the detractors of the Bill.  People are playing political games with this stuff.  It is a significant problem for the climate movement generally if we are saying that there is no room for manoeuvre outside of what the Minister is putting forward.  The Minister needs to leave the door open.  He needs to hear what is being said on Committee Stage and come back with amendments based on what he hears.  This needs to be a very important part of what we are doing.</p></speech>

I have listened to some of the scientific concerns.  Amendment No. 107, which I have tabled, tries to address one of the concerns raised.  With regard to the activists and others to whom we listen, the critical work we have to do now is in developing and delivering a climate action plan that is fit for purpose and allows us to use the provisions in the legislation to effect real change for a just transition to achieve climate justice.  This work will not be easy.  It will be hugely contentious.  There are huge gaps in public support.  There are different political views within the Oireachtas as well as outside on what we are going to do.  The time to act is now to deliver this much more ambitious plan.  The committee and Oireachtas have key roles.  The legislation is strong and well structured.  I will engage in this process with full commitment if there are flaws and changes that have to be made.  It is better to be honest and upfront, however.  The Bill as drafted, with some amendments which I have tabled, is what I expect to be progressed to Report Stage.</p></speech>

We are looking for a reflection of what the Climate Change Advisory Council has recommended, which is that in terms of targets biogenic methane coming from agriculture should be dealt with separately to other methane and carbon emissions.  The argument has been put forward by the Climate Change Advisory Council that it should be dealt with separately because carbon and methane coming from agriculture are part of an overall cycle.  As the Minister knows, the issue is the increase in the amount of methane coming from the agricultural sector rather than methane <i>per se</i>.  As the Minister knows, it is part of a cycle.  Methane emitted from animals goes into the atmosphere and converts into carbon dioxide.  This carbon dioxide is then sequestered in the soil and grass and some of it is consumed by animals and goes back into the cycle again.</p><p>We are in a unique situation in Ireland in that we have substantial amounts of marginal land that is unsuitable for tillage.  Globally, there is a big push to move a lot of agricultural land into other types of protein crops where there is not the same scale of emissions, particularly with regard to methane.  If we look at many parts of Ireland where we have marginal land that is completely unsuitable for tillage, producing protein for humans from cattle is the only way the land can be productively used.  It is part of a sustainable process.  As the Minister knows, in the past we had a situation in the Burren where cattle were removed and had to be reintroduced because of the detrimental impact it had on biodiversity.  We had the same with sheep in many upland and mountainous areas along the west coast of Ireland.  A number of animals are required on land to be able to maintain it from an environmental and biodiversity perspective.  The same is the case in many areas of marginal land throughout the country.</p><p>I accept that agriculture has to do its bit to meet the overall climate targets but my concern is that agriculture emissions are the soft option.  The Minister knows from being in the Department, and from having been in the Department with responsibility for energy previously, how difficult it can be at times to get people to move and take the type of actions needed.  I have given the example already of electric buses.  We have to wait until 2023 for the first double-decker electric bus to be on the streets of Dublin even though the Cabinet took the decision in January 2018 to progress along this route and no longer buy fossil fuel buses.  My concern is that when we start to meet the thresholds for 2025 and 2030, and when we have not retrofitted 500,000 homes by 2030 and do not have 1 million electric vehicles on our roads, in order to meet these targets the squeeze will be put on the most vulnerable sector in agriculture, which is our indigenous suckler beef sector.  It produces very carbon-efficient beef on marginal land.</p><p>It produces protein for humans on land that is not suitable for any other form of protein production and carries out a vital role in biodiversity.  The evidence is already there in relation to that.  It is not just me putting forward this argument.  The Climate Change Advisory Council, in its 2020 report, strongly advocated that biogenic methane should be separated out, should be accounted for separately, and should have its own dedicated ring-fenced targets so that agriculture improves and reduces its emissions per kilogram and its emissions per hectare.</p><p> At long last we can see work ongoing, which is building on work I was involved with in respect of smart farming, to improve grassland management and to improve soil sequestration of carbon.  There is an awful lot that can be done in that regard.  There is no point in the agricultural sector carrying its burden, so to speak, on the 2030 targets and on targets beyond that date, if it all is to be nullified, come the eve of 2025 or the eve of 2030, when another scheme is introduced, effectively to reduce overall numbers of suckler cows in Ireland, as we have already seen in the reliefs and supports that have been put in place with Brexit.  It is about putting in place a fair and transparent balance.</p><p> The amendment I put forward here clearly reflects the goal, objective and intention of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  The Minister has already cited our international targets and what we have signed up to internationally.  The committee will be aware that all of these were drafted by industrialised countries.  These are the countries that set the agendas and targets on it.  Yes, they are challenging targets to achieve, but when one considers a country such as Ireland, where we do not have the heavy industry and where 37% of our population lives in isolated rural areas, our geography and our emissions profile is very different to that of other European countries.  That needs to be reflected in how we actually design our targets here.  Personally, I believe that our targets for biogenic methane emissions should be on a European Union level because the policy is developed in the context of CAP.</p><p> The reality is that the vast majority of food products we produce are consumed outside of Ireland.  This should be reflected in the emissions profile of the countries where this food is consumed, and not where it is produced.  This will cause a huge problem further down the road in the way the current system is structured.  We have a perverse situation where the targets, as they are currently designed, will force the wind-down of beef exports from Ireland, where we are the most carbon-efficient beef exporter within the European Union.  This will be replaced with beef coming from South America as part of the overall trade agreements we have.  That beef, coming from the Amazon basin in Brazil, has a carbon footprint 35 times higher than the beef produced here in Ireland.  Yet, in theory, from an accounting point of view, it makes sense.  It makes sense from the point of view of reducing Ireland's emissions profile, which it will do, but it will compound the problem for our atmosphere, our climate and the planet as a whole.   We will be replacing relatively carbon-efficient beef production in Ireland with beef production from South America that is disastrous for the environment and disastrous for the climate.  While that is okay for the accounting mechanism under the agreements that are currently there for the climate targets we have set for ourselves at EU level, it is imperative that we do not go down the same road given the mistakes that are being made with European and global targets, or that we do the same thing here in Ireland.  We should have a very separate and distinct target set for the agricultural sector.</p><p> I want to make it quite clear that I am not talking about agriculture getting a free ride on this.  There is a substantial amount of work that the agricultural sector can do.  The Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, has a huge body of work to do around land use and land use change, which will be key to achieving our overall climate objective targets, and especially in the agricultural sector.  It is imperative that this work is done within a sector specific area because biogenic methane is very different to the carbon dioxide used anywhere else in society and in the economy.</p><p> It is not just the Climate Change Advisory Council.  Our colleagues in Northern Ireland have a very similar structure in agriculture that is also taking the separate approach to biogenic methane.  The Climate Change Committee there has specifically stated that there should be a different target for biogenic methane emissions in Northern Ireland, and that this should be offset against carbon sinks in other parts of the UK.  Members will be aware that New Zealand has also taken a very similar approach on this.  New Zealand has a very similar emissions profile to Ireland's, and it faces similar challenges to us.  They have separated biogenic methane from other forms of methane and other carbon dioxide emissions.  New Zealand has set separate targets on that.  New Zealand is our direct competitor in dairy production and sheep farming.  If we are serious about being fair to all sectors, and if we talk about taking the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council and the scientists who are experts in this area, every single one of them, to a man and woman, has said there needs to be a separate mechanism to calculate biogenic methane and that it should be treated in a different manner.  That is why I have tabled this amendment.</p><p> I hope the Minister will look at this fairly and reasonably.  I have listened intently to what the Minister said earlier, and that there is broad agreement on the Bill.  I accept that the Minister has gone through a tortuous process in securing the agreement on the Bill that he has already secured.  I can understand the Minister's logic for not being willing to budge any further on this and in having to try to go back to the Cabinet to try to get agreement on further changes on it.  I put it to the Minister, however, that we still live in a democracy.  Under our parliamentary procedures the first step is in carrying out amendments to the legislation.  We will also deal with it at a later stage in my amendments where I believe the way it is currently drafted is anti-democratic.  It is important that if the Minister is giving such a role to the Climate Change Advisory Council, which will be enshrined in this legislation and put on a statutory basis, then this key recommendation in the council's report needs to be adopted, included and incorporated into the legislation.</p></speech>

However, I would make a distinction between the vested interests of the agrifood business and the family farm.  The Deputy spoke about how we needed to deal with the increase in the herd over the past ten years.  It has been incredible.  Not only are we exporting to markets around the world, but we are creating those, too.  An Bord Bia sent people out to the Middle East and China to get their middle classes interested in foods they never ate before, for example, dairy produce and beef.  Those markets were created to fill the bank accounts of a certain cohort in our society who gain the most from doing so.  It has not benefited our farmers.  If it had, why would they be outside the meat factory plants or blockading the D&aacute;il and why would the Beef Plan Movement have begun?  Farmers have been left behind.  Continuing with the same policy does not help them.</p><p> I will move on to the science and argue against what is being said.  It is possible to treat biomethane as a special case in how we budget and plan for reductions.  The Government addresses this in its Bill, but that approach does not deal with the science.  In fact, there is no difference in impact on the atmosphere between methane from fossil fuels and biomethane.  There is not a special place for biogenic methane in terms of what it does in heating up the planet and how nature reacts to it.  It is the same gas.  Two separate cases have to be made.  One is for the carbon budget and not touching the beef and dairy industry, but the other is for nature and science.  There cannot be a special place for biogenic methane in the Bill.  One of the problems that arose during our earlier discussion with the Minister is that these matters are not being dealt with seriously.  There are flaws in the Bill, and one of the most serious is that biogenic methane has a special place.  Therefore, we are back to square one.</p><p> A key issue that needs to be addressed is being given an opt-out clause.  This will be viewed through carbon budgets rather than in terms of the science.  We can fool one another.  We might even fool the EU about our emissions if we do enough offsetting and carbon trading, but we will not fool the planet, nature or the science.  What bothers me about this approach is that we are viewing the carbon budget as something we must play around with to mask the reality, that being, there is no difference between biogenic methane and fossil fuel methane even though we are pretending there is to suit the industry.  That is dangerous, and it only suits the high end of the industry, not the family farm.  We need a just transition.  That is why many amendments have been tabled on the centrality of the just transition.  We need a just transition for farmers.</p></speech>

I take on board what Deputy Naughten has said about this matter.  Deputy Naughten spoke about the issue of split targets and putting some meat on the idea of distinct characteristics of biogenic methane as provided for in the Bill.  When I read this amendment and its related amendments, it looked as though biogenic methane would not be considered in the national objective or the Bill's provisions.  One of our recommendations at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and in our report - I believe it was recommendation No. 36 - was that consideration would have to be given and meat would have to be put on the bone, for want of a better term, of what is meant by "distinct characteristics of biogenic methane" and the role of agriculture in society and what its implications would be for accounting and other requirements.</p> <p>  I have a question about this group of amendments, but I would also like to hear from the Minister about the prospect of split targets.  Have they been considered?  They are employed elsewhere.  A reply would inform the committee.</p></speech>

That is critical in this legislation.  How we do this will involve everyone and benefit everywhere.  Under the draft section 6A(9)(a)(ii), the advisory council would take into account relevant scientific advice, including on the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  However, I will not support the amendment in changing the definitions as proposed.  We must be careful with definitions of biogenic and non-biogenic methane.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, biogenic methane covers wetlands, agriculture, including the rearing of ruminants and growing of rice and other crops, landfills, forests, oceans and termites.  Non-biogenic methane includes emissions from fossil fuel mining, biomass burning, waste treatment, geological sources, including geothermal and volcanic methane, and natural gas seepage in sedimentary basins.  Differentiating between definitions right now would be highly complex.</p> <p>  Something else to consider is that the UN process imagines anthropogenic emissions versus natural emissions.  We must differentiate between anthropogenic emissions &ndash; the likes of rice agriculture, livestock, landfills, waste treatment, biomass burning and fossil fuel &ndash; and emissions from natural sources, for example, wetlands, oceans, forests, fires and geological sources.  The definitions in this regard are best managed within the UN and IPCC processes as they must be based on international agreement and international standards.</p> <p>  As set out in the Bill's wording, we must take into account the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  The IPCC report from autumn 2018 recognised we would not reduce biogenic methane emissions or anthropogenic emissions from agriculture and other sectors to zero but we would have to do so in respect of fossil methane, which is the most critical step we must take.  We will have to reduce anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, though.  That is why there is no opt-out.  Every sector must be involved.</p> <p>  I might refer to the international approach.  Last autumn, the EU presented a new methane strategy.  Critically, it differentiated between fossil methane &ndash; to simplify, the petroleum industry's methane &ndash; and biogenic methane.  In this, there is an intimation of how differentiated the treatment could be.  The EU does not set the rules in this regard, though.  In an immediate sense, it sets the rules through CAP and other mechanisms, but Europe will have to adopt international agreements like the Paris process and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, process.  We are working on that with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney. We have a seat on the UN Security Council, which is an opportunity for us to connect the security issue to climate, including the question of how we treat biogenic methane.</p><p>In my contribution to President Biden's big event on climate last month, we referred to the approach we would like to see taken internationally on biogenic methane.  The US climate envoy, former Secretary of State, John Kerry, referred to that in his contribution when he spoken in Dublin recently.  The approach to be taken is to use the likes of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which is an organisation established within the UN system, to look specifically at the management of or approach to short-lived greenhouse gases.</p><p> Everyone knows that methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas.  It is short-lived in the sense that it oxidises in the upper atmosphere into carbon dioxide in a way that is very damaging and climate worrying.  There is real international concern about methane.  The level of methane in the atmosphere is rising rapidly and is of great concern.  I expect to see international scientific reports re-enforcing that later this summer, so we must address the methane issue.  The approach will and should differentiate.  It should take into account best science.  In the measuring and monitoring of this, a recent development has been the establishment of an EU-UN environmental programme, a methane monitoring observatory.  These are the sort of science sources which we will adhere to.</p><p> It is an international agreement which has different implications for different counties.  In regard to the area of agriculture, we should be supporting, wherever possible, agricultural systems that support not just our climate objectives - that must happen - but also our biodiversity and other objectives.  We should look to support the form of agriculture - pastoral and family farms - which is good at climate adaptation and resilience, as well as climate mitigation.  I am sorry for the long answer, but this is the crux of the issue.  In a global context, we should do that in our role on the UN Security Council, in particular, where climate has to been seen as a critical security issue in a way that supports developing countries in Africa and small island developing states, SIDS, and supports the form of climate-resilient pastoral family-farming which is small scale, less intensive and less feedlot-orientated agriculture in regard to ruminants.  That would have knock-on consequences for our country.  It would support the kind of family farming system of agriculture, which I think we are agreeing on here.</p><p> We will have to work on this internationally.  It can be good for the type of farming we want, which protects nature as well as rural Ireland.  We should take heart from this.  I listened intently to the president of the IFA today when he said - I know from my experience that the head of the ICMSA, Natura 2000 and hill farmers, and the other farm organisations increasingly understand this - that the vast majority of Irish farmers are committed to climate action.  They increasingly understand that what we will have to do is reduce our emissions and increase their income.  That is why I come back to how we treat and manage this.  It is to look at mechanisms, and not that agriculture will get an opt-out and will not play its part.  Going back to what I said earlier, in the autumn this committee will have to consider what the various sectoral allocations will be.  The truth is that if we reduce our ambition in one area, it may put impossible constraints or obligations on other sectors, which might have significant consequences for employment or other aspects in the quality of our lives.  Therefore, every sector is involved.</p><p> A key question within agriculture is, how do we increase income as we reduce emissions, including the reduction of the biogenic methane?  We must recognise that this has to be good for Irish agriculture, and I believe it can be.  That is the approach we will take on this.  We have recognised that in the provisions of the Bill which state we take into account the scientific advice on biogenic methane.  It is so complicated and multi-varied in its aspect that I do not think we can define it in the Bill.  However, we have sufficient recognition in the Bill to connect those international developments I mentioned briefly there.</p></speech>

I agree with what the Minister has said that we need a new vision for agriculture.  Anyone who seeks to try to present the case that nothing should change in agriculture is doing farmers a disservice.  In a decade&rsquo;s time when the price of carbon goes to well over a &euro;100 per tonne, the farming systems that did not look seriously at carbon and its management will leave family farms with much deeper problems than if they had made an early move to make those changes.  My only worry is that by setting very ambitious targets in a sector like agriculture, where the pace of change is not going to be easy given the age profile and mix of farming methods, we may be trying to force change faster than the system is capable of delivering.</p> <p>  We need to be thinking of paying for sequestration.  In international inventories, sequestration through forestry or land management of one sort or another is not counted as part of the inventory and would not count towards the 51%.  We must start to think differently because we need to start paying farmers to be farmers of carbon.  This inevitably means that apart from CAP funds, other funds need to be introduced which farmers can earn, taking account of the likelihood that farmers will be much more efficient, in cost terms, in bringing down our carbon footprint than some other sectors.  If one can relieve sectors of more expensive burdens, there should be scope to support farmers in delivering some of the changes that are available in the agriculture and land use sector.  It must be done in the context of new policy tools to allow farmers to make this transition.  If we rush to set targets and do not have those sorts of mechanisms, farmers will become frustrated.  What we have to do is try to get people on the one page in terms of combining the challenge to farm carbon while also delivering food.</p> <p>  I worry that this debate is often pitched as one group opposing another, and that is a dangerous arrangement.  We must find the space where a new vision for agriculture can be carved out and where people can see a decent family farm income coming in, albeit from doing different things compared to how things had been done before.  It is a challenge for the Oireachtas and our committee, in particular, to design those mechanisms.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the comments made by my two successors as Minister in this area, namely, Deputies Eamon Ryan and Bruton.  They have both recognised the validity of the point I am making concerning the need for biogenic methane to be treated differently.  The only point of disagreement between the three of us is how that aspect should be reflected in the Bill and that is why I submitted this amendment.  I will return to that point shortly.</p> <p>  Moving on to answer some of the questions raised by colleagues, I made it clear at the start of my contribution this morning, as I did while I was the Minister and I will do so again, that agriculture cannot get a free pass when it comes to climate change.  Therefore, I am not stating that agriculture should not be touched, but that it must be accounted for separately and that there is a good reason for doing that.  Agriculture has a key role to play regarding the issue of land use.  Substantial progress can be made in agriculture.  However, with a deadline set for 234 weeks' time, the only thing that can be done in that short time that will have a real impact is herd reduction.  The difficulty with herd reduction is that it undermines the type of farming that the Minister has expressly said that he wants to support, namely, family farms and pastoral grazing.  That in itself is not good for biodiversity or overall climate emissions.  </p> <p>  Physical constraints exist regarding the retrofitting of homes and in rolling out electric vehicles.  I set up those plans and targets and they were to be in full operation now, but that is not happening.  Even greater pressure is therefore being put on what I believe is the soft option of cattle numbers, instead of land use management.  Some environmental zealots are trying to claim that methane from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture are the same, but they are not.  They try to shut down any discussion of this issue.  There is a big difference between the two forms of methane.  Methane from fossil fuels comes from carbon which has been locked away in our planet for hundreds of millions of years.  Methane from agriculture comes from carbon dioxide that was in our atmosphere a few hours ago, a few days ago or a few weeks ago.  It is being converted into protein for humans to consume.  It is part of an overall carbon cycle.  </p> <p>  In fairness, that aspect was acknowledged by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the former Minister, Deputy Bruton.  It has also been acknowledged by the Climate Change Advisory Council, the Government of the United Kingdom, the European Union and New Zealand.  However, it is not yet part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, accounting framework.  Having said that, though, I fully accept that CH, methane, in our atmosphere, regardless of the source, has the exact same warming potential and that is why agriculture has a key role to play in combating climate change.  My issue concerns how this element is accounted for in domestic legislation and international climate rules.  Internationally, this aspect should be accounted for through the consumption of food, which accurately reflects the impact that methane has on our atmosphere, and not where that food is produced.  Taking the latter approach leads to perverse situations, such as the consumption of meat from the Amazon basis being incentivised.</p></speech>

I have only two substantial amendments to the Bill.  I accept there are many more amendments but this is one of my two.  If the Chair will let me finish my point in this regard, I will keep quiet after that.  Turning to my amendment, the Minister argues that there is sufficient recognition of biogenic methane in the legislation already.  I argue this is tokenism and non-binding.  The reality is that agriculture will become the fall guy for a failure to meet targets in other areas.  I fully accept that setting a separate target for biogenic methane is not a trivial task.  To answer Deputy O'Rourke's query, that is why I have not been prescriptive in this amendment.  I do not have the required detail available and I do not think that anyone does now.  I am just reflecting what has been recommended in the Climate Change Advisory Council's 2020 report.  It is imperative that the recommendation is incorporated in black and white into the legislation and that is why I have tabled this amendment.</p></speech>

There will be sectoral targets for agriculture and land use, which will be different from the targets for other sectors and probably less onerous.  However, the agricultural sector has to play its part too.  I reassure Deputy Bruton that it will be necessary to account for sinks as well as sources.  The Bill does that, and the definition concerning a removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere sets out that clearly.  It includes the use of natural or technological solutions, nature-based solutions being centre stage in that regard.</p> <p>  My key point is that we must increase incomes and reduce emissions.  Removal of greenhouse gases, in form of those sinks, could, should and will be the source of potential income for farmers, foresters and those involved in land use and reclamation management etc..  Critically, this should be a turning point for the better for agriculture.  We want to redirect some of the income currently going to the processing and retailing side of agriculture to pay for nature-based solutions and the environmental services that will be provided by farmers.  That is why many farmers are rowing in behind what we are seeking to do.  That income must go up.  We must have an Origin Green brand that is truly green in origin, in respect of protecting nature as well as stopping emissions.  </p> <p>  It can also increase income in many different ways.  As well as pasture-based family farming, we can also look at more secure incomes by having a diversity of income streams being derived from farming.  Last, but not least, this aspect concerns not just methane but also elements such as nitrous oxides, in addition to greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, from agriculture itself.  There is also potential to derive income from the generation of energy on farms.  Farm incomes could also be raised by reducing the use of nitrogen and nitrous oxide fertilisers.  This endeavour, therefore, is not just focused on methane.  It is about a variety of approaches, all of them centred on increasing income and getting a new generation of young farmers into the sector as emissions are cut.  I am afraid I cannot support the amendment but I think we agree on the principle that farming must play its part and, critically, the old narrative of the environment versus agriculture must end.  We work together.</p></speech>

Substantial progress needs to be made.  I ask the Minister to look again at the issue of biogenic methane and to look at the recommendations of the Climate Change Advisory Council.

That is a catch-all get-out clause for the Department to ensure that it will not meet many of the targets because it will not be practicable to do so.  We need to get away from that type of language in giving outs in the context of what can happen.</p><p>The amendment creates a definition of what is happening in just transition and why it is important.  Everybody recognises that this Bill is vitally important and just transition is an important part of how we address climate change to ensure that it is reflective of everybody's needs.  There is no point in having the people who are least in a position to deal with the effects of climate change being the ones who carry all the costs as well.  There is a real danger of that happening in any society.  This is important and I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.  In particular, it is vitally important to take that language of &quot;in so far as it is practicable to do so&quot; out of the Bill because it is not necessary at all.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, seek to improve on the definition of climate justice contained in the Bill and they all do so.  Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing amendment No. 14, which seeks to address what we would see as the weaknesses within the current definition of climate justice in the flexibility it allows.  The Bill leaves the option to come up short and our amendment seeks to strengthen the language in the Bill on equity and fairness.  The definition we are proposing is based on the Mary Robinson Foundation definition.  I know it is a definition the Minister has supported and used in the past.  It is one of the most important opportunities to build and improve on this legislation.  I would call on the Minister to support, if not the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, one of the other amendments, or to come back with a stronger definition, if not now then on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I know none of them will be accepted but they all speak to the glaring need to strengthen the definition of climate justice within this Bill.  If the Minister was still just a Deputy and not a Minister, he would probably be making similar arguments to those that are being made by the previous speakers and by those who will offer their thoughts subsequently.</p> <p>  There are no winners when it comes to climate change.  Everyone is a loser but there are those who are losing most, who are suffering most and who are most vulnerable.  By improving the definition of climate justice within this totemic Bill, we would be sending out a strong message of solidarity, assistance and real energy in that regard.  I ask the Minister to reassess his approach to this issue and to just transition by accepting the amendments.  If he is not going to accept amendments, perhaps he could make a commitment to come back with an improved wording.  Again, no one wants ownership over this and no one is going to win on this.  We just want the Bill to be improved.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 12 is in my name but I will not be in a position to press it because I have to go and speak in the Chamber shortly.  I will be withdrawing the amendment.</p></speech>

There is a plethora of similar amendments here and it would be good if the Government could go back and change the Bill, which was originally peppered with the phrase "in so far as is practicable".  There was a huge amount of comment on the matter and a request to change it.  The Government did so in respect of most of the text of the Bill but not in this section.  Perhaps the Minister could explain why the Government removed this language in other clauses but not in this one because it is a caveat that gives the Government a get-out and makes the Bill look so poor.</p> <p>  What I have in amendment No. 13 that makes it slightly different from the other amendments is the suggestion that the Bill should reflect the UNFCCC commitment to the common but differentiated responsibilities in respect of capacities.  In other words, wealthier countries have to do more than the poorer countries.  That is a statement Ireland should be well able to make in the Bill and not omit it and then include a get-out clause such as "in so far as is practicable".  It is not acceptable and I hope the Minister can take that on board and change that language.</p></speech>

We are all saying the same thing.  I saw earlier that one of the civil society groups wants the UNFCCC commitment mentioned in the Bill.  Perhaps that is something the Minister can take on board.</p> <p>  My amendment is a simple addition, which emphasises that it will be the poor people globally who will be impacted most by climate change.  When we talk about vaccinations we say that no one is safe until we are all safe and it is a similar concept when we are talking about global equality and climate change.  Unless this is a global effort and unless we tackle it globally and take our responsibilities as a wealthy nation on board, it will not be solved.</p> <p>  I am not pushed as to which amendment is accepted.  They all encompass what we need to see but I ask that the Minister consider them.  This is important.</p></speech>

Our response to climate change has to be centred around climate justice and delivering just transition.  The Bill recognises that.  The definition is based on the definition that the Mary Robinson Foundation has set out and chimes word for word with amendments Nos. 14 and 15.</p><p>It refers to the need to "safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable persons and endeavour to share the burdens and benefits arriving from climate change".  As I said, the text is taken almost word for word from the Mary Robinson Foundation definition and it is the right definition.  The same is true of how just transition is defined and where it is included in the Bill.  It is centred around an effort to "maximise employment opportunities" and "support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition".  That is an appropriate definition and it is included as one of the issues that ought to be taken into account as we set out our strategy.  The wording in the Bill is correct and appropriate.

In order to define how people are vulnerable, we need to acknowledge there will be social and economic vulnerabilities globally and it will be the poorest people who are most impacted in that regard.  If the Minister is not open to taking the more definitive amendments, he might consider the simple addition of the words "social and economic exclusion".</p></speech>

That is the problem with the definition in the Bill.  It is a catch-all, get-out clause for the Minister and the Department.  The definition is totally unacceptable without the removal of the words "in so far as is practicable".</p></speech>

We can play a part and contribute as far as we practically can but we cannot, on our own and single-handedly, address the entire global climate justice issue.  We can contribute to a solution but it is not completely within our control.  It requires an international effort, which is there at the centre of the Bill.  It reflects our commitment to the Paris Agreement and its articles, which very specifically recognise that those who have done least to cause the crisis should not be put to the greatest burden in addressing it.  Rather, those who have done most to cause it must do the most to seek to solve it.  That is at the core of this legislation and the articles of the Paris Agreement, with which we must be consistent in the wording of the Bill.</p> <p>  Seeking to achieve social equality and justice should be central to everything we do.  However, we must be careful not to put that whole responsibility on climate legislation, which is primarily about setting up the mechanisms whereby we can meet sectoral ambitions, targets and so on in addressing the entire social requirements of the State.  We will have equality and fairness in mind in seeking a just transition but we cannot address the social inequality in our State solely through climate legislation.  That requires myriad legislative measures.</p></speech>

The Minister gave one definition of "in so far as is practicable" and I expect the Department could come up with many other definitions that would not be as motherhood and apple pie as the definition the Minister has given.  That is the crux of the problem.  The definition is too wide open and, for that reason, it has to be opposed.</p></speech>

The measures set out in the Bill rely for their implementation on speculative technology and there is no definitive statement that we will totally remove carbon.  The provisions are based on the expectation that, some time in the future, we will have technology that enables us to capture carbon, as well as using offsets and other market-based mechanisms.  That does not allow for an absolute commitment to reduce our emissions and remove carbon.</p><p>Our amendment places an emphasis on nature-based solutions, with no reliance on the purchase of carbon credits, offsets and other market-based mechanisms, or carbon capture and storage technology that is unproven as yet.  Many people are saying such technologies will be the way to go in the future, but we do not have the technology now.  We can only commit ourselves to what is currently possible.  Something that is speculative and twice removed from us is not sufficient and does not make this a robust Bill.  Moreover, the idea that we can purchase our way out of this crisis makes a nonsense of our commitment to reducing our emissions.  That is what this amendment seeks to address.</p></speech>

Such inclusion would not be appropriate as it would undermine the obligations contained in the Bill.  The legislation has been developed to focus on achieving obligations through emissions reductions and removals in the State, not by way of markets here or elsewhere, as provided for in the relevant definitions in respect of emissions and renewables. The measures set out in the Bill are technology neutral.  We do not know which technologies will be used and the Bill is not solely reliant or focused on, or solely referring to, any one technology.  Therefore, the legislation does not need to prohibit explicitly the use of offsetting or specify which technologies will or will not evolve in the coming years.</p></speech>

It is a very weak provision, which is why propose to insert the sentence in the amendment.  The Bill is very weak and while it does not exclude offsetting, it could, by definition, leave it in.  We should set about excluding offsets and carbon credits and remove any possibility of them being used to balance budgets.  After all, this is all about budgets rather than the actual mechanism.  We must ensure the budgets do not include market-based mechanisms.</p></speech>

We would have to almost re-establish it in legislation, which I would prefer not to do, as it would open up a whole new market.  Just to exclude it is not in the current proposals or approach.</p> <p>  With regard to the two aspects of this and the potential use of carbon capture and storage, CCS, I will be up-front and open to say that if CCS becomes a viable technology, we should consider it for industrial production, the storage of carbon or power generation.  It is less likely, however, because the economics of other alternatives are advancing quicker.  We should not exclude it, however.</p></speech>

The national climate objective, as drafted, specifically sets within it the transition to a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally-sustainable and climate-neutral economy.

The term does not necessarily mean that we reduce our carbon emissions.  It could mean that we find accounting mechanisms to do it.  This amendment spells out that we have to find nature-based solutions that mean we actually reduce our carbon emissions, rather than just balance a budget.  Again, it refers to the earlier point, but it should remain in the Bill to ensure we use nature-based solutions to sequester greenhouse gases and that we do not rely on the balancing of budgets, as this Bill is shaping up to do.</p></speech>

I do not see our emissions reductions coming from accounting or storage systems.  We are going to have to stop the use of all fossil fuels in the State, in line with the Paris Agreement.

There are different interpretations of the concept of &quot;just transition&quot;.  Deputy Michael Collins hinted at this in his contribution.  All communities have to benefit and must be treated in a fair and equal way.  The point is that we are not starting from equality.  There is not equality right across society.  We are starting from different bases.</p><p>The discussion that most reflected this was on carbon taxes and the question of how they are implemented.  Carbon taxes, as they have been applied by the State, are exactly what we do not need.  This is not what just transition means.  It does not mean piling taxes on the people who can least afford it and ignoring those who benefit the most from the pollution and warming of the planet and leaving them untouched without having to pay their fair share.</p><p> Just transition should also look at how communities and workers are treated.  The Bord na M&oacute;na workers are a good case in point.  The Minister says they will be given jobs retrofitting and money will be put into retraining them but giving them minimum wage jobs in a recycling factory is not a just transition.  It does not tick the boxes.  This really has to be developed in a way that defines just transition as being central to how we implement it.  It is very obvious that we will not bring communities and workers with us, and we will not bring all that we need to bring with us, if we do not have this at its heart.  Many other amendments have been tabled on this and we should have a decent discussion on it.</p><p> The amendment covers decent, fair and high-value work, contributing to sustainable economic approaches and trying to undermine and eliminate poverty.  We will not do this by piling carbon taxes on the poor and letting the very wealthy fossil fuel industry and aviation industry off without paying their fair share.</p></speech>

This is one of the most important points we will speak about on Committee Stage.  It is fundamental to the principle and spirit of our climate ambition.  If the Bill does two things, they are to set interim and long-term targets and to set out a plan.  People need to see that their voices will be heard within it, that they will be considered and brought along, that this will not be just a case of more of the same, and that this will not confirm and firm up these positions.  The Minister can put whatever terms on them he wants.  We can call it the haves versus the have-nots, or those advantaged versus those disadvantaged.</p> <p>  A number of previous speakers have spoken on other amendments.  There is a real fear in communities about what the implications of climate action and the response to climate action mean.  We need to accept and acknowledge this as real and earnest.  Some of it is based on practical experience with regard to people struggling to heat their homes and pay their bills.  They are falling deeper and deeper into this scenario with the prospect, as they see it, of more of the same and worse to come.  The Bill needs to spell out that the Government and future governments have their backs.  It needs to spell it out in black and white because it is not there and there is deep concern about it.  There is an opportunity to improve on it and this is a way to do so.  If we do not do it, reasonable questions will be asked as to why not, legitimate concerns will not be allayed, and it will be a seriously missed opportunity.</p></speech>

The reality is that climate issues are not just about the environment.  They are part of a much broader issue and we cannot separate them out.  If we start dealing with environmental or climate issues separately to the economy, inequality and people's living standards we will not achieve what we need to achieve with the Bill.  We cannot leave people behind when we deal with the climate crisis.</p> <p>  We are at a crossroads.  We have an opportunity to use the Bill to meet our climate objectives and to create an environment we can all enjoy and live in.  If we do not do it right, there is a risk we will create a very divided Ireland where a portion of our communities are left behind.  If people are struggling to put a roof over their heads and food on their tables, climate issues and environmental issues will be the last thing on their minds and that is the reality.  Achieving the climate targets and the environment we need to move towards comes down to a cultural shift and a system shift.  We cannot do it unless we bring everyone along with us.  It is very important to ensure just transition is a component of the Bill.</p> <p>  The amendment I have tabled defines just transition and goes into what the principles are.  We need to have a conversation about what the just transition principles are.  Even during pre-legislative scrutiny, the officials stated that climate justice covers it.  It actually does not because it is a different concept.  It is a very broad concept but climate justice is more of an international global issue whereas just transition relates to Ireland and our workers and communities.  The first thing we need to do is to define it.</p> <p>  The Minister said we will not be able to deal with social inequalities in the Bill but we will have to address them because they are all part of the same thing.  We are all part of the same ecosystem.  We will not be able to deal with one issue without dealing with the other.  It is incredibly important that we incorporate this into the Bill.  This is an opportunity.  We can have it in the Bill and we can define it and have discussions on it.  We can look to countries such as Scotland which have done a very good job on this.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Other countries have done a lot of this work.  We could learn from what they have done.  Many of the amendments are pulling from international expertise.  We can look at this as an opportunity to right some of the wrongs and rebalance our communities and how we are living.  We have to incorporate it in the Bill.  It needs to be there as a guiding point of principle to give this direction.  Otherwise it will be forgotten.</p> <p>  I have had this conversation with the Minister previously when he introduced the waste policy.  People with disabilities had very limited consultation.  No one represented people in poverty when the policy was developed.  This needs a very holistic approach.  If we do not embed just transition in the framework of the Bill, we will not be able to take an holistic approach.  It is absolutely critical that we get this right and it has to go in at this point.  Earlier, the Minister mentioned that just transition is defined in the Bill but it is not.  It was one of the key recommendations of the committee.  We heard from many experts and the majority of them said we need to take the principles of just transition into account.</p> <p>  I tabled an amendment that was ruled out of order on the establishment of a just transition commission.  This should be looked at because the difficulty with just transition is that if we are not proactive on it, and if we put in place the framework for the climate targets and start putting restrictions on emissions but we have not considered just transition policies in parallel with this, we will have a very reactive transition and it will not be good.  We need to build just transition principles into the Bill now to make sure the processes happen at the same time.  I know the programme for Government includes a just transition commissioner.</p><p>However, there have been no details of how that will be implemented and no focus on it.  We will only get that focus if we incorporate the relevant provision into the Bill.</p></speech>

I want to comment on them generally.  I am very strongly in favour of a role of just transition commissioner being established.  I am open to the Minister's view as to whether that would best be done through dedicated legislation.  During my time as Minister, we sought to establish the principle of just transition, albeit in the face of very significant changes that had to be managed, particularly those affecting the peat sector.  We appointed an interim just transition commissioner, who has done a really good job on much of the type of consultation that is set out in these amendments.  The interim commissioner supported new measures that will seek to develop substitute sectors and ensure people adversely affected by peat operation closures in the midlands, for example, will have access to accelerated retrofit programmes and measures to support community activity.  That principle, of both dialogue and a very active programme of supporting people who are impacted, is important.</p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith knows I do not agree with her on carbon pricing.  It is important to note that carbon price revenue has been used entirely to support people who have been adversely affected by carbon charges.  That was done through social welfare measures, including increases in the fuel allowance and accelerated implementation of the warmer homes scheme, which has a very significant impact through enabling people to avail of free retrofitting of their homes.  Carbon price revenue has also gone towards the restoration of peatlands and to support programmes of change in the midlands.</p> <p>  The principle behind these amendments is sensible.  We need to have a broader dialogue and my understanding is that the Minister is absolutely committed to such dialogue.  In fact, we will not succeed in bringing people with us on what is going to be a challenging journey unless we can have dialogue at various sectoral and community levels.  Some of these amendments reflect what is in the programme for Government.  However, I am quite open on how we should proceed.  I will accept it if the Minister considers that new legislation dealing with this issue in a more comprehensive way, with the capacity to have actions as well as simply expressing principles by way of a definition, is a better way to go.  We need an activist programme with access to resources and the sort of secretariat that would enable it to go beyond the work Kieran Mulvey has been doing so successfully on an interim basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#FF00300"><p>I agree with Deputy Bruton that what Mr. Mulvey and others have done in the midlands is a really good example of practical intervention on a just transition basis.  That work is far from complete and there is an urgency behind delivering some of the funding that has been allocated.  I recognise that, but what has been done is a start in the right direction.</p> <p>  The principles of just transition are embodied in this legislation in a whole variety of different ways, including in the provision for consultation that is contained within and throughout it.  We have already started that consultation in terms of the development of the new climate action plan and the enactment of legislation.  We have just completed a very significant climate conversation with the public in which more than 300 sectoral experts gave their perspective and views.  Approximately 3,500 Irish people have engaged directly with us.  That type of consultation is key and is provided for in various parts of the Bill.</p> <p>  As Deputy Whitmore said, there is a difference in terms of focus between climate justice and just transition.  Climate justice, by its nature, is focused on developing the emerging world and addressing the injustices occurring there because of climate change.  Definitions are important and legislation is about providing legal definitions.  While I cannot support the amendments, I absolutely agree with the need for decency, fairness and high-value work.  However, decency is not an easy thing for which to legislate.  Fairness is absolutely central but it is delivered by way of the tax system and investment delivered under the budget.  That is how we turn our objectives into reality.  The wording we have in the Bill and the principles that are stitched right through it, which come from a just transition perspective, are appropriate.  These amendments seek to define just transition but do not offer something better than what is already there.  Therefore, I cannot support them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#FF00400"><p>On the question of just transition and taxes, what is happening is an attempt to tax people's behaviour without making alternatives available to them.  Pushing up carbon taxes for ordinary people is pushing up their heating bills.  Some people have poorly insulated homes, by any standards, and cannot afford to have them retrofitted.  Bringing in the taxes first, without addressing that reality, is saying to people they must change their behaviour but offering them no alternatives.  Many ordinary people do not have alternatives to turning on the gas, lighting the fire or driving a diesel car up and down the roads because there is no proper public transport, particularly in rural areas.  That behaviour is being taxed while, at the same time, the newspaper headlines today refer to an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft that made &euro;315 billion in profit in this country last year but paid zero corporation tax.</p> <p>  Climate justice is about addressing that type of unfairness.  I was standing beside Deputy Bruton outside Leinster House when he was Minister and a group of young people shouted at him "System change, not climate change".  He smiled and said he agreed with them.  Where is the system change in allowing Microsoft not to pay any tax on its billions in profits while more and more money is taken from the poor to heat their homes or drive a smelly old diesel car because there is no bus that will take them around their locality?  Without looking at those issues, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not dealing with just transition.  We need to spell out what it means and have a proper definition.  If not, we are feeding into climate denial.  What starts with people complaining about having more money taken from them or saying this climate business is too heavy on farmers and rural communities turns into climate denial and leads to a very fractious society where we are not all in it together and are not pulling together.  There needs to be a broader definition of what is meant by just transition and how we can pay our way.  The axe has fallen very hard on the wrong sector.</p></speech>

However, the Scottish Government has defined it.  There are a number of examples where other, similar countries have embedded it in their legislation.  The unions have come together and agreed a concept and principles, as have community organisations.  There is an onus on the Minister to reflect that in this Bill.</p> <p>  I agree with what the Minister and Deputy Bruton said regarding Kieran Mulvey, the interim just transition commissioner.  There has been great work done in this area but it relates only to the midlands.  The principles of just transition must be applied much more broadly than just to one particular region that has very specific issues.  My view is that new legislation will be required.  I tried to get a reference to a just transition commission into this Bill but I could not do it.  We need much more defined legislative provision for the establishment of a just transition commission and commissioner.  However, we do not have time to wait to nut out what the principles of just transition should be.  Those principles must be embedded in this Bill because it is what will govern our climate actions over the coming years.  We do not have two or three years to wait for additional legislation to put all of that in place.</p><p>As I said, we have to deal with just transition proactively.  We need to make sure we get in there with communities before the onus or burden of dealing with climate change is placed on them and in advance of placing requirements on them.  This is really important and not something we cannot have in this Bill.</p></speech>

Previous speakers covered what I wanted to say.  Scotland got it right; there is a whole section on just transition in its Bill.  Principles are something we need to stand over.  The whole committee agreed that just transition must be central to this.  We have to make sure that politically, morally, ethically and every which way, just transition is a major part of this Bill and nobody is left behind.  No other political generation has had to plan for what we are facing, which is basically a threat to the existence of humanity on our planet.  We are the legislators in place at this time.  If we do not make this part and parcel of the Bill, we will have absolutely failed.  I will not labour the point but as the children said, there is no planet B.  Just transition has to be at the heart of this Bill.</p></speech>

In that, the likes of the National Economic and Social Council and our social dialogue with other pillars, such as the environmental, farming, social and trade union sectors, will all be engaged in a much more detailed process to ensure we do not only focus on the midlands.  That work is ongoing and will be critical.  I share the belief of members of the committee that this is critical to the transition.  However, I keep coming back to the fact that the wording proposed in the amendments does not add to that.  The amendments do not add precision, legal strength or imperative and, therefore, I cannot support them.  We will stick with the definition and the reference to just transition throughout the Bill, but particularly in the new section 4(8)(k).</p></speech>

I remind members to turn off their mobile phones and to observe the note on privilege, which provides that members who are in Leinster House or the convention centre have full privilege for the meeting.  Members are asked to remove their masks when making a contribution as it will help with the quality of the sound recording.</p> <p>  We are dealing with the Revised Estimates for Vote 1 - President's Establishment, Vote 2 - Department of the Taoiseach, Vote 3 - Office of the Attorney General, Vote 4 - Central Statistics Office, Vote 5 - Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Vote 6 - Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The format of the meeting will be that we will ask the Minister of State for an opening statement and then members will question the figures or facts before us.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The committee has been supplied with a detailed briefing document for Vote 4, the Central Statistics Office, in advance of this meeting.  A briefing for the other Votes was provided prior to the previous meeting of the committee on 27 April.  As the Taoiseach has already provided a statement to the committee, I will limit my opening comments to the CSO which has not yet been discussed.</p></speech>

The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The role of the director general of the CSO, as prescribed by the Statistics Act 1993, provides that the officeholder acts independently and exercises sole responsibility in professional statistical matters.  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.</p> <p>  The Central Statistics Office plays a vital role in the functioning of the State in providing independent and verifiable data to citizens and policymakers on a broad range of topics, including social, economic and environmental issues.  The ability of the CSO to inform has been evident throughout the current pandemic.  The CSO delivered on the vast majority of its planned statistical work programme for 2020, publishing 421 releases and publications.  Of these, 29 were new products specifically related to providing insight on the impact of the pandemic across society and businesses, for policymakers and citizens alike.</p> <p>  The CSO delivered 59 individual publications from the 29 new products, which included publications focused on the business and social impact of Covid-19, the numbers of deaths and cases, the impact on the labour market and experimental outputs on excess deaths and on mobility during the pandemic.  Alongside the new products developed and delivered to provide additional insight, the CSO provided statistical and analytical expertise and new data services to support analysing health data sources in a safe and secure environment.  The CSO has supported modelling, analysis of health and of real time data and analysis to provide insight regarding trends and identifying emerging issues all to support central government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has, of course, impacted on the CSO's statistical work programme during the past year, with the greatest impact on processes that require face-to-face interactions with survey respondents.  The single largest casualty by scale was the postponement of the census of population from 2021 to 2022.  On consideration of the challenges caused by Covid-19, the Government decided to postpone the 2021 census until April 2022 to enable the CSO to undertake a comprehensive, inclusive and safe census in 2022, which will provide valuable and accurate data for our country in the years ahead.</p> <p>  Other surveys, such as pilots for the programme for international assessment of adult competencies and the household budget survey, were postponed until 2021.  Face-to-face collection at airports and ports also ceased during 2020.  While face-to-face interviewing for household surveys ceased, new technological solutions and mixed mode collection options were implemented to maximise the delivery of the statistical work programme.  The CSO has also developed new interactive graphics, infographics, new formats, namely, bulletins and frontier series, and outputs to provide the additional insight needed by the public, businesses and policymakers on the impact of the pandemic.</p> <p>  The CSO has continued to publish key economic indicators and has tracked the impact of the crisis on business sectors and the economy, including via the monthly exports and imports of goods, the quarterly national accounts, Government deficit and debt, the quarterly balance of payments, the labour force survey, the monthly unemployment and live register figures and the survey on income and living conditions, among others.</p> <p>  Planning has continued for census 2022 with the options for a potential census in 2026 are also being considered.  In both cases, an increase in the use of administrative data is being explored and the possibility of the development of an online response facility is being considered in respect of census 2026 which, if approved by Government, would mark 100 years since the first State census.</p> <p>  The CSO is continuing to work on a survey on the prevalence of sexual violence, with a pilot going into the field in 2021, and is progressing work on the data collection and processing of the next wave of the State's longitudinal study of children and youth, Growing up in Ireland, from 2023.</p> <p>  The CSO now faces a different challenge in measuring how our economy and society emerge from the Covid restrictions.  Sustainable, secure access to data and the reuse of high-value data sources in the form of administrative data and some private data sources are essential for the CSO to provide timely and accurate data that are meaningful to policymakers.  To enable this, the CSO has been to the forefront of building the national data infrastructure under action 24 of the Civil Service renewal programme on improving how data are collected, managed and shared.</p> <p>  The pandemic has confirmed what we have always known, that along with access, the quality of the data sources is crucial.  Continuing to build the national data infrastructure across the public service is a key component to delivering on the quality necessary for the creation of official statistics and to deliver the broader data framework to serve the needs of the State.</p> <p>  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, primarily EUROSTAT and the ECB, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN's fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.</p> <p>  New EU legislation introduced in 2015 fundamentally changed the role of the CSO, and that of its director general.  Following this legislation, the director general of the CSO now has responsibility for co-ordinating and overseeing the quality of all European official statistics in Ireland.  It is now the responsibility of the CSO to ensure that all compilers of European statistics in Ireland are adhering to the quality and methodological standards set out by the EU and detailed in the European statistics code of practice.</p><p> Turning to the CSO's budget, the net allocation for 2021 is &euro;63.155 million.  The funding provided reflects the Government's commitment to the office to meet its obligations under national and EU law, to continue developing the Irish statistical system, and to produce new outputs to meet domestic demand through the provision of trusted and robust official statistics.  Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on social, economic and environmental issues, as demonstrated by nearly 15 million web hits on the CSO website in 2020.</p><p> I commend the values and principles that inform the CSO's work.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public service and public policy by providing a high-quality and, importantly, independent statistical service.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions on various sectors.  Is the CSO satisfied with the resources available to it to carry out its job, which is expanding?  Has it the structures and finances to deal with the upcoming situation?</p></speech>

Given the multi-annual cycle of statistics, demand arises in certain years because of particular surveys, for example, the national census.  If the Deputy looks through the Vote's various elements, he will see there can be a fluctuation in spending between years.  With the National Statistics Board, NSB, the Government is strategically supporting our national and EU responsibilities.  Provision is made in the budgeting.  For example, a significant underspend is projected in certain heads and there were also underspends last year, but the CSO will roll out the national census next year.  We have provided for the needs of the census.  It is important we do so to meet our national and EU obligations.</p></speech>

It appears that the CSO will have an expanded role.  Has it done the necessary forward planning to accommodate such a requirement?</p></speech>

Through the NSB, we have set out a new strategy for 2021 to 2026.  It has been authorised.  At its launch in recent weeks, I spoke about having trusted and independent sources of data.  I am trying to embed some of the key priorities that the CSO has set out.  We will support those priorities, for example, monitoring transformations in the environment, economy and society to assist policymakers, communicating data and taking action to enhance official statistics and sources.  Embedding Eircode postcodes in all public sector data holdings is work the NSB wants to drive forward, and the CSO will have an important involvement in that.  Big data has a potentially valuable role in the compilation of official statistics.</p> <p>  Although we are discussing this year's Vote, I can go into more detail on the strategic direction, which is about using many of the other official data sources and how that informs our public policymaking and decision-making.  With the NSB, the CSO will move in an ambitious direction.  We can forward the 2021-26 strategic report that was set out by the NSB.  It is important we support and fund the strategy, and that is our intention.</p></speech>

As part of our engagement with Europe, e-health is referenced in the recovery and resilience facility.  The national recovery plan was launched this week.  We all recognise we need to strengthen the provision of e-health, but I do not know whether it is a direct competence of the CSO.  The combined data we take from healthcare is important for making informed public policy decisions.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said, "The single largest casualty by scale was the postponement of the census of population from 2021 to 2022."  As part of the recovery package that was just announced, there will be a new online facility for people to fill out the census.  Will the Minister of State tell us a little more about that?  I apologise if Deputy Durkan has already asked about this matter.  I did not hear all of his questions.</p></speech>

The census is a large-scale field operation that involves more than 5,000 staff and a number of visits to every household over a ten-week period.  The success of the census requires the co-operation of every household.  The decision to postpone it was not taken lightly.  As the Deputy will appreciate, foremost in that decision was the safety of the public and the field staff.</p> <p>  The census of population is a major logistical challenge and will commence in 2022.  There will be technological advances, which are referenced in one of the subheads.</p><p>In subhead 4 the technological advances relate to the census management system, which is in the fieldwork itself.  What is being explored specifically in terms of an online census is for 2026.  That is the distinction earmarked.  A census case management system will be used.  The Deputy will see some of the detail on that in subheads 4 and 5.  That is related specifically to the fieldwork and the 5,000 plus people who will be involved in it.  The online response facility will be considered in respect of the 2026 census which, as the Deputy knows, will be 100 years since the first State census, so it is really important.</p></speech>

It is my understanding there is a question about speaking Irish, and around 2 million people would say "Yes".  Can there be a follow-up question, potentially, that drills down into this and is a bit more specific?  Can oral or written ability be rated so we can clarify the level of Irish spoken?  That would be very useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021060300002#C00300"><p>It is a very good suggestion.  The questions and follow-on questions have already been set.  My understanding is that much of the paperwork around the census has already been printed in preparation for what would have gone ahead this year.  I will ask my officials to take the Deputy's suggestion back as part of considerations for the 2026 census.  We obviously want to get an in-depth picture of the Irish language in every community, as the Deputy said, and be able to respond properly to that.  Unfortunately, the one thing the census has shown is the need to try to rebalance the trend in the right direction with everything else we are trying to do with the Irish language.  I know the Deputy shares that aim.  I am very much open to allowing her, or anyone else, engage prior to the 2026 census.  There is a methodical process around that where a range of questions and options are examined.  We will take the Deputy's feedback on that as well.</p></speech>

That is very interesting.  That will be great, especially since 2026 will be a centenary year.  I fully understand the forms are already printed.  We will not ask the CSO to redo and reprint them all.</p> <p>  I have another question on Vote 6.  I did not realise this discussion was really about the census.  If the Minister of State does not have the response to Vote 6, that is fine.  I do not exactly remember this when I filled out the census form, but an issue was brought to my attention relating to people being asked to clarify their religion.  A variety of different religions are listed and then there is "other".  Somebody questioned whether being an atheist or of no religion could be included in that.  That was brought to my attention.  I do not recall from reading the census what is there, but it is something I have been asked about previously.</p></speech>

It does not relate to the census, so maybe it can be brought back if the Minister of State does not have the answer.  It relates to legal fees paid to counsel.  Under Vote 6, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor stated that it is fair to say fees paid by the State are lower than those in private practice.  I am quite interested in the State's overall level of expenditure on legal fees.  It is information that is not collected by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In the context of the statement that fees paid by the State are lower than those in private practice, has a study been carried out on this?  As I said, it does not relate to the census, so if it is something that can be brought back to me, that would be great.</p></speech>

I will give her the position, and if she needs more detail, I will try to get it to her directly.  The Deputy is referencing Vote 6, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The majority of expenditure on external expertise by that office and by the Office of the Attorney General is on engagement with counsel, whose services are required so the State can adequately defend itself in legal proceedings taken against it and ensure it is not exposed to significant financial or reputational risk as a result of such proceedings.  They jointly operate a system of evaluating the work done by each counsel and then decide on the appropriate fee in each and every case.</p> <p>  The Chief State Solicitor's office has, since 2019, instigated a far more intensive process of evaluation of fees to be paid in a tight budgetary management process.  This is being supported in that particular office by the work of a high-level professional fees control group and greater guidance to staff.  The methodologies for assessing fees at the higher levels consist of the application of the assessment process.  Following nomination by the Attorney General, counsel undertake the legal work and submit a fee note.  That is evaluated and a decision is then made on what level of fees are reasonable for the work, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount of work done by counsel and his or her performance.</p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, it is fair to say that fees paid by the State are lower than those in private practice.  Expenditure under that particular subhead is difficult to predict as it is a demand-led service.  The number of cases before the courts and the value of actions taken against the State is outside the control of that particular office.  Projections are based on expenditure in previous years but it can fluctuate as well.  If the Deputy needs any further detail, I can ask that it is sent to her. </p></speech>

Who carries out the value for money and policy reviews?  In 2020, the cost was &euro;55,000 while it is &euro;30,000 in 2021.  That is just for the Central Statistics Office.

The savings in 2020 arose from fewer than anticipated audits as the office outsources its internal audit function.  The 2021 allocation reflects the fact that the office expects a full list of a series of internal audits to be undertaken during 2021.  That relates to the Office of the Attorney General.</p> <p>  On the Central Statistics Office figures, the subhead provides for the fees and expenses in respect of mainly IT or non-IT value for money and policy reviews by the office.  The allocation for consultancy spending remains small and reflects Government policy to limit consultancy costs.  Typically with the CSO it related to external advice, for example, for IT-related advice.  That was the majority of the spend there.  As the Chairman will see, the allocation was quite small.</p></speech>

It appears these Estimates for 2020 were spent and there is an arrangement in 2021 for a similar spend.

Is this something that should be addressed so there is a Secretary General, perhaps the Government Secretary General, who should be responsible for the others?  It seems odd not to have a person who is the head of an organisation.  Perhaps the Minister of State would take up this point.</p> <p>  There is a note on the end of the table that says the staff and grades figures exclude politically appointed staff, commissions of investigation, tribunals of inquiry, citizens' assemblies and so on.

As the committee is aware, the Moriarty tribunal was established in October 1997 and published its first report in 2006, with its second report in March 2011.  Following completion of its final report the tribunal is dealing with applications for third-party costs.  The tribunal is also subject to a number of legal proceedings.  The total amount paid by this Department in respect of the tribunal from its inception in 1997 up to the end of April 2021 was &euro;66.3 million.  It will not be possible to ascertain the overall cost until all third-party costs have been settled.  Provision of &euro;4.209 million is included in the Estimates for 2021.</p> <p>  The Cregan commission of investigation, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, commission, was established by Government order in June 2015 following consultation with Oireachtas parties.  The commission was originally required to investigate certain transactions, activities and management decisions of the IBRC between January 2009 and February 2013.  Mr. Justice Cregan submitted an interim report in November 2015 that raised a number of significant issues that had arisen with regard to legal and professional privilege, banking confidentiality, and where the commission considered changes were required to its terms of reference.  New legislation, the Commission of Investigation (Irish Bank Resolution Corporation) Act 2016, was enacted to provide a new legal basis for the commission.</p><p>The commission&rsquo;s terms of reference were amended following consultation with the Opposition representatives to provide that the first module of its work was the transaction with Siteserv plc.</p><p> In 2020, a total expenditure of &euro;2.2 million was incurred by the IBRC commission with costs since its establishment in 2015 of &euro;9.9 million.  The commission&rsquo;s original deadline for reporting, as members know, was 31 December 2015.  The commission submitted its ninth interim report on 8 April 2021 in which it requested a further extension of it timeframe for reporting on the Siteserv transaction, until 31 October 2021.  The Taoiseach granted the commission&rsquo;s request for a further extension to its timeframe to report, given the apparent advanced stage of preparation of its final report.  If the commission&rsquo;s request was not granted it would have effectively dissolves the commission with no findings to show for in return for the substantial costs incurred to date and those incurred but not yet paid.</p><p> In relation to the Cooke commission of investigation, the NAMA commission was established on 3 June 2017.  Mr. Justice John Cooke is the commission&rsquo;s sole member.  In the first module of its work, the commission is charged with investigating the sale by NAMA of its Project Eagle portfolio.  The commission&rsquo;s original deadline for reporting was 31 June 2018, but following several requests from the commission, its timeframe for reporting has been extended.  Most recently, in March 2021, the Taoiseach granted the commission&rsquo;s request for an extension of its timeframe for reporting until the end of September 2021.</p><p> In 2020, a total expenditure of &euro;855,000 was incurred by the NAMA commission with a total cost since its establishment in 2017 of &euro;3 million.  There is a provision in the 2021 Estimates for both commissions for &euro;4.43 million.</p></speech>

The ninth interim report was given on 8 April 2021 and the timeframe has been extended to 31 October 2021.  The Taoiseach granted that extension, given the apparent advanced stage of preparation of its final report.  If that had not been granted it would have effectively dissolved the commission without providing any findings, with limited return for the substantial costs incurred to date, as well as those incurred but not yet paid.  That was the basis for the extension.</p></speech>

It is a significant issue and it runs across a number of Departments including the DPP, and so on.  A scoping exercise is being undertaken.  I raise it as often as I can with the Taoiseach because this is now the tenth year since the murder of that young man on the roadside.  It is two years and almost six months since the scoping exercise commenced.  The family is deeply upset that the scoping exercise has not concluded and the work of the inquiry, or whatever may be suggested, is more limited than it had expected.  Is there anything that can be done through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office to speed up that process and ensure we have a wide-ranging investigation into all aspects leading up to this young man&rsquo;s death and thereafter.  I refer to the failure of the courts, for example, the failure of the DPP&rsquo;s office and the failure of the Garda in particular, in this regard. There are many other questions Lucia O&rsquo;Farrell, her husband and family have.  Does the Minister of State think that, in the interest of fairness, it could be dealt with quickly?  Can you bring that to the Department&rsquo;s attention?</p></speech>

I raised it with previous holders of the office of Taoiseach when they came before the committee, so I am not doing anything extraordinary in raising it here again with the Minister of State representing the Taoiseach.  I refer to the Grace case and the 46 other cases which are being dealt with by the Department of Health.  It is shocking that the State would not show more compassion in respect of those cases.  These were non-verbal, mentally challenged young men and women.  We do not know the outcome.  While the investigations are ongoing, it has now been years spent on this.  As Head of Government, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure this is brought to a speedy conclusion, not just for Grace, as she was known, but for the other 46 individuals.  It is a reflection on the Government when we do not show this type of compassion and understanding in cases like these.  I ask that the Minister of State ensures he is given that information.</p> <p>  As for the whistleblowing legislation, which this committee is undertaking to review on foot of the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, it is greatly important that there be a whole-of-government intervention in this regard because it does not pertain to just one Department but will spread across numerous Departments, as it has done.  There are still outstanding cases being fought in the courts.  There is one case in particular about which I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister.  It is to do with a whistleblower in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.</p> <p>  When these matters are not dealt with, they linger on and affect the lives of people, whether they are those generally associated with the Grace case or the individual in the CIT case, as well as other whistleblowers.  It is likewise with the Shane O&rsquo;Farrell case.  Perhaps driven through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, we should be establishing a more efficient manner in dealing with all of these matters in order that they can be heard publicly and we can learn from the processes and give some closure and comfort to the families and individuals concerned.</p><p>As I have said to the Minister of State previously, I have raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Taoiseach, and the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, when they were before the committee.  My intention was to raise it with the current Taoiseach, who is not before us.  Perhaps the Minister of State will take it to the Office of the Taoiseach and ensure that we get some sort of response.</p></speech>

How is the Government ensuring value for money in that area?  Could the committee have a list setting out how much the various barristers and senior counsel are paid each year through the Department of the Taoiseach relative to all of the agencies that are under the Department?  We got that information in the past and I ask that the Minister of State investigate the matter and provide us with the detail.</p></speech>

For example, fees to counsel are mentioned and there is a reference to 40% of the expenditure of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would be interesting to get deeper information on the individuals who are in receipt of this money from the State and any other information the Minister of State can give us on those legal costs.  While we are discussing legal costs, is there any intention to reform or review the workings of these offices, especially the DPP?</p></speech>

The Minister of State might ask if any reform is being discussed, if the offices have set out any requirements they may have, and if they have sufficient staff and so on to do all the necessary work.  We often hear of difficulties in getting cases dealt with in an efficient way.  I wonder if we could have a note on that to give us an understanding of how all of this is being achieved and if further financial input is required.</p></speech>

I will go through it.  As the Chairman knows, the current Citizens' Assembly on gender equality was established in January 2020.  Prior to Covid-19, it was expected to conclude its work in summer 2020 and it held its final meetings on 17 and 18 April, including voting.  The Citizens' Assembly published its results on the 45 key recommendations recently.</p> <p>  Under the programme for Government, the Government aims to establish a citizens' assembly this year to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local Government structures best suited for Dublin.  This citizens' assembly could be established shortly with a new chairperson and new members following completion of the current Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  The programme for Government also provides for the establishment of citizens' assemblies to consider matters relating to biodiversity, drug use and the future of education.  The timing of these future citizens' assemblies is under consideration, as are the format and methodology they might take.  Any decision will be guided by the experience of the current Citizens' Assembly and the evaluation of the independent researcher who has been appointed to monitor and record, among other things, the perceived deliberative quality of the Citizens' Assembly.  As I said, there will be further detail on those shortly.</p></speech>

Last night, at another meeting, I raised with the Taoiseach the need to have someone as the head of civil servants.  The point was made yesterday by the Secretary General, Martin Fraser, and I am hopeful the Taoiseach might comment on that.  At yesterday's meeting, the Taoiseach may have misunderstood me as I was not talking generally about civil servants.  Rather, I was talking specifically about the Secretaries General in terms of their appearances before committees.  That needs to be strengthened in the context of the work that committees do to ensure that we achieve the type of transparency and accountability that are required.  The Taoiseach, as the Head of Government, should reinforce that point with the Secretaries General of the different Departments to assist the committees in their work.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is going through the Estimates with the committee because we could not find a date to accommodate the Taoiseach.  It is most unusual that the Taoiseach would not be present for the presentation of his Department's Estimates.  I hope his absence today will not develop into practice in future because people look for transparency and accountability.  These meetings have always been good exchanges in the past, including when the committee met the previous Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, his predecessor as Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and those who went before them.  They appeared before the committee to explain the figures in detail.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has to deal with a number of questions by way of providing further information.  I ask him to do that as efficiently as he can.</p></speech>

My understanding is that it has been the norm for many years that the Taoiseach attends the first session and the Chief Whip attends the second, which deals with the CSO.  The Taoiseach dealt with the Estimates in the previous session.  I will respond in writing to all the specific queries that members have raised.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021060300002#F01500"><p>I would like to say that is a fact but it is not.  Normally, the Taoiseach comes before the committee and presents the Estimates for his Department.  The Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for the CSO then attends separately.  When the Taoiseach attended the first meeting we did not complete the review of the Estimate for his Department.  It was expected that he would return and finish that Estimate but that did not happen.  That practice should not prevail.  I am making that specific point, not just for my chairmanship and the current members of this committee, but for the future.  It is not accurate to say the Taoiseach presented and that this was a meeting to deal only with the CSO Estimate.  That is not a fact and the Taoiseach is quite aware of that.</p><p>We said before concluding the previous meeting that the Members had not finished the examination of the Estimates.  The reason we are dealing with it here today is because of the timeframe involved.  If other Members have questions that have not been dealt with, they can ask them now, and, if not, I will bring the meeting to a close.  The clerk will circulate the information requested when it is received.</p></speech>

They are just making the point about the Land Development Agency, LDA, stripping local authorities of their functions.  It is part of our wider and interconnected critique of this entire Bill in that we think that is precisely what the Land Development Agency is doing.  It is stripping local authorities of functions they should have.  The Government is committed to this and, as I was saying at the previous meeting, I am on quite a losing streak with my amendments, as are many of the Opposition.  They are out of scope unless we can convince the Government the Land Development Agency is fundamentally misconceived, which it appears we cannot.  I will make that point and probably withdraw these amendments.</p></speech>

They are also being inserted to provide clarity and certainty that these provisions will apply also to any of its subsidiaries.  It was always the intention of this legislation, when it was being drafted, that references to the LDA would refer also to a subsidiary designated activity company.

It has been drafted by the Association of Irish Local Government.  It is one of a group of amendments it sent to all Deputies on the committee urging them to support them.</p><p>It is very straightforward.  It is an attempt to have a greater level of transparency and accountability.  The Minister of State will see from the amendment that it requires the agency to furnish an annual report, both to the Minister and the relevant Oireachtas committee, regarding progress towards achieving the aims the Government is setting out for the LDA.  As we have seen with other State agencies, the lack of annual reports, or substantial delays in their publication, means there is not the level of transparency and accountability that is required.</p><p> This is even more so the case when one is structuring an organisation like this as a designated activity company that has the cover of commercial sensitivity in terms of FOI and parliamentary questions.  The requirement to publish a detailed annual report and to make it available not just to the Minister but also to the relevant Oireachtas committee is eminently sensible.  I hope all members of the committee can support the amendment.</p></speech>

The wording is slightly different but the aim is the same, which is to ensure that the review of the achievement of the purposes of the Act by the LDA and its subsidiaries would be on an annual basis rather than every five years.  This is a new agency and it is important, in the context of transparency and accountability, to make sure that it does what is set out for it under the legislation and to do that every five years would be insufficient.  That is once every half a decade.  A lot can happen in that time, so it is important that the review would happen on an annual basis.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>

These amendments seek to substitute references to the LDA in this section for local authorities.  I am opposing them because the proposal is not relevant to the Bill.</p> <p>  Section 8 provides that the Minister can at any stage require the LDA to report to him or her on the LDA's progress in achieving the purposes of the legislation.  In addition, the LDA will be required to report to the Minister on its progress on a periodic basis, with the first report due in 2024.  As the purposes of this Bill directly relate the LDA and its functions, it is necessary for the agency to compile this report and would not be applicable for local authorities to carry out this role.</p> <p>  I will also address amendment No. 61, as jointly tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould and amendment No. 62, as tabled by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 seek to substitute the provision in section 8 that the report that the LDA is required to submit to the Minister on the achievement of the purposes of the Act should be prepared annually instead of every five years.  While I understand the intention behind the proposed amendment, I am opposing these amendments, as the provision for an annual report is already included at section 47.  In addition, the acquisition and development of land can take a period of time so it is not appropriate that this report is done on an annual basis.  It should be noted that the report by the LDA specified in section 8(2) is required by 31 March 2024 and every five years thereafter will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In addition, under section 8, the Minister can at any stage require the LDA to report to him or her on the LDA's progress in achieving the purposes of the Bill.  In addition, the LDA will be required to report to the Minister on its progress on a periodic basis, with the first report due in 2024.</p> <p>  Under section 47, the LDA is already required to furnish the Minster with an annual report by 30 June each year.  This annual report will be drafted in line with the provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  As the provision at section 47 already requires the LDA to publish an annual report the report furnished under section 8 is appropriately requested every five years.</p></speech>

I am genuinely surprised by the Minister of State's response because, on the one hand, he seems to be saying that there is a provision elsewhere in the Bill for annual reports, but the provision that there would be an initial annual report and then a report every five years seems to contradict that.  Perhaps he could explain the position because it could be the case that I do not understand the relationship between the two relevant sections of the Bill.</p> <p>  I find it incredible that anybody would be against the publication of an annual report by any State agency, commercial or non-commercial, that is going to be spending substantial sums of taxpayers' money and engaging in substantial land and residential property deals with other State agencies and potentially with commercial actors, depending on what happens.  That is surprising given all the difficulties we have had, for example, with NAMA, and the lack of accountability and transparency and subsequently the very significant charges that deals were done without the adequate level of attention to the public interest.  We only get access to that information when it comes to light several years later, either in the Comptroller and Auditor General's look-back report or through good investigative journalism.  Surely, if the Government wants the public to have confidence in this new agency, the publication of an annual report and the maximum level of transparency would be a good thing.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 70 relates to a requirement for the Minister to put in the public domain information regarding directions to the agency within 30 days of those directions, as opposed to "as soon as practicable", which is the wording in the Bill.  Again, the public and Opposition and backbench Government Deputies need to have access to the maximum level of information about the operations of this agency to protect the public interest.  That is our job, and I can see no reason for the Minister of State to oppose that amendment either.</p></speech>

I do not have any issue with that, it is fine.  The section I am seeking to amend relates to the review of the achievement of the purposes of the legislation.  The review is required every five years.  I do not think the timeframe is adequate, it should be done on an annual basis.  If the Minister considers an annual review is too frequent and it is every two years, I could probably live with that, but as it is a new agency an annual review would ensure that the LDA is operating in compliance with the purposes of the legislation.  The reason I am tabling the amendment is that it is a good, sensible measure.  To be clear, the Bill allows for an annual report.  That side of it is fine, but every five years for the review of the achievement of the purposes of the legislation is far too infrequent, especially given that the agency is new.</p></speech>

The aim of the annual report is to ensure that the agency is accountable in terms of its actions and operations.  Its performance in the context of the achievement of the objectives outlined in the legislation is outlined in the five-year report.  Other State agencies have also introduced timescales to reflect their activities.  The role of the LDA is to acquire sites and deliver the construction of homes and a significantly lengthy period is required to carry out the work.  A five-year timescale has been deemed appropriate to best reflect how the agency is performing in terms of the Act considering the timescale required to deliver on these sites.  Everyone on this committee knows the job is challenging.  The Bill also provides for the Minister to request a report at any time on how the agency is adhering to its objectives.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 70 seeks to replace the timeline of "as soon as practicable" at section 8(6) for a timeline of "within 30 days".  I am opposing amendment No. 70, as the current timeline is appropriate for such matters.  Section 8 provides that the Minister can at any stage require the LDA to report to him or her on the its progress in achieving the purposes of the legislation.</p><p>In addition, the LDA would be required to report to the Minister on its progress periodically.  The first report is due in 2024.  Subsection (6) relates to the giving of directions by the Minister to the agency following a review of a report received under the section.  The Minister shall cause copies of any direction given under this section, as currently drafted, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after the direction is given or action taken.  It is normal, as part of the governance of State agencies, that the Minister can issue a direction to an agency.  These directions will generally relate to the implementation of Government policy.  The LDA is required to comply with any direction issued under this section .  The proposed amendment seeks to provide that the Minister shall cause copies of any direction given under this section to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 20 days of the direction given or action taken.  I am opposing the amendment and allowing for ministerial directions to be laid as soon as practicable, as is appropriate for this section.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#E02000"><p>I move amendment No. 71:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 13, to delete lines 5 and 6 and substitute &quot;establish a non-commercial semi-state agency.&quot;. </blockquote> <p>I have two amendments in this grouping, Nos. 71 and 74, which I will discuss together.  Amendment No. 71 is one of the most fundamental amendments my colleague Deputy Gould and I have tabled.  It is to make the case for a land development agency, if such an entity is to exist, that is a non-commercial semi-State body.  The original proposition on the LDA, as announced, by Fine Gael in 2018, was to have an off-balance-sheet vehicle because it did not want its borrowings and expenditure to be State borrowings and expenditure.  Fine Gael wanted to set it up as a commercial semi-State body using the DAC model.  As we know, to secure off-balance-sheet status under EUROSTAT, a majority of a body's activities have to be on the open market.  That is why, when the LDA was originally announced, 60% of the homes it was to deliver were to be sold at open market prices, with a social housing proportion of only 10% and an affordable housing proportion of 30%, as members will remember.</p><p>One of the significant changes in this Bill is that the proportions of 10% and 30% and the 60% for open market sale are gone.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as Minister, has repeatedly told us he wants a majority of the homes on LDA land to be social and affordable.  He has been quite coy about what the proportion of unaffordable, open market priced homes would be, particularly on sites such as St. Kevin's in Cork and on the Dundrum Central site, but there will be open market sales.  The LDA is going to remain on balance sheet for some time, however.  If, as we know, 100%, 90% or 60% of the homes in the first round of projects are to be social and affordable, the transactions cannot be off balance sheet.  Therefore, all the agency's borrowings and expenditure will be on the general government balance sheet.</p><p>There is no reason, therefore, for it to be a commercial semi-State body.  One of the great advantages of making it a commercial semi-State body is borrowings.  It will be able to get the advantageous State borrowing rates which are much cheaper than private borrowings.  That is the case with Irish Water.  One of the great values of that entity, for all of its historical problems, is that it is on balance sheet.  It also provides for greater transparency and accountability.</p><p> To repeat a point I made in the previous meeting, if I want information about what a local authority is spending on land or housing, that information is available to me.  It is fully transparent.  Once one uses a commercial semi-State body, because of the application of the Companies Act, commercial sensitivity applies.  Significant volumes of information about spending and borrowing are redacted and transparency is greatly diminished.  That was one of the many problems with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and using public private partnerships being as a mechanism for delivery of social housing.  I will not rehearse my arguments on why we should not take that approach.  However, I am strongly of the view that if we are to have a State agency, it should be a non-commercial State agency which accesses cheaper government borrowing and provides full transparency on its borrowings and expenditure so the public has full visibility on its activities.</p></speech>

I invite him to speak on those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#F00300"><p>In a similar vein, our amendment proposes that the LDA be a public agency rather than a commercial entity, as envisaged in the Government's Bill.  It is noteworthy that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, appears to have moved over to the socialist position on housing policy, on which I commend it.  It may give the Government pause for thought on its misguided approach to resolving the housing crisis and its determination, through the Land Development Agency Bill, to involve private investment vehicles in trying to resolve the housing crisis.  The ESRI, it would appear, differs with the Government and concurs with the views of the left in that what we should do is have direct State investment.  It is suggesting we should be borrowing between &euro;4 billion and &euro;7 billion per year to invest directly in delivering public and affordable housing.  It is suggesting we could develop 18,000 public and affordable units per year, a figure remarkably similar to the one in People Before Profit's proposal on dealing with the housing crisis.</p> <p>  The Government, in responding to us and others on the left with a similar policy, such as Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats, regularly dismisses it as fanciful.  It now seems the ESRI does not think it is fanciful.  The ESRI points out, as we have repeatedly done over many years, that the net cost to the State would reduce over time because the State could progressively reduce the huge waste of money being spent on housing assistance payments, HAP, and leasing arrangements if it directly invested, upfront and big time, in its own public and affordable housing stock.  Over time, it would reduce the huge outgoings on HAP and leasing payments.</p> <p>  It is in that context that we are saying the LDA should be a purely public agency.  It should not be a commercial agency in any shape or form and should not involve private finance or capital.  There is no need to do that, as the ESRI points out.  If the Government has not listened to us in recent years, it may listen to the ESRI which is echoing our view that what we need is for the State to directly provide its own public and affordable housing building programme.  It also needs to scale up and double the current level of investment, as the ESRI suggests.  It is in that context that it makes sense for the agency to be purely public.</p></speech>

I will address amendments Nos. 71 and 74, as jointly tabled by Deputies Eoin &Oacute; Broin and Thomas Gould, and amendments Nos. 72 and 73, as jointly tabled by Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Gino Kelly, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Mick Barry.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 71 and 72 seek to replace and provide that the LDA will be established as a public non-commercial State agency instead of a designated activity company, DAC, as provided for.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 73 and 74 seek to delete some or all of subsections 2, 3 and 4 of section 11.  Subsections 2, 3 and 4 concern the naming of the agency, the disapplication of certain provisions of the Companies Act and provide for the agency to be independent in the performance of its functions.</p> <p>  Section 11 provides for the formation of the Land Development Agency as a designated activity company limited by shares, under the Companies Act.  The LDA will be a commercial semi-State body and will be independent in the performance of its functions.  Subsections 2 and 3 concern the naming of the agency and the disapplication of certain provisions of the Companies Act.  I am opposing this amendment because all three of these subsections are integral to section 11.  Deletion of these subsections would cause the section to only refer to the establishment of a DAC and would delete any reference to the naming of this DAC.</p> <p>  I am opposing these amendments because the Government has decided the LDA will be a commercial State company and there would be a significant cost to the Exchequer if these amendments were accepted.  The Bill has been drafted on the basis that all provisions have been carefully considered and drafted to ensure the LDA can work commercially.  Subsections 2, 3 and 4 are integral to section 11 and their deletion would cause this section to only refer to the establishment of a DAC and would delete any reference to the name of the DAC and its being independent in the performance of its functions.</p> <p>  The LDA is being established as a designated activity company.  As a DAC, the LDA will be able to receive investment funding from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, through its share capitalisation.  The initial shareholding in the LDA will be &euro;100 million, with the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform holding shares with a value of &euro;99 million and the Minister for Housing holding shares of &euro;1 million.  Deputy Boyd Barrett can clearly see it is a publicly-owned company.  There is no ambiguity or doubt surrounding that.</p> <p>  On a number of other points raised by Deputies, the independent adjudication of EUROSTAT is that the State should make LDA expenditure off balance sheet.  The Government's intention is that this expenditure would not be permanently on balance sheet.  For this reason, we are trying pave the way to achieve that.  We know the scale of the challenge ahead in terms of the capital that has to be raised to deliver housing in this State.  The LDA is a key actor in that delivery.  We know the high thresholds that will apply as regards affordability rates and we want to see almost 100% affordability achieved in the Dublin area.  That is important.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding members' views, a number of semi-State agencies are fully publicly-owned and the new agency will not be any different.  I also remind members that the fiscal rules, which are currently suspended, may be reintroduced in future.  The State and the new agency must have the capacity to operate in a countercyclical manner to ensure they can deliver housing at scale, which our citizens so badly need and deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#F00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He indicated that establishing the Land Development Agency as a non-commercial semi-State body would create a considerable expense on the Exchequer.  Every single euro the LDA acquires through the ISIF or borrowing and every euro it spends for the next number of years is on balance sheet.  That is the current position.</p><p>If it is the intention of the Government to honour the commitment given by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, that the majority of homes on LDA sites will be social and affordable, getting this funding off balance sheet will not be possible.</p><p> The Minister of State is completely correct that this is a matter for the CSO, in the first instance, and then EUROSTAT to decide if a vehicle is on or off balance sheet.  We know the bar that EUROSTAT sets for such a decision because in the very significant EUROSTAT decision on Irish Water, the five points it outlined as to why Irish Water would be on balance sheet are all very clearly in evidence here, in that the majority of the activity of the LDA, as promised by the Minister, will be non-commercial, that is, providing sociable and affordable housing.  The system for allocating those homes will be nominations through the local authorities for the social housing but also for the purchase of the affordable element.  The board's policies, particularly the requirement to abide by Government policy and direction, are enshrined in this legislation.  It is virtually impossible to see how the LDA can come off balance sheet unless - this is a very important point that the Minister of State made &ndash; it is in order to satisfy the core requirement of the market corporation test of EUROSTAT by providing that a majority of the residential units on LDA land are sold at commercial open market prices.  I do not dispute the Minister&rsquo;s view and I know it is Fine Gael&rsquo;s desire for the LDA to be off balance sheet.  However, if the Minister wants to achieve this, the only way he can do so is if, in the round, 60% of the homes the LDA delivers will be sold at open market prices, which we know are eminently unaffordable.</p><p> Given that the majority of the LDA activity is going to be in Dublin, the Government cannot, on the one hand, promise that up to a majority of the homes in Dublin will be social and affordable while, on the other hand, saying that it wants the LDA to be off balance sheet.  This is a crucial issue and I understand the LDA itself is quite concerned about this because it is not understand how its target of 150,000 homes, as promised by the then Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the then Ministers, Deputy Donohoe, and Mr. Eoghan Murphy, back in 2018 is going to be achieved if the agency is not off balance sheet.  The LDA does not see how it is going to be off balance sheet if the promise of the Minister that the majority of the homes will be social and affordable is to met.  </p><p> This response by the Minister of State exposes a fundamental flaw in how the Government is dealing with this matter.  It shows the deeply confused nature of this legislation and the different promises of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael as to what the LDA will deliver.  On that basis, I am pressing this amendment because it would be cheaper and more efficient to have a centralised housing agency on balance sheet as a non-commercial semi-State body and borrowing, exactly as Deputy Boyd Barrett stated and as recommended by the ESRI today, at historically low rates to provide the volume of public homes that we need.  As I said, this exposes the fundamental flaw of this entire enterprise and on that basis, this amendment is even more valid than it was before.</p></speech>

It is directly challenging the logic behind the Government&rsquo;s approach, as embodied in the Land Development Agency Bill.  The Government&rsquo;s obsession with public private partnerships and involving private investment, as well as the knock-on consequences of all of that in having to operate on a commercial basis, leads then to the requirement to sell some of the housing at full market price.  All of this is being justified on the basis that we have to keep the LDA off balance sheet, we do not want to inflate Government debt and so forth.  The ESRI is directly challenging that logic.  The Minister of State should respond to the point.</p> <p>  I add to that the point I made about the huge cost we are incurring annually, which continues to grow, through leasing and HAPs arrangements because we are not building enough of our own stock of public housing.  In the case of the LDA, we will not maximise the potential we have on our own land to deliver our own stock of public housing because the Government insists that some of it will have to be sold privately at market prices and so on.  It is, therefore, limiting the ability of the public land bank to develop public housing which can then wean us off the extortionate annual cost of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and HAP arrangements, which are required to substitute for the failure of the State to develop on a sufficient scale its own stock of public housing.  The Minister of State should also respond to that point.</p></speech>

The game is up now for the Government and it can no longer ignore the very clear and strong calls for public investment along the lines of what the ESRI and the rest of us have been saying for a long number of years.  The Government can no longer dismiss that argument.</p> <p>  On the on balance sheet versus off balance sheet argument put forward in respect of the LDA, Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the LDA is going to be on balance sheet for the foreseeable future.  There is no question about that.  The question that arises is whether the EU fiscal rules and orthodoxy will still exist by the time the LDA is possibly off balance sheet.  Those rules belong to a previous era and mainstream economists no longer subscribe to that fiscal orthodoxy.  That said, even if mainstream thinkers still subscribed to it, there is a very strong case, given the housing emergency we have, for breaking those rules, if needs be.</p> <p>  The idea that we would, because of the orthodoxy of the EU fiscal rules, perpetuate circumstances in which more than 8,000 people are living in emergency accommodation and 120,000 people are on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies is utterly unacceptable.  Bearing in mind that European Union member states are engaging in serious breaches of the rule of law, involving breaches of fundamental democratic rights, human rights, press freedom and attacks on the LGBTI+ community, all without proper sanction, the idea that the European Union would sanction Ireland for investing in public housing in the middle of an emergency crisis while turning a blind eye to all of those breaches of the rule of law and democratic rights is not in any way credible.</p> <p>  The Centre for Housing Law, Rights and Policy in NUI Galway has produced very good research on EU state aid rules and cost rental housing.  It very clearly put forward the legal case that a legitimate case can be made under EU state aid rules to support interventions in housing to address housing market failure.  We very clearly have housing market failure.  We do not need today&rsquo;s ESRI report to know that.  The case for public investment is overwhelming and the use of the outdated and previously mainstream EU fiscal orthodoxy, which some of us have never supported, as an excuse is a red herring.  Will members of this Government be the last people in Europe defending those rules?  Everybody else has moved on from them?</p></speech>

However, I am not sure what part of those two Bills he does not understand.  The core direction of both is to ensure there is a legislative basis for significant delivery of public housing by the State on land that we own.</p><p>The Minister in the D&aacute;il has said that in places like Dublin, 100% of the units will be social and affordable.  The use of open market sales to subsidise or reduce housing investment on the site is therefore not Government policy.  The Minister has said that very clearly in the course of this debate.  This Bill allows the LDA to establish DAC subsidiaries to deliver affordable housing and public housing.  The Affordable Housing Bill allows for council-led affordable housing on council land.  As late as this morning the Secretary General of the Department confirmed that the &euro;500 million we spend on HAP needs to be phased out because it is better value for money for us to spend capital money on the delivery of housing.  In many ways all the last few contributions re-fight an argument that was settled in the general election.  The State is back in the business of building houses, we are going to do it on a massive scale, and the Housing for All programme we will see in the summer will, I believe, do exactly what the ESRI wants us to do, which is to increase significantly the capital spending on this.  I really welcome the ESRI's report this morning.  It is really important and I think it will allow for the aggressive delivery of the legislation that Opposition parties are opposing.</p></speech>

The Minister and the Government have to recognise this now.  It is unbelievable that we are listening this morning to comments from Government Deputies who do not accept the facts.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, our party and other parties on the left have been calling for a massive housebuilding programme for some time.  That is the only thing that can solve the housing crisis.  What we have in the LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill does not go anywhere near far enough to deliver the houses we need.  The Government parties of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party do not realise this.  Is it that they do not realise it or that they do not accept that their policies are wrong and will not deliver the housing we need?  The housing crisis did not start today or yesterday.  We have been in this for ten years.  We know that the only way out of it is to build houses.</p> <p>  Deputy McAuliffe talked about how we spend &euro;500 million a year on HAP.  It is unbelievable that that is a Government strategy to try to deal with the housing crisis-----</p></speech>

Instead of giving it to landlords and making them rich, we should be spending that money and building houses.

I will be brief.  We are in the middle of a housing emergency.  We are the committee that has oversight over housing.  It seems simple to me that if we do not build houses as quickly as we possibly can, the emergency will continue to get worse.  That is why we are tabling amendments.  Deputy McAuliffe made a comment about the State being back into building houses.  In Cork city the State is building no houses.  Cork City Council is getting private developers to build estates that it is then purchasing off them to deliver them.  Where I live in Gurranabraher and where I come from in Knocknaheeny the estates were directly built by the local authorities with funding from central government.  That is what we need to get back to now: actually building houses ourselves.  I will not hold up the meeting any more, but that is the only way to tackle the housing emergency.</p></speech>

I think everybody here welcomes the ESRI report.  We all agree we need to put money into housing, but the reality is that we have the LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill.  That is the mechanism to resolve the housing issues we have, backed up by increased investment by the Government.  This committee can become very polarised but I think everybody here agrees that we need to solve the housing crisis.  The LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill are two key mechanisms in that, but I agree with and support what the ESRI says in that we need additional investment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#H01400"><p>Sure, and I apologise for coming in.  I just thought it would be important to respond to Deputy McAuliffe's point.  The point is that we should legislate in line with Government policy.  If the new policy of the Government is the direct provision of public housing, as Deputy McAuliffe says, and for 100% public and affordable housing on public land, let us first acknowledge that that is a departure from the initial conception of the LDA.  The problem is that the legislation is in line with the old policy.  The actual detail of the legislation is not in line with the policy Deputy McAuliffe is articulating; it is in line with the old policy.  Critically, this centres on the amendments we are now discussing.  If what we are trying to do is deliver public and affordable housing on public land, why set up the agency to do this as a commercial company rather than a public agency?  The two things do not go together.  I am afraid verbal commitments from the Government that it is in favour of what we are arguing for, what the ESRI is now arguing for and what Deputy McAuliffe says the Government is now in favour of do not tally with what is in this Bill.  What this Bill is about is setting up a commercial entity that is allowed - and this legislation facilitates this - to enter into commercial arrangements with private investment vehicles.</p></speech>

I also do not want to get back into political to-and-fro between members of the committee.  I will ask the Minister of State to respond to some of the comments that were made and to try to answer some of those questions and then ask Deputy &Oacute; Broin to press the amendment if he so wishes.</p></speech>

I thank the members again for all their genuine and valuable contributions.  I understand where each and every one is coming from.  I note members saying the fiscal rules may not be here at some point in the future.  Unfortunately, I cannot operate that scratch card type of economics whereby you have a crystal ball before you and you make predictions and put legislation through that affects citizens based on that.  My job is to try to put through the best Bill we can put through that will deliver the largest scale of social and affordable housing in this State.  I remind members that the affordable percentages are not limits; they are a minimum target.  That is the first key thing.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been very clear that in Dublin he expects the delivery mechanism through the LDA to result in 100% affordable housing.  With the previous Government it was 30%.  Again, that was not a limit but a minimum.  I remind members that through Part V we have the increase to 20%.  There seems to be a huge misunderstanding on the committee as to how EUROSTAT and the CSO compile or accredit what is off balance sheet and what is not.</p><p>Affordability is not a metric for any agency that is off balance sheet.  The metric is whether it can wash its face and how it carries out its business.  The LDA, like Coillte and other semi-State companies, will carry out its business by project managing with local authorities.  The affordability criteria are set in stone for public lands.  There will be a minimum of 50% social and affordable housing, with prices reduced by 20% under Part 5.  That gives the LDA capacity and it will project manage with local authorities.  The cost-rental element will be 30% below cost rents.</p><p> Anyone in this committee who suggests that, notwithstanding the massive economic challenges this State faces and the requirement to build 350,000 houses for citizens over the next decade at a probable cost of &euro;100 billion, the State can shoulder the full cost in future and we should not have a semi-State agency that can deliver housing units countercyclically, regardless of how stressed the State is, is living in fantasy land.  We have to provide the maximum number of affordable housing units.  The Minister has said it is his intention to deliver 100% affordable housing in Dublin.  </p><p> I remind Members that these figures are minimum rates, not targets.  We have to have an honest and open debate on how to deliver these affordable houses our citizens badly need.  I also remind members that the LDA is a publicly-owned semi-State company.  I hope that will allay concerns.</p><p> With regard to the ESRI report on the challenge the State faces, the Department has a record budget for delivering housing.  There is no point in muddying the waters by saying affordability is a criterion applied by EUROSTAT.  It is not.</p></speech>

How will the Government address affordable housing when there has been a 37% increase in the cost of materials coming into this country since 1 January?  That increase is due to the 2040 plan brought in by the Government in 2018.  The Government refused to accept an amendment by the Rural Independent Group on this two weeks ago.  Nobody in this country will be able to get affordable housing because that Bill was not amended.  We now have a shortage of housing, not only in built-up areas, a 37% increase in material costs and a lack of contractors to do the work.</p> <p>  The Minister of State says he will deliver affordable housing.  He gave a rough costing of &euro;100 billion.  What he is saying is not accurate.  I have been in construction all my life.  I see the changes daily.  There are ships on the seas carrying materials that are being bid for by different countries and the highest bidder gets those ships into port.</p> <p>  Brexit has caused a massive problem in our ports, with goods held up for the last three weeks.  The costs are caused by what is happening in the ports and one section not talking to the other.  The Government is causing a bigger problem.  To get affordable housing we have to get equipment and materials into the country and we must have the right number of people available to build it.  The 2040 plan has caused a 40% to 50% hike in prices for housing.  The Government has caused a problem in local authorities with the number of planning applications coming in at the moment.  I have 70 applications for housing on my books.  I am getting phone calls daily on a programme introduced by a Fine Gael-led Government in 2018, which has led to a 37% increase in costs.  Nothing will be affordable in this country until the Government simplifies things for the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I am strongly of the view that all appointments to the board, whether of the chair or of other members, should be made through the public appointments process.  This is a discussion we had frequently with the previous Government and ordinarily we were told that, even though the appointment is made by the Minister, it is intended that the public appointments process be used.  The difficulty, however, is that, unless this process is explicitly required by the legislation, the process for public appointments may be bypassed.  In fact, if I understand correctly, that happened recently in respect of some appointments made by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to the Climate Change Advisory Council.  We have a public appointments process for a reason, which is to ensure that there can be no political patronage or cronyism, and nor can there be a perception of such patronage or cronyism.</p><p>I am therefore strongly of the view that all such appointments to State boards, whether they be the boards of commercial or non-commercial agencies, should be made through that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#M00200"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for his amendments.  The Government has two amendments in this grouping, Nos. 103 and 105.  These amendments are technical amendments to provide that the appointment of the board and chair of the board will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The provision as currently drafted provides that the Minister appoints individuals to these roles and these amendments bring these provisions in line with similar provisions for other commercial State bodies by ensuring that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as shareholder, also consents to them.</p> <p>  I would remind Deputies that all appointees to the board, including the chair, will be recruited through the State boards process and in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The Public Appointments Service is currently running a competition to appoint the chair of the Land Development Agency and I hope that this process will be completed shortly.  </p> <p>  I will address now address amendments Nos. 102 and 104, which have been tabled jointly by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Deputy Gould.  Amendments Nos. 102 and 104 seek to amend a provision in section 15 to the effect that all members of the LDA board and the chair are to be appointed by the Minister and to substitute for this a provision to the effect that appointments are to be made through the State boards appointment process.</p> <p>  I am opposed to this amendment as it will be the case that all appointments to the board of the LDA will be carried out through the State boards process.  This is in line with the code of practice for the governance of State boards.  As is standard, the Public Appointments Service will run all LDA board competitions, in partnership with the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA.  Shortlisted candidates will be presented to the Minister for consideration.  As I said, the appointment of the chair is currently going through this process.  </p> <p>  It is clear that we have to abide by the code of practice.  It is a robust document.  Any changes that would have to be made to it if we were to accept this amendment to the legislation would necessitate a whole range of changes to different Acts as we would be adopting the principle that Acts would be changed each time.  We want one robust document for public appointments and we have one.  The document is really satisfactory.  There is nothing like action.  The appointment of the chairperson is currently going through the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#M00300"><p>As I expected, the Minister of State has given exactly the same rote response as his counterparts gave when we discussed these matters in respect of earlier legislation.  The difficulty is that, unless this is legally required under the Act rather than being advised in a voluntary code of practice to which the Government adheres, a Minister can make direct appointments, bypassing the public appointments process.  In many instances, including during the term of this Government, Ministers have done just that.  I used the recent appointments to the Climate Change Advisory Council as a case in point.  I fully accept what the Minister of State has said with regard to the code of practice.  In general, the Government does use the Public Appointments Service, but it does not always do so.  There should be no circumstances in which a Minister, regardless of who he or she is, can bypass that process.  This caused enormous controversy in previous governments.  Ministers appointed people who were widely believed to be politically aligned with the general thinking of those Ministers to significant State boards despite the fact that the code of practice which the Minister of State has outlined was in place at that stage.  I refer not only to the previous Government but the Government before that, when Fine Gael was in government with Labour.</p> <p>  I do not accept the argument that making the use of the public appointments process legally required creates complications.  It is a simple amendment which would prevent a Minister from making a direct appointment.  All of our parties agree that not only do we want to end cronyism, but that we want to end the perception of cronyism.  The best way to do so is to make sure that no Minister can make an appointment outside of the public appointments process.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>
