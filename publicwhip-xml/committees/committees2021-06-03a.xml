Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are meeting that requirement.</p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.  Today we will engage with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We engaged with the Department last November and today we will resume our examination of the 2019 Appropriation Accounts, Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government, with a specific focus on expenditure and value for money in relation to the following areas: the rental assistance scheme, otherwise known as RAS; the housing assistance payment, or HAP; the repair and lease scheme; the enhanced long term social housing leasing scheme; and emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage: Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General; Ms &Aacute;ine Stapleton and Mr. Barry Quinlan, assistant secretaries general; Ms Deirdre Mason, Mr. David Kelly and Mr. Eamonn Waters, principal officers.  We are also joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms. Clare Costello, principal officer in the housing Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The witnesses are all very welcome.</p>  <p>  When we begin to engage, I must ask members and witnesses to mute themselves if they are not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode.  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards references to other persons made in evidence.  The evidence of a witness who is physically present or who gives evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, a number of today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the precincts and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness present.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and may think it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  </p>  <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>  <p>  To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name when first contributing.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, delivered his opening statement on the Vote last November, which has been re-circulated to the committee prior to the meeting.  Unless Mr. McCarthy wishes to address the committee, we will move straight into Mr. Doyle's opening statement.  Is Mr. McCarthy happy to proceed thus?</p></speech>

I am joined remotely by a number of colleagues from the Department.  Ms &Aacute;ine Stapleton is assistant secretary with responsibility for the social housing delivery division.  I am also joined by Mr. Paul Lemass, rather than Mr. Barry Quinlan, as indicated by the Chairman.  Mr. Lemass is assistant secretary with responsibility for the housing policy, legislation and governance division.  I understand that Mr. Lemass is having some technical problems this morning but hopefully he will be with us shortly.  I am also joined by subject matter experts in the areas of social housing delivery and emergency accommodation, Ms Deirdre Mason, Mr. David Kelly and Mr. Eamonn Waters.  As requested by the committee, I have provided some advance briefing material for the meeting and a copy of my opening statement.  As this meeting is a resumption of the committee's examination of Vote 34 which took place across 25 and 26 November and as time is limited, I will focus on the areas set out in the committee&rsquo;s invitation for today.<br/><br/>Total housing expenditure in 2019 was &euro;2.34 billion, representing an increase of 19% on the outturn for 2018.  This was comprised of current expenditure of &euro;901 million and capital expenditure of &euro;1.445 billion.  An additional &euro;93 million from local property tax, LPT, receipts was also used by certain local authorities to fund housing programmes.  The focus of the Department&rsquo;s 2019 activity in the area of housing was led by the actions set out in the six-year Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<i>. </i></p> <p>Social housing delivery represents the largest proportion of expenditure under the housing programme and the schemes that the committee has asked us to focus on today are primarily current expenditure-funded delivery structures.</p> <p> In order to situate these programmes properly in the overall context of expenditure on housing, it is crucial to understand why the State relies on capital and current structures for social housing.  Simply put, it is about maximising the number of homes we can deliver and meeting the housing needs of all those who are reliant on the State for support.  We cannot just look at the local authority housing waiting lists when considering meeting housing need.  We must also look at all of those households already being supported.  This means enabling local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, to manage and maintain existing tenancies and properties, upgrade and relet stock, and manage day-to-day interactions with households, including applications, differential rent and transfers.  When we look at the totality of households in a housing support or in need of a housing support, the number exceeds 300,000.</p> <p> The Department is responsible for providing the resources, be they financial, legal or policy frameworks, to enable local authorities, AHBs and other stakeholders to operate a social housing system that provides for all eligible households.  Crucially, the State must meet these costs in a way that is aligned with domestic and EU fiscal rules.</p> <p> A whole housing system such as this has component parts that exist to meet the need for immediate, mid-term and long-term supports.  While we focus intensively on creating new supply, particularly new build supply, we must continue to have immediate options available to households that require them.</p> <p> Turning briefly to the schemes that the committee is interested in for this meeting, we will start with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  RAS has been an important contributor to social housing supply since its introduction on a pilot basis in 2005 and has placed responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or longer and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need.  RAS has enabled rent supplement to return to its original objective as a short-term income support.  By the end of 2019, the housing needs of more than 18,000 households were being met through RAS.</p> <p> The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is also a form of social housing support for people who have a long-term housing need.  HAP is an important part of the social housing options available across the country.  At the end of 2019, more than 52,000 households were having their housing needs met under the scheme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300003#B00600"><p>HAP gives local authorities greater flexibility to accommodate households in their areas of choice, provides a secure payment for tenant and landlord alike, removes barriers for people to return to employment and leads to improved property standards.</p>  <p>  In terms of reliance on the private rented sector for housing supports, it is important to note that fewer households were reliant on State support in 2019 than were in 2014.  The principal areas where such supports are provided are under HAP and RAS and also under rent supplement, which is operated by the Department of Social Protection.  In 2014, there were 92,000 tenancies under these schemes.  By the end of 2019, this number had reduced to 87,000.</p>  <p>  Leasing is one of the range of options available to local authorities to supplement delivery of social housing.  It represents less than 20% of targets but allows local authorities to secure long-term homes in areas where demand is high but they have neither land available for housing nor existing stock.  It frees up fiscal space so that more capital can be invested in build activity.  Leasing mechanisms allow the State to address a greater proportion of social housing need in the short run within a tight budgetary environment.  There are many types of leasing, including the enhanced lease and the repair and leasing scheme, which are on the list of topics for this meeting.</p>  <p>  The enhanced leasing scheme is aimed at property developers and investors who can deliver newly built or yet-to-be built houses and apartments for leasing at a scale of 20 or more units for a term of 25 years.  It secures homes at the earliest stage, provides certainty to the market and allows developers to secure construction finance in order to commence builds.  It also allows for units to be secured in areas or developments that may not otherwise be available for social housing.  One of the advantages of the scheme is that the lessor is obliged to provide management and maintenance services for the properties.</p>  <p>  The repair and leasing scheme is aimed at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the necessary funding to bring them up to the standard required for rental properties.  Under the scheme, the cost of the necessary repairs to properties will be met up front by the local authority or an AHB, with the cost of the repairs being recovered from the property owner by offsetting it against future lease payments.  This allows the local authority to access units quickly that may not otherwise have been made available for social housing.  Dwellings brought back into use under the scheme span a range of dwelling types, including over-the-shop properties, former bedsits, city centre terraced houses and one-off rural dwellings.</p>  <p>  While what I have set out reflects some of the positive indicators and increasing provision of social housing, we are keenly aware of the substantial work that remains to be done.  The number of homeless households supported to move from emergency accommodation to homes increased by 16% between 2018 and 2019, but the challenge remains in making substantial and sustainable inroads into reducing the net numbers reliant on emergency accommodation and services and we continue to prioritise working with housing authorities and NGOs.  Prevention is just as critical as developing pathways for exits.  In 2020 alone, almost 5,900 exits from homelessness were achieved.  All of these exits were to homes with tenancies.  Since the peak in October 2019 when 10,514 individuals were homeless, there has been a fall of 2,432, or 23%, based on the most recent data published on Friday last, 27 May.  While this trend is welcome, there is a continuing need to work with local authorities to develop and deliver high-quality emergency accommodation for homeless households.  Expenditure on homelessness involves much more than the provision of a bed and a temporary roof.  Complex other needs must be met.</p>  <p>  Across all areas, we will be unrelenting in our commitment to achieve the best outcome for citizens using the resources provided to us by the Exchequer.  The new programme for Government seeks to place an even more demanding ambition on delivery to be achieved in the years ahead.  Rising to meet this ambition will be the cornerstone of social housing activity for this Department.</p>  <p>  Housing expenditure in 2020 amounted to over &euro;2.6 billion and supported the social housing needs of more than 24,000 additional households across our social housing delivery streams and those already in a support.  Like many sectors, the impact of Covid-19 has been challenging for the Department and its stakeholders this year.  However, we continue to push for maximum feasible delivery across all streams.  In 2021, a provision of over &euro;3.3 billion is available for the housing programme.  This represents the largest ever investment in housing and will support implementation of the ambitions in the programme for Government, with a particular focus on increasing supply through new build activity.</p>  <p>  I hope that my opening statement, together with the advance briefing provided to the committee, has provided a rounded context for the specific housing programmes listed for today's discussion.  Housing is clearly one of the Department's key priorities.  I assure the committee that my team, our delivery partners and I will continue to work day in and day out to support the delivery of much-needed homes for citizens.  My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee's work today.</p></speech>

Today's lead committee speaker is Deputy McAuliffe, who has joined us in the committee room because he must also vote at a committee that is sitting next door.  The only way he could be accommodated was to have him be present.  However, we are socially distanced well beyond the requirement.  I think the distance is 6 m, not 2 m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300003#B00800"><p>Both politically and physically distanced, but I appreciate the Chairman's courtesy this morning.  I am present because we are voting on the Land Development Agency Bill next door.</p>  <p>  Implicit in the debate during the previous general election and in subsequent reports, including as late as this morning in the ESRI's report on the need for a capital building programme, is a criticism that we have been too reliant on short-term interventions like HAP and RAS.  I might focus some of my questioning on this matter.  Of the Department's &euro;4 billion gross expenditure, how much was spent on HAP and RAS?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300003#B00900"><p>My apologies.  I was on mute for a moment.</p> <p>We saw that ESRI report as reported this morning.  Certain targets were set under the various delivery streams of Rebuilding Ireland.  The current programmes to which the Deputy referred are using current funding but in a way where the capital funding required to deliver under those programmes is far higher.  HAP or RAS involve a cost of, maybe, &euro;8,000 to &euro;11,000 per annum to house a family.  The upfront capital cost of that is very significant.</p> <p> As to the figures the Deputy requested, the 2019 figures were &euro;134 million in the RAS space and &euro;382 million in HAP.  The number of homes that supports is significant.  The issue of upping the capital spend the Deputy referred to involves the balancing of that upfront capital investment and borrowing by the State within the fiscal rules against the need to deliver homes for people in the short term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300004#C00200"><p>I accept that.  It is a trap the State has been involved in for the best part of 30 years of having a temporary support measure while also having a need for capital spending.  I take the figures of &euro;134 million for RAS and &euro;382 million for HAP.  I take the point that, on average, it provides a home for in the region of &euro;10,000 per year.  Mr. Doyle is correct that the capital costs would be far greater but the borrowing costs for building those homes might be closer to the figure of &euro;10,000 per year.</p>  <p>  I come to the second part of the question in regard to the ESRI report.  I do not expect Mr. Doyle to stray into Government policy but does he accept the premise that increased capital spending and reducing supports such as HAP and RAS is the future policy direction of the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300004#C00300"><p>It is, within the bounds of what will be available to us in terms of the national development plan, NDP, which is being reviewed at the moment.  Our hope as a Department is to increase the capital spend to deliver more homes into the system and to rebalance that spend over time versus current spending levels.  As we work over the coming weeks on developing the Housing for All strategy and work with the NDP review, there will be a greater focus on the capital elements.  The programme for Government commits to reducing our reliance on the use of HAP for new social housing as the supply of social and public housing increases over that time.  It will be a central element of Housing for All but there is a large quantity of homes to be provided and the level of capital we are talking about is very substantial, as the Deputy will be aware.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300004#C00400"><p>Does Mr. Doyle agree with the ESRI's summation that we need to double our spending in capital?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300004#C00500"><p>The Deputy will forgive me if I do not get pinned to a doubling figure but I certainly agree with the premise that we have to significantly increase our capital spend.  It has been increasing but it is essential as we move forward to try to deliver houses for people.</p></speech>

In many ways, it is an unfair comparison because, in many cases, it was a move from rent supplement, which was with the Department with responsibility for social welfare, towards HAP.  Can Mr. Doyle compare the transition from RAS to HAP and talk about why we have not seen the reduction in RAS we might have expected with the introduction of HAP?  Can he compare it with the reduction that social welfare saw over that period?</p></speech>

It is about refocusing the rent supplement payment in the Department of Social Protection as a short-term support, as it was previously.  Over the period, we have seen significant numbers of people become eligible for social housing supports and HAP has been used to meet that increasing need where in the past RAS would have grown in that context.</p>  <p>  RAS is still a useful housing support and one that gives some flexibility to local authorities in providing for the need presented to them.  The costs of providing an individual property under RAS have offset a bit.  I will bring in my colleague, Ms. Mason, on this.  She is our expert on the subject. </p></speech>

We do not see tenancies moving from RAS to HAP.  RAS and HAP are meeting a long-term housing need and the increase in HAP tenancies includes some transfers from rent supplement and people on the waiting list on rent supplement but there are additional people in the private rental sector coming into HAP after being in social housing.</p></speech>

The local authority has responsibility to rehouse people in RAS but HAP is grounded in the private rental market.  The basis of HAP is that tenants have to find their own property.  With RAS, the local authority has responsibility for finding a dwelling for the individual.  People on rent supplement can come into RAS in the same property as long as the local authority is happy the property meets the required standards and the needs of the individual or family involved.</p></speech>

If it was any other portion of public procurement, senior public procurement experts would manage that &euro;500 million.  Instead, the policy allows for thousands of people without any public procurement knowledge spending public money in a market where it inevitably has an inflationary impact.  Does Ms Mason accept that having, in some cases, very vulnerable people procuring the service on an individual basis is an inevitable way to get poor value for money, compared to if the State procured it in a more co-ordinated way?</p>  <p>  I saw a figure in, I think, 2014 or 2015 that &euro;8 million was being spent on the rent supplement scheme in my area, Finglas.  That could not have been getting good value for money because thousands of people were procuring that service.  It is not a good way of spending public money.</p></speech>

We have seen in HAP since its inception a large number of transfers into other forms of social housing.</p> <p>The vast majority of those transfers would be into units owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  There are over 9,000 tenancies in that category at this point.  The value for money aspect is that there are over 60,000 active tenancies in HAP at the moment.  While this is a large amount of Exchequer expenditure, it is providing for a huge number of households to be accommodated.  There are two points I would make about the average cost.  The average cost in terms of the landlord payments is about &euro;10,000.  The Exchequer element of that is only about &euro;8,000.  A report done by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in 2019 looked at the impact of HAP tenancies in an area.  The effects on rental levels have been mentioned.  It found that there is no clear correlation between the number of HAP tenancies in an area and increases in rent.  That was a very interesting finding.  It is one of the reasons that the Minister would say that we keep HAP limits under review.  We are conscious of any inflationary effects of increasing the limits.  The other point is that the limits are a separate discretion that local authorities have: 20% across the country and 50% for homeless households in Dublin.  Limits are set, which mitigates some of the risk in terms of inflated prices-----</p></speech>

It is a temporary, short-term, necessary support.  Nobody disagrees with that.  The question is: how long do we accept it as a short-term, necessary support?  Has the Department set a target for when an eighth of its budget will no longer be spent by thousands of people without any public procurement oversight on the individual contracts?</p></speech>

It is providing housing for 60,000 households at the moment.  We will make inroads into that over time.  As we develop targets for the year ahead, we will see how the build targets interact with that.</p></speech>

He makes them <i>bona fides</i>.  I know he is new to the Department.  He spoke about making &quot;inroads into that over time&quot;, but what we actually need to see over the next number of years is a radical revolution in the delivery of public housing.  We passed the Affordable Housing Bill in this House over the last number of weeks.  Is the Department ready to start rolling out that delivery to local authorities, using the Affordable Housing Bill and all the powers it gives to local authorities, to deliver in the short term?  Along with the societal impacts, there is a public spending issue, where nearly &euro;500 million is being spent on a policy that should be phased out in the short term.  The short question is whether the Department and the local authorities are ready to start this radical roll-out of housing.</p></speech>

We will increase the level of capital funding, I have no doubt, under the NDP review.  It was increasing in any event.  I suspect it will increase further.  We will work with our delivery partners to deliver houses under that, thus offsetting, exactly as the Deputy says.  It is a matter for the Government to agree the funding and the overall targets.  We will implement it to the best of our ability with the delivery partners we have.</p></speech>

I will speak specifically about the local authorities of Cork County Council and Cork City Council.  It shows that the number of inspections carried out to September 2020 in County Cork was 611 and in the city of Cork was 434.  Notwithstanding the public health restrictions, we can take out all of the last 12 months in terms of the inspection regime.  Is the Secretary General satisfied that the inspection regime is properly funded - we all speak from our own experiences as public representatives &ndash; such that it can be ensured that the policy and legislation are working effectively and we do not have families living in absolute slums?  That is how I would describe some of the properties I have seen that are beneficiaries of RAS or HAP payments.  I contend that the inspection regime is not fit for purpose.  I do not want to put the blame on the local authorities.  What is the link between the Department and the local authorities in respect of ensuring the inspectorate passes muster and is fit for purpose?  I put the question to the Secretary General.</p></speech>

The quality of accommodation provided under these schemes is of significant importance to us.  I had a conversation on the topic with my colleague, Ms Deirdre Mason, last week.  On the inspection of rental properties in general, could I bring in my colleague Mr. Paul Lemass for a moment?  I am afraid he has an issue with sound.  Specifically on HAP and RAS, my colleague, Ms Mason, and I had a conversation on the inspection side last week.  I will bring her in for a moment.</p></speech>

They are, however, part of the overall private rental inspections regime that local authorities carry out.  They are funded separately for that purpose.  HAP, specifically, is provided for in legislation.  An inspection is required when a property has not been inspected in the previous 12 months.  The inspection has to be arranged within eight months.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the Covid-19 emergency period has affected both the arrangement of and the carrying out of inspections, because local authorities could not enter people's houses under levels 4 and 5.  The overall number of HAP inspections carried out is about 50% of the total number of inspections carried out by local authorities over the last number of years.  The fact that it is required under legislation has an impact.  Under the umbrella of the restrictions that were required under Covid-19, a virtual inspection regime has also been brought in.  Dublin City Council piloted that.  A number of other local authorities &ndash; about ten &ndash; have taken it up, or have expressed an interest in doing so.  There was a number of virtual inspections carried out last year and this year.  This could be used well into the future.  More inspections could be done.</p></speech>

The point I make here is that the witnesses acknowledge that there is an issue with inspections.  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a bearing in terms of the number of inspections.  I ask that this is prioritised, so that the Department would liaise with the local authorities in order to ensure that the inspection regime is fit for purpose, robust, and properly resourced, and so that there is a significant increase in the number of whole-time equivalents, WTEs, that would be tasked with this.</p> <p>That is the only ask I have.  I do not think it is fair to ask a tenant to walk around with a mobile phone to look at his or her house.  We have to get people back into houses as quickly as possible.  This is about taxpayers&rsquo; money at the end of the day.  If we are talking about taxpayers&rsquo; money, we cannot have a situation where we have quite literally slum landlords.  This is the outworking and the resourcing of the policy.  Families with children with respiratory illnesses are coming to me because they are not in proper, fit-for-purpose accommodation.  That is a poor day for Ireland in terms of how we deal with families under those schemes.</p></speech>

In 2014, when it was introduced, there were 285 either builds or acquisitions.  In 2015, it was 4,000; in 2016 it was 4,025; and in 2017 it was 4,209.  If we look at HAP, and not at the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, there were 485 in 2014; 5,680 in 2015; 12,000 in 2016; 17,000 in 2017; and so on.  It is exactly as predicted.  It is really bad value for money.  It is not only bad value for money but it is a poor social policy.  We know that the most efficient spend is by direct builds in terms of cost.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has said we are now moving from HAP and RAS to long leasing, enhanced leasing for 25 and sometimes 30 years.  In fact, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concluded that long leasing at the height of a rental market in high-demand areas represented bad value for money.  What analysis has the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage done on getting value for money and on shaping policy so that we will get value for money?  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report produced today recommends that we spend considerably more on housing, because it is driving costs in the economy.  What bearing will that have in terms of housing policy and on value for money?</p></speech>

It includes issues around the maintenance of properties, etc., over time.  Fundamentally, part of that is to provide housing where it is needed as quickly as possible, under the pressures that the State has been under to do so over the last number of years.  These current programmes have allowed that to happen.  Of course, we would prefer to be delivering new build properties, which is what we do-----</p></speech>

The State, through the local authorities, has had a considerable land bank.  The output, in terms of direct builds, is woefully inadequate and below what has been announced.  There seems to be impediments to direct builds, which are the most cost-efficient way of delivering housing stock because there will be an asset at the end.   However, we seem to be taking this lazy option of going for long leases and, essentially, tying up money in perpetuity.  One is effectively paying the mortgage on those properties for 25 years, refurbishing those at the end and handing them back to the owner or developer.  I cannot for the life of me see how that is value for money.  Indeed, when we had the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, in, it told us it was the least cost-efficient way of delivering housing.  Does value for money play a part in the thinking of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage?  Is it trying to unravel the impediments to getting local authorities directly building?  What is it doing in relation to that?  We will not get to value for money unless we do that.</p></speech>

I refer to putting in place a new build programme, the upfront capital costs and the challenges to deliver of which the Deputy speaks, which we are very keen to overcome.  I am a relatively recent arrival to the Department.  I am sure colleagues are sick to death of me at this stage talking about the need to do everything we can to remove any barriers that we can to the delivery of new build properties.  However, with that best will in the world - and people are working very hard to do that with the local authorities and other delivery partners - that takes time and is taking time-----</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  These are rapid-fire buzzer questions, which will require a yes or no answer.  Has the Department agreed one rule on whether local authorities consider somebody housed or not housed, once he or she is on either RAS or HAP?  In other words, if I am on HAP or RAS, am I off the housing list, or am I out of consideration for the allocation of a house by the Government?</p></speech>

Those schemes meet the housing need that they are deemed to do so.  However, if somebody is in HAP, he or she can still be on the transfer list to move into another form of social housing.</p></speech>

They come off the main social housing waiting list, because their housing need is considered met.  However, they are on a transfer list.   The local authority will follow an allocation scheme to take people off both the main waiting list and the transfer list.  We have seen more than 9,000 tenancies move from HAP to other forms of social housing, since HAP started back in 2014.  The moves are definitely happening.  The RAS tenancies are moving as well.  Approximately 53% of household exits last year were to other forms of social housing.  The vast majority of the other forms of social housing are to local authority-owned and approved housing body-owned units, that are either built or bought.  There might be a tiny percentage of movement between RAS and HAP, but that is not a normal move.  Generally, they are moving into a unit that is owned by the local authority or the approved housing body.  It is down to the local authority and its allocation scheme in terms of taking people from different waiting lists.</p></speech>

Can a note on this be sent to us?  My concern - and it can be addressed in the note &ndash; is that there is no consistency to this.</p> <p>People are seen as housed and there is no way they are getting consideration if they are on HAP or RAS and this is a problem.  We need consistency.  I would prefer if people remained under consideration for houses.</p></speech>

Over 25 years, this works out on a real-term basis as somewhere between &euro;375,000 and &euro;450,000 per year.  This is money the State has paid, but at the end of it has no asset in return.  There was a furore over the fact that an affordable home was classified as &euro;450,000 when most reasonable people would accept that was not affordable.  How does the Department justify this level of funding for housing provision over a period of 25 years when at the end of the day, we still end up with somebody with a housing need and an outlay on the State, but has nothing to show for it in terms of a real asset? </p></speech>

Leasing is one of the range of options available to local authorities to supplement that delivery.  It is a part of the overall programme.  It has not been possible for the State to provide capital funding to build the significant number of homes involved in each year.  Leasing is one of the tools that allowed delivery to happen.</p></speech>

In any event, on the Deputy's general point, I said this morning we would certainly like to be in a position to provide as many new-build homes as possible, funded by capital means.  That has not been possible over recent years.  In order to meet the need to provide roofs over people's heads, the leasing schemes and the current schemes the Deputy referred to helped to augment delivery over that space of time.</p></speech>

This is the point I am trying to get at.  Does Mr. Doyle accept that over the period of all these schemes, if we had spent an additional &euro;1 billion on capital works we would be better off in the long term compared to what we are currently doing?  At the moment, we are spending ever-increasing amounts.  This &euro;1 billion I am talking about is only going to increase under the current trajectory.  We will be spending additional hundreds of millions of euro per annum, essentially in dead money, and at the end of the day will end up, in many cases, probably exacerbating both the house price crisis we are in and the house supply crisis.</p></speech>

The public would not have been better off because there were many people we would not have been able to house over that period of time.</p></speech>

I am not sure the response can be characterised as that.  We know we need to deliver more capital new-build homes.  We absolutely accept that.  That is an absolute focus.

Protections are under those Acts as opposed to specifically for HAP tenants.  However, because the shared services centre provides a listing of the landlords to Revenue, there is enforcement based on the data in the list the shared services centre provides to the RTB quarterly.  The enforcement is on its side rather than on the local authority side because the local authority has an agreement with the tenant as opposed to the landlord.  The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord as it would normally be in any private tenancy arrangement.</p></speech>

That sets out to identify situations where people have not registered their tenancies with the RTB, whether it is a HAP tenancy or a private rental tenancy.  That service includes the potential to issue a fine of up to &euro;4,000 or six months in prison.  The RTB obtains information from members of the public.  It has its own research as well.  It also has an investigations and sanctions unit, which has a staff in excess of 15 people.  It proactively tries to identify situations like this as well as situations where there might be a breach of the rent pressure zones and other such breaches.

I received a report from the RTB in the past two weeks which sets out the number of cases in which it has taken prosecutions.  In 2017, it prosecuted a total of 29 landlords in the entire country.  Last year, that number has fallen to ten landlords for the entire country.  As such, I am not clear about the RTB in terms of implementation.</p>  <p>  I submitted to the RTB an audit of an area in my constituency in which 242 houses in a very small area were audited.  Of those 242 houses, 142 were not registered with the RTB.  Where is the RTB's answerability to the Department?  It gets funding but it appears it is falling down with regard to registrations.  I have submitted to the RTB a full list of 142 unregistered addresses.  What reports does the Department receive from the RTB?  Is the Department satisfied that there is full implementation of the requirement for landlords to register with the RTB?  Is there a difficulty with the process for registration given the number of tenancies not registered in one small area?</p></speech>

To put it in context, the number of private tenancies registered in quarter 3 of 2020 was 25,607 and in quarter 4 of 2020, it was 19,287.  The overall number of tenancies has been in the order of 300,000 for quite some time, so the overall numbers have not moved that much.  I accept there will always be landlords who do not register but we are satisfied that 15 staff on investigations and sanctions is a significant number of people who can actually follow up on these things.  Not everything results in a conviction.  It may lead to a situation where people just register and that is the end of it.</p>  <p>  I would add though that the investigations and sanctions unit has assessed information in relation to 1,531 tenancies.  Out of that, it has commenced investigations on 337 tenancies and 241 of those are still in investigation.  Getting to the court process at the end of that takes time; there is no doubt about it.  Covid has not helped with that.  I am satisfied that the unit, with 15 full-time staff and legislative powers, is in the right position to do what needs to be done.</p>  <p>  The Department and the RTB also rely on members of the public to make them aware of things.  If, as in the Deputy's case, there are 142 tenancies not registered, that is the kind of information the RTB needs to hear from members of the public.  In reality, we rely on that information, as well as other sources, for example, scanning lettings pages to make sure that if a property is being put up for let, it subsequently features on an RTB registration.  That is the effort that is being put in.</p></speech>

People have to go through the whole process all over again.  Likewise, when I wrote to the RTB it replied that it would not come back to me about any of the cases but would follow up.  I have no evidence to show how many of those houses or residential units will be registered in three months' time unless I physically audit each one of them again.</p></speech>

I go back to my previous point.  We have, on record from the RTB, 1,531 pieces of information assessed for investigation and that would suggest quite a significant number in the overall context.  We have about 6,000 disputes in a year, so that is in a similar order of magnitude.</p></speech>

The following year, there were only 1,100 notifications issued to landlords.  There was a substantial drop in the level of notification to landlords for non-registration.  In an area of my constituency, 60% of the properties that are let are not registered.  That raises serious questions.  I ask that the Department take up this matter, in particular in areas where there are third level institutions, which appear to be a major problem as regards registration.</p></speech>

The registration enforcement activity I have to hand is specifically to do with registrations.  In addition to the 1,500 or so investigations, 4,651 first notices were given regarding registration in 2018.  That number rose to 6,013 in 2019.  It went down to 1,282 in 2020 and that is clearly Covid-related.  These are significant numbers and the RTB follows up with a second notice letter, a first solicitor letter and, indeed, a second solicitor letter.  That goes on to additional enforcement.  There was in the order of 550 additional enforcements beyond the two letters and two notices.  I think that points to a significant engagement by the RTB in the issue of registration of tenancies.</p></speech>

I will confirm that in my notes.  If there was one at &euro;33 million, I suspect it would be Dublin City Council because it is by far the biggest.  I will review the enforcement and what is going on to collect rent.  During the Covid restrictions there has been an easing of enforcement activity simply to keep tenants in their homes.  I will investigate that further and revert to the committee on the &euro;33 million and the overall number.</p></speech>

I refer to the timeframe from when a local authority identifies a site and makes a submission to the Department for housing.  For instance, I am aware of a situation where a local authority secured approval for approximately five housing projects to proceed.  When it received tenders for the building of the houses, the tenders were far higher than anticipated, but then there was a further gap of up to six months before the Department finally gave clearance.  Have the rules changed on this?  There was a six-month delay from getting in the tender submissions, which were at a higher rate, for the Department to make a decision on it.  What is the average time from when a local authority identifies a site and gets it to starting the housing project to getting it completed?</p></speech>

There is a 59-week process with timeframes set out for the interactions between the Department and local authorities.  We certainly do not envisage those types of timeframes.  We are improving the system.  A housing delivery co-ordination office has been set up in the Local Government Management Agency, which works closely with local authorities to streamline the process.  The Minister recently changed the threshold for single-stage approvals from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million and that is something of which we are starting to see more. Six months is a long time.  If the Deputy wishes to provide the details of that case, we can certainly look into it.</p></speech>

Mr. Doyle and I know each other from our previous lives, mine with the Irish Road Haulage Association and his in the then Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I fundamentally disagree with his statement that HAP is providing homes.  It does not provide homes.  Only building houses does that.  HAP gives the applicant the means to afford rent.</p>  <p>  This brings me to my point, of which we notified the witnesses yesterday.  It relates to a circular issued by the Minister.  Is Mr. Doyle familiar with it?</p></speech>

Recently, representatives from An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeared before this committee.  Its chairman, Mr. Dave Walsh, informed us that its 2020 legal fees reached &euro;8.5 million.  I would have assumed on the basis that fewer houses were built and fewer applications were received that this figure would have been less than that for 2019, but it was actually 60% more.  The board is losing 70% of the cases that are judicially reviewed.  The courts are having to interpret ministerial guidelines because it seems that our planning policy lacks clarity.  Most court decisions are being made on the basis of a misinterpretation of the ministerial guidelines by one or other department.  What has Mr. Doyle, as the relevant Secretary General, done to try to bring these issues together?  They are culminating in choking the supply of housing.  We will never get rid of or lessen our HAP dependency or lower rents if we do not increase supply.  What measures has the Department taken?</p></speech>

As my time is limited, I will focus initially on the pyrite remediation scheme.  I come from a constituency, Mayo, that has seen mounting pressure arising from increased numbers of homes with pyrite-related damage.  In the past number of weeks, the impact on housing estates in north Mayo has become evident and the issue is starting to snowball as more residents become aware of issues.  Those numbers may reach the hundreds in the months ahead.  There are similar issues affecting households in Donegal and many residents feel the remediation scheme for defective building materials that came into effect last June falls short significantly in its intended purpose.</p>  <p>  The overwhelming majority of properties require demolition and rebuilding.  Many owners are angered by a 90% grant limit for costs, which is capped at &euro;275,000.  This approach does not take into account other expenses, such as storing furniture, materials and the cost of living elsewhere in the interim, including paying rent.  These people are looking for parity with the current pyrite remediation scheme in place for the east of the country.  Rental property availability is also a factor in areas with homes affected by pyrite.  Does the Secretary General accept the validity of these concerns?</p></speech>

We can see the level of damage and some images were shown at the time indicating how it is very significant.  I can absolutely understand the concerns of people who have been affected by this.</p>  <p>  The scheme amounts to the State stepping up to attempt to put those owners, in a substantial way, back into the position they would have been in if these defects had not occurred in the materials.  It is a significant scheme, with significant resources being applied to it.  I know there is dissatisfaction in some cases, as the Deputy has described, in that it is a 90% scheme.  There are some reasons for applying that 10% requirement.</p>  <p>  The scheme for homes affected by mica is new and there already significant numbers of applications for that.  We are endeavouring to deal with those.  There has not been-----</p></speech>

There is certainly a major anomaly with the defective concrete blocks scheme in this instance.  Chapter 13 in the Comptroller and Auditor General report on the accounts indicates projections for the Department that the scheme will amount to approximately &euro;210 million, remediating 3,140 dwellings.  I need to bring these concerns to the witness.</p>  <p>  How many homes in County Mayo have been approved under the first stage of the scheme?  How many have second stage approval for the implementation plan?</p></speech>

I have seen numbers for those which are under the stage 1 and stage 2 processes and I will send them to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I apologise if we sometimes cut across each other but we are trying to use technology and we are also caught with time limits arising from Covid-19 precautions.</p>  <p>  I will speak to the timeline.  I have made it my business to speak with officials, and particularly practitioners such as engineers etc. on the ground, over recent years in particular on the timeline for new builds.  To be honest, I get a feeling of fierce frustration from them arising from delays and the level of micromanagement of projects by the Department.  Stuff is sent back and forth to the Custom House.  There is all the appearance of a system of micromanagement.  If we want local authorities to act maturely and do the business for us, we must relax the restrictions and red tape.  This is not an argument for any kind of wild west behaviour but will the Department look at this?</p> <p>I raised the issue with the previous Minister, and former Deputy, Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister before him in the context of giving local authorities some breathing space.  I ask Mr. Doyle, as the Secretary General of the Department, to look at the matter again with a view to giving local authorities some breathing space and putting more trust in them.</p></speech>

As the Chair stated, there is a need to answer to this committee in terms of how public funding is being used.  We will absolutely remove barriers, within reason, while balancing the need to deliver with the need for financial probity.  I can see a colleague smiling because it is a mantra that I have had since joining the Department.</p></speech>

We are not going to get houses built that way.  Local authorities need to be trusted.  There are competent people in local authorities, including engineers and councillors to oversee projects.  There are competent management systems in general.  In terms of the reform of local government, which is a whole other area that I will not go into today, we need to give them breathing space.</p></speech>

Without wishing to use up time, perhaps she could provide a brief response on that.</p></speech>

That will be most helpful in achieving a shared understanding of the approach.  We are also working with the local authorities to build up their housing delivery teams, particularly in the context of ensuring that they have sufficient competence on the technical side.  A combination of measures, together with us continuing to look at the approval processes, will help address some of those issues.</p>  <p>  In answer to a question that was asked earlier, we are beginning to see some increasing use of the single-stage process as it has gone to the &euro;2 million ceiling and recently increased to the &euro;6 million ceiling.  Therefore, there are a combination of factors that will help address some of those very practical issues.</p></speech>

I cannot emphasise the point strongly enough.</p>  <p>  In respect of tax compliance and landlords, briefly, how does the Department ensure that landlords are tax compliant?  We know that the problem of unregistered landlords is fairly widespread.  I agree with the witnesses that the information does need to be fed to the RTB by all concerned.  How does the Department ensure that the landlords are tax compliant?  Is any work done on that?</p></speech>

That enables the Revenue to have access to some of the information in the RTB.  I can provide the committee with a note on the detail of that.</p></speech>

I wish to revert briefly to the issue of the long-term cost.  I was there in the days when rent supplements were first introduced, going back a good few years now.  It was a temporary measure to tide people over until they got more permanent accommodation.  Then we moved on to RAS and HAP.  The spend is now in the region of &euro;1 billion per year.  That &euro;1 billion provides between 5,000 and 6,000 one-, two- and three-bedroom homes, depending on what part of the country one is in.  That is roughly what we are talking about.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Department cannot magic up houses immediately at the click of a finger.  However, in respect of the long-term cost, a witness from TASC appeared before the committee a few weeks ago.  He quoted research by Mr. Mel Reynolds which stated that it costs &euro;450 per month more for HAP than direct bills in many parts of the country.  The point that we need to move on it cannot be emphasised enough.  It has been raised by a number of Deputies today.  The Department has to find the money and capital for it.  In that context, has much work been done in respect of looking at sources of finance?  There are 0% interest rates at the moment.  In fact, there are negative interest rates on deposits currently.  There are many investment funds out there.  The credit unions have in the region of &euro;10 billion in deposits.  Representatives of the credit unions have stated at various times that they would like to invest it better.  Irish pension funds are always sourcing ways of investing money to get a good return for pensioners.  The European Investment Bank is also lending at low interest rates.  Pension funds and credit unions in particular have substantial reserves.  Has the Department looked at tapping into that money and investing it with a view to getting a return in the areas of cost rental homes, but also in the context of social homes and affordable purchase homes, which to provide a good return if it is done properly?  Have those pots of money been looked at?</p></speech>

As was the case with my previous Department, we go in as a Department and argue our capital envelopes.  The question of where the capital comes from is more for the other Departments that I mentioned.  While we do feed into those debates and ask questions, it is a matter for those Departments.  However, we will continue to argue as strongly as we can - and we are doing so at the moment in the context of the NDP review - for as much capital funding as we can get, that the system can actually support and on which it can deliver houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021060300013#M01200"><p>I am saying I have heard that before.  I am not being dismissive, but real work needs to be done in that area.  There are options that need to be tapped into.</p>  <p>  In the area of the income thresholds for social housing, in counties Laois and Offaly, the threshold is &euro;480 for a single applicant.  For a couple, the threshold is &euro;503.  I can rattle off the numbers up the scale.  If an applicant has one child, the threshold increases by &euro;15 and so on.  I am aware that the Department is reviewing it.  One could paper the walls with the replies to parliamentary questions on this issue from various Deputies.  The point I wish to make is that there is a whole cohort of people who are just above the income threshold for social housing.  There is no option of cost rental or affordable purchase homes for them.  It does not exist outside the Pale.  There is certainly no option of a mortgage.  These people have reams of refusals from banks and building societies.  They are going to wind up as pensioners in private rented housing.  There will have to be a turbocharged HAP for them.  We are looking at HAP for pensioners.</p>  <p>  There is also a financial cost in the context of HAP.  The rents that we are seeing are not the real rents.  Every Deputy, county councillor and Minister in the country will state that their constituents are paying much more than what the rent is supposed to be.  Of the tenants that I deal in counties Laois and Offaly, certainly 95% of them are paying top-ups.  The point I wish to make is that there is a huge cohort of people who are trapped until kingdom come, in poor private rental accommodation, without security of tenure and rent control.  They are left at the mercy of the landlords, some of whom are okay, and some of whom are a long way from being okay.  Approximately 140 years ago, the Land League campaigned on the issues of fair rent, fixity of tenure and the right to buy.  Now we are in the 21st century trying to get back to that again.  I ask the Department to move on the issue of upping the income thresholds for social housing.  When can we expect to see that being delivered?  I ask for a short answer to that question.</p></speech>

The local authorities have delegated sanction for anything less than that.  The local authorities obviously have to do an assessment of the social housing need in their area before they send in the proposal to us, as well as the pipeline they have in terms of build and they also have to look at the availability of land.  Basically, they look at the need and sustainable communities in terms of the percentage of social housing in the area, they agree the market rents - there is a whole process around that - and a proposal comes into the Department.  If it is the enhanced lease, it goes through the Housing Agency as it is the national co-ordinator for that scheme.  We then look at it in terms of the overall balance.  Obviously, the cost of the scheme is very important.  The speed with which the project can be delivered is also important.  The sustainability of communities is considered as well.  An assessment is done internally in which we take account of all those criteria.  The first assessment is done by the local authority, however.  I suppose it depends on the area in which the project is being developed.  A lot of the development we are seeing now is in the Dublin area and involves apartments.  It comes back to the local authority's need in the area and the types of units it requires.</p></speech>

It relates to the Department's spending on Traveller accommodation.  Department officials were before us in February 2019 when I think we were reviewing the 2017 accounts.  At that meeting, queries and concerns were raised about the underspend on Traveller accommodation.  The same recommendation was made, almost word for word, when Department officials appeared before the committee again last year and the response seems to be the same again this year.  In any event, it appeared as though they were hiding behind an expert review dating back to September 2018.  Is that still the case?  What has happened since?</p></speech>

I know in the case of Covid there were significant efforts to spend in relation to trying to safeguard people from that community in terms of capital spend.  I think over the last year there has certainly been more spent.  However, this has been a feature over the last number of years and we need to focus more on making sure that capital money is taken up and spent in the local authorities.</p></speech>

Today the committee will engage with Dr. Stephen Kinsella and representatives of Social Justice Ireland on budget priorities.  Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh Dr. Stephen Kinsella, associate professor of economics from the University of Limerick and Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy, chief executive; Ms Michelle Murphy, research and policy analyst; Ms Colette Bennett, economic and social analyst; and Ms Susanne Rogers, research and policy analyst, from Social Justice Ireland.</p> <p>  Before beginning I explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references to other persons in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if a witness is giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, he or she may not, as such, benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present would do.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p><p>Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  Ach anois ba mhaith liom t&uacute;s foirmi&uacute;il a chur leis an gcruinni&uacute;.  I invite Dr. Kinsella to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I would like to discuss some competing priorities for budget 2022 and budget 2023.  For a moment there I sounded like the former Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan.<br/><br/>I have been asked to speak about a post-Covid world but I am afraid I do not believe one will exist for two reasons.  The first reason is biological: the evidence so far suggests Covid will become endemic.  It will simply become a part of the life that we all expect to live with.  It seems unlikely therefore we will ever be post Covid in any strict sense.  The other reason is socioeconomic: I do not believe the pandemic has changed anything.  It has accelerated previous trends around digitalisation, decarbonisation, and decentralisation.  We will have to use fiscal policy to construct bridges between the gaps between the past and the future that Covid has created, in particular in areas such as retail where there are large numbers of jobs.  The pandemic has also accelerated the level of anger felt by the public around the key issue of housing.  In Ireland in particular we have become very used to the phrase, anger is not a policy, but post Covid I think anger actually is a policy because it is a policy variable.  By altering expectations around policy formation and action, anger is now an economic variable.  Therefore, it will alter our physical reality as the pandemic recedes.<br/><br/>One measure of this is the recent Red C poll results, looking at which party, if any, the respondent believes is best equipped to deal with a particular issue over the next five years.  Most parties were in the middle.  To illustrate a simple fact, on the issues of the Covid pandemic such as job creation, education, crime, the economy and health, the Fine Gael Party seems to be doing quite well relative to Sinn F&eacute;in and it is on housing and the rental market that this is markedly not the case.  The ESRI's report on housing, which was produced today, is a reasonable summation of where we are with respect to housing policy and the need to use fiscal policy to address housing policy, which will be a key feature post Covid.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of the committee to a book by Eric Lonergan and Mark Blyth called <i>Angrynomics</i>.  It is about how anger is used as a policy variable and how it is weaponised by those who would try to attain power using it.  It is a very good dissection of the current policy tool that remains as a variable.<br/><br/>Turning to the outlook for 2021 and 2022, I reproduce forecasts and the figures are outlined in the submission for all major bodies for the Irish economy.  They show an expected growth rate of between 4% and 4.5% this year and 4.8% and 5.2% in next year.  I believe all of these forecasts are on the downside and it is likely that we will see higher levels of growth than this for two reasons.  The first is that they do not include the economic recovery plan spending, which was announced this week.  Second, as any economist who has studied the Irish economy carefully will be able to tell the committee, when the economy is allowed to rebound it rebounds much faster than most people can tell, including the people whose job it is to monitor it.<br/><br/>From these forecasts it is clear that domestic demand will expand, so people buying and selling things to one another within the domestic economy will expand following a release of savings across the economy.  We have a very high savings rate in the economy and there are tens of billions of euro waiting to be spent.  An operational question is where that will be spent, but that is perhaps for another day.  It is clear that not all areas of the economy will benefit from this expansion of domestic demand.  Uniquely in my experience as a professional economist, these forecasts all predict a strong expansion of economic activity to beyond pre-Covid levels without a correspondingly sharp reduction in either general unemployment or youth unemployment.  In the past, in every single economic expansion that I have studied, every single increase in GDP and domestic demand has been associated with a sharp fall in unemployment and youth unemployment.  The current forecasts by the Department of Finance, the IMF, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and the ESRI do not show a correspondingly sharp reduction in either youth unemployment or general unemployment.  The way to look at that is to focus on the actual numbers.  The Department of Finance's stability programme update, SPU, assumes a reduction in overall unemployment from 16.3% this year to 8.2% in 2022, and 6.7% in 2023.  The IFAC assumes a reduction from 15.8% this year to 7.4% in 2023.  While we assume a return to growth rates that are above the pre-Covid level, we are not assuming a corresponding fall in unemployment to its pre-Covid level.  That suggests a pre-planned amount of structural damage in the system that fiscal policy post Covid will need to address.<br/><br/>To be fair, while the economic recovery programme, outlined on pages 14-15, has a focus on youth unemployment in an expansion of key programmes, the key assumption across the policy documents I have studied in preparation for this appearance before the committee is that young people, who have endured not only Covid but an unequal experience of the post-austerity period from 2013 to 2020, particularly with respect to building up equity in assets like pensions and housing, will experience above average unemployment rates even as the economy around them expands, prices rise, and those already owning assets like housing continue to do well.  This is an unsustainable process and, much like the expansion of private credit in the boom period, unsustainable processes always stop.<br/><br/>The chart on page 4 shows just how deeply sectoral the nature of this shock has been.  Essentially, in finance and insurance, information and communication, manufacturing and public administration, the wages, if one likes, have found themselves rising, whereas, all other areas from construction to transport, hotels, real estate and in particular the arts have been hammered.  This will not be a surprise to any of the members of this committee.  However, it is important to understand that in addition to looking very carefully at youth unemployment and youth activity - they very much overlap - we should also look at areas in which these sectors can be maintained, and repair as much as possible of the damage to the balance sheets of these firms.</p><p>A good example of this is that the employment wage subsidy scheme payments were just 5% of total earnings in all sectors of the Irish economy in the first quarter of 2021 but they represented almost 50% of total earnings in the accommodation sector.  This is an extraordinary statistic.  Half of the people in a particular sector were sustained by a single payment.  This is a very good example of the deeply sectoral nature of the damage Covid has done.  It also gives a strong rationale for fiscal policy to ameliorate the damage in this area.</p><p> It will come as absolutely no surprise to any Deputy that retail, tourism and accommodation are the areas to focus on in the budget for 2022.  While some of the sectoral damage caused by Covid will be repaired by a simple reopening of the economy and, as I said at the very beginning, we will see a very large increase in the economic activity as the economy reopens, some firms quite simply will not be repaired.  There is a deep correlation between these sectors and youth unemployment, particularly as 46% of those on the pandemic unemployment payment are under the age of 34.  Where businesses in these sectors or subsectors fail, the State will need to be there to help.</p><p> I want to discuss budget deficit figures.  The Government is targeting a budget reduction to within its legally mandated fiscal bounds by 2024 or 2025.  It puts the economy on a glide path in budget 2022 towards a resumption of normality, albeit with a much higher stock of debt thereafter.  What is important is to recognise that fiscal consolidation is inevitable once the economy opens up.  Fiscal consolidation is not necessarily austerity but if it is poorly designed this is how it will feel, particularly to those whose supports are being withdrawn.  Closing the budget deficit will become important not in budget 2022 but in budget 2023 and beyond.  With respect to the binding fiscal rules, the European Commission recently stated the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact will continue to be applied in 2022 and is expected to be deactivated as of 2023.  There is a very important point to be made on when fiscal rules will begin to bind again, and the degree to which it will be difficult to explain to the public why the extraordinary largesse of the State cannot be extended by another year to them, given the amount of demand in the system.</p><p> Three options exist for closing the estimated gap shown in the figures.  One is to allow growth and reopening to do most of the work while investing in structurally transformative elements, such as digitalisation and decarbonisation.  Another is to raise taxes, particularly on employers and the wealthy.  The third is to reduce public spending.  The need to position the State's finances for some kind of balance does not chime at all with rising demands for ever larger capital spending, particularly on housing.  Therefore, it is probable that public anger will continue to rise.  I thank the committee for its time and attention.</p></speech>

How we plan our finances, and what we choose to prioritise post-Covid will have profound implications for the future of our economy and society.  Covid-19 has exposed and exacerbated weaknesses that already existed in Irish society.  These include a totally inadequate supply of social housing, a two-tier healthcare system, climate change, growing inequality, homelessness and environmental goals not being met to name but a few.  However this past year has shown us that change is possible.</p> <p>  During the last economic crisis, Ireland's austerity approach led to insufficient investment in social services, such as childcare and education, and in infrastructure such as social housing, public transport and rural broadband.  Investment is essential for a number of reasons.  These include securing economic development, protecting communities with initiatives such as community healthcare networks, keeping unemployment as low as possible with initiatives such as a substantial State-led childcare programme, ensuring critical infrastructure deficits are addressed, and tackling climate change at the level required and ensure that the transition to a low-carbon economy is just and fair.</p> <p>  Ireland needs a new and fairer social contract.  To promote human well-being and address current challenges, Social Justice Ireland proposes that such a new social contract should be based on a guiding vision and policy framework focused on producing five key outcomes.  These are a vibrant economy, decent services and infrastructure, just taxation, good governance and sustainability.  However, it is essential that these five outcomes be pursued simultaneously and not in sequence.  Previously the focus was on the first of the five outcomes with the idea that if the economy is right everything else will follow.  This simply does not happen.  We need to deal with all five simultaneously.  They are interdependent.  Ireland needs good services and infrastructure to deliver a vibrant economy.  Just taxation and good governance are required to deliver any or all of these outcomes.  Sustainability is required in the economy, on the environment, and in society itself for these outcomes to be achieved.  All the choices for budget 2022 and beyond set out in our presentation today, in the briefing documentation we have supplied to committee members and in the supplementary analysis are all focused on delivering these five outcomes simultaneously and in as short a timeframe as possible.</p> <p>  As the Government deliberates on budget 2022, it must recognise and acknowledge four major imperatives.  Its primary focus should be on increasing employment and delivering infrastructure and services and not on reducing the deficit.  A high level of borrowing will be needed in the next few years if Ireland is to increase employment and deliver the infrastructure and services required.  This borrowing must be affordable, and it is the correct thing to do for the future of the economy and society.  Action is required to increase the overall tax take and to adopt policies to broaden the tax base.</p> <p>  In framing the budget, Social Justice Ireland proposes that for 2022 and 2023, or until Ireland reaches full employment if earlier than 2023 which we do not believe will happen, the fiscal stance adopted by Ireland should be determined by an unemployment target rather than a deficit target, in recognition of the role domestic demand plays in sustaining domestic employment.  The State should begin to plan now for the additional tax measures necessary over the long-term to finance the government expenditure required to finance universal services and income supports for all our citizens.</p> <p>  The first budget priority on which we want to focus is poverty reduction and social welfare.  Without the social welfare system, 41.4% of the Irish population would have been living in poverty in 2019.  This is the most recent year for which we have figures.  Such an underlying poverty rate suggests a deeply unequal distribution of market income.  In 2019, social welfare payments reduced the poverty rate by more than 28 percentage points to 12.8%.  Since then, however, we have had two budgets where core social welfare rates were not increased.  This is profoundly retrogressive and will lead to Ireland losing the gains it has made in tackling poverty in recent years.</p><p>Core social welfare rates should be benchmarked.  More than a decade ago, budget 2007 benchmarked the minimum social welfare rate at 30% of gross average industrial earnings and today that figure is equivalent to 27.5% of the new average earnings data being collected by the Central Statistics Office.  In 2021 this would equate to &euro;222.08, implying a shortfall of &euro;19 between current minimum social welfare rates at &euro;203 and this threshold.<br/><br/>Given the importance of this benchmark to the living standards of many in Irish society and its relevance to anti-poverty strategy and approaches, it is critical that the current gap be addressed and that core social welfare rates should be increased by &euro;19 per week over the next two years, starting with an increase of &euro;10 per week in budget 2022.<br/><br/>The second budget priority we identify is housing.  The pandemic highlighted both the spectacular failure of successive Governments to address the challenge of housing, particularly for the most vulnerable, and the need to think beyond privatisation to more sustainable housing.  In our recently published ten-point plan to deliver housing for all, we called on the Government to implement a series of measures that would address the scale of the current challenge with the scale of response required.<br/><br/>Initiatives that should be contained in budget 2022 include expansion of Housing First to families, providing wrap-around services and supports for children and parents; acquisition of an equity stake in properties in mortgage distress, leaving families <i>in situ</i>while increasing the State&rsquo;s housing stock; and, most important, the building of 14,341 social homes each year for the next ten years at an annual investment of &euro;3.3 billion.  It was interesting to read this morning's ESRI report, which more or less makes the same recommendation.  We find that interesting because we have been making this exact recommendation for quite some time.  We are glad to see the ESRI coming along with us at this stage.<br/><br/>We also need to prohibit the sale of State lands suitable for residential development and use this land to build social housing.  We must address housing affordability on the supply-side rather than investing in demand-side schemes that artificially maintain high house prices.  Finally in this area, one of our priorities is to close all tax loopholes for large-scale investment vehicles purchasing residential properties.<br/><br/>Our third priority is unemployment and particularly youth unemployment.  Much of this was highlighted by Dr. Kinsella already.  In our recent employment monitor we highlighted that 21% of people whose employment was affected by Covid-19 do not expect to return to the same job after the pandemic.  In the absence of other employment opportunities, this suggests the potential for a transfer of these individuals from these schemes to jobseeker's payments.  It is likely that will happen, so a large increase in unemployment numbers seems inevitable, with rates of between 12% and 16% of the labour force possible.  Furthermore, the pandemic is also likely to reveal a large youth unemployment problem.<br/><br/>Budget 2022 needs to allocate resources to address these challenges and minimise the scale of the increase in unemployment and the growth of long-term unemployment.  Specifically, we believe the budget should resource the upskilling of those who are unemployed and at risk of becoming unemployed through integrating training and labour market programmes and adopt policies to address the worrying issue of youth unemployment.  In particular, these should include education and literacy initiatives, as well as retraining schemes.  The budget should expand the age profile for apprenticeships and training programmes to include older workers who may need to reskill.  It should also recognise the challenges of long-term unemployment and of precarious employment and adopt targeted policies to address these.  We must also resource policies to address the obstacles that face women as they return to the labour market.<br/><br/>Our fourth priority for the budget concerns taxation.  Budget 2022 offers an opportunity for the Government to reform some aspects of the current taxation system in the interests of enhancing fairness and sustainability.  Whereas 2022 is unlikely to be a year of major taxation initiatives, it is an opportunity to make some overdue changes that would also provide some additional revenue, particularly in the area of tax expenditures.<br/><br/>There are a number of approaches available to the Government in reforming the tax base.  The proposals we consider a priority are reforming tax expenditures, setting minimum effective tax rates for higher earners, reforming corporation tax and introducing a new minimum effective corporate tax rate, introducing a site value tax to replace the current property tax, the taxing of second homes, taxing empty houses and underdeveloped land and the taxing of windfall gains.<br/><br/>The committee should recommend that the tax expenditures should be prioritised and considered in this budget and that tax expenditures should be incorporated into the budget arithmetic so we get on budget not just what we always get, which is expenditure on infrastructure and services, etc., on one side but that we can also get the expenditure that is going on tax breaks, principally although not exclusively for the corporate sector.  There is also substantial scope for reducing tax expenditures and there are other recommendations in the document about those expenditures.<br/><br/>We support a universal basic income pilot.  Given our long-standing advocacy in this area of basic income, we welcomed the inclusion in the programme for Government of a commitment to examine basic income and run a pilot in Ireland during the lifetime of the current Government.  In May 2021, just a few weeks ago, we hosted a seminar and published a document outlining a proposal for such a pilot.  The proposal also outlined a timeline for the development, introduction and evaluation of the pilot.<br/><br/>There are limited cost implications associated with the pilot we have proposed and budget 2022 should commit to introducing this pilot and funding the evaluation process to accompany it.  Ultimately, there are important lesson to learn from this pilot that can inform longer-term developments in this area.  Any pilot must be scalable to the national level.  It would involve, for example, setting the rate at which basic income is paid at a level that allows it be scaled to the national level.  The recent seminar that I referred to presented a model and fully costed proposal that would allow a universal basic income in Ireland that would be revenue-neutral.  It is very important.<br/><br/>In concluding, we have a proposal for the committee.  Social Justice Ireland believes this committee plays a key role in the budget process but the need for budgetary oversight does not end when the budget is announced.  We believe the committee should play a greater role post-budget to provide oversight of how the allocations are spent and to review the adequacy and efficacy of budget allocations.  This would provide valuable information in advance of subsequent budgets and allow for greater clarity and focus.  Social Justice Ireland would, of course, be happy to contribute to that process after budget 2022.<br/><br/>Social Justice Ireland believes fundamental changes are required if Ireland is to address these challenges.  A new social contract is needed and it can be developed and delivered.  In responding to Covid-19, the Government made the changes required to protect both society and the economy.  Changes, some of which were dramatic, were delivered.  The common good featured prominently in planning and delivery.  The State, the only institution with the required capacity to address the pandemic, expanded to meet the challenge.  This was very welcome and is in stark contrast to the approach taken after the crash of 2008.  Mistakes were made in responding to Covid but lessons were learned; protecting jobs and services and a minimum standard of living were the priorities.  Now is the time to build on this progress.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I would like to take up a few points, first with Dr. Kinsella.  He stated that anger is going to become an economic variable.  I ask him to expand on that, and where he sees that being an issue.  I will link it to two other points.  What exactly does he mean by the statement that anger has become something that is being measured?  It is being measured almost as much on an economic level as an emotional level.  Dr. Kinsella made an interesting comment in his presentation.  He stated that he predicts "an expansion of economic activity to beyond pre-Covid levels of economic activity without a correspondingly sharp reduction in either general unemployment or youth unemployment".  Why does Dr. Kinsella think that?  Is it because wage subsidy scheme payments represented almost 50% of the total earnings for the accommodation sector?  I am assuming Dr. Kinsella is including the hospitality sector in that.  I ask him to respond to those two points, namely, on anger as an economic variable and general and youth employment not reducing in parallel with economic growth.</p></speech>

The Government does not necessarily need to respond linearly to the demands of people who are angry for some reason.  There are a few ways of answering the question.  I will start from a political-economic angle.  If the issue is housing, or what we might call the spatial realm, and the median voter wants to be a homeowner and they cannot be a homeowner, then by definition, as politicians react to what the median voter wants, they will be encouraged or almost forced by the need to cater for the median voter to expand housing provision.  That is one causal mechanism that could exist.<br/><br/>Another way of looking at it is through the concept of societal anger.  Here, I will use the terminology that Mark Blyth and Eric Lonergan use in their work, <i>Angrynomics</i>.  They distinguish between moral outrage and tribal energy.  Tribal energy is simply the idea of saying, for example: &quot;Those people are not like me.  I do not want them.  I like people like me.&quot;  Somebody who is hungry for power can exploit that tribal energy.  The moral outrage issue is simply one around fairness.  For example, issue X is simply not fair.  Where a sufficient percentage of the population believes that issue X is not fair or is not being fairly dealt with, that moral outrage, which is entirely justified, can be used via a popular uprising or activist movements to effect large-scale policy change.  That is what I mean, in concrete terms, by the idea that anger is a policy variable.  Just because some people are angry, it is not a particular reason to change policy.  One can see particular-----</p></speech>

As I said, it is about the median voter and the median household.  It is about the fact that we now have very large societal consensus around this issue.  One can see the diametric difference in an issue such the handling of the pandemic versus housing.  I have demonstrated one variable; I could show five more.  It is a policy variable because it alters expectations.  By altering expectations, it alters behaviour today.</p> <p>  On the question of how anger can be measured economically, it can be measured economically by looking at the degree to which the pronouncements of policy and the actual allocations of funding alter with respect to expressions of anger.</p> <p>  The second point the Deputy raised concerned forecasting beyond our pre-Covid activity and why, given an expansion of economic activity that will be vast, particularly in the third and fourth quarters of this year, we will not see a resumption of unemployment levels at their pre-Covid levels.  The answer is related to hysteresis.  Hysteresis is a fancy word for economic scarring.  For example, it occurs where certain sectors of the economy are scarred by the crisis that has come upon them.  The canonical explanation or understanding for this is demonstrated through the example of the introduction of the motor car.  When it was introduced, there were many people who worked with horses whose skills were no longer needed.  It is the same idea.  It is often used in the context of technological change.  Obviously, Covid-19 has spurned lots of technological change.  We are talking to each other on Microsoft Teams.  That is the perfect illustration of what I am talking about.  I did not get into my car and drive up to Dublin.  I did not book into a hotel the night before the meeting.  That is all demand that is no longer happening.  It is the perfect example of hysteresis.  If people do not go back into the offices, then people who sell sandwiches in sandwich bars do not have jobs.</p></speech>

Are we now in the middle of a new industrial revolution?</p> <p>Dr. Kinsella spoke about housing, anger and the median voter.  The ESRI report that will be published tomorrow mentions an extra spend of between &euro;4 billion and &euro;5 billion.  The document appears to deal exclusively with social housing provision.  It does not appear to deal with affordability, which, from my perspective, is as big an issue with the median voter.  If Dr. Kinsella is going with the policy being proposed by the ESRI, capacity constraints are not addressed.  Currently, with the supply of labour available, our capacity to build in Ireland is around 15,000 units per annum.  It is all very well to talk about spending money, but it must be demonstrated how it will be done.  The ESRI report itself mentions spending money, but does not state how the capacity constraints can be addressed and how the affordability aspect can be dealt with.  What we are finding on the ground, is that young couples cannot afford to purchase homes because they are not becoming available on the market for them.  It is not just a supply issue.  It is an internal supply issue within that supply in that there is a reduced supply to first-time buyers.  </p> <p>  Before I pose my questions to Dr. Healy, I ask Dr. Kinsella to clarify the following.  Are we in the middle of a new industrial revolution?  Although I welcome the ERSI report, I cannot see how it addresses the affordability issue.  It addresses the issue of spending money in a very macro way.  There is no point in throwing money at something unless there is the capacity to deliver it based on that funding.  I would like to have seen the ESRI report address those capacity constraints.  We need to build many more houses, both social and affordable.  While the report addresses social housing and the issue of spending money, it does not address the constraints on building that social housing and the affordability aspect.  I ask Dr. Kinsella to comment on that.</p></speech>

It creates a vast retraining problem.  The Deputy asked in particular about capacity constraints.  The labour supply capacity constraint is solved using retraining.  </p><p> As to whether we are in the middle of an industrial revolution, we absolutely are but it relates to energy generation.  By the time this decade is over, we will be in a situation where the majority of energy generated in this country will be renewable.  That is a sea change.  The last time that happened was in the 1940s, with the opening of Ardnacrusha.  It is genuinely amazing.  How those energy generation technologies alter the social, economic and urban fabric are all open questions that people smarter than me will be able to answer.  We are in the middle of an industrial revolution.</p><p> The ESRI report specifically examines how to borrow more to incentivise and invest under conditions of very low interest rates.  The point the ESRI is making is that should the Government decide to spend more on this issue, it can do so.  That is the important point.  However, the report, which I have only read once this morning and so cannot claim expertise on - one normally needs to read something three times before really understanding it------</p></speech>

The important point is that, as the Deputy correctly stated, it is blind to the funding allocation and capacity constraint issue.  It is probably not the place of an economist to say how this stuff should be delivered.  It would be more appropriate to put that issue into the hands of other experts.  Dr. Kieran McQuinn, the lead author of the report, is one of the best economists in the country and very well versed in how the macroeconomy of this country works.  If he says we can afford this kind of stuff, I am fairly sure that we can.  It is a political question and a question of delivery, as the Deputy stated, in terms of how one would use that &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion to deliver which types of homes and where and under what conditions.  Those are very important matters but they fall outside the scope of the study.</p></speech>

Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh as bhur gcur i l&aacute;thair.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-suimi&uacute;il &eacute;isteacht leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; agaibh.  Is d&oacute;cha go mbaineann an ch&eacute;ad cheist at&aacute; agam le Social Justice Ireland.  The first question I have is for Social Justice Ireland.  We have heard a lot of talk about the infrastructural deficit, especially in housing.  We have heard it from the IMF and now we have the ESRI clearly saying we need to double investment in capital spending in the context of housing.  It points out that billions of euro will be needed to fund the construction of housing and that this can be done without creating undue economic risks.  This is something I have been pointing out for a long time.  It is good to hear certain commentators and even some politicians agree it is time to focus on it.</p> <p>  We are also hearing that there is a need to focus on the deficit.  That seems to indicate that some people have not learned the lessons of the previous crisis.  Social Justice Ireland indicated that one of the priorities for budget 2022 should be to focus on creating employment and delivering infrastructure rather than simply focusing on reducing the deficit.  What risks does Dr. Healy see to the economy and society from pursuing a deficit reduction first approach?  Does he consider that to be a call for austerity via the back door?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021060300002#F00500"><p>The simple answer is "No".  We do not believe this is a covert call or whatever for a back door austerity situation.  We set out in our document to the committee detailed proposals relating to taxation.  What we look at in that context are three key issues: the need to increase the overall tax take, adopt policies to broaden the tax base and develop a fairer tax system.  We have been addressing these for some time.  In terms of increasing the overall tax take, we set out what we think the tax take levy should move towards.  We are not talking about massive increases but ones that are well within the capacity of the economy and society to bear.  In terms of broadening the tax base, we are proposing, for example, continuing to reform the area of tax expenditures and the further enhancement of procedures within the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to monitor on an ongoing basis the cost and benefits of all current and new tax expenditures.  We think there should be a sunset clause on every tax expenditure but-----</p></speech>

My apologies.  I think Dr. Healy may have misunderstood my question.  My question was more regarding the fact that he is clearly talking about an infrastuctural deficit we have had.  I am in complete agreement in that regard.  It left us on the back foot going into this crisis in terms of small classroom sizes, etc.  We are now seeing a significant focus from the IMF and the ESRI on our infrastructural deficit in the context of housing.  My concern relates to the commentators and politicians whose focus is not on this infrastructural deficit that we clearly have.  I believe that if we focus on capital spending, such as in the area of housing - the ESRI stated we need to double our capital spend on housing - that will have a knock-on effect on employment, etc., as well as dealing with the housing crisis.  Is Dr. Healy of the opinion that the narrative of those who are focusing simply on the deficit in the short term - I was going to say long term, which would have confused the whole thing even more - rather than focusing on these massive infrastructural deficits is in some way about bringing austerity in through the back door?  My apologies.  I think Dr. Healy thought I was suggesting he was in favour of a return to austerity, which is not what I was saying at all.</p></speech>

We have set various proposals regarding how one can broaden the tax base, increase the tax take and develop a fairer taxation system.  We would certainly argue against any austerity approach being taken.  In fact, we have specific proposals in respect of housing and what needs to be done in that regard.  We have recently put them forward in a ten-point plan.  I ask Ms Rogers to say a few words on that aspect to give the committee a better picture of our proposals in that space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.317" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susanne Rogers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021060300002#F00800"><p>I will not go through all ten points but, rather, just pick out those Dr. Healy highlighted in his presentation.  Expanding Housing First to families is vital.  Damage is done by virtue of being homeless.  Wraparound supports and services are needed to ensure those families are supported as they move from homelessness back into secure, stable and long-term accommodation.  That security of tenure piece seems to be missing.  That is really what any housing system, be it social or affordable housing, cost rental or private market, should be affording citizens.  That security of tenure piece is really missing, particularly in the private rental market.</p><p>Acquiring an equity stake in properties in mortgage distress is also an interesting piece.  Mortgage to rent has been in place since 2012, which I keep having to remind myself is almost ten years ago.  As of 31 March 2021, they had 1,179 applications completed across a span of almost ten years.  Thus, whilst mortgage to rent is working for some households in long-term mortgage distress, it is, again according to the Central Bank's latest data, not doing anything for the 30,000-odd households that have been in mortgage arrears for more than two years.</p><p> The number of households in mortgage arrears for ten years or more is 5,266.  The fact they are still in arrears shows there are no solutions available to them.  Anything that could have been done more than likely has been and they are at serious risk of losing their homes.  This is now 30,000 households that could be added to social housing lists, which is not what we need considering the lists are quite sizable.  According to the official housing lists, 61,000 households are on the assessment waiting for social housing.  To that can be added those on HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, because households in receipt of them are not secure and still have a social housing need to be met.  That is where we would be looking for those 14,500 social homes to be built each year.  Everybody has mentioned the ESRI report, which is fantastic.  The recovery plan announced yesterday mentioned 33,000 homes to be built across, private, social, affordable and all those other categories and again we welcome that.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I only have two minutes left so I must move quickly on but what she said was interesting.</p> <p>  Dr. Kinsella recently wrote: "It would be unwise to bet the house on corporation taxes bringing us into the black".  In the context of global tax reform, which the Government is assuming will reduce corporation tax receipts gradually by &euro;2 billion, IFAC noted the impact could be faster and greater and the IMF has recently raised concerns on that as well so I am interested in Dr. Kinsella's view.  Does Ireland need to begin preparing an alternative industrial strategy, one which creates an indigenous high value-added sector that can open up new revenue streams to offset potential losses in the FDI sector?  What are his views on the' new proposals from the US for a 15% global minimum tax, rather than the original 21% first mooted?</p></speech>

I have three main points.  I have been writing about the risks to Ireland's business model from changes to international corporation tax since 2011.  I am someone who believes there is both an upside risk and a downside risk to increased corporation tax revenues.  It could well be the case, for example, that changes in the international tax regime increase the State's corporate taxation revenue.  Thus there is an upside risk to us from corporation tax changes simply because the devil is never in the dynamic when it comes to tax; it is in the detail.  As such, that is a key issue.  If that happens, we will end up in a situation where a larger percentage of our overall tax take comes from one source, which is fundamentally unstable.  One of the great virtues of wealth taxes is they tend to be quite stable.  These are income taxes and they fluctuate with business cycles.  As it happens, the Irish structural situation is such that when things go badly for the domestic economy the international part of the economy, the multinational part, ends up saving the day.  This in part explains the post-austerity period and what explains the current state of the State's finances now.</p> <p>  On the second part of the question about whether there is a risk to the economy such that we need a new industrial strategy, I find myself in violent agreement with the Vice Chairman.  It is high time we consider the generation of a new industrial strategy that does not substitute for, but complements, the one that has existed since 1958.</p> <p>  To the third part of her question, there is a way to tie in the structural transformation supports around digitalisation, decarbonisation and particularly restructuring the workforce that are coming from the European Commission, with the need to transfer to this new industrial strategy.  I would very much like to see that happening.  For example, I am aware there is an artificial intelligence, AI, strategy coming.  We should have had an AI strategy five years ago when one was promised to us.  AI is not some fancy thing that young fellas on the docks with goatees get to use, it is a very important business-to-business technology and we as a country do not yet have a strategy for AI, and it is just one transformative technology.  Thus, I agree with the Vice Chairman 100%.</p></speech>

There are one or two points I wish to raise.  The pandemic hit different people in different ways and some people were more sheltered from it.  We have seen, for example, the way savings accumulated for some people while others fell behind because of it and suffered serious loss of income.  There was brief reference in Dr. Kinsella's presentation to those funds now being unleashed back into the economy.  Does he have a view of how that might be steered, where it will be spent or where it would best benefit us for it to be spent?</p> <p>  Second, the point was made that there is no expectation of a sharp drop-off in unemployment and youth unemployment in particular.  That is a real concern for a group of people who have been hit on the double over the years, and nearly on the treble.  I acknowledge the economic recovery plan was only published earlier in the week but what is Dr. Kinsella's view on the impact of that on youth employment in particular, where there are JobsPlus apprenticeships, placement schemes and so on?  What impact would he see those initiatives having on youth unemployment or is it something he sees as being a stubborn problem despite those efforts?  If that is the case where else would something need to be done?  I ask because there seems to be a wide range of initiatives from placement schemes to the likes of the JobsPlus scheme, apprenticeships, SOLAS programmes and so on.</p></speech>

His first question was where those savings will go.  It is probably important for members to get a sense of what the savings rate is.  It is the percentage of unspent income relative to the volume of that income.  For most years it is approximately 10%.  Since 1995 the average has been between 10% and 12% savings.  It is upwards of 24% this year so there is a wall of money and the question is where does that go.  I am very sorry to tell the Deputy that I do not know.  The reason I do not know is we have not created the channels by which that expenditure can be funnelled.</p><p>What I mean by that is that there is no Guaranteed Irish-like website one can go to to say "I understand you have all these savings, so here are 100 Irish companies you can spend money on" or "Here is a charity you can donate to" or anything like that.  There is no overarching infrastructure to shape those funds into the areas that we know need to get healed, if you like.  One of the very good things about this is-----</p></speech>

First, I would channel them directly into our city centres.  The idea is of the city centre as destination rather than simply as retail park.  Second, I would channel the savings into Guaranteed Irish business.  Third, I would channel them into the worst hit sectors.  I am thinking of two in particular, namely, the arts and tourism.  Such words are overused, but the arts sector in particular has been decimated.  "Decimated" means that only one in ten of a number of things is destroyed, so the word is actually an underestimate by a factor of nine.  Those are the areas.  Regardless of that, I think most people, when they are allowed to spend money, will spend their money.  We will be able to see in September and October where the damage the crisis has done has not been repaired.  I think we can take an empirical approach to that.</p> <p>  To the Deputy's second point about youth unemployment, we should understand what youth unemployment does.  A single year of unemployment between ages 16 and 24 reduces one's lifetime earnings, so it is not like one is out of work and then one gets back into work and it is grand for ever.  It literally reduces the path of one's income for the rest of one's life.  That results in lower living standards, poorer health and lower tax revenue for the State.  As social ills go, youth unemployment is one of the worst.  Dr. Healy was really strong on this, and I agree 100% that having as low a youth unemployment rate as possible is a very good measure of the well-being of a society.</p> <p>  To the third part of the Deputy's contribution, on the economic recovery plan, pages 14, 15 and 16, I think, of the plan have very reasonable measures relating to youth unemployment but, without being critical of them, they are all expansions of existing schemes, if I am not mistaken.  What this effectively means is that by expanding the existing schemes, which are welcome, one tackles the kinds of problems those agencies and schemes were set up to deal with.  The agencies and schemes might have been set up to deal with a problem in, say, 2014.  That is not 2021's problem.  There is probably a reasonable argument to tie together what Deputies Kieran O'Donnell and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell said.  There are vast infrastructural deficits in our country and an oversupply of labour in particular areas.  It feels like training is the function to map one to the other.  The question is what that training is and what it can be used for afterwards.  While there is a focus on youth unemployment because of its long-term damage, I do not want to let the moment pass before noting that another area of significant damage is older workers who are, say, 52 but who are effectively barred from the labour market because the skills they have in the job that does not exist any more do not map to any existing labour market conditions.  A policy suite that addressed both those ends would definitely be welcome because not only are we in the midst of a housing crisis that is taking up all the airwaves but we also have a massive pensions problem, which is the other big asset allocation issue of our time and which receives less than 1% of the coverage the housing issue receives.  It is at least as important and is a deeply gendered issue because it affects women far more than men.  It is one of the key issues.  Deputy Moynihan asked me where there is something that needs to be done.  The Pensions Commission is just about to start its work and we are talking about auto-enrolments.  If one adds up auto-enrolments, increases in employer PRSI, which are being flagged, local property tax changes, which are being flagged, and any kind of income tax increase, that will feel a lot like a return to the 2014-16 period unless we get large amounts of growth.</p> <p>  Those are my unfortunately unstructured comments in response to the Deputy Moynihan's perceptive questions.</p></speech>

Go raibh maith agat as an am, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  I agree with Dr. Kinsella on the loss of income and the social ill of youth unemployment, but would he also take into account the fact that so many younger people have been spending the college year at home, locked away in the bedroom?  Would he count that as part of the social ill?  Is that in the mix or is it just a matter of the loss of income?  Does Dr. Kinsella recognise the fact that students have lost out in that regard as well?</p></speech>

I have spent many an hour being beamed into hundreds of students' bedrooms so I know exactly what Deputy Moynihan is talking about.  However, while students have had a very hard time, that is a very separate issue, to my mind.  I think students are very resilient and will get over this unfortunate period.</p></speech>

I will not delay the committee too long because I have to go to another committee meeting.  It was interesting to listen to what both Dr. Kinsella and Dr. Healy had to say.  One of the things I have a concern about in where we are now is that we are pumping a lot of money into supports and then I hear Dr. Kinsella say the 2020 fiscal rules will come back into play again.  Will we have a cliff edge in that regard and, if so, where will we go from there if we are trying to build an economy?  It is being said that the economy could itself write off all our deficits but we could also have a rise in taxes and spending cuts.  These are all the options we have.  One of the concerns I have with all this is that right now we have pent up savings and a lot of money being put into supporting the economy, business and people who are out of work, which is all good and needs to be done.  However, are we fuelling an inflationary economy?</p> <p>  Coming to social justice and what is going on in housing, one of the concerns I have is that we are talking about building so many units every year and saying we will make sure that between the private sector, social housing and so on we will build more houses.  The truth of the matter is that at the moment the cost of building houses is rising substantially.  We are also looking at increasing densities.  I am afraid we will get back to creating ghetto-type developments and over-itensification and to providing housing in units and boxes for people and that we will not provide the amenities and social services required with all that.</p><p>I am concerned we will have a kneejerk reaction to situations in the private housing sector.  In my rural constituency in Galway, we cannot get houses to rent and we cannot build houses in our towns and villages because we do not have the infrastructure.  We have a housing crisis right across the country, not just in the cities or whatever.  How do we temper all of that to make sure we deliver 35,000 houses and how do we actually deliver them?  Has anybody come up with a plan for that?  The cost of building these houses is rising rapidly from an inflationary and regulatory point of view.  We are putting more and more into passive houses, insulation and so on.  That is all very well and good, but we are putting houses out of the reach of first-time buyers and out of reach of social delivery.  We will get less units because we are putting more cost into delivering them.  What is the reaction of Dr. Kinsella and Dr. Healy to those two comments?</p></speech>

Do Ms Rogers or Ms Bennett want to take on some of the issues the Deputy talked about?</p></speech>

The cost of building has not expanded all that much.  For example, an A-rated three-bedroom unit in Ballymun was delivered at a building cost of &euro;230,000.  The cost of provision of these houses is not on the construction side, although much more could be done on procurement.  It is more about the land.  That is why our ten-point plan for dealing with housing mentions not selling off State land capable of residential development use, because retaining the cost of land and making sure local authorities are enabled to develop it for residential units would actually reduce costs overall.</p> <p>  I feel very strongly about the issue of ghettoisation because it is something that is particularly levied at social housing developments or social and affordable housing.  We think and hear about these areas becoming ghettoes.  That does not need to be the case.  In fact, a significant amount of work on this, and the research that backs this book, was done in the 1990s and early 2000s by Professor Tony Fahey.  Ghettoisation has nothing to do with houses or people but has to do with the surrounding infrastructure.  That is not alone education, roads and shops but also community policing, mental health services and community healthcare networks.  Things that are taken for granted in more affluent areas as part of a housing development should be applied to social and affordable housing developments to build sustainable communities.  We have seen very good examples of it in Limerick.  We need to see more of them. </p> <p> On the push for passive housing, we have seen a push for greater retrofitting particularly in the economic plan but also in budget 2021.  That absolutely needs to happen.  We have more than 200,000 houses throughout the country, currently, in the lowest energy efficiency, F and G, bands.  They need to be retrofitted and that will come at a cost.  We have proposals on how that cost should be factored in, whether it is through loans or paying it off through utility bills.  Again, when we look at making grants available for retrofitting they tend to be quite regressive in that they benefit higher income households, which can afford up-front costs.  This is opposed to those who desperately need to have their housing retrofitted, need lower utility bills and who are still probably on solid fuel central heating systems, but who cannot afford that chunk of up-front fees to be able to apply for a grant to repay it.  That is absolutely needed.</p> <p>  Building newer homes passively will save in the long term on having to retrofit those homes.  It is a saving over time.  I understand costs are higher but, as I said, developments in Ballymun, for example, were able to build at an A-rate and still provide three-bedroom housing for &euro;230,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021060300002#J00500"><p>To come back on that, I know the houses in Ballymun have been delivered.  I am talking about the here and now and going forward.  There is inflation in construction.  A quotation for the price of materials will only last seven days.  The cost of materials is going up exponentially right now for three reasons: a lack of supply of native timber; Brexit; and supply chain issues due to the Covid pandemic.  For instance, insulation materials cannot be manufactured because the resin used in bonding the insulation has not been produced and there is now a world shortage.  The price of steel is going up because China has booked the world's supply and pre-ordered it and so on.  The house that will be built during the rest of this year, and next year, will cost much more than the &euro;230,000 in Ballymun or wherever it was built.  We have inflationary pressure coupled with the fact that many workers went back home to eastern European countries during the Covid pandemic and may not come back to us.  We have an inflationary situation.  How do we deal with that?</p> <p>  On the concentration and densities of houses, it is all very fine that we need to put in all the social services we talk about but they come at a cost.  They have to be built into the cost of the unit to deliver it.  This is a problem in the private sector where the cost is so high to deliver a house and the rules will not allow a first-time buyer to get a mortgage to buy it.  We have the perfect storm at the moment.  I am concerned about projections for how many houses will be built based on what I can see happening on the ground.  It is something we need to have a reality check on.  That is just a comment.  The witnesses do not need to answer.</p></speech>

That will not necessarily drive up construction costs all that much.  Again, if we reconsider how we do procurement in this space and look at it on a national level as opposed to a regional or county basis, we can certainly impact measures there to drive the cost of materials down.</p> <p>  In terms of building social infrastructure around housing developments and what that might mean for housing costs, again, this part of the social infrastructure is absolutely needed.  If it does not happen now, it will come at a cost and at a societal cost.  We know, for example, that less equal societies have higher crime rates and worse health, so it comes at a cost across a number of areas in that case.  Factoring in that cost now will actually save money in the longer term.</p><p> In terms of the cost and affordability generally, our proposal is for over 14,000 social units per annum at a cost of &euro;3.3 billion.  We welcome the ESRI report today that mentions a doubling of the housing budget and an increase in social housing provision.  Part of the reason that we welcome that, and we have been driving it for a number of years, is because when people are accommodated properly - not through social housing solutions but in actual social houses and social housing developments - that frees up at least 60,000 units that are currently on HAP and more which are in RAS.  That frees those private properties back into the market.  That, together with Central Bank constraints on credit, should drive down house prices.  That is why we are very much against the notion of an equity stake at the buyer side and these demand-side incentives.  They should be at the supply side instead because demand-side subsidies, as we have seen with help to buy, only serve to maintain artificially high house prices whereas if you have sufficient housing stock - we need to double our current housing stock within the next ten years - that frees up stock in the private sector that can create more affordability and drive down house prices.</p></speech>

The European Commission has to say that the fiscal rules are going to bind again.  I was a little surprised that they said "2023" and not "2024".  There are advanced discussions happening at the European Commission on how to change the fiscal rules and by the time we get to 2023, there may be a different set of fiscal rules.  For the moment, it is absolutely the case that should the fiscal rules come to bind in the current form, fiscal consolidation is inevitable.  That is why I wrote the way I did.  It is inevitable the Minister for Finance of the day will not be able to stand up in the D&aacute;il and spend &euro;18 billion, or even &euro;4 billion or &euro;5 billion, in those conditions.</p></speech>

I recall the many interesting exchanges we have had over the years.  Dr. Healy and I have had more than one.  It is good to renew the debate.</p> <p>  First of all, I agree entirely in relation to the housing situation.  I said that many years ago.  Dr. Healy will recall, at a meeting that I had with him more than 20 years ago, I predicted that the biggest single issue to face this country in the future would be a lack of housing, and so it is.</p> <p>  Their estimates are short of what is required.  There is more required than the 14,000 referred to in some cases or the 10,000 referred to in other cases.  As long as we keep having a target that is short of what is required, we always will be behind.</p> <p>  How we build those houses is a different issue and we have to find a way to do that.  The houses, incidentally, will be built by the private sector - public authority houses have to be built - because they are the only people who are in the business of building by contract.  It has to be done as quickly as possible.  There are economies of scale that we can get out of that.  We can get reductions there.</p> <p>  In relation to the cost of the houses, I do not want to delay the meeting by getting into the proof of the pudding.  I saw situations where housing land became available scot-free.  That happened because land was zoned.  It made not a whit of difference to the price of the houses.  It was all a different situation then.  Costs had gone up and there were all kinds of excuses put forward.</p> <p>  I heard the phrase "post-austerity" used on a number of occasions.  Austerity is something that you have choices in.  You can decide to have an austerity measure to correct something in the economy or you can choose not to.  It should have been named "post-bankruptcy" because this country was bankrupt when there was so-called "austerity".  We had better realise that.  If we do not realise that, we are missing the target completely and avoiding facing up to the issue.  The country was bankrupt.  The banks had no money.  We can blame it on however we like.  I have spoken about this on many occasions.  The banks had no money.  The institutions had no money.  The State could not be paid.  The State's servants could not be paid.  There were measures taken to cut people's salaries, left, right and centre, as a means of coming to an affordable way of running the country.  That is a subject that angers me when I see it, and I am coming to the anger bit in a minute.</p> <p>  There are indications of anger.  As I have said on many occasions in the past as well, anger does not pay the bills but it creates other problems.  There are indications of expressions of anger.  We should well read into history and see where they went in the past.  We have to do what we have to do.  We have to explain to the people who are angry.</p> <p>  Incidentally, it is not the same people who are affected.  The people who are angry are not necessarily the same people who have been impacted harshly in the economic situation.  It is other people who seek to capitalise on that.  That is what is happening in relation to the targeting of individual groups in society.</p> <p>  It is appalling that a country that had set such high standards internationally as this has so many people with these pent-up views and you only have to scratch the surface when they let them roll free.  We have to reject that.  We have to explain to people who are expressing such anger that if they want to go there, there are consequences for everybody and we never again want to go in that direction.</p> <p>  I am not asking anybody to respond.  This is a commentary of mine.  Dr. Healy and I have had this commentary on many occasions in the past.  I would claim that I made predictions then that have been proven, unfortunately, correct.  That is why I emphasise the importance of the housing.</p> <p>  Housing is part of our taxation system.  If a person has an affordable house - I would emphasise the "affordable" bit - he or she can rely on the future and can plan.  Otherwise, he or she cannot.  If the person is in somebody else's hands, if some landlord or institution has control of his or her housing, then the person cannot control it and can never rest easily.  Incidentally, I am not a communist or anything like that.  I am merely pointing at the situation that we have seen develop around us.  We do not seem to be able to respond quickly enough to stop it from getting out of hand.</p> <p>  There are scores of other issues that upset me.  I am nearly getting into the area of the anger now and I would want to be careful about that.  We need to revise our housing requirements upwards on an annual basis.  Many times in the past, I have tried to point that out.</p> <p>  This point goes back to anger.  Anger begets anger.  That is a lesson we should keep in mind.  On every occasion where wild expressions of anger were allowed to run free in the past, there came a position where there was retribution, reaction and really serious issues.  It would not be fair for me to go on about my various rants over the time.</p> <p>  There is much discussion now on what the level of national taxation on corporation profits should be.  It may not be all that bad.  It is at a certain level, a manageable level.  It might not be the worst thing that ever happened.  However, what is of crucial importance is that we do not all live in New York or in the centre of Europe.  We in this country have to get to those markets and we have a geographical disadvantage.  There has to be some correction at all times which gives us an even chance with all of our competitors globally because we depend so much on our export markets.</p> <p>  Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  That is about as much as I can say on this sitting.  There will be another time.</p></speech>

The second is about the anger and the groups that are in anger.

That is done in other European countries that we wish to emulate and this would effectively double our social housing provision.</p> <p>  On overall housing provision, I note that the economic development plan has a target of 33,000 units per year.  That is very good as a starting point but what that covers, however, is what is necessary to account for demographic changes and obsolescence.  It does not account for the legacy need of decades of insufficient construction.  Again, when we talk about what we are looking at specifically, we are talking about social housing provision.  Our target would cover the current need into the future.  As to the private provision, that is worthy of greater consideration.  The 33,000 units is greater than what was set out in the Rebuilding Ireland plan, which was anywhere from 25,000 units per year to 25,000 units on average per year.  This is certainly something that needs to be expanded further.</p></speech>

Now there is the potential for a very large number of people moving from that to the jobseeker's allowance and then, after six months, to a means-tested payment at a rate of between &euro;200 and &euro;300, which is significantly lower than the top level of the pandemic unemployment payment, and that is why the benchmarking issue is key.  Benchmarking the core social welfare rates to 27.5% of average earnings is one of the key means of reaching our own national poverty targets.  There is a gap there of approximately &euro;20 and we will be looking for a &euro;10 increase in core social welfare rates in budget 2022 and another &euro;9 to &euro;10 in budget 2023, which is vital.  If welfare rates had been benchmarked in 2016 at that rate, an extra 12,000 adults of working age would have been lifted out of poverty.  If the benchmark was raised by 1% to 28.5%, 28,000 adults would be lifted out of poverty.  That is going a very significant way to meeting our poverty targets.</p> <p>  One other issue on the point of anger is youth unemployment and older workers who were in vulnerable positions and training.  We have to look back to the learnings from the previous crash with, for example, the youth guarantee.  The pilot was very good.  Insufficient resources, however, were put into the guarantee itself and the outcomes from that.  This time around we need a task force, and to be completely sure that we have new training in place for those new jobs that are going to come on scheme.  These have to be well-paid jobs and we have to keep these young people connected to the labour market.  There has to be an outcome for them.  This caused significant problems in other European countries in the levels of youth unemployment during the crisis and the lack of prospects for young people.</p> <p>  As to older workers, one certainly has to look at a county and regional level at what is there, how these workers traineeships are offered, and how they are transitioned.  People have to be given opportunities.  If not, then that anger will come.  It is vital that we get our training, skills and our industrial strategy right.  Some &euro;22 billion is available from the European Commission in funds for youth unemployment.  We have to ensure that whatever proportion of that we get is used very well. </p></speech>

I am glad that Deputy Durkan got that off his chest.  I can assure him that the poorest constituents who come to my office are those that are suffering in society.</p> <p>  I will address my first question to Dr. Kinsella.  When he appeared before this committee two years ago he called for the introduction of fiscal stress testing for the public finances because of the volatility of certain tax heads.  He asked for the introduction of automatic rules that would set ceilings and floors on spending to deal with the increased volatility.  Does he feel that his advice was listened to and what more can be done to make improvements in this area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Kinsella" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021060300002#L00900"><p>I thank the Deputy very much and I also thank the committee for repeatedly listening to me.</p> <p>  I have made a number of recommendations down the years.  The first was around fiscal stress testing of medium-term expenditure ceilings.  IFAC has gone some way towards doing this.  I convinced my colleagues on the council to examine this and some of the fiscal stress testing methodologies have been adopted there.  These have not been looked at in the overall stability programme updates or anything like that.  </p> <p>  We can argue in a certain sense that the Covid-19 pandemic is the perfect fiscal stress test.  We have seen what happens to the income tax take, for example, when one sector of the economy, the low-wage sector, is hit.  We know what that looks like now.  That is the first part, in that the council has not necessarily listened that carefully, which is a pity.  I would very much like to have seen more of that work being done, particularly in respect of the corporation tax issue.  We have said that losing &euro;2 billion might be the impact of that.  If it is more than &euro;2 billion, we are in very deep trouble.</p> <p>  The second issue that I raised, I believe, a year ago was the idea that this committee has a much deeper connection with the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General such that it formalises at a secretariat level structured dialogue processes, somewhat like the ones that the Higher Education Authority has with universities, whereby the committee is not just scrutinising next year's expenditure but is scrutinising the performance of the public sector as to that expenditure from the previous year.  If the Oireachtas gives the university sector &euro;1 billion, how was it spent?  What is a good allocation of money?  What did we learn from that experience?  As we go into the next allocation phase what do we, as the public, know about programmes that work and those that do not.  My argument there is that it is only through that feedback mechanism that the system will learn and will then get to programme-level level budgeting, which is very important.  We do not know, for example, whether the provision of cancer care in the mid-west is better, worse, or anything in between than the provision of cancer care in Dublin.  We have no idea as to the allocation of funding.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, a great deal has been done but there is certainly more to do to address these issues.</p></speech>

Turning to Social Justice Ireland, I have read its previous pre-budget submissions with interest and I look forward to its next one.  One thing that stood out is that in just 15 years, it is expected that more than one in five of our population will be aged over 65.  As Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for older people, I agree with all of Social Justice Ireland's proposals relating to older people, particularly the restoration of cuts to housing aid for older people and for people with different income abilities.  Social Justice Ireland has called for multi-annual budgeting, which is something that every group that I have met has mentioned is a barrier to their work.  I am interested to hear if Social Justice Ireland has any new proposals in the area of older people that I could assist it with.</p></speech>

In respect of older people, pension provision inadequacy was also mentioned by Professor Kinsella and the fact that it is a very gendered issue.</p><p>We have an expanding ageing population and it is a key factor in terms of the dynamic between housing policy and pensions policy.  Long before now, the State pension was meant to provide for a person's living expenses but it was never intended to provide for accommodation expenses on top of that or certainly not accommodation expenses the likes of which we are seeing now.  The adequacy of the State pension is important.  We are very concerned that the new pensions commission is dealing with the State pension only, not with auto-enrolment.  Such policy incoherence will give rise to a serious issue because when we look at the adequacy of the State pension into the future, we must also consider adequacy of income now and into the pre-pensionable age.  For example, people on lower incomes who may be captured by the auto-enrolment system, of necessity, are facing having a reduced income now to pay for an inadequate income in the future.  Social Justice Ireland has a policy proposal for a universal State pension based on residency, which we put together in 2018, but we had been advancing it for quite some time.  It is not connected to a person's household status, so it loses that gendered element.  Pension provision and income adequacy are important factors when it comes to a standard of living in older age.</p><p> Deputy Ryan mentioned our proposals on reinstating the 2010 level of housing grants for older people and people with disabilities.  That is something we are still progressing because the latest data show that it has decreased again and fewer people are in receipt of it.  We know, for example, that a significant proportion of older people are living in substandard accommodation, both through data available from EUROSTAT and through the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, and happiness studies.  That is something that must be addressed and increased.  Increases were made last year but they were not sufficient to address the current need and the future need.  Again, housing is a factor.  At the time, the Departments of Health and Housing, Local Government and Heritage produced their policy statement on housing for the older population and we would like to see some of the recommendations starting to get implemented because it focused on the spectrum of need.</p><p> Approximately 3.7% of the population will need nursing home care and we want to see adequate nursing home provision.  We saw the damage inadequate nursing home provision can cause in the early stages of the pandemic, so we need to see more adequate provision and enforcement of standards in the sector.  That requires resources.  We would like to see the funding report on nursing homes that was meant to be published in November 2019.  It was delayed again in October 2020 due to GDPR concerns, but we would like to see it because it will feed into the resourcing allocations for nursing homes and for care provision.  We want to see an increase in home help hours and home help packages.  While the number of people accessing home help has increased, the number of hours has decreased, so last year for those lucky enough to receive home care provision, it was less than the previous year.  A really interesting point to come out of the latest set of data from the performance report in the HSE, dated September 2020, is that the year-on-year waiting list has decreased by almost 5,000, yet we have not seen a similar increase in the number of people providing care.  There is something about the data that does not make sense.  The support of members would be gratefully received if it were possible to look into that a bit further.  Regarding the spectrum of housing, we know that we need greater supports for those who have their own homes under the nursing home support scheme but also in terms of social and affordable housing provision for those who want to downsize and rightsize their housing and those who want to live within their communities but in more supported accommodation.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the work it did on this Bill at pre-legislative stage, which was more extensive than any previous pre-legislative process and was effectively akin to Committee Stage, given that there were so many amendments in written draft form rather than just the heads of a Bill.  The amendments, most of which were incorporated in a revised draft of the Bill, that the committee proposed were beneficial in strengthening the Bill.  The work that the committee did was exemplary in that regard and I thank its members.</p><p>The first of my four amendments reflects a commitment in the programme for Government to end the issuing of new licences for exploration and extraction of gas.  A similar decision was taken by the previous Government in 2019 in respect of oil exploration and extraction.  My Department is no longer accepting new applications for exploration licences for either natural gas or oil.  The amendment in this Bill will implement that decision.</p><p>Subsection (1) in amendment No. 230 repeals the Minister's power to grant petroleum prospecting licences, licensing options, exploration licences, lease undertakings and petroleum leases under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, subject to certain saving provisions to which I will refer shortly.  This subsection is drafted to ensure that the Minister's power to revoke licensing options and lease undertakings is maintained.</p><p>Subsections (2) to (6) provide for the limited situations in which further authorisations may be granted.  Existing authorisations will not be affected by the repeal of the provisions of the 1960 Act, in that they will continue to be able to apply to progress through the licensing stages.  This is necessary to allow existing authorisations, some of which have been in place for more than ten years, to reach a natural conclusion in accordance with their existing terms and conditions, given that the State and the companies involved entered into those agreements in good faith.</p><p>We have already seen the effect of recent changes in policy.  At the end of September 2019, shortly after the then Taoiseach's announcement that new exploration for oil would end, there were 55 authorisations under regulation.  In the latest quarterly acreage report published by my Department, which set out the position at the end of March 2021, there were only 29.  I expect this number to decline further as authorisations expire or are relinquished, with no new authorisations for exploration and extraction replacing them.</p><p>The saving provisions also provide for petroleum prospecting licences, PPLs, to be granted to the holders of other authorisations.  We are doing this because, as in the case of licensing options and lease undertakings, the licensing terms require the holders of those authorisations to also hold a PPL.  Holders of exploration licences and petroleum leases may also require a PPL in certain special circumstances where it may be necessary for the authorisation holder to acquire data outside the boundary of its authorised area in order to inform fully any work directly relevant within its authorisation.  In the case of a petroleum leaseholder, it is not uncommon during the lifetime of a producing field for new seismic data to be acquired for purposes that include monitoring changes to the field through time as a result of production.  However, it is important to note that holding a PPL does not entitle the licensee to any further petroleum authorisation.  It is also important to remember that any application for follow-on authorisation or applications to conduct activity in the Irish offshore under existing authorisations will remain subject to ministerial consent and will continue to be required to meet environmental, technical and financial standards.</p><p>These amendments will ensure that no petroleum authorisations for new exploration can be granted while allowing existing authorisations to apply to progress, with the applications remaining subject to assessment by my Department.</p></speech>

Do they apply to all existing licences or tentative ones?  At what stage of the licensing process will licences be caught by these provisions or excluded?</p> <p>  We have discussed energy security in the D&aacute;il Chamber in terms of ensuring that we do not have blackouts.  The Sunday newspapers wrote much about the concerns in that regard at the weekend.  This brings me to the issue of assessment.  We have an energy review.  It is important that we see that information so that there can be confidence in the security of our energy supply for the years ahead and that we are not facing a cliff edge, as some call it.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed amendments to deal with future situations where this legislation, including the Minister's amendment, might be contested.  They related to dispute settlement and the likes of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  That they were ruled out of order was disappointing.</p> <p>  We did not get to discuss amendment No. 1, but a point that will run through this debate is people having confidence that we are making decisions based on sound and up-to-date information that is made publicly available and to which communities and different sectors can contribute.  This is an important matter that relates to this amendment and will arise time and again during our discussions on this legislation.</p></speech>

Of the 29 existing authorisations, three are petroleum leases, only one of which is currently producing.  That is the Corrib gas field.  Four are lease undertakings, 18 are exploration licences, two are licensing options and two are petroleum prospecting licences.</p><p> The issue of energy security was debated extensively in recent years at hearings of previous Oireachtas committees.  We must remember that, statistically, our success rate in terms of the number of offshore wells drilled has been very low, even if there are 29 authorisations.  The strike rate in terms of discovering commercially recoverable oil or gas has been very low.  Anyone who argues that we will be energy secure on the basis of oil and gas exploration is mistaken and promoting false security.  The issue of security on our grid system is a completely different issue.  The Sunday newspapers were correct that we have an issue with gas-fired power generation being out of commission at present.  That will present a challenge for the coming winter.  We will have to manage our supply and demand very carefully in the coming years.  In many ways, that is a separate issue and it is not related to the issue of offshore oil and gas exploration.</p><p> With regard to the analysis of the switch away from oil and gas and the ending of new authorisations for oil and gas exploration, Mr. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, stated when presenting the agency's world energy outlook at recent conferences and in giving its assessment of what we need to do for climate that every country needs to acknowledge the need to stop exploration for new oil and start cutting off the supply line of new fossil fuels.  The Government and that which preceded it have probably been ahead of others in doing this.  I have met representatives of the very small number of countries, including Costa Rica and Denmark, that have taken similar policy approaches.  The number is growing and will continue to do as I have described.  The Danes will be continuing with extraction and production for quite some time but they are taking a similar approach in that while they are not stopping existing authorisations, there are stopping new ones.  That is the approach we are taking.  What we are doing is very much in line with the leading-edge countries in this area.</p></speech>

This is an historic move by the Minister.  It is exceedingly welcome.  Ireland will be among a handful of countries across the globe that will be banning oil and gas exploration.  I worry, however, why the Minister has felt the need to double down in this Bill on existing legislation, thereby allowing companies that have licences to move on to the next level.  While it is welcome that the Bill will prevent future licensing, why does the Minister want to double down on what is already in legislation?  I find that slightly worrying although it is very welcome news that several of the licences have expired and are not being renewed.  Why does the Minister want and feel the need to double down on what is already written into legislation?  Would enshrining it in this Bill, by way of a double whammy, not give reassurance to the fossil fuel industry that regardless of circumstances and if we failed to meet our targets and something awful happened on the planet, we would allow it to?  I agree with the Minister that we do not want a native fossil fuel industry.  We have moved beyond that.  Time is running out.  We need to move away from fossil fuel extraction.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the mass movement that pushed this issue.  It repeatedly stated we need system change, not climate change, and that fossil fuel should be kept in the ground.  That was the main slogan.  It is a great tribute to those people, mainly the young, who fought so hard to get us to this point.  It is welcome but I have questions.</p></speech>

The Deputy introduced legislation in this area four years ago.  At the same time, almost on the same day, we had similar legislation.  There was one variation or difference in that we accepted from the start that in any move of the kind in question, existing authorisations would work through to their conclusions.  The Deputy's legislation sought to stop the authorisations at the point of enactment.</p> <p>  One reason for our approach is that the State acts in good faith in terms of abiding by contracts it enters into and meeting expectations.  We do not have a stop-start approach to legislation and policy if we have initiated a process.  That is important because we are now turning the Department's and State's resources for the issuing of prospecting licences and the regulation of the development of energy at sea towards the development in future years of offshore wind, tidal and wave energy.  There are very similar mechanisms of authorisation, prospecting, licensing and planning.  We need to provide very complex legal certainty on the environment for the development of that critical resource for us to tackle climate change.</p> <p>  The State has done well in the context of the integration of wind power.  One reason for this, according to people in the industry, is that we do not change course.  When we have set ourselves on a course, we try to stick to it.  That is important because, considering the major investment required for the climate transition, we do not need a stop-start approach.  For that reason, among others, we are allowing the existing authorisations to work through to their conclusions.  I expect that my commentary will not lead to production but we will have to watch out for that.  At the same time, we will have to ramp up the development of offshore wind energy in particular.</p></speech>

It is a bit like crossing our fingers and hoping it will not.  It is a real shame that the provision is being included in the Bill because we have not, in fact, entered into contracts with any of the relevant companies.  They have licences, which is quite different.  What the Minister is saying is that, regardless of how circumstances pan out, we are the gentlemen of the industry and honour our agreements with companies in the industry.  That is just not good enough.  If, for example, Providence or the Chinese corporations were to find oil and started to drill for it, would that not leave us with considerable egg on our face and make a negative contribution to the battle to stop the overheating of the planet?  I just do not regard this as necessary.  The companies already have licences and the Minister has the right to stop the progression of those licences.  He just admitted he will retain that right.  Why, therefore, is he doubling down on existing legislation if not to reassure what must be a nervous fossil fuel industry instead of letting it know that we are very determined about this?  I do not believe it is about gentlemen's agreements and it is certainly not about contracts because the companies are only owners of licences, nothing else.</p></speech>

There is uncertainty in exploration and drilling for oil and gas but it is certain that Ireland is one of the windiest places on the planet.  The wind, particularly in the north and west of the country, blows with consistency.  I want to use the resources, expertise and capability of the companies to tap into that energy resource.  Working with them in a predictable way is one of the most important ways of securing that investment, particularly for our western, north-western and southern coasts.  That is why it is important that we get this right.</p></speech>

It is important that we outline that the Government needs to carry its weight, that it must do what it needs to do and that it must do what needs to be done on the basis of just transition and equity.  It is important to specify that at the start and within the objective of the Act.  The amendment is as it is and it is relatively simple.</p></speech>

We all know that climate change is not an isolated situation in Ireland alone.  The actions we take have worldwide consequences and it is important to recognise that.  That is why it is important that it should be there in the objective of the Act and why the intentions of the Bill should be specified and broadened out.</p></speech>

I want to cite where the objective is included in the Bill and is set out clearly in section 5, in the proposed section 3(3), which is probably the most critical section of the legislation:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister and the Government shall carry out their respective functions under sections 4, 5, 6, 6B, 6C and 6D [of this Act] in a manner&mdash;  	(a) that is consistent with the ultimate objective specified in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change done at New York on 9 May 1992, and: <blockquote> 	(i) any mitigation or adaptation commitments entered into by the European Union in response or otherwise in relation to that objective;<br /><br />(ii) the steps specified in Articles 2 and 4(1) of the Agreement done at Paris on 12 December 2015 to achieve that objective ... </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>That is the overarching and most critical international legal course that we are set on and by committing Ministers and Government to carry out all their functions with respect to that, achieves the objective that is contained in this amendment.  That is probably one of the most critical sections in the legislation.</p></speech>

It is fundamental that we base it on science and the technologies we know are relevant to climate change.  I will not go through each of the elements but it is a matter of ensuring that each of those elements is recognised, addressed and acknowledged within this legislation and that when the criteria are being set, each of those elements is considered.</p></speech>

It is important that they are clearly laid out in order that everybody in the future will know what was taken into account and what decisions were made.

There are already target-setting criteria established in the Bill, which provide that any carbon budget plan or strategy the Government adopts will take account of a number of limited but crucial considerations, such as our EU and international obligations, including the Paris Agreement commitments, as well as the calculated national and voluntary projections.  Those matters are clear and cannot be disputed.  We need to be wary of introducing conflicting considerations that might make it impossible to reach agreement on what is a fair budget for Ireland.  We do not want any conflict with the process of bringing forward carbon neutrality objectives by 2045.</p> <p>  The Bill already includes target-setting criteria and considerations when determining how to distribute the budget across relevant sectors and what actions and measures are necessary to achieve the budget and ensure it is economically and socially just.  That is critical.  Ministers must have regard to the extensive list of matters set out under section 4(8) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as inserted by section 6 of the Bill, which is the more appropriate place to set out those criteria.</p></speech>

They are all trying to do the same type of thing, which is to make the legislation more explicit in terms of targets and accountability for those targets, and ensuring the process of getting to those targets is fair and equitable and that the voice of communities and sectoral representatives are heard.  We need to see more from the Minister in this regard or we will have a problem with the Bill every step of the way.</p></speech>

I am doing so on the basis of extensive advice from my Department.  The Bill has been significantly scrutinised and redrafted on the back of this committee's engagement and it has gone through incredibly extensive legal analysis and further redrafting.  It is a redrafting of existing 2015 legislation.  It is not fresh ground we are going over; it is something that has been carefully examined.  It is hugely significant politically, with huge consequences in terms of the roll-out and the structures of the public service.  It is not a Bill that will be easily further amended.</p> <p>  I mean no disrespect to the committee in saying that.  It reflects the amount of work that has been done and the balancing that has been achieved within Government and within Departments and elsewhere to get it right.  I think we have a very good Bill.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about trying to improve it further and so on, but I also have to take into account the many other considerations in terms of the broad agreement we have on what is already hugely significant and consequential legislation.</p></speech>

It seems, in effect, that all these amendments are a waste of time because, as far as he is concerned, he has done an adequate consultation on the Bill.  The advice he has is that nothing can be changed and he has gone as far as he can in terms of making the Bill work.  It looks like we are going to have nothing more than a few days of banging our heads against the wall.</p></speech>

Is he open to accepting any of them?  If not, and if Government members are going to vote against each of them, I have other things I could be doing today and on the two days scheduled for this debate next week.  It would be good if the Minister could clarify his position now.</p> <p>  I am absolutely baffled by the decisions regarding some of my amendments.  I made the point earlier that writing to the Ceann Comhairle will not deal with the fact they were ruled out of order.  I cannot for the life of me understand how bringing forward a target date from 2050 to 2045 will incur any additional expense for the State.  At this stage, it would be really beneficial to everybody who is giving up their time today to this debate to have clarification as to whether the Minister is open to accepting any amendments.</p></speech>

To answer Deputy Whitmore's question, this is critical legislation and it is critical that it gets passed quickly because we want to include this year in the first of the five-year plans.  We want to go to Glasgow being as far advanced as we can be in terms of our climate action plans.  The critical work for this committee, in my mind, will come in delivering the provisions that are already set out in the legislation.  There is a real, significant and important role for the committee as we go into the sectoral analysis and review of the carbon budget, the strategy and the climate action plan.  At every stage in that process, I would like to see as extensive an engagement as possible with members.  The work published today by the committee on the transport sector, to give an example, is hugely significant and very well considered.  We need to do more of that type of work.  That will happen in the autumn, if we can get this legislation through both the D&aacute;il and Seanad in advance of the summer recess, which is the timeline I am hoping to make.</p> <p>  There is no disrespect to the committee on my part, or lack of recognition of the important work it has to do.  I am working on the basis of the advice from my Department and the Attorney General's office.  We have considered every single amendment.  I do not want to give false expectation that there is a strong likelihood of amendments being agreed.  That is not the case.  My approach is on the basis of an assessment of each amendment on its merits and considering, as I said, the balancing act we have to do in terms of what is already very well-amended legislation.</p><p>I will refer to my speaking notes a lot because this is highly complex in many instances.  There is no expectation within those speaking notes that we will be accepting the amendments.  At the same time, we will listen and adjust if a compelling argument is made.  However, as we set out I should be honest with members that this is the recommendation I am getting from my Department.</p></speech>

This is the first Committee Stage debate I have been through.  When we started out in the committee, and started reviewing the climate Bill initially, the recommendation from the Minister and the Department was that we would not have pre-legislative scrutiny.  We pushed back against that and had very extensive pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Minister will agree that the Bill and the amendments were much stronger as a result.</p> <p>  We are now at another point where the committee has a role.  We should be allowed conduct that role and the Minister should engage with us in good faith.  I am disappointed to hear that does not appear to be the case and we will not have that opportunity.  This is really just a listening exercise for the Minister where we talk and he listens, but he still goes ahead with the Bill as it currently stands. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#H00300"><p>I will absolutely engage in good faith, will listen to every word and be open to any suggestion but I should also be honest.  Good faith also means not giving a false picture.  I will say to Deputy Whitmore that we are usually very open to accepting amendments.  We were involved in legislation last year on the establishment of the carbon fund from the National Oil Reserves Agency levy.  The Deputy may recall there was a provision in that, on Committee or Second Stage, where she made the case to amend that legislation to include investment in, and protection of, biodiversity and community investment for this transition.  I was not able to make the amendment in that legislation but I committed to come back to it in this legislation and we have already adjusted it.</p> <p>  It is no lack of willingness to listen and adjust but, to reiterate the point I made, there has not been such significant legislation before the Oireachtas in my time, which goes back to 2002 with a short interval out.  It has major implications for the operations of the State in every aspect of its work.  The work done during pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was, to my mind, highly unusual.  It is very unusual that a draft Bill goes for pre-legislative scrutiny where it is drafted line by line.  In effect, what this committee did in the pre-legislative scrutiny process was akin to Committee Stage, in that line-by-line amended recommendations went back to Government.  We listened and amended, quite significantly, the legislation to reflect that.  There is no disrespect to the committee.  I have engaged in this process very much in good faith, but part of that is being honest about the belief within my Department, and my own view, that the legislation as drafted is very well structured, thanks to the committee as much as anything else.</p></speech>

It is because this Bill is so important that so much effort and dedication was put into these amendments.  There are two streams of amendments to this Bill.  One stream of people genuinely wants to take what we believe is a good Bill and make improvements.  We are coming to a section that will deal with climate justice and just transition.  Much very good work has been done in preparation for this Stage.  It is bitterly disappointing to think that none of the amendments will be accepted. </p> <p>  I am agnostic as to which climate justice amendments will be accepted, or what parts of them will be accepted but there is a very real need to improve that area and that language in this Bill.  As groundbreaking as the pre-legislative scrutiny was for this Bill, we should not consider it an outlier and something that will not happen too often.  It should be the basis for future legislation and not treated as something that happened this one time and probably will not happen again.  It should be built upon through all Stages.  </p> <p>  The danger is that the goodwill and engagement built up through pre-legislative scrutiny and carried through to Second Stage will be lost now.  We could end up having quite a testy, negative experience when this returns to the Chamber.  That is not something that anyone on the committee, any of the spokespeople or anyone passionate about this wants to see.  I hope between now and the meeting this afternoon, and the scheduled meetings next week, the Minister might reconsider his approach and what is written in the speaking notes.  He has the expertise and the experience, going back many years, to be able to judge what can and cannot be put in and what concessions and compromises can be made.  I ask at this stage that he revisits that.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Whitmore, my assessment is that of my officials, the Office of the Attorney General and the whole of Government, which has paid razor sharp attention to this legislation as it affects every Department.  I also have to listen to them and heed their advice.  That is something I will do.</p></speech>

That is not fair to us.  We all have a lot to do and if the Minister is going to reject amendments we should know that from the outset, rather than go through these things one by one.</p> <p>  The impact of this will mostly be on activists.  Many seasoned activists, people the Minister knows very well, will be very disappointed by the rejection of these amendments.  The amendments are not coming from just anywhere. They are not frivolous or meaningless but are there to try to strengthen what the Minister states is very important, seismic and historic legislation.  We agree with him on that, but seasoned campaigners and, indeed, eminent scientists are worried about the weaknesses in the Bill.  They want to see issues like climate justice, just transition, carbon budgets and carbon capture and storage considered in more detail and done better.  </p> <p>  The Minister is not just rejecting the representations of Deputies on the committee but also a huge tranche of the movement, who sat around for endless hours, as the Minister probably knows, scrutinising the Bill and suggesting amendments that will now be rejected.  It that is what the Minister is going to do, it is important for us to know and he should tell us early on.  As has been said, we can all have a big row when it gets to Fifth Stage in the D&aacute;il but we are not really going to strengthen this Bill.  It will be left with gaping holes and historic weaknesses. </p></speech>

The Bill is not strong enough and needs to be improved.  I do not care whether the amendments come from the Opposition or the Minister.  This process needs to be about taking the Bill back to the Minister's colleagues and partners in government, the Attorney General or whoever, and saying he is hearing, loud and clear, that we need to improve on this Bill.  It was improved in the previous pre-legislative, PLS, stage and can be improved on again.</p> <p>  My concern is that the Minister sounds deaf to the deep concerns being expressed by communities throughout the country, which he surely heard loud and clear during the debate on Second Stage.</p><p>There are deep concerns the Bill does not provide protections for our most vulnerable and those who will be worst affected by these climate measures.  The Bill does not go nearly far enough in terms of definitions, commitments and the principles of just transition.  They want, we want and I certainly want more explicit detail on this and commitments from the Government spelled out in legislation.  This would serve two purposes.  It would strengthen the Bill and provide protection for communities.  It would also allay the fears of the detractors of the Bill.  People are playing political games with this stuff.  It is a significant problem for the climate movement generally if we are saying that there is no room for manoeuvre outside of what the Minister is putting forward.  The Minister needs to leave the door open.  He needs to hear what is being said on Committee Stage and come back with amendments based on what he hears.  This needs to be a very important part of what we are doing.</p></speech>

I have listened to some of the scientific concerns.  Amendment No. 107, which I have tabled, tries to address one of the concerns raised.  With regard to the activists and others to whom we listen, the critical work we have to do now is in developing and delivering a climate action plan that is fit for purpose and allows us to use the provisions in the legislation to effect real change for a just transition to achieve climate justice.  This work will not be easy.  It will be hugely contentious.  There are huge gaps in public support.  There are different political views within the Oireachtas as well as outside on what we are going to do.  The time to act is now to deliver this much more ambitious plan.  The committee and Oireachtas have key roles.  The legislation is strong and well structured.  I will engage in this process with full commitment if there are flaws and changes that have to be made.  It is better to be honest and upfront, however.  The Bill as drafted, with some amendments which I have tabled, is what I expect to be progressed to Report Stage.</p></speech>

We are looking for a reflection of what the Climate Change Advisory Council has recommended, which is that in terms of targets biogenic methane coming from agriculture should be dealt with separately to other methane and carbon emissions.  The argument has been put forward by the Climate Change Advisory Council that it should be dealt with separately because carbon and methane coming from agriculture are part of an overall cycle.  As the Minister knows, the issue is the increase in the amount of methane coming from the agricultural sector rather than methane <i>per se</i>.  As the Minister knows, it is part of a cycle.  Methane emitted from animals goes into the atmosphere and converts into carbon dioxide.  This carbon dioxide is then sequestered in the soil and grass and some of it is consumed by animals and goes back into the cycle again.</p><p>We are in a unique situation in Ireland in that we have substantial amounts of marginal land that is unsuitable for tillage.  Globally, there is a big push to move a lot of agricultural land into other types of protein crops where there is not the same scale of emissions, particularly with regard to methane.  If we look at many parts of Ireland where we have marginal land that is completely unsuitable for tillage, producing protein for humans from cattle is the only way the land can be productively used.  It is part of a sustainable process.  As the Minister knows, in the past we had a situation in the Burren where cattle were removed and had to be reintroduced because of the detrimental impact it had on biodiversity.  We had the same with sheep in many upland and mountainous areas along the west coast of Ireland.  A number of animals are required on land to be able to maintain it from an environmental and biodiversity perspective.  The same is the case in many areas of marginal land throughout the country.</p><p>I accept that agriculture has to do its bit to meet the overall climate targets but my concern is that agriculture emissions are the soft option.  The Minister knows from being in the Department, and from having been in the Department with responsibility for energy previously, how difficult it can be at times to get people to move and take the type of actions needed.  I have given the example already of electric buses.  We have to wait until 2023 for the first double-decker electric bus to be on the streets of Dublin even though the Cabinet took the decision in January 2018 to progress along this route and no longer buy fossil fuel buses.  My concern is that when we start to meet the thresholds for 2025 and 2030, and when we have not retrofitted 500,000 homes by 2030 and do not have 1 million electric vehicles on our roads, in order to meet these targets the squeeze will be put on the most vulnerable sector in agriculture, which is our indigenous suckler beef sector.  It produces very carbon-efficient beef on marginal land.</p><p>It produces protein for humans on land that is not suitable for any other form of protein production and carries out a vital role in biodiversity.  The evidence is already there in relation to that.  It is not just me putting forward this argument.  The Climate Change Advisory Council, in its 2020 report, strongly advocated that biogenic methane should be separated out, should be accounted for separately, and should have its own dedicated ring-fenced targets so that agriculture improves and reduces its emissions per kilogram and its emissions per hectare.</p><p> At long last we can see work ongoing, which is building on work I was involved with in respect of smart farming, to improve grassland management and to improve soil sequestration of carbon.  There is an awful lot that can be done in that regard.  There is no point in the agricultural sector carrying its burden, so to speak, on the 2030 targets and on targets beyond that date, if it all is to be nullified, come the eve of 2025 or the eve of 2030, when another scheme is introduced, effectively to reduce overall numbers of suckler cows in Ireland, as we have already seen in the reliefs and supports that have been put in place with Brexit.  It is about putting in place a fair and transparent balance.</p><p> The amendment I put forward here clearly reflects the goal, objective and intention of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  The Minister has already cited our international targets and what we have signed up to internationally.  The committee will be aware that all of these were drafted by industrialised countries.  These are the countries that set the agendas and targets on it.  Yes, they are challenging targets to achieve, but when one considers a country such as Ireland, where we do not have the heavy industry and where 37% of our population lives in isolated rural areas, our geography and our emissions profile is very different to that of other European countries.  That needs to be reflected in how we actually design our targets here.  Personally, I believe that our targets for biogenic methane emissions should be on a European Union level because the policy is developed in the context of CAP.</p><p> The reality is that the vast majority of food products we produce are consumed outside of Ireland.  This should be reflected in the emissions profile of the countries where this food is consumed, and not where it is produced.  This will cause a huge problem further down the road in the way the current system is structured.  We have a perverse situation where the targets, as they are currently designed, will force the wind-down of beef exports from Ireland, where we are the most carbon-efficient beef exporter within the European Union.  This will be replaced with beef coming from South America as part of the overall trade agreements we have.  That beef, coming from the Amazon basin in Brazil, has a carbon footprint 35 times higher than the beef produced here in Ireland.  Yet, in theory, from an accounting point of view, it makes sense.  It makes sense from the point of view of reducing Ireland's emissions profile, which it will do, but it will compound the problem for our atmosphere, our climate and the planet as a whole.   We will be replacing relatively carbon-efficient beef production in Ireland with beef production from South America that is disastrous for the environment and disastrous for the climate.  While that is okay for the accounting mechanism under the agreements that are currently there for the climate targets we have set for ourselves at EU level, it is imperative that we do not go down the same road given the mistakes that are being made with European and global targets, or that we do the same thing here in Ireland.  We should have a very separate and distinct target set for the agricultural sector.</p><p> I want to make it quite clear that I am not talking about agriculture getting a free ride on this.  There is a substantial amount of work that the agricultural sector can do.  The Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, has a huge body of work to do around land use and land use change, which will be key to achieving our overall climate objective targets, and especially in the agricultural sector.  It is imperative that this work is done within a sector specific area because biogenic methane is very different to the carbon dioxide used anywhere else in society and in the economy.</p><p> It is not just the Climate Change Advisory Council.  Our colleagues in Northern Ireland have a very similar structure in agriculture that is also taking the separate approach to biogenic methane.  The Climate Change Committee there has specifically stated that there should be a different target for biogenic methane emissions in Northern Ireland, and that this should be offset against carbon sinks in other parts of the UK.  Members will be aware that New Zealand has also taken a very similar approach on this.  New Zealand has a very similar emissions profile to Ireland's, and it faces similar challenges to us.  They have separated biogenic methane from other forms of methane and other carbon dioxide emissions.  New Zealand has set separate targets on that.  New Zealand is our direct competitor in dairy production and sheep farming.  If we are serious about being fair to all sectors, and if we talk about taking the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council and the scientists who are experts in this area, every single one of them, to a man and woman, has said there needs to be a separate mechanism to calculate biogenic methane and that it should be treated in a different manner.  That is why I have tabled this amendment.</p><p> I hope the Minister will look at this fairly and reasonably.  I have listened intently to what the Minister said earlier, and that there is broad agreement on the Bill.  I accept that the Minister has gone through a tortuous process in securing the agreement on the Bill that he has already secured.  I can understand the Minister's logic for not being willing to budge any further on this and in having to try to go back to the Cabinet to try to get agreement on further changes on it.  I put it to the Minister, however, that we still live in a democracy.  Under our parliamentary procedures the first step is in carrying out amendments to the legislation.  We will also deal with it at a later stage in my amendments where I believe the way it is currently drafted is anti-democratic.  It is important that if the Minister is giving such a role to the Climate Change Advisory Council, which will be enshrined in this legislation and put on a statutory basis, then this key recommendation in the council's report needs to be adopted, included and incorporated into the legislation.</p></speech>

However, I would make a distinction between the vested interests of the agrifood business and the family farm.  The Deputy spoke about how we needed to deal with the increase in the herd over the past ten years.  It has been incredible.  Not only are we exporting to markets around the world, but we are creating those, too.  An Bord Bia sent people out to the Middle East and China to get their middle classes interested in foods they never ate before, for example, dairy produce and beef.  Those markets were created to fill the bank accounts of a certain cohort in our society who gain the most from doing so.  It has not benefited our farmers.  If it had, why would they be outside the meat factory plants or blockading the D&aacute;il and why would the Beef Plan Movement have begun?  Farmers have been left behind.  Continuing with the same policy does not help them.</p><p> I will move on to the science and argue against what is being said.  It is possible to treat biomethane as a special case in how we budget and plan for reductions.  The Government addresses this in its Bill, but that approach does not deal with the science.  In fact, there is no difference in impact on the atmosphere between methane from fossil fuels and biomethane.  There is not a special place for biogenic methane in terms of what it does in heating up the planet and how nature reacts to it.  It is the same gas.  Two separate cases have to be made.  One is for the carbon budget and not touching the beef and dairy industry, but the other is for nature and science.  There cannot be a special place for biogenic methane in the Bill.  One of the problems that arose during our earlier discussion with the Minister is that these matters are not being dealt with seriously.  There are flaws in the Bill, and one of the most serious is that biogenic methane has a special place.  Therefore, we are back to square one.</p><p> A key issue that needs to be addressed is being given an opt-out clause.  This will be viewed through carbon budgets rather than in terms of the science.  We can fool one another.  We might even fool the EU about our emissions if we do enough offsetting and carbon trading, but we will not fool the planet, nature or the science.  What bothers me about this approach is that we are viewing the carbon budget as something we must play around with to mask the reality, that being, there is no difference between biogenic methane and fossil fuel methane even though we are pretending there is to suit the industry.  That is dangerous, and it only suits the high end of the industry, not the family farm.  We need a just transition.  That is why many amendments have been tabled on the centrality of the just transition.  We need a just transition for farmers.</p></speech>

I take on board what Deputy Naughten has said about this matter.  Deputy Naughten spoke about the issue of split targets and putting some meat on the idea of distinct characteristics of biogenic methane as provided for in the Bill.  When I read this amendment and its related amendments, it looked as though biogenic methane would not be considered in the national objective or the Bill's provisions.  One of our recommendations at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and in our report - I believe it was recommendation No. 36 - was that consideration would have to be given and meat would have to be put on the bone, for want of a better term, of what is meant by "distinct characteristics of biogenic methane" and the role of agriculture in society and what its implications would be for accounting and other requirements.</p> <p>  I have a question about this group of amendments, but I would also like to hear from the Minister about the prospect of split targets.  Have they been considered?  They are employed elsewhere.  A reply would inform the committee.</p></speech>

That is critical in this legislation.  How we do this will involve everyone and benefit everywhere.  Under the draft section 6A(9)(a)(ii), the advisory council would take into account relevant scientific advice, including on the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  However, I will not support the amendment in changing the definitions as proposed.  We must be careful with definitions of biogenic and non-biogenic methane.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, biogenic methane covers wetlands, agriculture, including the rearing of ruminants and growing of rice and other crops, landfills, forests, oceans and termites.  Non-biogenic methane includes emissions from fossil fuel mining, biomass burning, waste treatment, geological sources, including geothermal and volcanic methane, and natural gas seepage in sedimentary basins.  Differentiating between definitions right now would be highly complex.</p> <p>  Something else to consider is that the UN process imagines anthropogenic emissions versus natural emissions.  We must differentiate between anthropogenic emissions &ndash; the likes of rice agriculture, livestock, landfills, waste treatment, biomass burning and fossil fuel &ndash; and emissions from natural sources, for example, wetlands, oceans, forests, fires and geological sources.  The definitions in this regard are best managed within the UN and IPCC processes as they must be based on international agreement and international standards.</p> <p>  As set out in the Bill's wording, we must take into account the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  The IPCC report from autumn 2018 recognised we would not reduce biogenic methane emissions or anthropogenic emissions from agriculture and other sectors to zero but we would have to do so in respect of fossil methane, which is the most critical step we must take.  We will have to reduce anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, though.  That is why there is no opt-out.  Every sector must be involved.</p> <p>  I might refer to the international approach.  Last autumn, the EU presented a new methane strategy.  Critically, it differentiated between fossil methane &ndash; to simplify, the petroleum industry's methane &ndash; and biogenic methane.  In this, there is an intimation of how differentiated the treatment could be.  The EU does not set the rules in this regard, though.  In an immediate sense, it sets the rules through CAP and other mechanisms, but Europe will have to adopt international agreements like the Paris process and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, process.  We are working on that with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney. We have a seat on the UN Security Council, which is an opportunity for us to connect the security issue to climate, including the question of how we treat biogenic methane.</p><p>In my contribution to President Biden's big event on climate last month, we referred to the approach we would like to see taken internationally on biogenic methane.  The US climate envoy, former Secretary of State, John Kerry, referred to that in his contribution when he spoken in Dublin recently.  The approach to be taken is to use the likes of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which is an organisation established within the UN system, to look specifically at the management of or approach to short-lived greenhouse gases.</p><p> Everyone knows that methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas.  It is short-lived in the sense that it oxidises in the upper atmosphere into carbon dioxide in a way that is very damaging and climate worrying.  There is real international concern about methane.  The level of methane in the atmosphere is rising rapidly and is of great concern.  I expect to see international scientific reports re-enforcing that later this summer, so we must address the methane issue.  The approach will and should differentiate.  It should take into account best science.  In the measuring and monitoring of this, a recent development has been the establishment of an EU-UN environmental programme, a methane monitoring observatory.  These are the sort of science sources which we will adhere to.</p><p> It is an international agreement which has different implications for different counties.  In regard to the area of agriculture, we should be supporting, wherever possible, agricultural systems that support not just our climate objectives - that must happen - but also our biodiversity and other objectives.  We should look to support the form of agriculture - pastoral and family farms - which is good at climate adaptation and resilience, as well as climate mitigation.  I am sorry for the long answer, but this is the crux of the issue.  In a global context, we should do that in our role on the UN Security Council, in particular, where climate has to been seen as a critical security issue in a way that supports developing countries in Africa and small island developing states, SIDS, and supports the form of climate-resilient pastoral family-farming which is small scale, less intensive and less feedlot-orientated agriculture in regard to ruminants.  That would have knock-on consequences for our country.  It would support the kind of family farming system of agriculture, which I think we are agreeing on here.</p><p> We will have to work on this internationally.  It can be good for the type of farming we want, which protects nature as well as rural Ireland.  We should take heart from this.  I listened intently to the president of the IFA today when he said - I know from my experience that the head of the ICMSA, Natura 2000 and hill farmers, and the other farm organisations increasingly understand this - that the vast majority of Irish farmers are committed to climate action.  They increasingly understand that what we will have to do is reduce our emissions and increase their income.  That is why I come back to how we treat and manage this.  It is to look at mechanisms, and not that agriculture will get an opt-out and will not play its part.  Going back to what I said earlier, in the autumn this committee will have to consider what the various sectoral allocations will be.  The truth is that if we reduce our ambition in one area, it may put impossible constraints or obligations on other sectors, which might have significant consequences for employment or other aspects in the quality of our lives.  Therefore, every sector is involved.</p><p> A key question within agriculture is, how do we increase income as we reduce emissions, including the reduction of the biogenic methane?  We must recognise that this has to be good for Irish agriculture, and I believe it can be.  That is the approach we will take on this.  We have recognised that in the provisions of the Bill which state we take into account the scientific advice on biogenic methane.  It is so complicated and multi-varied in its aspect that I do not think we can define it in the Bill.  However, we have sufficient recognition in the Bill to connect those international developments I mentioned briefly there.</p></speech>

I agree with what the Minister has said that we need a new vision for agriculture.  Anyone who seeks to try to present the case that nothing should change in agriculture is doing farmers a disservice.  In a decade&rsquo;s time when the price of carbon goes to well over a &euro;100 per tonne, the farming systems that did not look seriously at carbon and its management will leave family farms with much deeper problems than if they had made an early move to make those changes.  My only worry is that by setting very ambitious targets in a sector like agriculture, where the pace of change is not going to be easy given the age profile and mix of farming methods, we may be trying to force change faster than the system is capable of delivering.</p> <p>  We need to be thinking of paying for sequestration.  In international inventories, sequestration through forestry or land management of one sort or another is not counted as part of the inventory and would not count towards the 51%.  We must start to think differently because we need to start paying farmers to be farmers of carbon.  This inevitably means that apart from CAP funds, other funds need to be introduced which farmers can earn, taking account of the likelihood that farmers will be much more efficient, in cost terms, in bringing down our carbon footprint than some other sectors.  If one can relieve sectors of more expensive burdens, there should be scope to support farmers in delivering some of the changes that are available in the agriculture and land use sector.  It must be done in the context of new policy tools to allow farmers to make this transition.  If we rush to set targets and do not have those sorts of mechanisms, farmers will become frustrated.  What we have to do is try to get people on the one page in terms of combining the challenge to farm carbon while also delivering food.</p> <p>  I worry that this debate is often pitched as one group opposing another, and that is a dangerous arrangement.  We must find the space where a new vision for agriculture can be carved out and where people can see a decent family farm income coming in, albeit from doing different things compared to how things had been done before.  It is a challenge for the Oireachtas and our committee, in particular, to design those mechanisms.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the comments made by my two successors as Minister in this area, namely, Deputies Eamon Ryan and Bruton.  They have both recognised the validity of the point I am making concerning the need for biogenic methane to be treated differently.  The only point of disagreement between the three of us is how that aspect should be reflected in the Bill and that is why I submitted this amendment.  I will return to that point shortly.</p> <p>  Moving on to answer some of the questions raised by colleagues, I made it clear at the start of my contribution this morning, as I did while I was the Minister and I will do so again, that agriculture cannot get a free pass when it comes to climate change.  Therefore, I am not stating that agriculture should not be touched, but that it must be accounted for separately and that there is a good reason for doing that.  Agriculture has a key role to play regarding the issue of land use.  Substantial progress can be made in agriculture.  However, with a deadline set for 234 weeks' time, the only thing that can be done in that short time that will have a real impact is herd reduction.  The difficulty with herd reduction is that it undermines the type of farming that the Minister has expressly said that he wants to support, namely, family farms and pastoral grazing.  That in itself is not good for biodiversity or overall climate emissions.  </p> <p>  Physical constraints exist regarding the retrofitting of homes and in rolling out electric vehicles.  I set up those plans and targets and they were to be in full operation now, but that is not happening.  Even greater pressure is therefore being put on what I believe is the soft option of cattle numbers, instead of land use management.  Some environmental zealots are trying to claim that methane from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture are the same, but they are not.  They try to shut down any discussion of this issue.  There is a big difference between the two forms of methane.  Methane from fossil fuels comes from carbon which has been locked away in our planet for hundreds of millions of years.  Methane from agriculture comes from carbon dioxide that was in our atmosphere a few hours ago, a few days ago or a few weeks ago.  It is being converted into protein for humans to consume.  It is part of an overall carbon cycle.  </p> <p>  In fairness, that aspect was acknowledged by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the former Minister, Deputy Bruton.  It has also been acknowledged by the Climate Change Advisory Council, the Government of the United Kingdom, the European Union and New Zealand.  However, it is not yet part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, accounting framework.  Having said that, though, I fully accept that CH, methane, in our atmosphere, regardless of the source, has the exact same warming potential and that is why agriculture has a key role to play in combating climate change.  My issue concerns how this element is accounted for in domestic legislation and international climate rules.  Internationally, this aspect should be accounted for through the consumption of food, which accurately reflects the impact that methane has on our atmosphere, and not where that food is produced.  Taking the latter approach leads to perverse situations, such as the consumption of meat from the Amazon basis being incentivised.</p></speech>

I have only two substantial amendments to the Bill.  I accept there are many more amendments but this is one of my two.  If the Chair will let me finish my point in this regard, I will keep quiet after that.  Turning to my amendment, the Minister argues that there is sufficient recognition of biogenic methane in the legislation already.  I argue this is tokenism and non-binding.  The reality is that agriculture will become the fall guy for a failure to meet targets in other areas.  I fully accept that setting a separate target for biogenic methane is not a trivial task.  To answer Deputy O'Rourke's query, that is why I have not been prescriptive in this amendment.  I do not have the required detail available and I do not think that anyone does now.  I am just reflecting what has been recommended in the Climate Change Advisory Council's 2020 report.  It is imperative that the recommendation is incorporated in black and white into the legislation and that is why I have tabled this amendment.</p></speech>

There will be sectoral targets for agriculture and land use, which will be different from the targets for other sectors and probably less onerous.  However, the agricultural sector has to play its part too.  I reassure Deputy Bruton that it will be necessary to account for sinks as well as sources.  The Bill does that, and the definition concerning a removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere sets out that clearly.  It includes the use of natural or technological solutions, nature-based solutions being centre stage in that regard.</p> <p>  My key point is that we must increase incomes and reduce emissions.  Removal of greenhouse gases, in form of those sinks, could, should and will be the source of potential income for farmers, foresters and those involved in land use and reclamation management etc..  Critically, this should be a turning point for the better for agriculture.  We want to redirect some of the income currently going to the processing and retailing side of agriculture to pay for nature-based solutions and the environmental services that will be provided by farmers.  That is why many farmers are rowing in behind what we are seeking to do.  That income must go up.  We must have an Origin Green brand that is truly green in origin, in respect of protecting nature as well as stopping emissions.  </p> <p>  It can also increase income in many different ways.  As well as pasture-based family farming, we can also look at more secure incomes by having a diversity of income streams being derived from farming.  Last, but not least, this aspect concerns not just methane but also elements such as nitrous oxides, in addition to greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, from agriculture itself.  There is also potential to derive income from the generation of energy on farms.  Farm incomes could also be raised by reducing the use of nitrogen and nitrous oxide fertilisers.  This endeavour, therefore, is not just focused on methane.  It is about a variety of approaches, all of them centred on increasing income and getting a new generation of young farmers into the sector as emissions are cut.  I am afraid I cannot support the amendment but I think we agree on the principle that farming must play its part and, critically, the old narrative of the environment versus agriculture must end.  We work together.</p></speech>

Everybody recognises that this Bill is vitally important and just transition is an important part of how we address climate change to ensure that it is reflective of everybody's needs.  There is no point in having the people who are least in a position to deal with the effects of climate change being the ones who carry all the costs as well.  There is a real danger of that happening in any society.  This is important and I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.  In particular, it is vitally important to take that language of &quot;in so far as it is practicable to do so&quot; out of the Bill because it is not necessary at all.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, seek to improve on the definition of climate justice contained in the Bill and they all do so.  Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing amendment No. 14, which seeks to address what we would see as the weaknesses within the current definition of climate justice in the flexibility it allows.  The Bill leaves the option to come up short and our amendment seeks to strengthen the language in the Bill on equity and fairness.  The definition we are proposing is based on the Mary Robinson Foundation definition.  I know it is a definition the Minister has supported and used in the past.  It is one of the most important opportunities to build and improve on this legislation.  I would call on the Minister to support, if not the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, one of the other amendments, or to come back with a stronger definition, if not now then on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I know none of them will be accepted but they all speak to the glaring need to strengthen the definition of climate justice within this Bill.  If the Minister was still just a Deputy and not a Minister, he would probably be making similar arguments to those that are being made by the previous speakers and by those who will offer their thoughts subsequently.</p> <p>  There are no winners when it comes to climate change.  Everyone is a loser but there are those who are losing most, who are suffering most and who are most vulnerable.  By improving the definition of climate justice within this totemic Bill, we would be sending out a strong message of solidarity, assistance and real energy in that regard.  I ask the Minister to reassess his approach to this issue and to just transition by accepting the amendments.  If he is not going to accept amendments, perhaps he could make a commitment to come back with an improved wording.  Again, no one wants ownership over this and no one is going to win on this.  We just want the Bill to be improved.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 12 is in my name but I will not be in a position to press it because I have to go and speak in the Chamber shortly.  I will be withdrawing the amendment.</p></speech>

There is a plethora of similar amendments here and it would be good if the Government could go back and change the Bill, which was originally peppered with the phrase "in so far as is practicable".  There was a huge amount of comment on the matter and a request to change it.  The Government did so in respect of most of the text of the Bill but not in this section.  Perhaps the Minister could explain why the Government removed this language in other clauses but not in this one because it is a caveat that gives the Government a get-out and makes the Bill look so poor.</p> <p>  What I have in amendment No. 13 that makes it slightly different from the other amendments is the suggestion that the Bill should reflect the UNFCCC commitment to the common but differentiated responsibilities in respect of capacities.  In other words, wealthier countries have to do more than the poorer countries.  That is a statement Ireland should be well able to make in the Bill and not omit it and then include a get-out clause such as "in so far as is practicable".  It is not acceptable and I hope the Minister can take that on board and change that language.</p></speech>

We are all saying the same thing.  I saw earlier that one of the civil society groups wants the UNFCCC commitment mentioned in the Bill.  Perhaps that is something the Minister can take on board.</p> <p>  My amendment is a simple addition, which emphasises that it will be the poor people globally who will be impacted most by climate change.  When we talk about vaccinations we say that no one is safe until we are all safe and it is a similar concept when we are talking about global equality and climate change.  Unless this is a global effort and unless we tackle it globally and take our responsibilities as a wealthy nation on board, it will not be solved.</p> <p>  I am not pushed as to which amendment is accepted.  They all encompass what we need to see but I ask that the Minister consider them.  This is important.</p></speech>

Our response to climate change has to be centred around climate justice and delivering just transition.  The Bill recognises that.  The definition is based on the definition that the Mary Robinson Foundation has set out and chimes word for word with amendments Nos. 14 and 15.</p><p>It refers to the need to "safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable persons and endeavour to share the burdens and benefits arriving from climate change".  As I said, the text is taken almost word for word from the Mary Robinson Foundation definition and it is the right definition.  The same is true of how just transition is defined and where it is included in the Bill.  It is centred around an effort to "maximise employment opportunities" and "support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition".  That is an appropriate definition and it is included as one of the issues that ought to be taken into account as we set out our strategy.  The wording in the Bill is correct and appropriate.  While I understand the sentiments behind these amendments, I do not support them.  I prefer to keep the wording as it is.</p></speech>

In order to define how people are vulnerable, we need to acknowledge there will be social and economic vulnerabilities globally and it will be the poorest people who are most impacted in that regard.  If the Minister is not open to taking the more definitive amendments, he might consider the simple addition of the words "social and economic exclusion".</p></speech>

That is the problem with the definition in the Bill.  It is a catch-all, get-out clause for the Minister and the Department.  The definition is totally unacceptable without the removal of the words "in so far as is practicable".</p></speech>

We can play a part and contribute as far as we practically can but we cannot, on our own and single-handedly, address the entire global climate justice issue.  We can contribute to a solution but it is not completely within our control.  It requires an international effort, which is there at the centre of the Bill.  It reflects our commitment to the Paris Agreement and its articles, which very specifically recognise that those who have done least to cause the crisis should not be put to the greatest burden in addressing it.  Rather, those who have done most to cause it must do the most to seek to solve it.  That is at the core of this legislation and the articles of the Paris Agreement, with which we must be consistent in the wording of the Bill.</p> <p>  Seeking to achieve social equality and justice should be central to everything we do.  However, we must be careful not to put that whole responsibility on climate legislation, which is primarily about setting up the mechanisms whereby we can meet sectoral ambitions, targets and so on in addressing the entire social requirements of the State.  We will have equality and fairness in mind in seeking a just transition but we cannot address the social inequality in our State solely through climate legislation.  That requires myriad legislative measures.</p></speech>

The Minister gave one definition of "in so far as is practicable" and I expect the Department could come up with many other definitions that would not be as motherhood and apple pie as the definition the Minister has given.  That is the crux of the problem.  The definition is too wide open and, for that reason, it has to be opposed.</p></speech>

The measures set out in the Bill rely for their implementation on speculative technology and there is no definitive statement that we will totally remove carbon.  The provisions are based on the expectation that, some time in the future, we will have technology that enables us to capture carbon, as well as using offsets and other market-based mechanisms.  That does not allow for an absolute commitment to reduce our emissions and remove carbon.</p><p>Our amendment places an emphasis on nature-based solutions, with no reliance on the purchase of carbon credits, offsets and other market-based mechanisms, or carbon capture and storage technology that is unproven as yet.  Many people are saying such technologies will be the way to go in the future, but we do not have the technology now.  We can only commit ourselves to what is currently possible.  Something that is speculative and twice removed from us is not sufficient and does not make this a robust Bill.  Moreover, the idea that we can purchase our way out of this crisis makes a nonsense of our commitment to reducing our emissions.  That is what this amendment seeks to address.</p></speech>

Such inclusion would not be appropriate as it would undermine the obligations contained in the Bill.  The legislation has been developed to focus on achieving obligations through emissions reductions and removals in the State, not by way of markets here or elsewhere, as provided for in the relevant definitions in respect of emissions and renewables. The measures set out in the Bill are technology neutral.  We do not know which technologies will be used and the Bill is not solely reliant or focused on, or solely referring to, any one technology.  Therefore, the legislation does not need to prohibit explicitly the use of offsetting or specify which technologies will or will not evolve in the coming years.</p></speech>

It is a very weak provision, which is why propose to insert the sentence in the amendment.  The Bill is very weak and while it does not exclude offsetting, it could, by definition, leave it in.  We should set about excluding offsets and carbon credits and remove any possibility of them being used to balance budgets.  After all, this is all about budgets rather than the actual mechanism.  We must ensure the budgets do not include market-based mechanisms.</p></speech>

We would have to almost re-establish it in legislation, which I would prefer not to do, as it would open up a whole new market.  Just to exclude it is not in the current proposals or approach.</p> <p>  With regard to the two aspects of this and the potential use of carbon capture and storage, CCS, I will be up-front and open to say that if CCS becomes a viable technology, we should consider it for industrial production, the storage of carbon or power generation.  It is less likely, however, because the economics of other alternatives are advancing quicker.  We should not exclude it, however.</p></speech>

The term does not necessarily mean that we reduce our carbon emissions.  It could mean that we find accounting mechanisms to do it.  This amendment spells out that we have to find nature-based solutions that mean we actually reduce our carbon emissions, rather than just balance a budget.  Again, it refers to the earlier point, but it should remain in the Bill to ensure we use nature-based solutions to sequester greenhouse gases and that we do not rely on the balancing of budgets, as this Bill is shaping up to do.</p></speech>

There are different interpretations of the concept of &quot;just transition&quot;.  Deputy Michael Collins hinted at this in his contribution.  All communities have to benefit and must be treated in a fair and equal way.  The point is that we are not starting from equality.  There is not equality right across society.  We are starting from different bases.</p><p>The discussion that most reflected this was on carbon taxes and the question of how they are implemented.  Carbon taxes, as they have been applied by the State, are exactly what we do not need.  This is not what just transition means.  It does not mean piling taxes on the people who can least afford it and ignoring those who benefit the most from the pollution and warming of the planet and leaving them untouched without having to pay their fair share.</p><p> Just transition should also look at how communities and workers are treated.  The Bord na M&oacute;na workers are a good case in point.  The Minister says they will be given jobs retrofitting and money will be put into retraining them but giving them minimum wage jobs in a recycling factory is not a just transition.  It does not tick the boxes.  This really has to be developed in a way that defines just transition as being central to how we implement it.  It is very obvious that we will not bring communities and workers with us, and we will not bring all that we need to bring with us, if we do not have this at its heart.  Many other amendments have been tabled on this and we should have a decent discussion on it.</p><p> The amendment covers decent, fair and high-value work, contributing to sustainable economic approaches and trying to undermine and eliminate poverty.  We will not do this by piling carbon taxes on the poor and letting the very wealthy fossil fuel industry and aviation industry off without paying their fair share.</p></speech>

This is one of the most important points we will speak about on Committee Stage.  It is fundamental to the principle and spirit of our climate ambition.  If the Bill does two things, they are to set interim and long-term targets and to set out a plan.  People need to see that their voices will be heard within it, that they will be considered and brought along, that this will not be just a case of more of the same, and that this will not confirm and firm up these positions.  The Minister can put whatever terms on them he wants.  We can call it the haves versus the have-nots, or those advantaged versus those disadvantaged.</p> <p>  A number of previous speakers have spoken on other amendments.  There is a real fear in communities about what the implications of climate action and the response to climate action mean.  We need to accept and acknowledge this as real and earnest.  Some of it is based on practical experience with regard to people struggling to heat their homes and pay their bills.  They are falling deeper and deeper into this scenario with the prospect, as they see it, of more of the same and worse to come.  The Bill needs to spell out that the Government and future governments have their backs.  It needs to spell it out in black and white because it is not there and there is deep concern about it.  There is an opportunity to improve on it and this is a way to do so.  If we do not do it, reasonable questions will be asked as to why not, legitimate concerns will not be allayed, and it will be a seriously missed opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.513" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#EE00300"><p>I also think this is one of the most important conversations on the Bill we will have.  The reality is that climate issues are not just about the environment.  They are part of a much broader issue and we cannot separate them out.  If we start dealing with environmental or climate issues separately to the economy, inequality and people's living standards we will not achieve what we need to achieve with the Bill.  We cannot leave people behind when we deal with the climate crisis.</p> <p>  We are at a crossroads.  We have an opportunity to use the Bill to meet our climate objectives and to create an environment we can all enjoy and live in.  If we do not do it right, there is a risk we will create a very divided Ireland where a portion of our communities are left behind.  If people are struggling to put a roof over their heads and food on their tables, climate issues and environmental issues will be the last thing on their minds and that is the reality.  Achieving the climate targets and the environment we need to move towards comes down to a cultural shift and a system shift.  We cannot do it unless we bring everyone along with us.  It is very important to ensure just transition is a component of the Bill.</p> <p>  The amendment I have tabled defines just transition and goes into what the principles are.  We need to have a conversation about what the just transition principles are.  Even during pre-legislative scrutiny, the officials stated that climate justice covers it.  It actually does not because it is a different concept.  It is a very broad concept but climate justice is more of an international global issue whereas just transition relates to Ireland and our workers and communities.  The first thing we need to do is to define it.</p> <p>  The Minister said we will not be able to deal with social inequalities in the Bill but we will have to address them because they are all part of the same thing.  We are all part of the same ecosystem.  We will not be able to deal with one issue without dealing with the other.  It is incredibly important that we incorporate this into the Bill.  This is an opportunity.  We can have it in the Bill and we can define it and have discussions on it.  We can look to countries such as Scotland which have done a very good job on this.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Other countries have done a lot of this work.  We could learn from what they have done.  Many of the amendments are pulling from international expertise.  We can look at this as an opportunity to right some of the wrongs and rebalance our communities and how we are living.  We have to incorporate it in the Bill.  It needs to be there as a guiding point of principle to give this direction.  Otherwise it will be forgotten.</p> <p>  I have had this conversation with the Minister previously when he introduced the waste policy.  People with disabilities had very limited consultation.  No one represented people in poverty when the policy was developed.  This needs a very holistic approach.  If we do not embed just transition in the framework of the Bill, we will not be able to take an holistic approach.  It is absolutely critical that we get this right and it has to go in at this point.  Earlier, the Minister mentioned that just transition is defined in the Bill but it is not.  It was one of the key recommendations of the committee.  We heard from many experts and the majority of them said we need to take the principles of just transition into account.</p> <p>  I tabled an amendment that was ruled out of order on the establishment of a just transition commission.  This should be looked at because the difficulty with just transition is that if we are not proactive on it, and if we put in place the framework for the climate targets and start putting restrictions on emissions but we have not considered just transition policies in parallel with this, we will have a very reactive transition and it will not be good.  We need to build just transition principles into the Bill now to make sure the processes happen at the same time.  I know the programme for Government includes a just transition commissioner.</p><p>However, there have been no details of how that will be implemented and no focus on it.  We will only get that focus if we incorporate the relevant provision into the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#FF00200"><p>On a procedural issue and to be fair to Deputy Pringle, these amendments seem very similar to the ones he tabled earlier.  I want to comment on them generally.  I am very strongly in favour of a role of just transition commissioner being established.  I am open to the Minister's view as to whether that would best be done through dedicated legislation.  During my time as Minister, we sought to establish the principle of just transition, albeit in the face of very significant changes that had to be managed, particularly those affecting the peat sector.  We appointed an interim just transition commissioner, who has done a really good job on much of the type of consultation that is set out in these amendments.  The interim commissioner supported new measures that will seek to develop substitute sectors and ensure people adversely affected by peat operation closures in the midlands, for example, will have access to accelerated retrofit programmes and measures to support community activity.  That principle, of both dialogue and a very active programme of supporting people who are impacted, is important.</p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith knows I do not agree with her on carbon pricing.  It is important to note that carbon price revenue has been used entirely to support people who have been adversely affected by carbon charges.  That was done through social welfare measures, including increases in the fuel allowance and accelerated implementation of the warmer homes scheme, which has a very significant impact through enabling people to avail of free retrofitting of their homes.  Carbon price revenue has also gone towards the restoration of peatlands and to support programmes of change in the midlands.</p> <p>  The principle behind these amendments is sensible.  We need to have a broader dialogue and my understanding is that the Minister is absolutely committed to such dialogue.  In fact, we will not succeed in bringing people with us on what is going to be a challenging journey unless we can have dialogue at various sectoral and community levels.  Some of these amendments reflect what is in the programme for Government.  However, I am quite open on how we should proceed.  I will accept it if the Minister considers that new legislation dealing with this issue in a more comprehensive way, with the capacity to have actions as well as simply expressing principles by way of a definition, is a better way to go.  We need an activist programme with access to resources and the sort of secretariat that would enable it to go beyond the work Kieran Mulvey has been doing so successfully on an interim basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#FF00300"><p>I agree with Deputy Bruton that what Mr. Mulvey and others have done in the midlands is a really good example of practical intervention on a just transition basis.  That work is far from complete and there is an urgency behind delivering some of the funding that has been allocated.  I recognise that, but what has been done is a start in the right direction.</p> <p>  The principles of just transition are embodied in this legislation in a whole variety of different ways, including in the provision for consultation that is contained within and throughout it.  We have already started that consultation in terms of the development of the new climate action plan and the enactment of legislation.  We have just completed a very significant climate conversation with the public in which more than 300 sectoral experts gave their perspective and views.  Approximately 3,500 Irish people have engaged directly with us.  That type of consultation is key and is provided for in various parts of the Bill.</p> <p>  As Deputy Whitmore said, there is a difference in terms of focus between climate justice and just transition.  Climate justice, by its nature, is focused on developing the emerging world and addressing the injustices occurring there because of climate change.  Definitions are important and legislation is about providing legal definitions.  While I cannot support the amendments, I absolutely agree with the need for decency, fairness and high-value work.  However, decency is not an easy thing for which to legislate.  Fairness is absolutely central but it is delivered by way of the tax system and investment delivered under the budget.  That is how we turn our objectives into reality.  The wording we have in the Bill and the principles that are stitched right through it, which come from a just transition perspective, are appropriate.  These amendments seek to define just transition but do not offer something better than what is already there.  Therefore, I cannot support them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#FF00400"><p>On the question of just transition and taxes, what is happening is an attempt to tax people's behaviour without making alternatives available to them.  Pushing up carbon taxes for ordinary people is pushing up their heating bills.  Some people have poorly insulated homes, by any standards, and cannot afford to have them retrofitted.  Bringing in the taxes first, without addressing that reality, is saying to people they must change their behaviour but offering them no alternatives.  Many ordinary people do not have alternatives to turning on the gas, lighting the fire or driving a diesel car up and down the roads because there is no proper public transport, particularly in rural areas.  That behaviour is being taxed while, at the same time, the newspaper headlines today refer to an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft that made &euro;315 billion in profit in this country last year but paid zero corporation tax.</p> <p>  Climate justice is about addressing that type of unfairness.  I was standing beside Deputy Bruton outside Leinster House when he was Minister and a group of young people shouted at him "System change, not climate change".  He smiled and said he agreed with them.  Where is the system change in allowing Microsoft not to pay any tax on its billions in profits while more and more money is taken from the poor to heat their homes or drive a smelly old diesel car because there is no bus that will take them around their locality?  Without looking at those issues, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not dealing with just transition.  We need to spell out what it means and have a proper definition.  If not, we are feeding into climate denial.  What starts with people complaining about having more money taken from them or saying this climate business is too heavy on farmers and rural communities turns into climate denial and leads to a very fractious society where we are not all in it together and are not pulling together.  There needs to be a broader definition of what is meant by just transition and how we can pay our way.  The axe has fallen very hard on the wrong sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060300002#FF00500"><p>The Minister is arguing that just transition is a difficult concept to define.  However, the Scottish Government has defined it.  There are a number of examples where other, similar countries have embedded it in their legislation.  The unions have come together and agreed a concept and principles, as have community organisations.  There is an onus on the Minister to reflect that in this Bill.</p> <p>  I agree with what the Minister and Deputy Bruton said regarding Kieran Mulvey, the interim just transition commissioner.  There has been great work done in this area but it relates only to the midlands.  The principles of just transition must be applied much more broadly than just to one particular region that has very specific issues.  My view is that new legislation will be required.  I tried to get a reference to a just transition commission into this Bill but I could not do it.  We need much more defined legislative provision for the establishment of a just transition commission and commissioner.  However, we do not have time to wait to nut out what the principles of just transition should be.  Those principles must be embedded in this Bill because it is what will govern our climate actions over the coming years.  We do not have two or three years to wait for additional legislation to put all of that in place.</p><p>As I said, we have to deal with just transition proactively.  We need to make sure we get in there with communities before the onus or burden of dealing with climate change is placed on them and in advance of placing requirements on them.  This is really important and not something we cannot have in this Bill.</p></speech>

Previous speakers covered what I wanted to say.  Scotland got it right; there is a whole section on just transition in its Bill.  Principles are something we need to stand over.  The whole committee agreed that just transition must be central to this.  We have to make sure that politically, morally, ethically and every which way, just transition is a major part of this Bill and nobody is left behind.  No other political generation has had to plan for what we are facing, which is basically a threat to the existence of humanity on our planet.  We are the legislators in place at this time.  If we do not make this part and parcel of the Bill, we will have absolutely failed.  I will not labour the point but as the children said, there is no planet B.  Just transition has to be at the heart of this Bill.</p></speech>

In that, the likes of the National Economic and Social Council and our social dialogue with other pillars, such as the environmental, farming, social and trade union sectors, will all be engaged in a much more detailed process to ensure we do not only focus on the midlands.  That work is ongoing and will be critical.  I share the belief of members of the committee that this is critical to the transition.  However, I keep coming back to the fact that the wording proposed in the amendments does not add to that.  The amendments do not add precision, legal strength or imperative and, therefore, I cannot support them.  We will stick with the definition and the reference to just transition throughout the Bill, but particularly in the new section 4(8)(k).</p></speech>

It also includes emissions that are produced by aviation and shipping.  When one thinks about it, we must take account of them because although they may not be attributable to any activity in this State, they do take place outside the State.  That was illustrated beautifully by the visits and campaigning we had here by Pennsylvanians, with Julie Dermansky, Mark Ruffalo and the rest of them telling us about their communities' experience with fracked gas and how it would be inappropriate for us to import it.  I acknowledge the Minister has made statements on this matter and that it will be discussed elsewhere but it equally would apply to non-territorial emissions emanating from aviation and shipping.  I am going to push this because it needs to be stated in the Bill.</p></speech>

I welcome that nature-based solutions have been incorporated in the Bill but it is important to define what we mean when talking about these things.  Many of these things are new concepts, such as the just transition, which is not a concept with which everyone is familiar.  Similarly, &ldquo;nature-based solutions&rdquo; is not a term with which everyone is familiar.  There is a risk with nature-based solutions that people could look to a stand of trees and think that it is a nature-based solution because it captures carbon.  However, when talking about nature-based solutions, they must also have environmental and biodiversity benefits.  Otherwise we may do more damage than we want.  This amendment sets out the definition of nature-based solutions, as a guiding principle and for indication in the Bill.</p></speech>

We defined them as enhancing biodiversity and that they seek to reduce or decrease, at the same time, the removal of greenhouse gas emission and support climate resilience in the State.  As that is the appropriate definition and location for the amendment, I cannot support this amendment but we have delivered on the intent in that change, which has already been drafted.</p></speech>

It is a definition of socioeconomic disadvantage.  Following on from our earlier discussions on the need for the Bill to be explicit in ensuring fairness and equity, there is a need for a definition of what disadvantage and socioeconomic disadvantage means, and the elements of it in terms of poverty, source of income, illiteracy, level of education, employment status or being a member of a disadvantaged group.  This amendment would add to the Bill and strengthen it by ensuring the Government is in a position to ensure that climate action is delivered in a fair way.</p></speech>

We have serious concerns about aspects of this Bill.  People in rural Ireland are struggling just to pay bills and put food on the table.  They are now being hit with this carbon tax, which will add a further &euro;100, &euro;150 or &euro;200 per year to a home heating oil bill.  There is no solution for ordinary working families because they will probably be above the income threshold and ineligible to receive favourable warmer home grants.  There are contractors who are worried they cannot afford to continue their daily work.  It is fine to say the country is tackling issues, but there are no solutions.  We will keep tabling amendments to create solutions.  We would appreciate it if the Minister considered supporting them or at least proposed solutions.  For example, people cannot use bales of briquettes from Ireland anymore but briquettes can be imported from abroad.  That is not a solution.  It is only a nod-and-wink exercise.  There are many other examples to which I could point.  I would appreciate it if this amendment was accepted.</p></speech>

This is an important issue.  I can see the fossil fuel industry using gas a way of trying to greenwash its activities.  I subscribe to an online publication, <i>Natural Gas World</i>.  When I first subscribed, it contained a considerable amount of information about the trading being done, petroleum, drilling for oil and so on.  That information hardly appears now.  It is all about gas, liquefied natural gas, LNG, and how various countries are building terminals and pipelines to dig for and move, ship or import gas.  It is all couched in environmentally friendly terms and gas is being presented as a green transitional fuel, but we must blow that myth out of the water, pardon the pun.</p><p>This is will be an important debate for us in any energy security review.  The argument is that, when we burn it, gas is less intensive than coal and we must therefore move to it as a better way of using energy.  However, this does not take into account the full life cycle of what we use, from where it begins to how it is drilled for, fracked and extracted and the impact of those operations on the environment wherever they happen on the planet, be it Malaysia, New Zealand, Russia or wherever.  All of these countries are trading in gas, including LNG, and encouraging more investment.  This is worrying.  As those who inhabit the planet, who have created this mess and who can do something about it, how are we going to change this situation if we promote gas as a transitional fuel in this manner?  I feel strongly about the amendment.</p></speech>

It will have a key role in providing backup for renewables, which is reflected in the wording of the amendment, but it cannot be seen as a long-term mainstay of our generation.  It will have a role in backing up renewables as we find and roll out new mechanisms and new storage systems.  However, the definition in the amendment would risk confusing the more important definition in the national climate objective, where we set out our key objective of delivering an environmentally sustainable and climate-neutral economy.  As such, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

By way of clarification, some claims are being made, disingenuously, that what we are trying to do is give agriculture a free pass.  Anyone who has any understanding of the English language would see quite clearly that this amendment states biogenic methane would be accounted for separately, not that it would be ignored altogether.  In fairness, both Deputy Bruton and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, have acknowledged it needs to be accounted for separately.  I do not believe the legislation here is strong enough in that regard and I believe agriculture will be left to carry the can for failures across other sectors of the economy.

One issue is that of planning permission for one-off houses for young people in rural Ireland.  It is becoming a complete nightmare.  More rules and regulations are being put in place that do not fit with the way of life in rural Ireland.</p><p>We want our rural communities to grow and prosper. Unfortunately, that is not happening on the ground at the moment.  It is the case that rural communities are being decimated by immigration and unemployment.  Droves of young people are leaving rural Ireland, heading to the bigger cities or abroad.  Those who want to live in rural Ireland are finding it almost impossible to live in their own communities due to all the rules and regulations that are being put before them.  They are finding it almost impossible financially to live in their own rural communities because of the expense of travel.  Public transport is an absolute disaster in my constituency.  It is the same in many constituencies in rural Ireland.  I have spoken to many other Deputies who have told me that, for example, a bus might stop at the door in the morning at 8 o'clock but there will not be another public transport service available until perhaps 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock that night.</p><p>Unfortunately, the way I see it, there is a two-tier society.  These amendments have been tabled in good faith to see if we can turn this around and live in an environmentally clean world or countryside.  However, things certainly need to change dramatically.  To us, if these amendments are not accepted, we will be worse off.  We are facing a crisis and a problem with Irish agriculture.  We know the crisis fisheries is facing, but in rural Ireland agriculture is going through an enormous crisis.  There is a possibility we could be facing a 50% cull in farm activities and animals if this climate action Bill reaches its goals by 2030.  That will have devastating consequences for rural Ireland.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot see that things are going to improve.  The recent announcement in respect of the results-based environment agri pilot, REAP, scheme is proof of that.  Any farmer who has heather on his or her land will be excluded from the programme.  It is an ideal opportunity to reward people who have environmentally friendly farms.  Unfortunately, it is going the other way.  They will be fined, which will lead them into further financial difficulties.  Many young farmers are scratching their heads.  They do not know how they are going to put food on the table for their families or how they are going to live.  Grants are getting smaller, not bigger.  Unfortunately, anything that is coming up is not contributing to the survival of family-run farms.</p><p>I plead with the Minister to give serious consideration to these amendments.  Perhaps he can support them for what they seek to achieve.  They are seeking to ensure we secure young family farms.  They are seeking to ensure young men and women who want to build a one-off house in their community and live their life in a rural community can be fully supported in doing so.  There are many people who come to work and live in rural communities - they could be teachers or nurses - and who cannot get planning permission to build a one-off house to live in those communities.  At the same time, when I come to the city, I see there is transport, houses and high-rise buildings beyond belief.  There is no issue with planning in certain places.</p><p>Our amendment is very genuine.  I hope it is seen in the best light by the Minister.  It is an ideal opportunity for him to add these amendments into the legislation.  Then at least we will be seen to be working on a level playing field on which we can all agree to work.  As I said, we were careful in our approach to these amendments to ensure they were fair in every way possible.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on the amendments.  We expect he might support them.</p></speech>

This afternoon we are dealing with Supplementary Estimates for the Public Service.  Members will be aware that the D&aacute;il order that the Revised Estimates for the Public Service in respect of the following Votes would be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 27 - international co-operation and Vote 28 - Department of Foreign Affairs.  Today's meeting of the select committee will consider these Estimates.</p> <p>  On behalf of Members of the select committee I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, Deputy Brophy.  The officials accompanying them are Mr. John Conlan, chief financial officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ms Siobhan Byrne, the director of the Passport Service, who is known to this committee and Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, the director general of the development co-operation and Africa division, who again was with the committee recently.  I thank the team of departmental officials for the comprehensive briefing material provided to the committee and for the ongoing attention and very positive relationship with the committee on items we discuss on a weekly basis.</p> <p>  The proposed format for today's meeting is that the committee will deal with Votes 27 and 28 under the relevant programmes.  At the outset of consideration I will invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to give an overview on Vote 28, outlining pressures likely to impact on his Department's expenditure regarding the Vote for the remainder of this year, 2021.  The floor will then be open for questions from Members for each of the programmes.  I ask that Members put their questions on a specific programme so that we can progress in an orderly and efficient manner.  I also ask Members to be conscious of the time constraints.  Members will be aware that on the previous occasion when we discussed Estimates we were in some way challenged towards the end of the meeting in terms of having questions addressed.  We are operating under Covid time constraints.</p> <p>  When we have completed consideration of Vote 28, I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to make an opening statement and we will proceed to consider programmes under Vote 27.  I remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#A00500"><p>I appreciate having the opportunity to do this.  I am pleased to be here this afternoon to present the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2021.  As you said, Chairman, I will focus on Vote 28, the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs, and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will address the committee after that on Vote 27.  Members are aware that there is considerably more money involved in the international co-operation vote than in the foreign affairs Vote.</p> <p>  Members will have seen the advance briefing notes provided by my Department on the two Votes, which summarise the main activities and priorities under each expenditure programme.  For 2021, the overall gross estimate for the foreign affairs group of Votes, which is Votes 27 and 28, is &euro;807 million.  This represents a &euro;30 million increase on the 2020 allocation.  For 2021, the total gross expenditure allocation for Vote 28, including a capital allocation of &euro;10.5 million, is &euro;281 million.  This is an overall increase of just over &euro;10 million or 4%.  This increase has been allocated to programmes to assist the Department in meeting the many challenges and opportunities we face in the coming year.</p> <p>  The Vote 28 priorities for this year include: the next phase of the passport reform programme; protecting our interests in a post-Brexit EU; Northern Ireland; maximising our position on the UN Security Council; the continued expansion of the overseas mission network under the Global Ireland 2025 initiative; provision for urgent capital building and security works in our network of missions abroad and; continuing investment in the Department's global ICT network.  My Department, and our mission network around the world, plays a critical role in promoting and advancing Ireland's interests through our international engagement,and will provide international support to the Government's economic recovery plan announced on Tuesday.  This is more important than ever as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic.  We will continue to strengthen our  global presence, to ensure Ireland is ready to take advantage of new markets and opportunities and to continue to support our citizens and communities abroad.  As has been proposed, I will now proceed to make a short introductory comment on each of the programmes in sequence.</p> <p>  Programme A relates to our people.  Programme A, which has an allocation of &euro;85.3 million, covers many key policy areas for my Department, including consular services and assistance, the Passport Service, our emigrant support programme and Northern Ireland.  As Members might expect, some of the services have been put under a lot of pressure this year.  Others to date have not been, such as the Passport Office, but we expect significant pressure in that office as international travel resumes.  I can provide a detailed response if required.  The Passport Service and the provision of consular services and assistance lies at the heart of the Department's engagement with citizens.  This was clearly demonstrated during 2020, when the Department provided advice and assisted thousands of citizens across the world to return safely to Ireland or gave them advice on what to do in connection with international travel.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Passport Service scaled up to more normal operational levels on 4 May 2021.  At that time, approximately 89,000 passport applications were on hand.  The Passport Office has processed approximately 45% of these applications, which works out at more than 42,000 passports.  Of the remainder, 70% are awaiting further action from the applicant, such as a new photograph or supporting documents.  With the full resumption of services, the Passport Service is issuing around 25,000 passports each week, which is a lot.  We are very focused on that.  During the month of May we issued more than 81,000 passports, which is a dramatic increase on the position in recent months.  By the end of quarter 2 this year, the passport online service for all application types will be available for 97% of applicants worldwide.  With this continued expansion, it is vital that the highest possible standards are maintained in security and service delivery.  The 2021 allocation includes a capital allocation of &euro;3.5 million, to be focused on the updating of the passport operating system.</p> <p>  The 2021 allocation for the emigrant support programme remains at the same level as it was in 2020, which is &euro;12.6 million, underlining the importance the Government attaches to supporting and deepening our bonds with our vibrant and diverse global Irish community.</p><p>I commend the work of my colleague Minister of State Brophy in this important area in his role as the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, and he will take any questions later on these matters.</p><p> This programme also deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation, and British-Irish relations, which are a particular emphasis of my Department now.  My Department remains focused on strengthening our relationship with the UK in the post-Brexit context.  I visited London in April, and I will travel there again immediately after this meeting, as it happens, for further meetings tonight and tomorrow.  I look forward to participating in the British-Irish Council summit and a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference later this month.  In July, we will open a consulate general in Manchester for the north of England.  The Government has committed to providing &euro;5 million in funding in 2021 to support the International Fund for Ireland&rsquo;s programmes.  Funding for the peace and reconciliation fund has also been increased significantly to &euro;5 million, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to building cross community reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in the Border regions more generally.</p><p> The focus of my work under programme B, which is concerned with Our Place in Europe and accounts for an allocation of &euro;36.5 million, will be to safeguard Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the broader context of Brexit and the future direction and policies of the European Union.  It will also support Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU&rsquo;s global engagement on peace, security, trade and development, as well as security in the wider European region.  Programme B is also used to fund projects and proposals which further Ireland&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, priorities, support EU engagement and support the placing of Irish personnel in EU and international institutions.  These projects have a very positive impact on Ireland&rsquo;s profile internationally with respect to our key foreign policy objectives, and can help to shape and implement EU policies that work for Ireland.</p><p> The majority of current expenditure under programme C, which has an allocation of &euro;56 million and is concerned with Our Values, consists of contributions to international organisations.  The allocation set aside for these contributions, at &euro;34 million, is at the same level as last year.  We make a broad range of commitments under this heading to international organisations, predominantly UN bodies, concerned with areas such as refugees, healthcare and education, for example.  Another key pillar of our international engagement under programme C is our input into the shaping and formulation of the EU&rsquo;s CFSP, most notably at the monthly meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, in which I participate. </p><p> Programme D, concerning Our Prosperity and which has an allocation &euro;44 million, will focus in 2021 on assisting Irish businesses in the context of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and as we emerge from the pandemic.  The programme also includes a capital allocation of &euro;500,000 towards Expo 2020 in the United Arab Emirates, UAE, which is now set to run from October 2021 to the end March 2022.  We will continue to intensify our collaboration and co-operation with other Departments and State agencies, to ensure that we are effective and responsive to the needs and expectations of our citizens and our business sector.  Our annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme also comes under this expenditure allocation and this year, in partnership with other Departments and State agencies, we delivered a virtual programme, including more than 80 virtual receptions.  They ended up having an extraordinary reach online on social media and video platforms and there are some real lessons to be learned from that experience for the future.   </p><p> Finally, programme E, which has an expenditure allocation of &euro;48.7 million to cover activities under the heading of Our Effectiveness, covers the management and development of staff, the management and mitigation of risk, ICT, property management and compliance with statutory and legal obligations.  The programme also covers communication by the Department of its policies, objectives and activities to citizens at home and abroad. </p><p> That is a very quick overview of the main foreign affairs activities and priorities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Defence for the year.  I welcome comments and questions from committee Members on any of the foreign affairs policy programmes and the broader work of the Department, which I assure the committee is very busy.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  I will touch on some specific areas and while there may be a little crossover between the areas of the Minister and the Minister of State, I will try my best to remain focused on Vote 28 for now.  I commend all the work that has been and is being done by the Department.  It has been an extremely busy year.  I commend all the staff for their Trojan work.  The example of the Passport Office highlighted the great challenges involved in trying to keep a system in place despite the impact of the public health restrictions.  I congratulate and thank everyone for all their efforts.</p> <p>  Mentioning the passport issue, and in the context of the continuing and expected numbers of applications for passports from people in the North, especially post-Brexit, does the Minister have updated figures in that regard?  Many in society in the North, including my party colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, have repeatedly asked about the possibility of opening a passport office in the North, maybe in Belfast.  Are there such plans?  If not, will the Minister and his Department examine establishing such an office in the North?  The figures I received previously indicated that there is a major demand for such an office.  </p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, may touch on the issue of the diaspora later, but I will ask one question in this area now.  The new President of the United States, Joe Biden, has Irish connections and is very proud of them.  In that context, what approaches and discussions have occurred so far regarding undocumented Irish immigrants in the US?  Is it likely that a deal of some sort will be put in place to ensure that those people can regularise their status in America?  We do not need to reiterate the great difficulties undocumented Irish people living in the US have faced for many years.  </p> <p>  Moving to the situation in the North, unionism now has new leaders.  I congratulate the new leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP.  However, there is a crisis within unionism in the North.  Historically, unionists have sought to find a route out of internal conflict through the manufacture of some sort of external crisis, and that nearly always comes at the expense of nationalists.  Unfortunately, issues have arisen regarding the Northern Ireland protocol and the positions taken towards it by the unionist parties.  The situation has escalated because the DUP is now boycotting the North-South Ministerial Council.  I ask the Minister to comment on the backtracking on commitments regarding key institutions such as that council.  </p> <p>  On the subject of the United Nations Security Council, the Minister recently and rightly expressed his disappointment concerning the events in Gaza and the failure by the Security Council to even agree a statement concerning the killing of civilians in Gaza.  It was ten or 11 days before the Security Council came to some sort of agreement on issuing a statement.  Last week, the D&aacute;il passed an historic vote in respect of recognising that an illegal annexation has taken place in the Occupied Territories.</p><p>Obviously, declaring that Israel has broken international law is an important step.  What are the Minister's intentions now to articulate the position taken by the Irish Parliament and the rationale behind it in respect of the Security Council?  He might give a little more detail because while it is a welcome step, on its own it is meaningless unless we are willing and prepared to articulate our position and go forward in respect of the consequences for Israel of breaking international law.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on that.</p><p> As for overseas missions, I welcome the move to establish consular services in Manchester.  I think the Minister mentioned Manchester but I am happy to stand corrected.</p><p> There is also a commitment to reopen the Irish Embassy in Iran.  That is a hugely important move and one I have called for previously, as have many other people, so I welcome that.  We as a country have significant responsibilities in respect of the establishment of the Iran nuclear deal.  The Minister recently met the Iranian President and foreign minister.  Could I ask the Minister for a brief update on the nuclear deal?  Could I ask him to pass comment specifically on Israel in respect of any future deal?  I think there have been reports recently that Israel is prepared to abandon its bilateral approach with the US and to take unilateral action against Iran if a deal is reached.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p><p> I have a lot of other questions, mostly referring to Vote 27, I think, so I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>

I ask that questions relating to the diaspora, with particular reference to the undocumented in the US, be left for the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, with perhaps just a brief comment from the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I am conscious of the time because I want to allocate at least three quarters of an hour to Vote 27 for the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy.  I call Deputy Cowen, to be followed by Deputy Stanton.</p></speech>

Regarding the ICT issue, is the Minister happy that the Department is cyber-safe, bearing in mind the recent cyberattack?  Has anything been put aside to deal with that issue?  Could the Minister say a bit more about the Fulbright Commission?  Specifically, could he comment on the situation regarding J1 visas, relating to international education between Ireland and America?  Students in Ireland are finding it difficult at the moment to get J1 visas to travel to the United States.  Can the Minister offer any hope or throw any light on this issue as to when it might change?  Will he comment on any interaction he has had with the Americans on the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.629" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#C00500"><p>I will deal with Deputy Brady's questions first.  Regarding the Passport Office in Northern Ireland, the truth is that the vast majority of passport applications now are submitted online, so the physical presence of a printing press and where it is located are not anything like as relevant as they were before, when people had to come into the Passport Office and fill out forms to get their passports.  It is now very much an online process, and I think considerably more than 90% of applications now are submitted online.  Members might be interested to know that before this meeting I had a good briefing on the Passport Office because I was anxious to make sure I could give the committee accurate numbers and a sense of what is happening weekly.  Last week, for example, 16,435 applications came in.  That is the figure for renewals of passports and applications for new ones.  The Department issued 20,689 passports in the same week, so we are issuing more passports than we are getting applications.  That said, there are still just over 93,000 applications in the system.  At the moment we are meeting our target for the number of adult applications for renewal done within ten days.  Some of them are done in a considerably shorter time than that.  We are setting ourselves a target that if you are an adult applying for a passport renewal, you will get your passport back within ten days.  Children are more complicated in respect of the security and verification issue, but we think that by the end of next month we will have our ten-day benchmark turnaround time implemented for all renewals and new applications for both adults and children.  That is pretty impressive, given the fact that we have had to ramp up in recent months from almost a drip-feed of applications coming through to now doing, as I said earlier, 81,000 in the month of May.  I expect we will issue about 25,000 passports a week or something close to that as we move into this period now when many people are planning for a reopening of international travel.  I think that will remind people to look at their passports maybe for the first time in 18 months and all of a sudden we will find that many people want passports renewed quickly.  That will put us under pressure but we are gearing up for that in a serious way.  I want to put on the record that the staff and the team working in the Department have been phenomenal when it comes to passports.  This is a difficult environment to work in in the context of Covid restrictions, with many people working in very close proximity in big open-plan offices.  We have everybody back working now, and I just wanted to put on the record my thanks to them for that.  It has been a huge effort.  They are working from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. on shifts to try to get on top of the passport issue, which we know will ramp up significantly.</p> <p>  We are watching Northern Ireland closely.  During the past 18 months or so, during Covid, a significant proportion of the passport applications have come from the UK and from Northern Ireland.  That balance is now changed somewhat as many people in the Republic of Ireland want to get their passports renewed.  We will keep that option open.  At the moment the focus is, I think, on delivery through the systems and platforms we currently have.  There is no problem for anyone in Northern Ireland looking to get a passport or a passport renewal through the online system.  It is very efficient.  We also have a call line.  To give the committee a sense of the numbers of people we are dealing with in terms of customer service in this call centre, the passport service is currently interacting with up to 10,000 customers each week.  Our phone service for citizens has been considerably scaled up to complement the web chat service, which we encourage people to use and which has operated throughout the pandemic.  This is a very busy part of my Department and is doing a really good job in what have been quite difficult circumstances in recent months.</p> <p>  I will let the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, deal primarily with the issue of the diaspora.  Regarding the issue of the undocumented that Deputy Brady raised, we have worked and continue to work to look at options that are available in Washington, particularly in Congress and in the Senate, to try to help undocumented Irish in the United States.  As the committee will know, we have been working with proposals on an E3 visa system.  I do not need to go into all the detail of that but it remains a focus of ours.  There are many friends of Ireland helping us on Capitol Hill, and that is important.</p> <p>  We have a very good relationship developing with the new US Administration.  I met both Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan as they travelled through Shannon.</p><p>One was on the way to the Middle East.  The other was on his way home.  It shows the strategic benefit sometimes of having that Shannon stopover available.  At times, it really opens up a helpful line of communication.  I impressed upon the Secretary of State the importance of a US special envoy to Northern Ireland and I think they have very much taken that on board.  I spoke to Jake Sullivan about that in some detail and I think that will be a message that is passed on directly to the White House.  Given the changing nature of politics in Northern Ireland, the polarisation that is there, the vulnerability there and the complexity in the context of the Protocol, Brexit and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, it would be a good strategic move to have a special envoy to Northern Ireland at this moment in history, and which I think would be useful.<br/><br/>In do not want to get into commenting on unionism or unionist parties.  I would just say I had a very good dialogue with the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, yesterday.  It was a direct straight-talking meeting, as one would expect.  I wished Doug Beattie well.  I think he is a very able politician and I look forward to working with him.  The new leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, is likely to meet the Taoiseach shortly and I expect that I will be meeting him, as leader of the DUP, shortly as well.  Of course, we will have an opportunity to meet on other occasions as well in the weeks ahead - I mentioned the British-Irish Council, BIC, earlier.<br/><br/>In terms of the North-South Ministerial Council, we can work on making sure that we get the North-South Ministerial Council back up and running.  Both unionist leaders have said that it is their desire to have a good working relationship with the Government in Dublin and certainly we are in that space as well in terms of trying to make sure that we can make North-South Ministerial Council meetings work effectively.  It is a really important pillar of the Good Friday Agreement and the institutions - North-South co-operation on a regular basis.<br/><br/>In terms of the UN Security Council, I expected Deputy Brady to raise the Middle East peace process.  Anyone who knows me knows that I have had a long-standing interest in this issue, have been to the region many times and hope to go there many more times.  I, the D&aacute;il and the Government felt that Ireland needed to be clear and vocal in relation to what we were seeing in the latest round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians.  There was an unacceptably high loss of life of children and civilian populations.  I was very vocal about that.  I think it is Ireland's job on the Security Council to call out what we would regard as breaches of international law and where there are concerns, we call them out even if that makes for an uncomfortable political space at times.  We called it out on both sides.  Firing rockets from Gaza into civilian populations is completely unacceptable, is a breach of international law and needs to be utterly condemned, and is not justified under any circumstances, but also the military force that was used on a population in Gaza also needed to be called out, and was by me and the Government.  I refer to the motion that we put down in relation to recognising the scale, the extent, the pace and the strategic nature of the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, in particular, close to East Jerusalem.  It is difficult to interpret such action as anything but <i>de facto</i>annexation because of the permanent nature of that infrastructure and the growing population living in settlements on the West Bank now.  It was a reflection of our assessment of what is happening on the ground, and working with many others who were also following that.<br/><br/>Let me be very clear.  I want to have a strong and positive diplomatic relationship with others, unlike some who want to expel the Israeli ambassador and want nothing to do with Israel.  Theirs is not the position of the Government.  We believe that the way forward to achieve a peace agreement, a historic peace agreement that can last between Palestinians and Israelis, is to engage with both sides, bluntly and honestly.  There will be times when we strongly disagree with the approach of one side or the other, and we will call that out, but I will certainly continue to adopt the approach of speaking to both sides, honestly and with an open mind.  I think that is the right thing to do, despite calls for me to take a very different approach, that, I think, would be seen internationally as one-sided and therefore limit my ability to be seen as a credible voice on these complex issues.  Let me tell Deputy Brady that I intend on being very much involved, at a UN level and an EU level, in trying to break a political cycle that has continued to deliver misery, hatred, violence and death for far too long.  We have to find a way of breaking that cycle and moving towards a more progressive peace negotiation that can result in two states that are safe, security and, ultimately, prosperous in the future.<br/><br/>In terms of overseas missions, just so that the committee will know the extent of the project of expansion of the Department of Foreign Affairs footprint on behalf of Ireland, we have in the past couple of years opened new embassies or representation in Cardiff, Monrovia, Santiago, Bogot&aacute;, Vancouver, Amman in Jordan, Mumbai, Wellington, Frankfurt and Los Angeles, LA.  This year, we are moving ahead with Rabat, Kyiv, Manila and Manchester.  The cycle continues.  We are strategically opening up, developing and investing in footprints in parts of the world where Ireland has an interest, needs to have a strategic voice and can avail of significant opportunities for diplomatic relations, partnerships and trade.  We will continue on that project, which is project Ireland 2025, to double our overall global impact in terms of standing and voice.<br/><br/>Finally, in relation to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, which is the Iranian nuclear deal, some people have asked the question, what is an Irish foreign minister doing heading off to Tehran for the first time in 20 years and a few weeks later, inviting an Iranian foreign minister to Dublin for what were fairly substantive discussions.  The reason for that primarily is that we have a specific responsibility on the UN Security Council.  We are the country that is the facilitator for the resolution that is the basis for the Iranian nuclear deal.  We are committed to trying to ensure that that deal gets rebuilt and committed to because a number of years ago then US President Trump moved away from it in a robust way which obviously had a serious consequence.  Ultimately, it is our belief that the world would be a safer place if we have the Iranian nuclear deal in place which provides as many guarantees as we can put in place that Iran is not developing and will not develop a nuclear weapon through robust and transparent international inspections and in return the international community is willing to remove sanctions that would otherwise have been in place in the absence of that deal.  In our view, that makes sense for Iran.  It makes sense for the United States, who are a big partner in this, and for the other parties to the JCPOA who are also committed to rebuilding this agreement.  I would not overplay our role in encouraging Iran back to that negotiating table, and, indeed, others too, but it certainly has been a factor.  That is the story of the Security Council - taking on awkward issues and speaking to people who one may have a strong difference of opinion with in many areas.  It is taking on the role of an international credible country that is involved in big debates and big discussions on big global issues.  This is certainly one of them and that is what we are doing.</p><p>Over time, I inform Deputy Brady, we will re-open an embassy in Tehran, probably in 2023 and in the short term we will have a representation there on the premises of the German embassy.  Most European countries have embassies in Tehran.  We will have a presence on the ground to ensure that we are fully informed and have channels of communication open where necessary and appropriate.</p><p> On Israel&rsquo;s concerns about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, there are also a number of countries who have real concerns about this and whether they can trust Iran as regards the threat of a nuclear weapon.  Israel is obviously to the fore in that.  I do not want to make any further comment on that apart from saying that any country has the right to defend itself if it feels it is threatened.  As long as that happens within the framework of international law, that is a matter for Israel and for, hopefully, a new government which looks like it is developing in Israel in the past 24 hours but we will have to wait and see what happens in that regard because Israeli politics can be unpredictable.</p><p> On passport applications from Northern Ireland, I can provide the statistic to members that in 2020 we received 40,000 such applications representing 10% of the total number of 2020 applications.  Some 40,000 such applications is a big number.</p><p> Addressing Deputy Stanton, we are very conscious on the ICT issue that given what has happened in our health system and the cyber attack there that our systems need to be very robust and well protected in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Much private and sensitive information is passing to this Department on a regular basis as is the case for that matter with the Department of Defence.  We are regularly testing our ICT systems to ensure that they are robust.  We have had attempts by people to try to access our system in the Department of Foreign Affairs which is not something that I like to say but it is reality.  I suspect that there is not a foreign office in the world, and certainly not in the western world, that has not had regular attempts to hack into their system.  We need to ensure that our systems are robust in that regard.  I believe that they are but one can never be complacent in this space.</p><p> I am pleased to inform the committee that my Department continues to support the Fulbright Commission in Ireland to further education exchange between the United States and Ireland.  We have maintained a commitment of &euro;404,000 for 2021.  The work of the commission has benefited more than 2,000 Irish and US citizens in the areas of scientific research, applied research and the arts in the past four years.  With increased funding for my Department, the Fulbright Commission in Ireland has expanded in the talent that it reaches, bringing in more diverse fields of scholarship such as technology and cyber.  This year 31 Irish Fulbright awardees have been selected for the 2021-2022 season.  We recognise Fulbright as the pre-eminent exchange programme between Ireland and the US and it plays an essential role in building transatlantic understanding and fostering extraordinary academic and people-to-people links, which I wish to clearly state as it is important.  </p><p>The news is not as positive on the J1 Visa issue.  In truth, because of travel restrictions this is effectively not happening.  The US Embassy is primarily focused on facilitating US nationals returning to the US and managing the restrictions linked to Covid-19.  I hope that we will see that change in the weeks and months ahead as Ireland and the EU opens up on the basis of a structured Covid-19 certification system.  As Ireland does that from 19 July, we will also look to not only opening up international travel for EU countries and for Irish people within the EU but also for the UK and US on the basis of people travelling with a full vaccination or having recovered from having Covid-19 in the past nine months.  People who are not vaccinated will still probably have to have polymerase chain reaction, PCR, tests before they travel and may be required to quarantine as well although not in hotel quarantine unless, of course, a significant variant of concern issue emerges that we have not seen yet.  I would certainly like to see and I am confident that there will be a situation  that when we open up to EU travel that we will also be opening for people who are vaccinated.  We must not forget that the vast majority of adults in the UK and in the US will be fully vaccinated by the time we reach 19 July and as the summer moves on, just as the vast majority of people here will have been, I am glad to say.</p><p> I believe that deals with all of the questions.</p></speech>

In the context of programme C and values, the Minister mentioned contributions made to international organisations, predominantly the UN and issues surrounding refugees, healthcare and so forth, in the context of our membership of the UN Security Council, allied to our programme for government commitment, which, thankfully, seeks to support UN institutions, including the support of the democratisation and human rights, and also in the context of representations that have been made to me, what priority has the Department given to advance what appears to be the very recent UN report findings that genocide was committed in Iraq by ISIS against the Yazidi community?  I also ask this in the context of a recent speech by the Irish UN ambassadors at the UN report launch.  Can the Minister elaborates on this and perhaps he might engage with us and give us some indication of the priority in funding towards those institutions commitments to democratisation and human rights, please?</p></speech>

When reverting to the Minister, I acknowledge in terms of consular service and assistance the tremendous role being played across the world by our diplomats and those involved in the front line of consular services, with particular reference to Irish citizens who may find themselves for many reasons facing some challenges and difficulties.  Can I ask the Minister in that regard if there has been a visible impact in expenditure on emergency consular service in the light of Covid-19 and is that reflected in the numbers over the past year?</p> <p>  Before I hand over to the Minister I notice that Deputy Stanton has a further question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#E00500"><p>Very briefly and I thank the Chairman, I support my colleague, Deputy Cowen, on his points about the Hazidi community.  I have met some of these people in the past and what they have experienced is unspeakable in many ways.  I support the Deputy in what he has just said there and I will listen with interest to the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.636" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#E00600"><p>First of all, on Deputy Cowen's question and Deputy Stanton's support for it, for us to essentially accept that something is a genocide, Ireland's approach to that question is that this is one that is asked in multiple conflict situations, whether it is in respect of Armenia, or various different conflicts in Africa at different times, or indeed parts of the Middle East.   The approach we have taken is that Ireland recognises genocide and calls it as such under the precedent and on the back of an international court ruling or if an international consensus builds around a certain issue.  I understand that that is not ideal on a number of levels.</p><p>First, it is often not possible for an international court to determine whether genocide took place because of the burden of proof required.  Second, the international consensus issue is often problematic because of political interest, different perspectives and regional interests on the Security Council.  </p><p> I take the point in relation to the Yazidi population, which has been targeted and treated in an appalling fashion.  If both Deputies want to follow up with a meeting on that, we can maybe look at whether we can do more in that area.  Iraq is in a vulnerable place with a government trying to find its feet.  There is still a significant presence of foreign troops there.  If we can do more to support the organisations linked with the assessment of what happened to the Yazidi population and how it should be categorised or with humanitarian assistance, I am open to that.  We have a flexible aid budget.  We have to prioritise within it because it is an endless ask but if members want me to focus more on that, I would be happy to do so.  I will follow up with Deputy Cowen on it.  Maybe we can have a meeting on it and I will get a more detailed briefing.</p><p> Our consular services will say they have never had an 18 months like we have just been through.  Thousands of Irish people needed assistance and support to understand their options for returning home and navigating their way through Covid restrictions in different parts of the world. That is particularly the case in Australia and New Zealand, where difficult choices are faced by Irish citizens because, once they come home, the chances of them going back, in terms of jobs and career opportunities, have been very limited in the short term due to restrictions.   In other parts of the world, we have had to charter planes to get people home or work with the UK or other EU countries to share the chartering of planes.  We chartered a plan out of Nigeria, a plane out of Peru and we have been in partnership with other countries in chartering planes out of India.</p><p> Our consular services have been heroic in quietly getting on with the job.  There has been somewhat of an increase in resources there but most recent increases have been linked to the Passport Office.  We do not have the option to shift huge numbers of new people into consular services.  We put many people who would otherwise have been working in the Passport Office into our consular services to run call centres.  Applications for passports were dramatically down so we had people we could shift into consular services.  Over the Christmas period last year, we essentially had a travel call centre.  We banned all commercial flights between Britain and Ireland.  Instead, we did a deal with Aer Lingus and, predominantly, Ryanair to fly Irish residents home on a chartered schedule each day.  My Department acted as a travel agency and our consular team were under huge pressure through the Christmas period on the phones. </p><p> The reason we are not seeing a big increase in expenditure is that we effectively shifted resources into consular services from passport services.  That has not resulted in a Revised Estimate but it meant that the our consular team grew significantly.  As consular cases fall back, international travel opens again and we get more demand in your Passport Office, people have shifted back to the passport service.</p><p> We ended up also effectively running a call centre for mandatory hotel quarantine.  That is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health but the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs have played a big part in ensuring it works efficiently around information call centres, standards in security and making sure everything is being done as it should be.  That involves Defence Forces presence in airports, hotels and the transport systems between them.  This is a Government effort and the year we have been through was so out of the ordinary that we have had to be flexible.  There have been some increases in pay and administration but they have not been as marked as one might think because we have been able to shift resources within the Department.</p></speech>

The Minister and I have spoken on the floor of the Chamber about declaring that other genocides have taken place, namely in Armenia.  We disagree on how we come to the finding that a genocide has or has not taken place.</p> <p>  On 15 June, we have representatives from the Yazidi community before the committee.  It would be important to proceed with the meeting and listen to what they have to say.  Maybe at that point we can communicate directly with the Minister.  We need to do more, in view of the finding that genocide was committed.  When I asked the Minister about the Government acknowledging and recognising that the Armenian genocide took place, following numerous countries that have done so, he said he would talk to his officials, look at the position adopted to this point and maybe review it.  While it would be difficult to get findings of guilt in court or anything like that, there is a lot of historical evidence showing genocide happened against the Armenian people.  Hence, many countries, including quite recently the US, have come out and said genocide did take place.  It is important to call these things out in the hope it will help in future instances to stop genocides taking place.</p> <p>  We have to wait until 15 June for our Yazidi meeting to see what actions we need to take and then follow up with the Minister.  I ask for the Minister's response on the Armenian genocide.</p></speech>

We have a wide-ranging meeting with telecoms booked with the UK, Ireland and beyond.</p><p>Will the Minister bring these matters to a conclusion, with reference to Deputy Brady's final question?  Perhaps he might have some closing remarks before we prepare to conclude the discussion on Vote 28.  We can then hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Colm Brophy.</p></speech>

Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief.  Many diverse communities, including Christians and Yazidis, have ancient roots in Iraq.  The EU's Iraq strategy addresses reconciliation and the preservation of Iraq's ethnic and religious diversity.  Full implementation of Iraq's programme for national reconciliation will be important to avoid inflaming sectarian divisions.  We welcome the recent passing by the Iraqi Parliament of a Yazidi female survivors law, which represents progress in addressing the legacy of ISIS crimes against Yazidi and other minority groups.</p> <p>  A UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/ISIL, UNITAD, was established by Resolution 2379 (2017).  It requests the Secretary General to establish an investigative team, headed by a special adviser, Mr. Karim Khan, to support domestic efforts to hold ISIS accountable by collecting, preserving and storing evidence in Iraq of acts that might amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Iraq.  The head of UNITAD reports directly to the UN Security Council.</p> <p>  In June 2020, Mr. Khan told the Security Council the team had already identified 344 alleged ISIS perpetrators involved with the 2014 massacre of Yazidis in the Sinjar district of northern Iraq.  UNITAD also welcomed a draft Iraqi law, presented in November 2019, which would allow Iraq to prosecute acts committed by ISIS as genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.  The primary responsibility for investigating crimes normally lies with the host government and UNITAD is helping to build the capacity of the Iraqi authorities to investigate these crimes and prosecute those responsible.</p> <p>  The most recent UNITAD report, from November 2020, noted the team had commenced the provision of training and support to Iraqi investigative judges in building case files for the prosecution of ISIS members for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  Ireland strongly supports the work of UNITAD and will support its mandate at the Security Council if and when it arises.</p> <p>  Irish Aid gives &euro;9.5 million to the Iraq humanitarian fund.  We are making a contribution.  I am sorry for the long answer but I know colleagues are interested in and concerned about that matter.</p> <p>  I will come back to Deputies on the Armenia issue.  I said we would take a look at it and I thought we had a very good and mature debate on it and there was no evidence of party politics.  There were some genuine concerns raised and I said we would take a look at it, which we will.</p> <p>  The truth is our Estimates are relatively straightforward in the work we do and foreign policy is much more complicated.  The committee will speak next to the Minister of State who is responsible for the spending of much money that keeps many people alive, educates many young children and supports many very vulnerable communities.  The Irish Aid programme is respected across the world as one of the most transparent, efficient, effective and impactful aid programmes of any country.  We repeatedly get peer-reviewed and very positive feedback from those peer reviews relating to the impact on the most vulnerable people, or the furthest behind, to use a UN term.  That is how Irish Aid is measured in the work it is doing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, can deal with those matters as he is more than capable of doing that.  I hope people are happy to allow the Estimates for Vote 28 to move ahead.</p></speech>

Vote 27 funds approximately two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, ODA, programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid.  The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department&rsquo;s high-level goal, which is to work for a more just, secure and sustainable world.</p> <p>  For this year, the Government allocated a total of &euro;868 million to official development assistance.  This represents a total increase of almost &euro;30 million, or approximately 4%, on the 2020 level.  That means that 2021 is the seventh consecutive year in which the Government has increased the overall allocation to the development co-operation programme.  Of this total, &euro;571 million is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs through Vote 27 &ndash; International Co-operation.  This is an increase of &euro;20 million, or almost 4%, on last year&rsquo;s allocation.</p> <p>  The remaining estimated &euro;297 million is managed through other Departments.  By far the largest component of this other element of ODA is Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU development co-operation budget.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Finance and Justice also manage significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA.</p> <p>  The 2021 allocation for ODA is yet again a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to international development.  Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme is both an important statement of who we are as a people and a clear reflection of Ireland&rsquo;s values and interests.  The global pandemic we are living through demonstrates that we each have a stake in making this a better world.  The Irish Aid programme is an investment in a better, safer and more sustainable world.  It provides Ireland with an opportunity to expand our influence and to strengthen our partnerships today and for tomorrow.</p> <p>  In the Our Shared Future programme for Government, we committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income to ODA by 2030.  Sustained, managed increments in ODA will be required to deliver on this commitment.  Careful planning and consultation with other Departments and stakeholders will be also needed to ensure it is done effectively.</p> <p>  We are adopting a steady and phased approach, taking into consideration the range of demands across government, recognising that to deliver on this ambition will mean making difficult choices between competing priorities.  For 2021, based on current estimates for gross national income, GNI, the ODA to GNI outturn is projected to run at approximately 0.32%, which is a similar level to 2020 but a significant increase in cash terms.</p> <p>  Official development assistance is an integral component of Ireland&rsquo;s overall foreign policy and national presence overseas, enabling Ireland to respond to complex human needs and humanitarian crises around the world.  Ireland has built a distinguished track record of responding to global development challenges and delivering a high quality, untied and coherent approach to development co-operation.  A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, provides the framework for our development co-operation programme in the decade ahead.  A whole-of-government policy, A Better World affirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to realising the central pledge of the sustainable development goals to reach "the furthest behind first".</p><p>To do so, Ireland focuses our efforts on four policy priorities: gender equality; reducing humanitarian need; climate action; and strengthening governance.  The policy also outlines a commitment to intensity work in three clusters of interventions where Ireland has proven expertise namely, protection, food and people.</p><p> As the Covid-19 pandemic is increasing poverty and vulnerability around the world, Ireland will continue to play our part in responding to the needs of those most affected.  This year, we will continue to invest in global public health and contribute to global efforts to develop a vaccine and ensure it will be available to people regardless of income or where they are from.  We are investing money through Vote 27, and knowledge.  Officials in the Department are working with HSE experts to deliver improvements in public health in partner countries in Africa.</p><p> In 2020 the OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, undertook a peer review of Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation policy, programme and systems.  The peer review found Ireland is a strong development partner, with many areas of excellence.  The quality and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme was found to be high, with Ireland allocating overseas development aid and assistance, ODA, to least developed countries and fragile states, priority partners and sectors.  This clear focus enables Ireland to channel our development assistance to where it is needed most, to exercise leadership and obviously to make a visible difference.</p><p> Ireland does development well.  We have a well-earned reputation for the quality of our aid programme and being highly effective at reaching those in extreme poverty.  What we do works, and has real impact.  Ireland, and we as Irish people, can be proud of our programme.  Our international development cooperation and humanitarian action, along with our human rights, peacekeeping, disarmament and security policies and actions, are at the heart of our efforts to create a more secure, stable and inclusive world.  It reflects our best interests as well as our values.  I thank the committee and welcome comments and questions from members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.647" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I welcome the Minister of State.  I begin by commending the work of people in his section, both at home and abroad.  When I was at the Department of Justice, we spent a certain amount of time in the UN in New York, Geneva and other places.  As the Chairman knows well, we spent our time there lobbying for a place on the UN Security Council, which we got in the end.  During that time we met with many colleagues and the respect in which Ireland is held by those other countries is just enormous.  It was amazing to see.  Much of that is down to the work done by our ODA people abroad, the money we spend and the relationships we have.  It is important to say that.  It was tangible, it was warm and it was friendly and Ireland was highly respected.  The Minister of State will get an opportunity when the travel restrictions are over to meet some of these people as well and I am sure he will agree with me.</p> <p>  I have just a few questions.  On the climate unit and the money being spent on countering climate disruption, could the Minister of State give a few examples of how it is being spent in various parts of the world?  I met people from some of the Pacific islands and they were worried about their islands being swamped by rising sea levels, for instance.  As such, this is a real issue.  There are some people out there who feel it has gone past the point of no return in this regard.  The Minister of State might comment on that.</p> <p>  An issue has arisen which may not be in the Minister of State's remit but which he may wish to comment on anyway.  Quite a number of Irish people are in places like Dubai and the Middle East generally as teachers and want to come home for the summer break.  They have been vaccinated with a vaccine not approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, such as Sinopharm, which is the Chinese one, or the Russian one, or others.  It appears there may be some difficulties in their coming back, if they do so.  Will the Minister of State comment on that situation because the time when these people will be coming home is coming up very soon?  People have been in contact with myself and others about that.</p> <p>  I noticed another issue in appendix 2 of the documentation we were given.  There is an item called "Other Channels" at 16% and &euro;1.42 million.  The Minister of State may not have the details to hand now but he might make available to us at some stage a breakdown of that considerable amount of money.  A number of years ago there was a discussion about in-donor refugee costs, meaning some of the ODA money was being spent here in the country on refugees and asylum seekers.  I am not sure if that is still the case.  The Minister of State might comment on that, or send us a note later if he is not in a position to do so now.  To finish off, the work being done by our ODA people is amazing and the money is being spent in a very good way.  I thank the Minister of State's officials for that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.651" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#H00700"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  I begin by expressing my support for the increase in the ODA budget; it is up &euro;30 million, which is roughly 4%.  It is critical we maintain our commitment to reach the figure of 0.7% of GDP by 2030, to which the Government has committed.  The Minister of State might outline the road map for how we are going to get to that position because progress has been very slow.  I have serious concerns that target will be missed so I ask him to outline the road map for that.</p> <p>  I turn to the recent demolition of Palestinian structures and the destruction of donor-funded projects in the occupied territories.  We had a number of witnesses before the joint committee and one of the groups, the West Bank Protection Consortium, gave us evidence that in 2020, for example, 156 donor-funded structures were destroyed by the Israeli occupying forces in the occupied territories.  That was a massive increase of 23% on the 2019 figure of Palestinian structures destroyed.  When we talk of structures, these are of course houses, schools, solar panels and other basic infrastructure.  The West Bank Protection Consortium told us it had lodged a compensation claim of around &euro;625,000 with the Israeli authorities over the destruction of those donor-funded structures.  The consortium told us not a penny of that had been paid, yet this is bigger than getting the money back off the Israelis, it is ultimately about holding them to account for their illegal activities.  What actions are being taken by the Minister of State and by the Department to follow up and ensure that Israel is held to account, and that compensation claim is paid out for the destruction of those donor-funded structures?</p> <p>  Another area I want to touch on is Ethiopia, particularly the Tigray area.  Ireland is one of the largest partners in terms of Irish aid to Ethiopia and the Tigray area.  This has obviously been going on for many decades and we have seen the horrific abuses and we have seen deaths.  We have seen the humanitarian crisis that has unfortunately evolved because of the conflict which is still playing out, not just by Ethiopian troops but also with the involvement of neighbouring countries.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to outline the impact the crisis in Ethiopia is having both on the budget for Irish Aid, the impact it is having on humanitarian access and our future plans in relation to Ethiopia.</p> <p>  I also want to touch on probably the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world, which has been largely forgotten by the international community, namely, the situation in Yemen.  War, cholera, poverty, Covid and a looming famine are having an absolutely devastating impact on civilians there.</p><p>Will the Minister of State outline what Ireland is doing in terms of our obligations and response to the horrific situation in Yemen?</p><p> Lastly, I wish to refer to the roll out of vaccines.  I reiterate that I welcome the increase in the overseas development aid budget but believe it is necessary to consider the key issues thrown up by the Covid-19 pandemic.  There is no doubt that lower income countries such as Yemen and, unfortunately, many other countries have been impacted more severely than other nations regarding the long-term impact of Covid.  The impact of the pandemic will severely impact far outside infection and mortality rates in areas that already suffer so many serious challenges such as hunger, conflict, global warming and poverty,  just to name a few.  We, in Ireland, should be commended on increasing our funding to the World Health Organization.  When it comes to vaccine inequality and access issues for people who live in lower income countries, as the Minister is aware, these are also related to intellectual property rights and on reaching agreement on a Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver at the World Trade Organization.  I believe it is incumbent on the Irish Government to play a constructive role and to use its status within the EU to influence its position ahead of the meeting by the TRIPS council on 8 and 9 June.</p><p> We need to lead the charge on the TRIPS waiver.  Unfortunately, we have been very mute in terms of supporting the TRIPS waiver, which is and will continue to have a massive negative impact on developing countries across the world.  It has the potential to undo a lot of good work in terms of trying to bring peace to countries such as Mali and other countries where women, in particular, who have been imbedded into peace process have been pulled out of those processes to look after their families and communities.   Until we have a TRIPS waiver, and until we see equality in terms of the roll out of the vaccines, unfortunately, it has the potential to undo a lot of good work that has been done.  I ask the Minister of State to outline his views of the TRIPS waiver.  What is being done to articulate the need for a TRIPS waiver?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#J00200"><p>Members will be aware that aspects of the TRIPS waiver are more primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge the report that this committee undertook earlier this year on the matter of global vaccines, vaccine equality and the importance of ensuring that every effort is made to have vaccines distributed, particularly to the less developed regions of the world.</p> <p>  There was an earlier issue that arose with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that the Minister of State might be in a position to address briefly and that is the engagement, or otherwise, his Department and himself have had with the American Administration, with particular reference to the Irish undocumented, under the heading of diaspora.  It is an issue that has been ongoing for some time and we wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours there.  Perhaps there might be a fresh impetus having regard to the change of Administration in the United States.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia.  Again, in the opening comment there was mention of the importance of protection, food and people.  Obviously, the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region is striking at the heart of protection, food and people.  It seems that the Eritrean Government is not in the business of withdrawing its troops as initially stated early in the year by both the Eritrean Government and the Ethiopian Government.  This has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in the region.  The harvest is now in doubt in terms of the inability of farmers to plan and sow crops.  There is a humanitarian crisis looming and a real risk of famine.  Obviously Ireland has a position in the United Nations with reference to the Human Rights Council and the Security Council.  We trust that every effort is being made having regard to the special relationship between Ireland and Ethiopia over the years.</p> <p>  Finally, I wish to acknowledge the great work that both the Minister of State and his Department are undertaking for and on behalf of Ireland in areas of great challenge across the region, as evidenced by the questions from Deputies Stanton and Brady to date.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1573" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#J00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I shall follow on directly from the comments made by the Chairman and that of Deputy Brady about Ethiopia and Tigray.  Obviously it is, as the Chairman quite rightly described in his remarks, a situation in which Ireland is very actively involved both from the UN side and our relationship with Ethiopia.  It is an important country for us in terms of Irish Aid.  Obviously, we very much welcome the situation where we now have some inspections on the ground from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to investigate reported atrocities there.  The key situation is to try to get a peaceful cessation of hostilities.  We did put in emergency aid worth just over &euro;3 million and we have an ongoing aid programme with Ethiopia.  As the year progresses we will look at reviewing that.  Very much our goals and efforts, particularly through our UN involvement in the Security Council, is to try to bring about a peaceful solution there.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton mentioned a couple of things.  Apologies, as this is the first time doing this and if I miss out on anything I will come back to it or attempt to come back to it.  The Deputy is quite right in his comments about the high regard in which we are held by so many people in terms of the work done over the years by so many in Irish Aid and in terms of work on the ground, in particular.  That represented itself in the response of people to the Covid pandemic outbreak right around the world both in terms of our missions, the staff on the ground and Irish NGOs.  I refer to the cumulative response to immediately work, to adapt and do quick changes to work to mitigate the immediate impact of Covid in the areas in which they worked.  The way we did that was a credit to them.  They have worked in an incredible way over the past 18 months and a very large thanks is due to them for that.</p> <p>  One key thing about the climate unit is that a lot of the previous approach was about mitigation.  What we are primarily looking at is adaption and making climate finance available for that.  Deputy Stanton or another contributor quite rightly mentioned the small islands and the countries that are most affected.  When we talk in the West about staving off the impacts of climate change, those small islands and countries will say the impacts are with them now and that it is not a solution down the road in five, ten or 15 years that is needed but immediate solutions to help them deal with rising tides and with the  impacts, particularly severe weather that can have a devastating impact.  We very much work in that space.  In the area of climate finance, we are seeing a significant increase in our commitment, particularly in terms of moving the focus away from mitigation to adaptation and putting that in place.</p><p>Even simple things, such as working with village communities on putting in place a cooker burner system that stops wood being burned on an open fire, has a direct benefit for rural communities in Malawi and other places.  There is a combination of mitigating climate impacts as well health impacts through direct immediate measures.</p><p> Deputy Stanton raised the question of vaccines.  It is probably not directly in my area but I will comment on it because it is very much a diaspora related area.  As the Deputy correctly mentioned, a large number of Irish people, in particular teachers, work in the United Arab Emirates and various parts of the Middle East.  Usually they go out on a 12 month programme and return to Ireland around this time of year.  We need to look at this situation.  The Chinese vaccine is recognised by the World Health Organization as valid and this is the vaccine in overwhelming use in the Middle East.  Therefore, Irish people will be returning fully vaccinated with a certificate of full vaccination.  We need to think about broadening how we look at this, in terms of opening up aviation to allow for this vaccine to be taken into account.  If I am correct, and if not I apologise, one of the quirks is that the US has not approved AstraZeneca as a vaccine and if it took the same approach as we are taking in Europe we could have all types of interesting scenarios.  Globally we need to look at this and state when World Health Organization approved vaccines have been administered that people are fully vaccinated, and we should look at this as proof of vaccination.</p><p> Deputy Stanton is quite right that there is a figure on the development aid side in the Department of Justice.  The figure has reduced this year.  As the Deputy is well aware from his previous role, which he did so well, there was a first year cost on the refugee side of things in Ireland.  I believe I have covered all of the questions.</p><p> To answer Deputy Brady, the key issue for me in terms of the roadmap to achieve the 0.7% target is, as I said in my opening remarks, to have a very stable and incremental approach.  Unfortunately, we have seen other countries that moved very quickly to 0.7% and had to pull back from it.  The direct impact of a country pulling back from it on millions of people's lives is even worse.  The main focus of what I want to do through the budgetary process in the coming years is to negotiate a steady and sustained path so that when we reach the 0.7% level we want to reach, not only will we have buy-in on the political side of things but also from society and the country at large and, therefore, that we have a ring-fence around it that makes it a stable amount and we do not end up in the situation we have, unfortunately, seen in other nearby parts of the world, where there was 0.7% and then there was a reduction, which had quite severe impacts.</p><p> I join Deputy Brady in his condemnation.  It is awful when we see aid projects funded either by Irish Aid or the European Union targeted or destroyed as part of any hostilities or situation developing.  Structures are in place to enable compensation to be sought and this should be done.  Even if something is going to become a target or eventually gets damaged because of a situation, it is still imperative that we are there putting in place the aid in the first place and making a contribution.  As has the Deputy, I have seen some very upsetting pictures of a destroyed building, school or institution that was doing so much good on the ground for a community and is now lying in ruins.  What is key is to make the contribution in the first place, and if we have to go back and do it again we will have to be continuous in our support to make sure we do so.</p><p> I addressed Ethiopia at the beginning.  The Deputy spoke about vaccines and access to vaccines.  I always speak about two matters with regard to vaccines and they are very important.  It is vital that we have as much equality of access to vaccine as possible.  COVAX is really helping to deliver this.  Very much from the conversations I have had, it is important to ensure we have the funding in place.  This is something of which Ireland can be particularly proud because an area of development aid in which we are particularly strong is health systems to deliver the vaccines.  There is absolutely no point in flooding a country with vaccines unless we have enabled it to have in place the health system to deliver them.  We have a commitment of more than &euro;100 million in 2021 on global health.  This is all about what we have learnt over the years in our experience of dealing with Gavi and other institutions and organisations in this area.  To make sure it works not only do we have to ensure the vaccines are there but also make sure the healthcare professionals are there and the right structures and facilities are in place, as are the right PPE and all of the things necessary in the background to enable a health system to work in order to get vaccine delivery.  This is something on which we have been very strong.  COVAX is ramping up at this stage and we are beginning to see increased access.</p><p> As the Chair mentioned, intellectual property falls very much within another Department's area.  We as a country are open to looking at how we can work co-operatively together with all other countries.  We acknowledge what President Biden has said.  We acknowledge the comments of the European Commission in this regard.  While all of this is important, it is a long-term process and it will enable many discussions to take place in many institutions over months.  What COVAX is doing is putting vaccines on the ground now.  This is why we have put &euro;3 million into it, to make sure there is an immediate flow of vaccines.  Yes, more needs to be done and I hope we will see very quickly a substantial increase in what COVAX is doing.  It is a very positive way of delivering.</p><p> Deputy Brady mentioned Yemen.  Obviously, the situation in Yemen is a horror story that has fallen off the world's headlines and in many ways has not received attention.  Consistently what we will find through the work of Ireland, and the work of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the Security Council, is that we have a tradition as a country of prioritising conflict resolution and working with the international institutions in this area, and it is something on which we are very strong.  This is something we will continue to do.  I hope I have covered most of what was asked in the questions.</p><p> The Chair asked about the visa situation.  We welcome the change of Administration in the United States and the tone President Biden set within weeks of coming into office.  He spoke openly about looking again, not just in the context of Ireland on which we have been working so hard but in an international context, at working on pathways to citizenship and regularising the status of people.  This is a very welcome step.  We welcome the work Congress is doing at present on this with the Administration.  We will continue the work we have been doing.  The undocumented Irish are people for whom we have worked very strongly over a number of years.  It was very difficult in recent years to try to get a resolution on this.  I hope this time around that Congress and the Administration will consider it as part of an enlarged solution.  In the meanwhile, there are other visas such as the E3 Visa, for which we will continue to prioritise access.</p><p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has mentioned that there is a very difficult situation with regard to J1 visas at present.  The decision on access is one for the US Administration.  There are many deeply disappointed students in Ireland who would love to have had the option of a J1 visa.</p><p>I got a J1 visa and really enjoyed it but, unfortunately, that was a long time ago.  I do not know whether this was raised, but it also impacted students who have gained scholarships to a large number of American universities and received a full offer of a place in the university but, unfortunately, do not have a visa access point.  We continue to work to see what we can do in that regard as well.</p><p> I think that covers most of what I was asked.</p></speech>

Of course, there is the ongoing issue of the crop of J1 applicants, many of whom are disappointed because of the Covid-related restrictions.  My two daughters were beneficiaries of J1 visas.  As the Minister of State noted, it is an exciting time for those availing of a J1 visain terms of building up experience of life and otherwise.</p> <p>  There is time remaining in the meeting.  I will go back to Deputy Brady.  I thank the Minister of State for dealing comprehensively with the questions asked.  Deputy Stanton raised an issue relating to Irish returnees from the United Arab Emirates, possibly from Abu Dhabi or Dubai, and the issue of the recognition of the vaccine or otherwise.  Perhaps the Minister of State will furnish Deputy Stanton with a note on that issue if he can.  Does Deputy Brady have anything to add before we bring matters to a conclusion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.658" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021060300002#L00300"><p>To follow up on Irish Aid and the demolition of structures in the occupied territories in Palestine, the West Bank Protection Consortium to which Ireland is a party made the specific point in terms of the compensation claim and the follow-up that while, obviously, no compensation payment had been made, it is primarily up to the Government to follow up on that.  I appreciate the Minister of State may not be aware of the details of this issue.  If he is not, he may be able to get a note for the committee on it.  There was specific reference to it being up to the Government to follow up with regard to the non-payment of the compensation claim.  If he does not have knowledge of the issue, that is fine, but it is important.  I hear what he is saying in terms of going in to rebuild structures that are demolished in the occupied territories, but the point here is about accountability.  I mentioned the historic decision made by the D&aacute;il last week when it declared that annexation has taken place in the occupied territories.  Such annexation is illegal under international law and there needs to be accountability and consequences for those measures.  Similarly, there must be consequences for the Israeli occupation forces in the context of the demolition and destruction of Irish-funded structures and aid in the occupied territories that have been illegally annexed.  The compensation claim has been made, but what is the Government doing in terms of following up on that to ensure there is accountability?  It is not good enough for us to fund it and put it in place only for it to be demolished and subsequently rebuilt.  The demolition cycle will continue if there is no accountability.  Like in the case of the illegal actions being perpetrated on civilians in the Gaza Strip, unless there is accountability, Israel will continue to act with perceived impunity.</p></speech>

It is probably more appropriate to follow up with a note on this because the specifics the Deputy is seeking are not something I am in a position to give him.  I know follow-up takes place on the ground in terms but it would probably be better for me to provide a note on the issue so that the Deputy has more information.</p></speech>

One of the issues that arose during my time in the Department of Justice was the horrors that occurred in the Mediterranean, with so many people drowning while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe from north Africa.  One of the suggestions made at the time was that some of the aid from Europe should go to assisting people to stay in their own country so that they would not have to make the journey across the Sahara and wherever else and the Mediterranean.  Does that form part of the official development assistance, ODA, policy?</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked about the ODA target of 0.7% of GNI.  What is the roadmap in that regard?  Has the Minister of State given it consideration?</p> <p>  I mentioned the issue of in-donor refugee costs.  How much is spent in that regard?  I ask the Minister of State to send me a note with the detail on that issue.</p></speech>

It is about putting a situation in place on the ground which, as a by-product, will stop migration and people having the necessity to move.  If one looks at what causes most global migration, much of it relates to food shortages, such as where crops fail due to climate, etc.  What we are trying to do in so many of our programmes is to address such issues in order that people have the ability and the means to remain on the ground.  I have not had the chance to discuss some of our really positive programmes, particularly in the areas of education and gender equality.  We are one of the strongest countries in terms of leading supports in areas to ensure that girls can remain in school.  We can break the cycle of poverty through the work we do in ensuring there is education available for young girls which keeps them in school.  That not only benefits young girls in society, but also the whole of society in terms of breaking that poverty cycle.  All of those things combined, which is what Irish Aid is really about, will, it is hoped, enable countries to move away from the situation of people in those countries wanting to move to Europe.  The current situation in that regard is not sustainable.</p> <p>  I am often challenged by people who ask why we are spending money on overseas aid and what the benefits are to Ireland and Europe of all this money going there.  The benefit is that the world cannot continue to have the type of structure it has had to date for so many reasons, including the climate challenge we are now facing.  We need to create a far greater equality between the wealthy countries of western Europe and elsewhere in the western world and those in the remainder of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in Africa, where there is still devastating poverty.  If we do not do so and proactively engage on that issue, our children and our children's children will feel the impact.  The impact will be felt even more quickly than that.  As the Deputy stated, we saw through the events in the Mediterranean what can happen very quickly and the appalling loss of life that can result when people are desperate and wish to move.</p> <p>  I think the figure he is seeking in that regard is 16% on the justice side.  I think it is &euro;142 million.  I will double check that and come back to the Deputy with a note on it.  Appendix 2 is &euro;142.5 million, which relates to the other channels the Deputy asked about in his original contribution.  As I outlined in response to Deputy Brady in terms of the pathway to allocating 0.7% of GNI* to ODA, it is very much an incremental approach that is designed to make it sustainable.  I think I have covered the points raised.</p></speech>

I apologise if I missed it.  I refer to the Sinopharm vaccine with which many Irish teachers working in the Middle East, for instance, have been fully vaccinated.</p><p>What is the situation if they want to come home?  Did the Minister of State indicate that they will not be able to come back?  If they do come back, must they quarantine in a hotel for two weeks at their own expense?  What is the situation in this regard, just to be clear?  I am sorry if what I am saying is misleading.</p></speech>

To be clear, the situation is that only vaccines approved by the EMA are regarded as complying fully with our requirements and obviating the need for quarantine.  That is the situation as it stands.  Teachers vaccinated with the Chinese vaccine would be required to quarantine on their return.  It is a situation which includes many Irish citizens and members of the diaspora, which is my area of responsibility, who view themselves as being fully vaccinated and who are living their lives in that way in the countries in which they reside.  They are enjoying all the benefits of being fully vaccinated, and yet that is on foot of a vaccine that the WHO has recognised but that we do not.</p> <p>  The Minister for Health was asked about this matter in the D&aacute;il as well.  He stated these matters must be considered in the context of where we will be in the coming months.  I am also conscious that we must be guided by advice from the NIAC and all the public health advice.  It is what feeds into the Government's decision-making in this area.  From the perspective of the diaspora, which is my main area of responsibility, therefore, it is important to recognise that situations of this type will arise involving Irish citizens.  It will not just affect the teacher cohort we have been talking about because many locations globally are using vaccines supplied by Russia or China.  Therefore, this is a matter for us to consider in the context of the advice we get from the health professionals.</p></speech>

The OECD development assistance committee published its important peer review since the last time we considered Vote 27.  I acknowledge the favourable commentary of the OECD concerning the work of the Minister of State and his team, which really enhances Ireland's reputation abroad.  Irish people at home are very proud of the work that our development co-operation team engages in on our behalf.  I thank the Minister of State for dealing with the many questions posed by members.

The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The role of the director general of the CSO, as prescribed by the Statistics Act 1993, provides that the officeholder acts independently and exercises sole responsibility in professional statistical matters.  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.</p> <p>  The Central Statistics Office plays a vital role in the functioning of the State in providing independent and verifiable data to citizens and policymakers on a broad range of topics, including social, economic and environmental issues.  The ability of the CSO to inform has been evident throughout the current pandemic.  The CSO delivered on the vast majority of its planned statistical work programme for 2020, publishing 421 releases and publications.  Of these, 29 were new products specifically related to providing insight on the impact of the pandemic across society and businesses, for policymakers and citizens alike.</p> <p>  The CSO delivered 59 individual publications from the 29 new products, which included publications focused on the business and social impact of Covid-19, the numbers of deaths and cases, the impact on the labour market and experimental outputs on excess deaths and on mobility during the pandemic.  Alongside the new products developed and delivered to provide additional insight, the CSO provided statistical and analytical expertise and new data services to support analysing health data sources in a safe and secure environment.  The CSO has supported modelling, analysis of health and of real time data and analysis to provide insight regarding trends and identifying emerging issues all to support central government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has, of course, impacted on the CSO's statistical work programme during the past year, with the greatest impact on processes that require face-to-face interactions with survey respondents.  The single largest casualty by scale was the postponement of the census of population from 2021 to 2022.  On consideration of the challenges caused by Covid-19, the Government decided to postpone the 2021 census until April 2022 to enable the CSO to undertake a comprehensive, inclusive and safe census in 2022, which will provide valuable and accurate data for our country in the years ahead.</p> <p>  Other surveys, such as pilots for the programme for international assessment of adult competencies and the household budget survey, were postponed until 2021.  Face-to-face collection at airports and ports also ceased during 2020.  While face-to-face interviewing for household surveys ceased, new technological solutions and mixed mode collection options were implemented to maximise the delivery of the statistical work programme.  The CSO has also developed new interactive graphics, infographics, new formats, namely, bulletins and frontier series, and outputs to provide the additional insight needed by the public, businesses and policymakers on the impact of the pandemic.</p> <p>  The CSO has continued to publish key economic indicators and has tracked the impact of the crisis on business sectors and the economy, including via the monthly exports and imports of goods, the quarterly national accounts, Government deficit and debt, the quarterly balance of payments, the labour force survey, the monthly unemployment and live register figures and the survey on income and living conditions, among others.</p> <p>  Planning has continued for census 2022 with the options for a potential census in 2026 are also being considered.  In both cases, an increase in the use of administrative data is being explored and the possibility of the development of an online response facility is being considered in respect of census 2026 which, if approved by Government, would mark 100 years since the first State census.</p> <p>  The CSO is continuing to work on a survey on the prevalence of sexual violence, with a pilot going into the field in 2021, and is progressing work on the data collection and processing of the next wave of the State's longitudinal study of children and youth, Growing up in Ireland, from 2023.</p> <p>  The CSO now faces a different challenge in measuring how our economy and society emerge from the Covid restrictions.  Sustainable, secure access to data and the reuse of high-value data sources in the form of administrative data and some private data sources are essential for the CSO to provide timely and accurate data that are meaningful to policymakers.  To enable this, the CSO has been to the forefront of building the national data infrastructure under action 24 of the Civil Service renewal programme on improving how data are collected, managed and shared.</p> <p>  The pandemic has confirmed what we have always known, that along with access, the quality of the data sources is crucial.  Continuing to build the national data infrastructure across the public service is a key component to delivering on the quality necessary for the creation of official statistics and to deliver the broader data framework to serve the needs of the State.</p> <p>  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, primarily EUROSTAT and the ECB, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN's fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.</p> <p>  New EU legislation introduced in 2015 fundamentally changed the role of the CSO, and that of its director general.  Following this legislation, the director general of the CSO now has responsibility for co-ordinating and overseeing the quality of all European official statistics in Ireland.  It is now the responsibility of the CSO to ensure that all compilers of European statistics in Ireland are adhering to the quality and methodological standards set out by the EU and detailed in the European statistics code of practice.</p><p> Turning to the CSO's budget, the net allocation for 2021 is &euro;63.155 million.  The funding provided reflects the Government's commitment to the office to meet its obligations under national and EU law, to continue developing the Irish statistical system, and to produce new outputs to meet domestic demand through the provision of trusted and robust official statistics.  Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on social, economic and environmental issues, as demonstrated by nearly 15 million web hits on the CSO website in 2020.</p><p> I commend the values and principles that inform the CSO's work.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public service and public policy by providing a high-quality and, importantly, independent statistical service.</p></speech>

Given the multi-annual cycle of statistics, demand arises in certain years because of particular surveys, for example, the national census.  If the Deputy looks through the Vote's various elements, he will see there can be a fluctuation in spending between years.  With the National Statistics Board, NSB, the Government is strategically supporting our national and EU responsibilities.  Provision is made in the budgeting.  For example, a significant underspend is projected in certain heads and there were also underspends last year, but the CSO will roll out the national census next year.  We have provided for the needs of the census.  It is important we do so to meet our national and EU obligations.</p></speech>

Through the NSB, we have set out a new strategy for 2021 to 2026.  It has been authorised.  At its launch in recent weeks, I spoke about having trusted and independent sources of data.  I am trying to embed some of the key priorities that the CSO has set out.  We will support those priorities, for example, monitoring transformations in the environment, economy and society to assist policymakers, communicating data and taking action to enhance official statistics and sources.  Embedding Eircode postcodes in all public sector data holdings is work the NSB wants to drive forward, and the CSO will have an important involvement in that.  Big data has a potentially valuable role in the compilation of official statistics.</p> <p>  Although we are discussing this year's Vote, I can go into more detail on the strategic direction, which is about using many of the other official data sources and how that informs our public policymaking and decision-making.  With the NSB, the CSO will move in an ambitious direction.  We can forward the 2021-26 strategic report that was set out by the NSB.  It is important we support and fund the strategy, and that is our intention.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said, "The single largest casualty by scale was the postponement of the census of population from 2021 to 2022."  As part of the recovery package that was just announced, there will be a new online facility for people to fill out the census.  Will the Minister of State tell us a little more about that?

The census is a large-scale field operation that involves more than 5,000 staff and a number of visits to every household over a ten-week period.  The success of the census requires the co-operation of every household.  The decision to postpone it was not taken lightly.  As the Deputy will appreciate, foremost in that decision was the safety of the public and the field staff.</p> <p>  The census of population is a major logistical challenge and will commence in 2022.  There will be technological advances, which are referenced in one of the subheads.</p><p>In subhead 4 the technological advances relate to the census management system, which is in the fieldwork itself.  What is being explored specifically in terms of an online census is for 2026.  That is the distinction earmarked.  A census case management system will be used.  The Deputy will see some of the detail on that in subheads 4 and 5.  That is related specifically to the fieldwork and the 5,000 plus people who will be involved in it.  The online response facility will be considered in respect of the 2026 census which, as the Deputy knows, will be 100 years since the first State census, so it is really important.</p></speech>

It is my understanding there is a question about speaking Irish, and around 2 million people would say "Yes".  Can there be a follow-up question, potentially, that drills down into this and is a bit more specific?  Can oral or written ability be rated so we can clarify the level of Irish spoken?  That would be very useful.</p></speech>

The questions and follow-on questions have already been set.  My understanding is that much of the paperwork around the census has already been printed in preparation for what would have gone ahead this year.  I will ask my officials to take the Deputy's suggestion back as part of considerations for the 2026 census.  We obviously want to get an in-depth picture of the Irish language in every community, as the Deputy said, and be able to respond properly to that.  Unfortunately, the one thing the census has shown is the need to try to rebalance the trend in the right direction with everything else we are trying to do with the Irish language.  I know the Deputy shares that aim.  I am very much open to allowing her, or anyone else, engage prior to the 2026 census.  There is a methodical process around that where a range of questions and options are examined.  We will take the Deputy's feedback on that as well.</p></speech>

That is very interesting.  That will be great, especially since 2026 will be a centenary year.  I fully understand the forms are already printed.  We will not ask the CSO to redo and reprint them all.</p> <p>  I have another question on Vote 6.  I did not realise this discussion was really about the census.  If the Minister of State does not have the response to Vote 6, that is fine.  I do not exactly remember this when I filled out the census form, but an issue was brought to my attention relating to people being asked to clarify their religion.  A variety of different religions are listed and then there is "other".  Somebody questioned whether being an atheist or of no religion could be included in that.  That was brought to my attention.  I do not recall from reading the census what is there, but it is something I have been asked about previously.</p></speech>

It does not relate to the census, so maybe it can be brought back if the Minister of State does not have the answer.  It relates to legal fees paid to counsel.  Under Vote 6, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor stated that it is fair to say fees paid by the State are lower than those in private practice.  I am quite interested in the State's overall level of expenditure on legal fees.  It is information that is not collected by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In the context of the statement that fees paid by the State are lower than those in private practice, has a study been carried out on this?  As I said, it does not relate to the census, so if it is something that can be brought back to me, that would be great.</p></speech>

I will give her the position, and if she needs more detail, I will try to get it to her directly.  The Deputy is referencing Vote 6, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The majority of expenditure on external expertise by that office and by the Office of the Attorney General is on engagement with counsel, whose services are required so the State can adequately defend itself in legal proceedings taken against it and ensure it is not exposed to significant financial or reputational risk as a result of such proceedings.  They jointly operate a system of evaluating the work done by each counsel and then decide on the appropriate fee in each and every case.</p> <p>  The Chief State Solicitor's office has, since 2019, instigated a far more intensive process of evaluation of fees to be paid in a tight budgetary management process.  This is being supported in that particular office by the work of a high-level professional fees control group and greater guidance to staff.  The methodologies for assessing fees at the higher levels consist of the application of the assessment process.  Following nomination by the Attorney General, counsel undertake the legal work and submit a fee note.  That is evaluated and a decision is then made on what level of fees are reasonable for the work, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount of work done by counsel and his or her performance.</p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, it is fair to say that fees paid by the State are lower than those in private practice.  Expenditure under that particular subhead is difficult to predict as it is a demand-led service.  The number of cases before the courts and the value of actions taken against the State is outside the control of that particular office.  Projections are based on expenditure in previous years but it can fluctuate as well.  If the Deputy needs any further detail, I can ask that it is sent to her. </p></speech>

Who carries out the value for money and policy reviews?  In 2020, the cost was &euro;55,000 while it is &euro;30,000 in 2021.  That is just for the Central Statistics Office.

The savings in 2020 arose from fewer than anticipated audits as the office outsources its internal audit function.  The 2021 allocation reflects the fact that the office expects a full list of a series of internal audits to be undertaken during 2021.  That relates to the Office of the Attorney General.</p> <p>  On the Central Statistics Office figures, the subhead provides for the fees and expenses in respect of mainly IT or non-IT value for money and policy reviews by the office.  The allocation for consultancy spending remains small and reflects Government policy to limit consultancy costs.  Typically with the CSO it related to external advice, for example, for IT-related advice.  That was the majority of the spend there.  As the Chairman will see, the allocation was quite small.</p></speech>

It appears these Estimates for 2020 were spent and there is an arrangement in 2021 for a similar spend.  Are these consultancy services, value for money and policy reviews carried out by an outside company?  Are they private companies?  Does all of this work go to tender?

There is no one person who takes the responsibility of the totality of the civil servants who are Secretaries General.  Is this something that should be addressed so there is a Secretary General, perhaps the Government Secretary General, who should be responsible for the others?  It seems odd not to have a person who is the head of an organisation.  Perhaps the Minister of State would take up this point.</p> <p>  There is a note on the end of the table that says the staff and grades figures exclude politically appointed staff, commissions of investigation, tribunals of inquiry, citizens' assemblies and so on.

As the committee is aware, the Moriarty tribunal was established in October 1997 and published its first report in 2006, with its second report in March 2011.  Following completion of its final report the tribunal is dealing with applications for third-party costs.  The tribunal is also subject to a number of legal proceedings.  The total amount paid by this Department in respect of the tribunal from its inception in 1997 up to the end of April 2021 was &euro;66.3 million.  It will not be possible to ascertain the overall cost until all third-party costs have been settled.  Provision of &euro;4.209 million is included in the Estimates for 2021.</p> <p>  The Cregan commission of investigation, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, commission, was established by Government order in June 2015 following consultation with Oireachtas parties.  The commission was originally required to investigate certain transactions, activities and management decisions of the IBRC between January 2009 and February 2013.  Mr. Justice Cregan submitted an interim report in November 2015 that raised a number of significant issues that had arisen with regard to legal and professional privilege, banking confidentiality, and where the commission considered changes were required to its terms of reference.  New legislation, the Commission of Investigation (Irish Bank Resolution Corporation) Act 2016, was enacted to provide a new legal basis for the commission.</p><p>The commission&rsquo;s terms of reference were amended following consultation with the Opposition representatives to provide that the first module of its work was the transaction with Siteserv plc.</p><p> In 2020, a total expenditure of &euro;2.2 million was incurred by the IBRC commission with costs since its establishment in 2015 of &euro;9.9 million.  The commission&rsquo;s original deadline for reporting, as members know, was 31 December 2015.  The commission submitted its ninth interim report on 8 April 2021 in which it requested a further extension of it timeframe for reporting on the Siteserv transaction, until 31 October 2021.  The Taoiseach granted the commission&rsquo;s request for a further extension to its timeframe to report, given the apparent advanced stage of preparation of its final report.  If the commission&rsquo;s request was not granted it would have effectively dissolves the commission with no findings to show for in return for the substantial costs incurred to date and those incurred but not yet paid.</p><p> In relation to the Cooke commission of investigation, the NAMA commission was established on 3 June 2017.  Mr. Justice John Cooke is the commission&rsquo;s sole member.  In the first module of its work, the commission is charged with investigating the sale by NAMA of its Project Eagle portfolio.  The commission&rsquo;s original deadline for reporting was 31 June 2018, but following several requests from the commission, its timeframe for reporting has been extended.  Most recently, in March 2021, the Taoiseach granted the commission&rsquo;s request for an extension of its timeframe for reporting until the end of September 2021.</p><p> In 2020, a total expenditure of &euro;855,000 was incurred by the NAMA commission with a total cost since its establishment in 2017 of &euro;3 million.  There is a provision in the 2021 Estimates for both commissions for &euro;4.43 million.</p></speech>

The Moriarty tribunal continues to run in terms of costs.  Is there any thing the Department can do to speed up the settlement of those costs in order to have them dealt with once and for all?  Perhaps it can take initiatives to ensure we save taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

I can ask the Department officials who are directly liaising with the Moriarty tribunal to submit a note to the committee about that interaction but until third-party costs are addressed, it will not be able to conclude.</p></speech>

In that consideration, can the Department of the Taoiseach discuss with him the end date in this regard or are there any controls in relation to bringing it to an end, while at the same time dealing with all of the issues that are there?</p></speech>

The ninth interim report was given on 8 April 2021 and the timeframe has been extended to 31 October 2021.  The Taoiseach granted that extension, given the apparent advanced stage of preparation of its final report.  If that had not been granted it would have effectively dissolved the commission without providing any findings, with limited return for the substantial costs incurred to date, as well as those incurred but not yet paid.  That was the basis for the extension.</p></speech>

It is a significant issue and it runs across a number of Departments including the DPP, and so on.  A scoping exercise is being undertaken.  I raise it as often as I can with the Taoiseach because this is now the tenth year since the murder of that young man on the roadside.  It is two years and almost six months since the scoping exercise commenced.  The family is deeply upset that the scoping exercise has not concluded and the work of the inquiry, or whatever may be suggested, is more limited than it had expected.  Is there anything that can be done through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office to speed up that process and ensure we have a wide-ranging investigation into all aspects leading up to this young man&rsquo;s death and thereafter.  I refer to the failure of the courts, for example, the failure of the DPP&rsquo;s office and the failure of the Garda in particular, in this regard. There are many other questions Lucia O&rsquo;Farrell, her husband and family have.  Does the Minister of State think that, in the interest of fairness, it could be dealt with quickly?  Can you bring that to the Department&rsquo;s attention?</p></speech>

I was a member of the previous Oireachtas justice committee, and I am aware of the significant difficulty and trauma this ongoing issue is causing the family.  I know the Chair has spoken about it regularly.  I will reflect that to the Taoiseach and will ask him to follow up with the Chair directly.  I acknowledge everything the Chair has said and I will ask him and his office to follow up with the Chair.</p></speech>

I raised it with previous holders of the office of Taoiseach when they came before the committee, so I am not doing anything extraordinary in raising it here again with the Minister of State representing the Taoiseach.  I refer to the Grace case and the 46 other cases which are being dealt with by the Department of Health.  It is shocking that the State would not show more compassion in respect of those cases.  These were non-verbal, mentally challenged young men and women.  We do not know the outcome.  While the investigations are ongoing, it has now been years spent on this.  As Head of Government, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure this is brought to a speedy conclusion, not just for Grace, as she was known, but for the other 46 individuals.  It is a reflection on the Government when we do not show this type of compassion and understanding in cases like these.  I ask that the Minister of State ensures he is given that information.</p> <p>  As for the whistleblowing legislation, which this committee is undertaking to review on foot of the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, it is greatly important that there be a whole-of-government intervention in this regard because it does not pertain to just one Department but will spread across numerous Departments, as it has done.  There are still outstanding cases being fought in the courts.  There is one case in particular about which I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister.  It is to do with a whistleblower in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.</p> <p>  When these matters are not dealt with, they linger on and affect the lives of people, whether they are those generally associated with the Grace case or the individual in the CIT case, as well as other whistleblowers.  It is likewise with the Shane O&rsquo;Farrell case.  Perhaps driven through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, we should be establishing a more efficient manner in dealing with all of these matters in order that they can be heard publicly and we can learn from the processes and give some closure and comfort to the families and individuals concerned.</p><p>As I have said to the Minister of State previously, I have raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Taoiseach, and the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, when they were before the committee.  My intention was to raise it with the current Taoiseach, who is not before us.  Perhaps the Minister of State will take it to the Office of the Taoiseach and ensure that we get some sort of response.</p></speech>

How is the Government ensuring value for money in that area?  Could the committee have a list setting out how much the various barristers and senior counsel are paid each year through the Department of the Taoiseach relative to all of the agencies that are under the Department?  We got that information in the past and I ask that the Minister of State investigate the matter and provide us with the detail.</p></speech>

For example, fees to counsel are mentioned and there is a reference to 40% of the expenditure of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would be interesting to get deeper information on the individuals who are in receipt of this money from the State and any other information the Minister of State can give us on those legal costs.  While we are discussing legal costs, is there any intention to reform or review the workings of these offices, especially the DPP?</p></speech>

The Minister of State might ask if any reform is being discussed, if the offices have set out any requirements they may have, and if they have sufficient staff and so on to do all the necessary work.  We often hear of difficulties in getting cases dealt with in an efficient way.  I wonder if we could have a note on that to give us an understanding of how all of this is being achieved and if further financial input is required.</p></speech>

I will go through it.  As the Chairman knows, the current Citizens' Assembly on gender equality was established in January 2020.  Prior to Covid-19, it was expected to conclude its work in summer 2020 and it held its final meetings on 17 and 18 April, including voting.  The Citizens' Assembly published its results on the 45 key recommendations recently.</p> <p>  Under the programme for Government, the Government aims to establish a citizens' assembly this year to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local Government structures best suited for Dublin.  This citizens' assembly could be established shortly with a new chairperson and new members following completion of the current Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  The programme for Government also provides for the establishment of citizens' assemblies to consider matters relating to biodiversity, drug use and the future of education.  The timing of these future citizens' assemblies is under consideration, as are the format and methodology they might take.  Any decision will be guided by the experience of the current Citizens' Assembly and the evaluation of the independent researcher who has been appointed to monitor and record, among other things, the perceived deliberative quality of the Citizens' Assembly.  As I said, there will be further detail on those shortly.</p></speech>

Last night, at another meeting, I raised with the Taoiseach the need to have someone as the head of civil servants.  The point was made yesterday by the Secretary General, Martin Fraser, and I am hopeful the Taoiseach might comment on that.  At yesterday's meeting, the Taoiseach may have misunderstood me as I was not talking generally about civil servants.  Rather, I was talking specifically about the Secretaries General in terms of their appearances before committees.  That needs to be strengthened in the context of the work that committees do to ensure that we achieve the type of transparency and accountability that are required.  The Taoiseach, as the Head of Government, should reinforce that point with the Secretaries General of the different Departments to assist the committees in their work.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is going through the Estimates with the committee because we could not find a date to accommodate the Taoiseach.  It is most unusual that the Taoiseach would not be present for the presentation of his Department's Estimates.  I hope his absence today will not develop into practice in future because people look for transparency and accountability.  These meetings have always been good exchanges in the past, including when the committee met the previous Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, his predecessor as Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, and those who went before them.  They appeared before the committee to explain the figures in detail.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has to deal with a number of questions by way of providing further information.  I ask him to do that as efficiently as he can.</p></speech>

My understanding is that it has been the norm for many years that the Taoiseach attends the first session and the Chief Whip attends the second, which deals with the CSO.  The Taoiseach dealt with the Estimates in the previous session.  I will respond in writing to all the specific queries that members have raised.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

Normally, the Taoiseach comes before the committee and presents the Estimates for his Department.  The Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for the CSO then attends separately.  When the Taoiseach attended the first meeting we did not complete the review of the Estimate for his Department.  It was expected that he would return and finish that Estimate but that did not happen.  That practice should not prevail.  I am making that specific point, not just for my chairmanship and the current members of this committee, but for the future.  It is not accurate to say the Taoiseach presented and that this was a meeting to deal only with the CSO Estimate.  That is not a fact and the Taoiseach is quite aware of that.</p><p>We said before concluding the previous meeting that the Members had not finished the examination of the Estimates.  The reason we are dealing with it here today is because of the timeframe involved.  If other Members have questions that have not been dealt with, they can ask them now, and, if not, I will bring the meeting to a close.  The clerk will circulate the information requested when it is received.</p></speech>

They are just making the point about the Land Development Agency, LDA, stripping local authorities of their functions.  It is part of our wider and interconnected critique of this entire Bill in that we think that is precisely what the Land Development Agency is doing.  It is stripping local authorities of functions they should have.  The Government is committed to this and, as I was saying at the previous meeting, I am on quite a losing streak with my amendments, as are many of the Opposition.  They are out of scope unless we can convince the Government the Land Development Agency is fundamentally misconceived, which it appears we cannot.  I will make that point and probably withdraw these amendments.</p></speech>

These amendments are technical provisions in section 8, so that the review of the achievement of purposes of the Act that apply to the LDA will also apply to subsidiary designated activity companies, DACs.  They are also being inserted to provide clarity and certainty that these provisions will apply also to any of its subsidiaries.  It was always the intention of this legislation, when it was being drafted, that references to the LDA would refer also to a subsidiary designated activity company.  For the avoidance of doubt, I will move these amendments.</p> <p>  I will address amendments Nos. 59, 63, 65 and 68.  Will I keep going and address all the amendments?</p></speech>

It has been drafted by the Association of Irish Local Government.  It is one of a group of amendments it sent to all Deputies on the committee urging them to support them.</p><p>It is very straightforward.  It is an attempt to have a greater level of transparency and accountability.  The Minister of State will see from the amendment that it requires the agency to furnish an annual report, both to the Minister and the relevant Oireachtas committee, regarding progress towards achieving the aims the Government is setting out for the LDA.  As we have seen with other State agencies, the lack of annual reports, or substantial delays in their publication, means there is not the level of transparency and accountability that is required.</p><p> This is even more so the case when one is structuring an organisation like this as a designated activity company that has the cover of commercial sensitivity in terms of FOI and parliamentary questions.  The requirement to publish a detailed annual report and to make it available not just to the Minister but also to the relevant Oireachtas committee is eminently sensible.  I hope all members of the committee can support the amendment.</p></speech>

The wording is slightly different but the aim is the same, which is to ensure that the review of the achievement of the purposes of the Act by the LDA and its subsidiaries would be on an annual basis rather than every five years.  This is a new agency and it is important, in the context of transparency and accountability, to make sure that it does what is set out for it under the legislation and to do that every five years would be insufficient.  That is once every half a decade.  A lot can happen in that time, so it is important that the review would happen on an annual basis.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>

These amendments seek to substitute references to the LDA in this section for local authorities.  I am opposing them because the proposal is not relevant to the Bill.</p> <p>  Section 8 provides that the Minister can at any stage require the LDA to report to him or her on the LDA's progress in achieving the purposes of the legislation.  In addition, the LDA will be required to report to the Minister on its progress on a periodic basis, with the first report due in 2024.  As the purposes of this Bill directly relate the LDA and its functions, it is necessary for the agency to compile this report and would not be applicable for local authorities to carry out this role.</p> <p>  I will also address amendment No. 61, as jointly tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould and amendment No. 62, as tabled by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 seek to substitute the provision in section 8 that the report that the LDA is required to submit to the Minister on the achievement of the purposes of the Act should be prepared annually instead of every five years.  While I understand the intention behind the proposed amendment, I am opposing these amendments, as the provision for an annual report is already included at section 47.  In addition, the acquisition and development of land can take a period of time so it is not appropriate that this report is done on an annual basis.  It should be noted that the report by the LDA specified in section 8(2) is required by 31 March 2024 and every five years thereafter will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In addition, under section 8, the Minister can at any stage require the LDA to report to him or her on the LDA's progress in achieving the purposes of the Bill.  In addition, the LDA will be required to report to the Minister on its progress on a periodic basis, with the first report due in 2024.</p> <p>  Under section 47, the LDA is already required to furnish the Minster with an annual report by 30 June each year.  This annual report will be drafted in line with the provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  As the provision at section 47 already requires the LDA to publish an annual report the report furnished under section 8 is appropriately requested every five years.</p></speech>

I am genuinely surprised by the Minister of State's response because, on the one hand, he seems to be saying that there is a provision elsewhere in the Bill for annual reports, but the provision that there would be an initial annual report and then a report every five years seems to contradict that.  Perhaps he could explain the position because it could be the case that I do not understand the relationship between the two relevant sections of the Bill.</p> <p>  I find it incredible that anybody would be against the publication of an annual report by any State agency, commercial or non-commercial, that is going to be spending substantial sums of taxpayers' money and engaging in substantial land and residential property deals with other State agencies and potentially with commercial actors, depending on what happens.  That is surprising given all the difficulties we have had, for example, with NAMA, and the lack of accountability and transparency and subsequently the very significant charges that deals were done without the adequate level of attention to the public interest.  We only get access to that information when it comes to light several years later, either in the Comptroller and Auditor General's look-back report or through good investigative journalism.  Surely, if the Government wants the public to have confidence in this new agency, the publication of an annual report and the maximum level of transparency would be a good thing.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 70 relates to a requirement for the Minister to put in the public domain information regarding directions to the agency within 30 days of those directions, as opposed to "as soon as practicable", which is the wording in the Bill.  Again, the public and Opposition and backbench Government Deputies need to have access to the maximum level of information about the operations of this agency to protect the public interest.  That is our job, and I can see no reason for the Minister of State to oppose that amendment either.</p></speech>

I do not have any issue with that, it is fine.  The section I am seeking to amend relates to the review of the achievement of the purposes of the legislation.  The review is required every five years.  I do not think the timeframe is adequate, it should be done on an annual basis.  If the Minister considers an annual review is too frequent and it is every two years, I could probably live with that, but as it is a new agency an annual review would ensure that the LDA is operating in compliance with the purposes of the legislation.  The reason I am tabling the amendment is that it is a good, sensible measure.  To be clear, the Bill allows for an annual report.  That side of it is fine, but every five years for the review of the achievement of the purposes of the legislation is far too infrequent, especially given that the agency is new.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#C00900"><p>I want to avoid any doubt in terms of the conflation of two different issues.  The aim of the annual report is to ensure that the agency is accountable in terms of its actions and operations.  Its performance in the context of the achievement of the objectives outlined in the legislation is outlined in the five-year report.  Other State agencies have also introduced timescales to reflect their activities.  The role of the LDA is to acquire sites and deliver the construction of homes and a significantly lengthy period is required to carry out the work.  A five-year timescale has been deemed appropriate to best reflect how the agency is performing in terms of the Act considering the timescale required to deliver on these sites.  Everyone on this committee knows the job is challenging.  The Bill also provides for the Minister to request a report at any time on how the agency is adhering to its objectives.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 70 seeks to replace the timeline of "as soon as practicable" at section 8(6) for a timeline of "within 30 days".  I am opposing amendment No. 70, as the current timeline is appropriate for such matters.  Section 8 provides that the Minister can at any stage require the LDA to report to him or her on the its progress in achieving the purposes of the legislation.</p><p>In addition, the LDA would be required to report to the Minister on its progress periodically.  The first report is due in 2024.  Subsection (6) relates to the giving of directions by the Minister to the agency following a review of a report received under the section.  The Minister shall cause copies of any direction given under this section, as currently drafted, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after the direction is given or action taken.  It is normal, as part of the governance of State agencies, that the Minister can issue a direction to an agency.  These directions will generally relate to the implementation of Government policy.  The LDA is required to comply with any direction issued under this section .  The proposed amendment seeks to provide that the Minister shall cause copies of any direction given under this section to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 20 days of the direction given or action taken.  I am opposing the amendment and allowing for ministerial directions to be laid as soon as practicable, as is appropriate for this section.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 71 is one of the most fundamental amendments my colleague Deputy Gould and I have tabled.  It is to make the case for a land development agency, if such an entity is to exist, that is a non-commercial semi-State body.  The original proposition on the LDA, as announced, by Fine Gael in 2018, was to have an off-balance-sheet vehicle because it did not want its borrowings and expenditure to be State borrowings and expenditure.  Fine Gael wanted to set it up as a commercial semi-State body using the DAC model.  As we know, to secure off-balance-sheet status under EUROSTAT, a majority of a body's activities have to be on the open market.  That is why, when the LDA was originally announced, 60% of the homes it was to deliver were to be sold at open market prices, with a social housing proportion of only 10% and an affordable housing proportion of 30%, as members will remember.</p><p>One of the significant changes in this Bill is that the proportions of 10% and 30% and the 60% for open market sale are gone.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as Minister, has repeatedly told us he wants a majority of the homes on LDA land to be social and affordable.  He has been quite coy about what the proportion of unaffordable, open market priced homes would be, particularly on sites such as St. Kevin's in Cork and on the Dundrum Central site, but there will be open market sales.  The LDA is going to remain on balance sheet for some time, however.  If, as we know, 100%, 90% or 60% of the homes in the first round of projects are to be social and affordable, the transactions cannot be off balance sheet.  Therefore, all the agency's borrowings and expenditure will be on the general government balance sheet.</p><p>There is no reason, therefore, for it to be a commercial semi-State body.  One of the great advantages of making it a commercial semi-State body is borrowings.  It will be able to get the advantageous State borrowing rates which are much cheaper than private borrowings.  That is the case with Irish Water.  One of the great values of that entity, for all of its historical problems, is that it is on balance sheet.  It also provides for greater transparency and accountability.</p><p> To repeat a point I made in the previous meeting, if I want information about what a local authority is spending on land or housing, that information is available to me.  It is fully transparent.  Once one uses a commercial semi-State body, because of the application of the Companies Act, commercial sensitivity applies.  Significant volumes of information about spending and borrowing are redacted and transparency is greatly diminished.  That was one of the many problems with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and using public private partnerships being as a mechanism for delivery of social housing.  I will not rehearse my arguments on why we should not take that approach.  However, I am strongly of the view that if we are to have a State agency, it should be a non-commercial State agency which accesses cheaper government borrowing and provides full transparency on its borrowings and expenditure so the public has full visibility on its activities.</p></speech>

I invite him to speak on those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.819" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#F00300"><p>In a similar vein, our amendment proposes that the LDA be a public agency rather than a commercial entity, as envisaged in the Government's Bill.  It is noteworthy that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, appears to have moved over to the socialist position on housing policy, on which I commend it.  It may give the Government pause for thought on its misguided approach to resolving the housing crisis and its determination, through the Land Development Agency Bill, to involve private investment vehicles in trying to resolve the housing crisis.  The ESRI, it would appear, differs with the Government and concurs with the views of the left in that what we should do is have direct State investment.  It is suggesting we should be borrowing between &euro;4 billion and &euro;7 billion per year to invest directly in delivering public and affordable housing.  It is suggesting we could develop 18,000 public and affordable units per year, a figure remarkably similar to the one in People Before Profit's proposal on dealing with the housing crisis.</p> <p>  The Government, in responding to us and others on the left with a similar policy, such as Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats, regularly dismisses it as fanciful.  It now seems the ESRI does not think it is fanciful.  The ESRI points out, as we have repeatedly done over many years, that the net cost to the State would reduce over time because the State could progressively reduce the huge waste of money being spent on housing assistance payments, HAP, and leasing arrangements if it directly invested, upfront and big time, in its own public and affordable housing stock.  Over time, it would reduce the huge outgoings on HAP and leasing payments.</p> <p>  It is in that context that we are saying the LDA should be a purely public agency.  It should not be a commercial agency in any shape or form and should not involve private finance or capital.  There is no need to do that, as the ESRI points out.  If the Government has not listened to us in recent years, it may listen to the ESRI which is echoing our view that what we need is for the State to directly provide its own public and affordable housing building programme.  It also needs to scale up and double the current level of investment, as the ESRI suggests.  It is in that context that it makes sense for the agency to be purely public.</p></speech>

I will address amendments Nos. 71 and 74, as jointly tabled by Deputies Eoin &Oacute; Broin and Thomas Gould, and amendments Nos. 72 and 73, as jointly tabled by Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Gino Kelly, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Mick Barry.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 71 and 72 seek to replace and provide that the LDA will be established as a public non-commercial State agency instead of a designated activity company, DAC, as provided for.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 73 and 74 seek to delete some or all of subsections 2, 3 and 4 of section 11.  Subsections 2, 3 and 4 concern the naming of the agency, the disapplication of certain provisions of the Companies Act and provide for the agency to be independent in the performance of its functions.</p> <p>  Section 11 provides for the formation of the Land Development Agency as a designated activity company limited by shares, under the Companies Act.  The LDA will be a commercial semi-State body and will be independent in the performance of its functions.  Subsections 2 and 3 concern the naming of the agency and the disapplication of certain provisions of the Companies Act.  I am opposing this amendment because all three of these subsections are integral to section 11.  Deletion of these subsections would cause the section to only refer to the establishment of a DAC and would delete any reference to the naming of this DAC.</p> <p>  I am opposing these amendments because the Government has decided the LDA will be a commercial State company and there would be a significant cost to the Exchequer if these amendments were accepted.  The Bill has been drafted on the basis that all provisions have been carefully considered and drafted to ensure the LDA can work commercially.  Subsections 2, 3 and 4 are integral to section 11 and their deletion would cause this section to only refer to the establishment of a DAC and would delete any reference to the name of the DAC and its being independent in the performance of its functions.</p> <p>  The LDA is being established as a designated activity company.  As a DAC, the LDA will be able to receive investment funding from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, through its share capitalisation.  The initial shareholding in the LDA will be &euro;100 million, with the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform holding shares with a value of &euro;99 million and the Minister for Housing holding shares of &euro;1 million.  Deputy Boyd Barrett can clearly see it is a publicly-owned company.  There is no ambiguity or doubt surrounding that.</p> <p>  On a number of other points raised by Deputies, the independent adjudication of EUROSTAT is that the State should make LDA expenditure off balance sheet.  The Government's intention is that this expenditure would not be permanently on balance sheet.  For this reason, we are trying pave the way to achieve that.  We know the scale of the challenge ahead in terms of the capital that has to be raised to deliver housing in this State.  The LDA is a key actor in that delivery.  We know the high thresholds that will apply as regards affordability rates and we want to see almost 100% affordability achieved in the Dublin area.  That is important.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding members' views, a number of semi-State agencies are fully publicly-owned and the new agency will not be any different.  I also remind members that the fiscal rules, which are currently suspended, may be reintroduced in future.  The State and the new agency must have the capacity to operate in a countercyclical manner to ensure they can deliver housing at scale, which our citizens so badly need and deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.822" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#F00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He indicated that establishing the Land Development Agency as a non-commercial semi-State body would create a considerable expense on the Exchequer.  Every single euro the LDA acquires through the ISIF or borrowing and every euro it spends for the next number of years is on balance sheet.  That is the current position.</p><p>If it is the intention of the Government to honour the commitment given by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, that the majority of homes on LDA sites will be social and affordable, getting this funding off balance sheet will not be possible.</p><p> The Minister of State is completely correct that this is a matter for the CSO, in the first instance, and then EUROSTAT to decide if a vehicle is on or off balance sheet.  We know the bar that EUROSTAT sets for such a decision because in the very significant EUROSTAT decision on Irish Water, the five points it outlined as to why Irish Water would be on balance sheet are all very clearly in evidence here, in that the majority of the activity of the LDA, as promised by the Minister, will be non-commercial, that is, providing sociable and affordable housing.  The system for allocating those homes will be nominations through the local authorities for the social housing but also for the purchase of the affordable element.  The board's policies, particularly the requirement to abide by Government policy and direction, are enshrined in this legislation.  It is virtually impossible to see how the LDA can come off balance sheet unless - this is a very important point that the Minister of State made &ndash; it is in order to satisfy the core requirement of the market corporation test of EUROSTAT by providing that a majority of the residential units on LDA land are sold at commercial open market prices.  I do not dispute the Minister&rsquo;s view and I know it is Fine Gael&rsquo;s desire for the LDA to be off balance sheet.  However, if the Minister wants to achieve this, the only way he can do so is if, in the round, 60% of the homes the LDA delivers will be sold at open market prices, which we know are eminently unaffordable.</p><p> Given that the majority of the LDA activity is going to be in Dublin, the Government cannot, on the one hand, promise that up to a majority of the homes in Dublin will be social and affordable while, on the other hand, saying that it wants the LDA to be off balance sheet.  This is a crucial issue and I understand the LDA itself is quite concerned about this because it is not understand how its target of 150,000 homes, as promised by the then Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the then Ministers, Deputy Donohoe, and Mr. Eoghan Murphy, back in 2018 is going to be achieved if the agency is not off balance sheet.  The LDA does not see how it is going to be off balance sheet if the promise of the Minister that the majority of the homes will be social and affordable is to met.  </p><p> This response by the Minister of State exposes a fundamental flaw in how the Government is dealing with this matter.  It shows the deeply confused nature of this legislation and the different promises of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael as to what the LDA will deliver.  On that basis, I am pressing this amendment because it would be cheaper and more efficient to have a centralised housing agency on balance sheet as a non-commercial semi-State body and borrowing, exactly as Deputy Boyd Barrett stated and as recommended by the ESRI today, at historically low rates to provide the volume of public homes that we need.  As I said, this exposes the fundamental flaw of this entire enterprise and on that basis, this amendment is even more valid than it was before.</p></speech>

It is directly challenging the logic behind the Government&rsquo;s approach, as embodied in the Land Development Agency Bill.  The Government&rsquo;s obsession with public private partnerships and involving private investment, as well as the knock-on consequences of all of that in having to operate on a commercial basis, leads then to the requirement to sell some of the housing at full market price.  All of this is being justified on the basis that we have to keep the LDA off balance sheet, we do not want to inflate Government debt and so forth.  The ESRI is directly challenging that logic.  The Minister of State should respond to the point.</p> <p>  I add to that the point I made about the huge cost we are incurring annually, which continues to grow, through leasing and HAPs arrangements because we are not building enough of our own stock of public housing.  In the case of the LDA, we will not maximise the potential we have on our own land to deliver our own stock of public housing because the Government insists that some of it will have to be sold privately at market prices and so on.  It is, therefore, limiting the ability of the public land bank to develop public housing which can then wean us off the extortionate annual cost of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and HAP arrangements, which are required to substitute for the failure of the State to develop on a sufficient scale its own stock of public housing.  The Minister of State should also respond to that point.</p></speech>

The game is up now for the Government and it can no longer ignore the very clear and strong calls for public investment along the lines of what the ESRI and the rest of us have been saying for a long number of years.  The Government can no longer dismiss that argument.</p> <p>  On the on balance sheet versus off balance sheet argument put forward in respect of the LDA, Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the LDA is going to be on balance sheet for the foreseeable future.  There is no question about that.  The question that arises is whether the EU fiscal rules and orthodoxy will still exist by the time the LDA is possibly off balance sheet.  Those rules belong to a previous era and mainstream economists no longer subscribe to that fiscal orthodoxy.  That said, even if mainstream thinkers still subscribed to it, there is a very strong case, given the housing emergency we have, for breaking those rules, if needs be.</p> <p>  The idea that we would, because of the orthodoxy of the EU fiscal rules, perpetuate circumstances in which more than 8,000 people are living in emergency accommodation and 120,000 people are on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies is utterly unacceptable.  Bearing in mind that European Union member states are engaging in serious breaches of the rule of law, involving breaches of fundamental democratic rights, human rights, press freedom and attacks on the LGBTI+ community, all without proper sanction, the idea that the European Union would sanction Ireland for investing in public housing in the middle of an emergency crisis while turning a blind eye to all of those breaches of the rule of law and democratic rights is not in any way credible.</p> <p>  The Centre for Housing Law, Rights and Policy in NUI Galway has produced very good research on EU state aid rules and cost rental housing.  It very clearly put forward the legal case that a legitimate case can be made under EU state aid rules to support interventions in housing to address housing market failure.  We very clearly have housing market failure.  We do not need today&rsquo;s ESRI report to know that.  The case for public investment is overwhelming and the use of the outdated and previously mainstream EU fiscal orthodoxy, which some of us have never supported, as an excuse is a red herring.  Will members of this Government be the last people in Europe defending those rules?  Everybody else has moved on from them?</p></speech>

However, I am not sure what part of those two Bills he does not understand.  The core direction of both is to ensure there is a legislative basis for significant delivery of public housing by the State on land that we own.</p><p>The Minister in the D&aacute;il has said that in places like Dublin, 100% of the units will be social and affordable.  The use of open market sales to subsidise or reduce housing investment on the site is therefore not Government policy.  The Minister has said that very clearly in the course of this debate.  This Bill allows the LDA to establish DAC subsidiaries to deliver affordable housing and public housing.  The Affordable Housing Bill allows for council-led affordable housing on council land.  As late as this morning the Secretary General of the Department confirmed that the &euro;500 million we spend on HAP needs to be phased out because it is better value for money for us to spend capital money on the delivery of housing.  In many ways all the last few contributions re-fight an argument that was settled in the general election.  The State is back in the business of building houses, we are going to do it on a massive scale, and the Housing for All programme we will see in the summer will, I believe, do exactly what the ESRI wants us to do, which is to increase significantly the capital spending on this.  I really welcome the ESRI's report this morning.  It is really important and I think it will allow for the aggressive delivery of the legislation that Opposition parties are opposing.</p></speech>

The Minister and the Government have to recognise this now.  It is unbelievable that we are listening this morning to comments from Government Deputies who do not accept the facts.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, our party and other parties on the left have been calling for a massive housebuilding programme for some time.  That is the only thing that can solve the housing crisis.  What we have in the LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill does not go anywhere near far enough to deliver the houses we need.  The Government parties of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party do not realise this.  Is it that they do not realise it or that they do not accept that their policies are wrong and will not deliver the housing we need?  The housing crisis did not start today or yesterday.

I will be brief.  We are in the middle of a housing emergency.  We are the committee that has oversight over housing.  It seems simple to me that if we do not build houses as quickly as we possibly can, the emergency will continue to get worse.  That is why we are tabling amendments.  Deputy McAuliffe made a comment about the State being back into building houses.  In Cork city the State is building no houses.  Cork City Council is getting private developers to build estates that it is then purchasing off them to deliver them.  Where I live in Gurranabraher and where I come from in Knocknaheeny the estates were directly built by the local authorities with funding from central government.  That is what we need to get back to now: actually building houses ourselves.  I will not hold up the meeting any more, but that is the only way to tackle the housing emergency.</p></speech>

I think everybody here welcomes the ESRI report.  We all agree we need to put money into housing, but the reality is that we have the LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill.  That is the mechanism to resolve the housing issues we have, backed up by increased investment by the Government.  This committee can become very polarised but I think everybody here agrees that we need to solve the housing crisis.  The LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill are two key mechanisms in that, but I agree with and support what the ESRI says in that we need additional investment.</p></speech>

I just thought it would be important to respond to Deputy McAuliffe's point.  The point is that we should legislate in line with Government policy.  If the new policy of the Government is the direct provision of public housing, as Deputy McAuliffe says, and for 100% public and affordable housing on public land, let us first acknowledge that that is a departure from the initial conception of the LDA.  The problem is that the legislation is in line with the old policy.  The actual detail of the legislation is not in line with the policy Deputy McAuliffe is articulating; it is in line with the old policy.  Critically, this centres on the amendments we are now discussing.  If what we are trying to do is deliver public and affordable housing on public land, why set up the agency to do this as a commercial company rather than a public agency?  The two things do not go together.  I am afraid verbal commitments from the Government that it is in favour of what we are arguing for, what the ESRI is now arguing for and what Deputy McAuliffe says the Government is now in favour of do not tally with what is in this Bill.  What this Bill is about is setting up a commercial entity that is allowed - and this legislation facilitates this - to enter into commercial arrangements with private investment vehicles.</p></speech>

I also do not want to get back into political to-and-fro between members of the committee.  I will ask the Minister of State to respond to some of the comments that were made and to try to answer some of those questions and then ask Deputy &Oacute; Broin to press the amendment if he so wishes.</p></speech>

I thank the members again for all their genuine and valuable contributions.  I understand where each and every one is coming from.  I note members saying the fiscal rules may not be here at some point in the future.  Unfortunately, I cannot operate that scratch card type of economics whereby you have a crystal ball before you and you make predictions and put legislation through that affects citizens based on that.  My job is to try to put through the best Bill we can put through that will deliver the largest scale of social and affordable housing in this State.  I remind members that the affordable percentages are not limits; they are a minimum target.  That is the first key thing.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been very clear that in Dublin he expects the delivery mechanism through the LDA to result in 100% affordable housing.  With the previous Government it was 30%.  Again, that was not a limit but a minimum.  I remind members that through Part V we have the increase to 20%.  There seems to be a huge misunderstanding on the committee as to how EUROSTAT and the CSO compile or accredit what is off balance sheet and what is not.</p><p>Affordability is not a metric for any agency that is off balance sheet.  The metric is whether it can wash its face and how it carries out its business.  The LDA, like Coillte and other semi-State companies, will carry out its business by project managing with local authorities.  The affordability criteria are set in stone for public lands.  There will be a minimum of 50% social and affordable housing, with prices reduced by 20% under Part 5.  That gives the LDA capacity and it will project manage with local authorities.  The cost-rental element will be 30% below cost rents.</p><p> Anyone in this committee who suggests that, notwithstanding the massive economic challenges this State faces and the requirement to build 350,000 houses for citizens over the next decade at a probable cost of &euro;100 billion, the State can shoulder the full cost in future and we should not have a semi-State agency that can deliver housing units countercyclically, regardless of how stressed the State is, is living in fantasy land.  We have to provide the maximum number of affordable housing units.  The Minister has said it is his intention to deliver 100% affordable housing in Dublin.  </p><p> I remind Members that these figures are minimum rates, not targets.  We have to have an honest and open debate on how to deliver these affordable houses our citizens badly need.  I also remind members that the LDA is a publicly-owned semi-State company.  I hope that will allay concerns.</p><p> With regard to the ESRI report on the challenge the State faces, the Department has a record budget for delivering housing.  There is no point in muddying the waters by saying affordability is a criterion applied by EUROSTAT.  It is not.</p></speech>

How will the Government address affordable housing when there has been a 37% increase in the cost of materials coming into this country since 1 January?  That increase is due to the 2040 plan brought in by the Government in 2018.  The Government refused to accept an amendment by the Rural Independent Group on this two weeks ago.  Nobody in this country will be able to get affordable housing because that Bill was not amended.  We now have a shortage of housing, not only in built-up areas, a 37% increase in material costs and a lack of contractors to do the work.</p> <p>  The Minister of State says he will deliver affordable housing.  He gave a rough costing of &euro;100 billion.  What he is saying is not accurate.  I have been in construction all my life.  I see the changes daily.  There are ships on the seas carrying materials that are being bid for by different countries and the highest bidder gets those ships into port.</p> <p>  Brexit has caused a massive problem in our ports, with goods held up for the last three weeks.  The costs are caused by what is happening in the ports and one section not talking to the other.  The Government is causing a bigger problem.  To get affordable housing we have to get equipment and materials into the country and we must have the right number of people available to build it.  The 2040 plan has caused a 40% to 50% hike in prices for housing.  The Government has caused a problem in local authorities with the number of planning applications coming in at the moment.  I have 70 applications for housing on my books.  I am getting phone calls daily on a programme introduced by a Fine Gael-led Government in 2018, which has led to a 37% increase in costs.  Nothing will be affordable in this country until the Government simplifies things for the rest of the country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.921" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#L02800"><p>I move amendment No. 102:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 16, line 25, to delete &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;through the public appointments process&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>Section 15 of the Bill relates to the board of the agency.  I am strongly of the view that all appointments to the board, whether of the chair or of other members, should be made through the public appointments process.  This is a discussion we had frequently with the previous Government and ordinarily we were told that, even though the appointment is made by the Minister, it is intended that the public appointments process be used.  The difficulty, however, is that, unless this process is explicitly required by the legislation, the process for public appointments may be bypassed.  In fact, if I understand correctly, that happened recently in respect of some appointments made by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to the Climate Change Advisory Council.  We have a public appointments process for a reason, which is to ensure that there can be no political patronage or cronyism, and nor can there be a perception of such patronage or cronyism.</p><p>I am therefore strongly of the view that all such appointments to State boards, whether they be the boards of commercial or non-commercial agencies, should be made through that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-03a.923" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021060300002#M00200"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for his amendments.  The Government has two amendments in this grouping, Nos. 103 and 105.  These amendments are technical amendments to provide that the appointment of the board and chair of the board will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The provision as currently drafted provides that the Minister appoints individuals to these roles and these amendments bring these provisions in line with similar provisions for other commercial State bodies by ensuring that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as shareholder, also consents to them.</p> <p>  I would remind Deputies that all appointees to the board, including the chair, will be recruited through the State boards process and in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The Public Appointments Service is currently running a competition to appoint the chair of the Land Development Agency and I hope that this process will be completed shortly.  </p> <p>  I will address now address amendments Nos. 102 and 104, which have been tabled jointly by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Deputy Gould.  Amendments Nos. 102 and 104 seek to amend a provision in section 15 to the effect that all members of the LDA board and the chair are to be appointed by the Minister and to substitute for this a provision to the effect that appointments are to be made through the State boards appointment process.</p> <p>  I am opposed to this amendment as it will be the case that all appointments to the board of the LDA will be carried out through the State boards process.  This is in line with the code of practice for the governance of State boards.  As is standard, the Public Appointments Service will run all LDA board competitions, in partnership with the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA.  Shortlisted candidates will be presented to the Minister for consideration.  As I said, the appointment of the chair is currently going through this process.  </p> <p>  It is clear that we have to abide by the code of practice.  It is a robust document.  Any changes that would have to be made to it if we were to accept this amendment to the legislation would necessitate a whole range of changes to different Acts as we would be adopting the principle that Acts would be changed each time.  We want one robust document for public appointments and we have one.  The document is really satisfactory.  There is nothing like action.  The appointment of the chairperson is currently going through the process.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that, unless this is legally required under the Act rather than being advised in a voluntary code of practice to which the Government adheres, a Minister can make direct appointments, bypassing the public appointments process.  In many instances, including during the term of this Government, Ministers have done just that.  I used the recent appointments to the Climate Change Advisory Council as a case in point.  I fully accept what the Minister of State has said with regard to the code of practice.  In general, the Government does use the Public Appointments Service, but it does not always do so.  There should be no circumstances in which a Minister, regardless of who he or she is, can bypass that process.  This caused enormous controversy in previous governments.  Ministers appointed people who were widely believed to be politically aligned with the general thinking of those Ministers to significant State boards despite the fact that the code of practice which the Minister of State has outlined was in place at that stage.  I refer not only to the previous Government but the Government before that, when Fine Gael was in government with Labour.</p> <p>  I do not accept the argument that making the use of the public appointments process legally required creates complications.  It is a simple amendment which would prevent a Minister from making a direct appointment.  All of our parties agree that not only do we want to end cronyism, but that we want to end the perception of cronyism.  The best way to do so is to make sure that no Minister can make an appointment outside of the public appointments process.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>
