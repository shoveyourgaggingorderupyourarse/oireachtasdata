Is that okay with members?  Following this discussion, we will need to make a decision on whether it is necessary for a reasoned opinion to be sent to the D&aacute;il on this particular proposal.</p><p> I welcome to the meeting officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, including Mr. John Finnegan, principal officer.  Mr. Aidan Ryan, who is joining us on Microsoft Teams, is the permanent representative of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels.  He is very welcome this morning.  Both Mr. Finnegan and Mr. Ryan will speak to COM (2021) 851.  We are also joined by Mr. Noel Regan and Mr. Kevin Brady, both principal officers in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications as well.  They are also very welcome this morning.</p><p> Before beginning I will read the note on privilege.  I remind the witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue the remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For the witness attending remotely and outside Leinster House, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such, he may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  I ask all members joining online from within the confines of the Leinster House complex to confirm they are on the campus.  I also remind members they can attend the committee meeting in person if they so wish or by dialling in via their offices with Microsoft Teams.</p><p> Mr. Finnegan may now provide an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finnegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#B00200"><p>This statement relates to the proposal on the protection of the environment through criminal law.  On 15 December last year, the Commission published a legislative proposal to replace an existing 2008 directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law.  The Commission evaluated the 2008 directive during 2019 and 2020 and published the results of the evaluation in October 2020.</p> <p>  The Commission found that the 2008 directive had little effect in practice.  The number of environmental crime cases investigated and prosecuted was still very low in the Commission's opinion.  Penalties were considered to be too lenient to discourage environmental crimes and there was too little co-operation between member states in enforcing these laws.  In addition, the Commission noted very little information on investigations was being gathered.</p> <p>  The Commission proposes to address these issues by introducing a new, expanded and reinforced directive, replacing the 2008 directive, on the protection of the environment through criminal law.  This new directive will clarify the definitions of existing criminal offences and define nine new environmental offences.  These are: placement on the market of products that cause substantial damage to the environment because of the products' use on larger scale; serious breaches of EU chemicals legislation causing substantial damage to the environment or human health; illegal ship recycling; illegal water abstraction; source discharge of polluting substances from ships; illegal trade in timber; serious breaches of rules on the introduction and spread of invasive alien species within the Union; serious circumvention of requirements to do an environmental impact assessment; and illegal production, placing on the market, import, export, use, emission or release of fluorinated greenhouse gases.  The proposal would define sanction types and levels for environmental crimes, improve cross-border co-operation and investigation, ensure better data collection and sharing of statistics and improve the effectiveness of national enforcement chains.</p> <p>  Many of the issues raised by this proposal concern criminal law and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working closely with the Department of Justice as this proposal is examined by the Council of Ministers.  The proposal will be considered by the working party on judicial co-operation in criminal matters, COPEN, formation of the Council, which brings together justice officials from member states.  Other Departments will also be concerned with sector-specific matters relating to agriculture, water, industry and transport.</p> <p>  In terms of implications for Ireland, we view the next ten years to be critical if we are to address the climate and biodiversity crises which threaten our safe future on this planet.  It is imperative that we protect our biodiversity and natural heritage against deliberate acts of systematic destruction of ecosystems, both nationally and globally.  Tackling environmental crime is also a key commitment under the EU's Green Deal.  This proposal includes robust measures that will define sanction types and levels for environmental crimes, improve cross-border co-operation, ensure better data collection and sharing of statistics and improve the effectiveness of national enforcement chains, including our own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#B00300"><p>I thank Mr. Finnegan for his statement.  I invite members to indicate if they wish to ask questions.  As we have one hour for this part of the session, time is limited, so perhaps members will limit their questions to two minutes.  Some members might like to spend two hours asking questions but we will put the limit at two minutes per question per member.  If we have time, we will have a second or third round.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#B00400"><p>I will get the ball rolling.  I might come in for a second round because as members ask questions, we might tease out more what this means and the consequences.</p> <p>  I welcome strengthened directives and legislation around environmental crime and crimes against biodiversity causing habitat loss.  Currently it is fair to say that in Ireland we have a weak position and we do not have a very good track record of implementing sanctions against environmental crime or biodiversity loss.  Any opportunity we have to strengthen that position is very much welcome.</p> <p>  The witness mentioned extra measures but I did not hear any extra measures around biodiversity and habitat loss.  To what degree is that already contained within the original legislation?  Is it envisaged that will be enhanced under this new directive?  As I said, I welcome greater sanctions but the key question is whether we have the resources in Ireland to stop crimes against wildlife and the environment?  Can we catch those perpetrators or do the witnesses feel this is something that must be much more heavily resourced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finnegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#B00500"><p>The existing provisions from the current directive, which are being carried forward, included provisions relating to biodiversity.  The new criminal offences defined would criminalise activities in breach of environmental legislation that would harm ecosystems and biodiversity.</p><p>With regard to the sanctions and criminalisation, the picture the Commission found was that while authorities were in place in member states to police the existing crimes, this was ineffective because co-operation between them was not effective.  Therefore, the view of the Commission is that by improving co-operation between member states, prosecutorial and investigative activity will be much more effective.  The Commission draws attention to the fact that the definitions of the crimes before 2008 were different in different member states.  Some member states did not define them as crimes.  It was found in the evaluation that the directive gave enough discretion such that the definitions were still different, and this caused difficulties, including practical difficulties, in cross-border investigations.  Since the definitions and sanctions were different, it was not even possible to use legal machinery such as the European arrest warrant.  The reasoning behind what was proposed was that by tightening the definition of the crimes, expanding the list of crimes and harmonising the sanctions, the existing investigative activity would be much more effective.  This was because people could co-operate between member states.  Obviously, environmental damage does not respect member state borders.  In the Commission's view, which seems reasonable, investigations have to cross borders as well.</p></speech>

However, would he advocate a strengthening of resources in Ireland because our record on environmental crime, wildlife crime, prosecutions and charges is not good?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finnegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#C00300"><p>We are at an early stage of scrutiny.  This matter relates to one of the complex aspects of this legislation.  In our Department, we define the standards but we have to work with the Department of Justice and the enforcement authorities to determine what the real implications of the provisions would be.  It is definitely part of our scrutiny to determine the implications regarding our resource needs and ascertain whether the right resources will be in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#C00400"><p>I have just a couple of questions.  Mr. Finnegan mentioned better co-operation between national authorities.  Domestic co-operation also seems to be key.  In that context, Mr. Finnegan mentioned co-operation between the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Justice.  In fairness to the Minister of State responsible for heritage, Deputy Noonan, he has pushed the idea of the wildlife crime unit.  The Ministry responsible for heritage would seem to comprise another key point.  What are the plans to ensure those elements intersect?</p> <p>  Let me refer to an issue in which I am very interested.  I do not believe we need to wait for the directive to come into place to assume there is a problem, that is, the serious circumnavigation of the requirement to make an environmental impact assessment.  Ireland has an extremely poor record on conducting environmental impact assessments and constantly seems to be coming up with new reasons as to why we do not need to conduct them.</p> <p>  With regard to resources and capacity, how has the capacity increased over the past year or two?  What are the plans to increase it in respect of environmental impact assessments, including in respect of the public's capacity to support them?  This has come up in multiple areas, including forestry.</p> <p>  There are two points that I noted.  Mr. Finnegan mentioned deliberate acts.  I was a little concerned when I heard that.  Could Mr. Finnegan clarify that it is not the Irish position that one has to prove bad intent?  An act that is the result of negligence still has the same bad environmental impact as a deliberate act.  Indeed, the precautionary principle under EU law and practice under the treaties implies it is about due care being taken.  Could Mr. Finnegan comment on how the precautionary principle is likely to be reflected in our approach to the directive?  Could he clarify that it is not solely deliberate acts but also acts that come about through negligence that he believes might be covered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#C00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  I will allow her in for a second round later.  I believe we will have time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finnegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#C00600"><p>I thank the Senator.  She made a very good point on the need for internal co-operation on both scrutiny and execution.  This is because each of the nine new offences will require the expertise of other Departments for scrutiny.  It is to ensure that the directive reaches its best possible form and that there is co-operation in enforcing it.</p> <p>  The first offence is the placement on the market of products that, in breach of mandatory requirements, cause substantial damage to the environment because of their use on a larger scale.  The existing requirements that limit the use of certain materials are the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They are often enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, so we will have to scrutinise the provision with it.  It would have to take a leading role in this.  That is a good example of the structure in that the standards are in existing legislation &mdash; in this case, in the REACH directives and other measures on the use of chemicals and other raw materials in manufacturing.  Certain things are forbidden on a civil or EU law basis.  The directive under discussion does not change that standard; it just states certain egregious breaches of the existing standards will become a criminal offence.</p> <p>  The second new offence concerns serious breaches of chemicals legislation.  Again, the existing standards, which are just being reinforced, will need to be scrutinised by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the other existing stakeholders.</p> <p>  The third offence relates to ship recycling.  There is existing legislation setting standards for the recycling of ships.  It is the responsibility of my Department.  We will have to examine closely the effects of imposing criminal sanctions for serious breaches.  </p> <p>  The fourth offence concerns water abstraction and makes abstraction a criminal offence if it causes substantial damage.  Again, this would have to be considered by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is responsible for existing legislation related to water and which would have primary responsibility for enforcement.</p> <p>  The fifth new offence, on the discharge of polluting substances from ships, will require scrutiny by the Department of Transport, which would have to be involved in enforcement.</p> <p>  The sixth, on placing illegally harvested timber on the EU market, would obviously require the scrutiny of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which would have to take a leading role.</p> <p>  The seventh concerns serious breaches of rules concerning invasive species.  This and other biodiversity matters are the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  As the Senator mentioned, there are provisions to criminalise a failure to carry out proper environmental impact assessments in certain circumstances.  That is part of our planning system.  There are existing standards in this regard that are the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and various bodies under its aegis.</p> <p>  The ninth offence primarily concerns my Department.  The change made means that the release of fluoridated greenhouse gases into the atmosphere will become a criminal offence.  The Senator made the very good point that this legislation will require whole-of-government scrutiny to ensure it works properly and whole-of-government action to enforce it.</p> <p>  The subject of environmental impact assessments is controversial, as the Senator suggested.  We will be discussing with our colleagues who are responsible for that aspect of the planning system the best and most appropriate way to add criminal sanctions in a helpful way.  I am afraid I cannot help the Senator very much with the details of the system and how it is currently working, but I am sure we can return to that.  Colleagues in the responsible Department can answer specific questions on the current system.</p> <p>  The Senator raised a very interesting question that has been raised by member states.  It concerns the distinction between a deliberate act and a negligent act.  My colleague the attach&eacute; may join in on this.  In summary, there have already been two days of discussion on the directive, at the end of last month.  The first three articles were gone through.  Exactly the kinds of questions being discussed have been raised.  For example, is the definition of "unlawful" in the directive appropriate?</p><p>Is there a need for <i>mens rea</i>for something to be a criminal act?  What should the distinction be between deliberate and negligent acts?  What is the standard for negligence?  These are very technical and very important legal principles, and we are working with the Department of Justice to ensure that what is implemented works well in our system.  Certainly, the intention of the directive as it stands is that it covers deliberate acts and negligent acts.  It covers natural persons and legal persons.  What is needed now is the technical scrutiny to ensure the directive has its intended effect in a common law jurisdiction.</p></speech>

This proposal is at a very early stage.  It was tabled by the Commission in December.  We have had one meeting so far.  All there has been time for is to have a first-cut review of articles 1, 2 and 3, which involve the definitions and the offences.  As Mr. Finnegan said, the proposal addresses that offences must be unlawful and committed intentionally.  There is also a reference to serious negligence.  Recognising that the European legal system is slightly different from ours, we have to analyse and study the effects of this.  We are not alone here.  The member states are also querying exactly what has been proposed in these definitions and are looking for clarity.  We expect the Presidency and Commission to listen to the questions that are being raised by the member states and to come back at a later stage with some level of clarity and discussion to try to reach a harmonised view.  The text being looked at is at a very early stage and a lot of work needs to happen before it is finalised.</p></speech>

To follow up on Senator Higgins, what has been proposed is critical, but I baulk at the appearance of the word "serious".  Who will define the seriousness and what criteria will be used?  I ask the same question about the word "systematic".  It is all terribly vague really.  When we are talking about environmental crime, some people might immediately think about the fossil fuel industry.  We always talk about greenwashing.  One could say that the planet is more or less a crime scene because of what the fossil fuel industry has inflicted upon it.  I know what has been proposed is critical, but will the Department provide any reassurance in that regard?</p></speech>

It is worth reminding the committee that nothing in this would dilute existing provisions.  Something that is already illegal under European law, such as to pollute or to harm a habitat or so on, will remain illegal.  The existing sanctions under European law, including the requirement to cease those acts and fines for infringement of existing European law, will remain in place.  What we are talking about here is a push to criminalise unlawful acts that are in breach of existing legislation.  Deputy Cronin put her finger on the difficulty and what we are working with the Department of Justice on to ensure that the definitions of what is deliberate and what is negligent are clear and workable so that they can work in practice and achieve the desired effect.</p></speech>

The first cut of three articles has already taken place over a two-day meeting and that raised more questions than answers.  The next meeting is tomorrow.  The French Presidency will control the speed at which this will progress.  At the moment, we do not expect the Council to be in a position to finalise its position until the very end of the French Presidency and possibly to seek a general approach at the final meeting of the Council of Ministers of Justice towards the end of its Presidency in June and July.  After that, it will begin to go into the trilogue process with the European Parliament.  We will have some feedback from the European Parliament on its views of the process.</p></speech>

The concept of environmental crime has not been treated very seriously in this country in recent years and that is why it is so important that directives like this are.  This leads into my first question.  Does the Department believe, in the context of other European countries, their standard of environmental law is substandard or poor?  Is that why a directive like this is needed for member states across the European Continent?</p> <p>  I refer to improving cross-Border co-operation.  I come from Dundalk, a Border area.  The most significant environmental crimes that I have seen in my eight years of politics is fuel laundering and the dumping of illegal toxic sludge, not only on our roadways but in our rivers and lakes, which I have physically seen, of Border areas.  That has actually decreased in recent years because of the dye and other measures we have introduced as a way of combating it.  However, it is still an extremely serious issue in the part of the world from where I come.  If possible, that is an area we need to focus on.  I would love to hear more detail.  I know it may be difficult to give details now because it is at an early stage, but it would be important to get more detail on what we can do in terms of cross-Border co-operation, particularly when going from a member state, the Republic of Ireland, into Northern Ireland which is no longer in the European Union.</p> <p>  Who would be the enforcement authority of this?  Will it be done on a cross-sectoral basis?  Will it be the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Justice?  Who will be the enforcement people of this?</p> <p>  Finally, I have a quick question, a basic one.  Will the Department give a rough outline of the timeframe involved in this directive from start to finish and when can we expect to see it being implemented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finnegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#D01100"><p>I am reluctant to characterise any member state's environmental regime as being substandard.  The Commission carefully, in its extensive review, did not criticise any member state's system.  The point it made, and it is the basis for all of this, is that they differ.  We are in a situation where if the system differs in its definition of crimes or even in its sanctions, it is operationally very difficult for people to co-operate.  One can imagine the sort of co-operation involved.  The Senator raised a very good local example of it.  The Commission is aiming to create that standardisation whereby, operationally, everybody is aiming for the same thing and that the legal mechanisms that already exist for arrest warrants and searches and so on can be triggered.</p> <p>  It is also worth saying that although the Commission does not criticise any individual member state, it has said that harmonisation does not just allow co-operation.  It said that where there are differences in levels of criminal enforcement and definitions of crime, there is a danger of creating safe havens.  It does not name names.  This is theoretical.  There is, at least in theory, a danger of areas of lesser enforcement, thereby creating safe havens, unfair competition, distorting trade, and penalising the good actors who, in good faith, try to follow these regulations and rules.</p><p> On the co-operation issue, our understanding of this proposal at this stage is that it is the type of measure that is intended to deal with that.  Washing diesel and dumping the residue breaches any number of existing rules and there are a similar number of civil penalties.  People can be forced to stop doing that and clean it up.  This would go further in providing that, in certain circumstances, that becomes a crime.  What we need to do in the scrutiny of this proposal is to set out what happens in our jurisdiction and produce a workable set of definitions and language for this directive that criminalises that practice.</p><p> To respond to the remarks on cross-sectoral enforcement, many Departments and agencies specialise in this issue.  The Health and Safety Authority is involved, as is the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Irish Coast Guard and agencies involving ships.  It will be a case of giving additional powers to existing agencies which are the experts in these areas.  One of the issues will obviously be that if they are enforcing criminal law, co-operation may be required from other agencies.  I cannot speak to that because we are at an early stage.  I have to repeat that a bit.  Those are the sort of complex issues which have to be considered.  I can tell the committee that the 2008 directive was very complex to transpose for exactly that reason because it involved changing the legislation governing many existing Departments and agencies.</p></speech>

I was wondering which body would have primary responsibility.</p><p>I want to follow up on two or three words.  Mr. Finnegan referred to the idea of tightening the offences.  While he said the offences will still be unlawful, I am a little concerned that the tightening of offences might mean excluding certain things that would be considered unlawful now from the new definition of a crime.</p><p>I raise again the issue of &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;systematic&quot;.  I am worried that we are creating new loopholes or defences.  For example, with the idea of <i>mens rea</i>, we know that intention is extraordinarily hard to prove in the law.  It is almost impossible do so and, in fact, the Government recently introduced legislation on the argument that intention is too hard to prove.  In that context, it would be useful to know what Ireland is doing at the Council meetings.  Are we being clear around the idea of negligence in the discussion of such matters as &ldquo;serious&rdquo; or &ldquo;systematic&rdquo;?  What is our position in those discussions?</p><p>I mentioned the precautionary principle.  Serious negligence is one thing but the precautionary principle is a little different.  It is an obligation to take appropriate measures and steps.  For example, if a company has an incident in Lithuania and then allows another incident to take place in another country, surely at that point it has failed to apply a precautionary principle.  I want to get a sense of where the Department stands on these issues.</p><p>Mr. Finnegan indicated he may be able to follow up around environmental impact assessments, which will obviously be key to this.  If the Department could follow up, it would useful to know what public resources - staffing, financial and other - are available to support environmental impact assessments, how that has changed in the past year or two and what the plan is for the following number of years.  It is clear that this is a tool that we will need more and earlier in processes.  I am a bit concerned that we might take the approach we have taken in the past, namely, one where we try to apply it in fewer and fewer cases rather than trying to resource it in a better way.  If Mr. Finnegan does not have the information to hand, perhaps he will provide some written answers.</p></speech>

The points she makes are very valid and I would take them nearly as advice.  She is right that a lead agency can be very useful.  We are at a very early stage here and when we are thinking about transposing this directive when it takes its final form, establishing lead responsibility, if it is possible, could be a very valuable thing to do.<br/><br/>The Senator also made a very good point on another issue.  Expressly, the Commission has said it is tightening the definitions so that they are harmonised.  At the moment, with what one might call looser definitions, different member states have ended up with different interpretations.  There is obviously a risk that tightening something also narrows it, which may exclude something one wanted to include.  That is exactly the sort of scrutiny that will be needed as we follow this through the Council, and as the D&aacute;il and Seanad continue to follow this also, in order that we do not have unintended effects as we try to tighten and refine our definitions.<br/><br/>The questions the Senator is raising are powerful and go to the heart of what will have to be decided in Council.  It is the interaction between this legislation and our criminal law because the ideas of <i>mens rea</i>, negligence and criminalising, as the Senator stated, a breach of the precautionary principle would represent a change in our criminal law.  That is exactly the sort of issue we are at the start of addressing with the Department of Justice.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that we are in a particular position as a member state because with the exit of the United Kingdom, Ireland, unlike just about any other member state, has a common law system.  This means there is a significant difference between our criminal justice system and those of other member states.  In recognition of this, Articles 1, 2 and 4a of Protocol 21 on the position of what was then the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, justice and security, which is annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, states that we actually have an option not to take part in this measure, if it proves impossible to reconcile that with our common law criminal justice system.  All I can say on that is that the full implications of the measure are still being considered.  Necessary legal advice will be obtained from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in due course.  That will give us a clear sense as to whether Ireland will be able to participate and how we can participate in it.  If it is proposed to participate, it is a matter that will be formally considered by Government and thereafter by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  <br/><br/>We made a declaration at the time of that protocol indicating that we intended to opt in to this type of area to the maximum extent possible.  That approach will be adopted here.  However, the Senator raises very difficult and important issues, including that something drafted and legislated for in a system in another member state does not automatically work here.  We need to ensure the language has the intended effect.  More work will be done on that and we will return to the Government and Oireachtas on that question.</p></speech>

I will add to Senator Higgins&rsquo;s question on the timeframe for this discussion.  Mr. Finnegan stressed that we are at a very early stage, and I appreciate that a great deal of work needs to be done.  There is perhaps a conflict across member states with regard to how they deal with wildlife and environmental crime and so on.  What is the thinking in the Department in respect of the fact that this EU legislation could be coming down the tracks and it may or may not go anywhere?  Is there a view in the Department that this is a parallel process which will not influence reforms nationally?  Are we going to get on with improving our legislation on environmental crime?  I am concerned that the signalling of this legislation from Europe could put a stay on improving the situation here at home.</p></speech>

It would probably be a very poor mark for Ireland if we tried to opt out of progress on environmental legislation, whatever about the UK.

Agreed.</p> <p>  COM (2021) 803 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and Council on common rules for the internal markets in renewable and natural gases and hydrogen.  COM (2021) 804 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council on the internal markets for renewable and natural gases and hydrogen.  COM (2021) 805 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council on methane emissions reduction in the energy sector and amending regulation.  Following the engagement of this committee, this committee will make a decision on whether it is necessary that a reasoned opinion is sent to the D&aacute;il on these particular proposals.  Mr. Regan has an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.47" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#F01400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the committee the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the hydrogen and decarbonised gas market package and the regulation of methane emissions.  On 15 December 2021, the European Commission published two legislative proposals revising the 2009 gas directive and gas regulation, with the aim of decarbonising the EU gas market by facilitating the uptake of renewable and low-carbon gases, including hydrogen.</p> <p>  The underlying aim of the proposals is to create the conditions for a shift from fossil natural gas to renewable and low-carbon gases, in particular biomethane and hydrogen.  They seek to establish a market for hydrogen by creating the right environment for investment and enabling the development of dedicated infrastructure.  The proposed new market rules will cover access to hydrogen infrastructure, separation of hydrogen production and transport activities and tariff setting.  The intention is that they will be applied in two phases, before and after 2030.</p> <p>  There will be a flexible regulatory regime up to 2030.  However, after 2030 it is clearly signalled that the rules will be similar to the current rules for natural gas, for example, that hydrogen network operators must be fully ownership-unbundled and regulated tariffs and open access to networks will apply.  The new rules are intended to make it easier for renewable and low-carbon gases to access the existing gas grid by removing tariffs for cross-border interconnections and lowering tariffs at injection points.</p> <p>  Another priority of the package is consumer empowerment and protection.  Similar to the provisions already applicable in the electricity market, the package provides for consumers to switch suppliers more easily, use effective price comparison tools, get accurate, fair and transparent billing information, and have better access to data and new smart technology.</p> <p>  In regard to the matter of security of energy supply, under the proposals for gas regulation amendments are also proposed to strengthen the resilience of the gas system, with a particular focus on the role of gas storage.  On 15 December 2021, the European Commission also published its proposals for a regulation on methane emissions.  The legislative proposal on methane emissions reduction in the energy sector would establish a new EU legal framework that requires oil, gas and coal companies within the EU to measure, report and verify their methane emissions.  It also proposes that importers of fossil fuels would be required to submit information about how their suppliers perform measurement, reporting and verification of their emissions and how they mitigate those emissions with a view to the Commission introducing more stringent measures on fossil fuel imports by 2025. </p> <p>  The aim of decarbonising the EU gas market by facilitating the uptake of renewable and low carbon gases is in line with the EU&rsquo;s climate targets and will help to support the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s ambition set out under last year's climate action plan.  The proposals for hydrogen in regard to market access, a transitionary approach to regulation and arrangements to move from a natural gas system are considered to be positive proposals, although they need detailed consideration.</p><p>Similarly, the proposals on gas security and integrated planning across electricity, natural gas and hydrogen should help support a planned approach to the energy transition.  However, all of the proposals need to be carefully assessed in the context of Ireland no longer being directly connected to the EU market, now that the UK has left the European Union.  The provisions to mirror consumer rights in the electricity market to those in the gas market, such as improving the ease of switching supplier, greater transparency in billing information and more effective price comparison tools, are positive developments.  The proposed regulation on methane includes key transparency measures that are an important first step in addressing the methane associated with natural gas imported into the EU.  However, the proposals do not go as far as national policy envisages.  In particular, the Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas, published in May 2021, sets out that the Government will work with like-minded European states to promote and support changes to European energy laws in order to allow the importation of fracked gas to be restricted.</p><p> On Friday, 18 February, the Department launched a consultation to gather the views of stakeholders and interested parties on this package, which will inform the further development of Ireland's position on the proposals.  The closing date is Friday, 15 April.</p></speech>

If I may, I will go first this time.  I have a considerable concern about these proposals, and I believe it is reflected in Mr. Regan's opening statement, which is that there is no distinction being made between green hydrogen, which is something that we would pursue probably quite vigorously in Ireland because we have the renewable energy resource, and other forms of hydrogen, particularly those that are created using fossil fuels.  If we, as the continent of the EU, go down the road here with hydrogen we must be very careful that we do not save the fossil fuel industry by giving it a route via generating hydrogen using processes other than electrolysis of renewable electricity.  This is a serious concern I have about these.</p> <p>  My other concern is about how we use hydrogen and how we will use hydrogen.  It seems to me that these proposals suggest that hydrogen would be mixed with natural gas to lower its carbon intensity.  That is just about the worst use of hydrogen we can have.  That is locking in gas use for a long time, for decades to come.  If we go down the road of saying that this is how we use hydrogen, it is a very inefficient use by the time the renewable  electricity has been converted to hydrogen.  One is injecting it into the grid for burning a boiler in somebody's home, which may only be 80% or 90% efficient.  There are very significant losses there.  We should directly electrify as much of our economy as possible, but where we are using hydrogen it should be where we have to use it.  If we are burning hydrogen in gas boilers and transporting hydrogen via the natural gas network, there are colossal losses in that.  It is not the best use of energy that we are going to create in the development of a scaled up renewable energy sector.  There are different ways to use it.  I have concerns that some of these directives are sending us down a path that is not the best use of the resources we have.  Perhaps Mr. Regan would care to comment.</p></speech>

There is pure renewable hydrogen, which is referred to as green hydrogen, and which Ireland supports.  They have created a second category called low-carbon hydrogen.  The test is that there must be 70% emissions reduction versus current levels.  There are a couple of points on that.  First of all, there are a limited amount of ways in which one can make hydrogen: renewable hydrogen and electricity from the grid.  If one is not located directly beside the renewable power station then one might take electricity with some level of carbon.  That is the question.  Low carbon gases would seem to fall into this category.  Nevertheless, there is still the ability to create hydrogen from fossil fuels, for example, without carbon capture and storage, CCS, which would not even fall in that category.  As the Chairman has said, one is simply replacing one fossil fuel with another form of fossil fuels.  That does seem to be an issue that needs to be addressed.  The Commission has not addressed it in a way that stops it, essentially.  Rather, it has addressed it in a way to incentivise the other two of renewable hydrogen and low-carbon hydrogen.  That issue is going to have to be resolved.  Where we are today is that the hydrogen in Europe is largely made of natural gas and it is done without carbon capture and storage, so it is not a good process, and I would certainly not want to see an extension of that process.</p> <p>  On the use of hydrogen, yes we absolutely want to see a focus on where the use of hydrogen in Ireland should be.  We intend to do a consultation on that very question during the year leading up to the next climate action plan.  In the positive sense, we have some good signals.  We will be developing offshore renewable electricity, which could be a good source for hydrogen.  With hydrogen use in Ireland we know that heating will focus on energy efficiency, district heating and electric heat pumps.  It is not an obvious place for hydrogen to be used in Ireland.  Similarly, with transport it is about public transport and electric vehicles.  The likely home for this in transport, if it is to be used in transport, would be for heavy duty vehicles, maritime and possibly aviation somewhat further down the line.</p> <p>  I echo what the Chairman has said, that this should be used after energy efficiency and after electrification.  The benefit is that it can find to those difficult to decarbonise places, for example high-temperature heating in industry, which is proving very difficult to decarbonise.</p> <p>  That would be Ireland's approach as is set out in the climate action plan.  Through our scrutiny of this legislation we must assess whether the gate is too open and that we do not go in the direction of the fossil fuels.  We must also recognise that each member state will need some differences.  For example, Ireland is not a heavy industry country compared with others, so they might put more of their hydrogen there versus our use.  There will be some changes but ideally not enough that fossil fuels would be the answer.</p></speech>

It sounds at odds with one of the major suppliers of energy, which I believe does want to go down the low-carbon gas route.  Is that the position of the Department now, that we do not see hydrogen in the natural gas grid in the way we are going?</p></speech>

That will be there.  What we must work out, through our consultations, is the transition period.  Essentially, Ireland has no market and if there is a role for the natural gas grid, it must be asked whether it is injection or for a period where it is put in and used for specific customer uses such as high-temperature heating.  There may be value there.  For example, those customers who use high-temperature heating in Ireland would typically use natural gas and they are connected to the gas grid.  There may be such cases that makes sense.  With the package, over time the idea is to transfer completely to hydrogen and with the transition there may be some scenarios where it would make sense, but possibly not for heating homes and other certain areas like that.</p></speech>

One of the areas that interests me is what Mr. Regan had to say about consumer protection.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities was before the committee last week and we discovered that of the 72,000 premises that now have smart meters only 44,000 of those have been offered the opportunity to switch to cheaper off-peak or renewable electricity.</p><p>This directive is designed to respond to that.  Why is it so low in Ireland?  Will it take this directive to change behaviour?  Is there capacity to anticipate some of the expectations of this legislation?  The officials might tell us exactly what requirements will be placed on companies to ensure smart meters are used.  </p><p> We do not have what Mr. Regan described as useful advanced information about customers' bills being presented in a timely way which would facilitate ease of switching.  We have completely the opposite, with maximum friction put in and minimum information to allow customers to avoid much higher charges than are necessary.  What protections and obligations are going to be placed on companies and how soon are we likely to see them in Ireland?  Could we move ahead of the legislation to introduce such protections?  A lot of consumers are under considerable pressure at the moment.</p></speech>

The case for smart metering in gas is slightly weaker than electricity given that gas can be balanced over a longer period.  Essentially it is not real-time balanced by the grid operator.  The pricing signal is daily, essentially, not half hourly like the electricity.  This is recognised in the legislation which provides that each member state must do a mandatory cost-benefit assessment, CBA, as to whether smart meters for electricity and gas make sense.  However, Article 19 of the directive provides that the customer be given the right to get one anyway.  There is a CBA basis for each member state to do it if it makes sense in their countries.  Even if that is negative, the customer has a right to a smart meter.  That is enshrined in the legislation.  Before I turn to Deputy Bruton's second question, on what the Commission proposed in respect of hydrogen, there is an opportunity here to set up the hydrogen market learning from the lessons of the gas and electricity market.  They are saying that from day one, every meter for hydrogen is to be smart.  There will be no old-fashioned meters, as it were.</p> <p>  There are several articles pertaining to consumer empowerment.  There are basic contractual rights, including to transparent information on prices and tariffs, a wide choice of payment methods and plain and unambiguous language.  There is also a right to switch within no more than three weeks.  If the Deputy wanted to switch today, the switch would be complete within three weeks.  There is also a mandatory comparison tool.  Each member state must have an easily usable comparison tool that customers can access free of charge to understand their different products.</p> <p>  Finally, something new in gas that will probably follow electricity is the right to be an "active customer".  In electricity that mean a solar panel on one's roof that connects to the grid.  There is work to be done in gas but it could be small bio-methane on a farm, for example.  There will be a right to get to the grid and access one's renewable gas into the system.  There is a suite of measures in this legislation for gas which mirror those in electricity.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if it is possible to do these.  The answer is "Yes".  It is something we can discuss with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in terms of examining the provisions and assessing which of them could be brought forward ahead of the legislation.  We do not expect the legislation to be dealt with in this Presidency but most likely in the next Presidency, that of Czechia, in the latter part of the year.</p></speech>

At the weekend it emerged that half the calls made to some banks are abandoned because no one answers.  Could legislation like this make it a requirement that companies report on their responses to calls and have a minimum requirement that customers can contact them and avail of all the wonderful protections Mr. Regan has outlined?  If they cannot make contact with their provider it is all set at naught.</p></speech>

While there is no reference to the point the Deputy raises, it is certainly something we can take away and consider.  The timing provision is in respect of the time to switch when someone has made the decision and confirmed it.  There is no timing restriction on the point at which a person is trying to access their current provider.  That is something we can take away and seek to raise through the legislation.  This legislation will apply to gas specifically.  There is an opportunity here in the switching articles, and there are several of them, to get it right.</p></speech>

I have a bit of a problem with using hydrogen on its own.  We should be more specific about bringing in hydrogen.  I was delighted to introduce a Bill on green hydrogen strategy a couple of weeks ago with Sinn F&eacute;in's climate spokesperson, Deputy Darren O'Rourke.  We are really going to need a key fuel source if we are going to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Green hydrogen has really good potential not just for heating homes but also for transport.  I am a Deputy for North Kildare, which has turned into something of a logistics hub for heavy goods vehicles.  Electricity is not going to be able to meet that.  We are on the western edge of Europe.  We have an abundance of offshore wind and we are ready to harness that potential.  Despite the millions spent on consultants and advisors, Ireland does not even have a green hydrogen strategy.  Scotland had one in 2015 and the European Commission had one in 2020.  We cannot just depend on the private sector to be able to meet our climate targets.  Do the officials have any comment on that?  Do they have any comments on the fact that we do not have a green hydrogen strategy in Ireland yet?</p></speech>

It creates the market for hydrogen and the network access for that market.  It is facilitative.  It still allows Ireland to make its own choices as to how it creates the hydrogen and where it is used.  We operate within the market but we are allowed that choice.  Our intention is to have a hydrogen strategy within the climate action plan for 2022.  The timing is quite opportune in terms of where we are today.  The 2021 climate action plan sets out those points I made earlier as to where the hydrogen opportunities will largely be in Ireland, given that we are making developments in offshore wind, for example.  There are a lot of actions relating to hydrogen within the climate action plan 2021.  There is research going on within Government Departments.  The SEAI also has a programme of research.  I assure the Deputy that there is work going on from the last climate action plan and many actions that will feed in to where we are.  In terms of stepping forward now to our own hydrogen strategy, on top of the climate action plan we now also have this legislation, which is really important because it sets the market and arrangements that the strategy will be based on.  It is a key piece.</p><p>Our intention is to consult on the strategy in the coming months and the summer in order that we are then ready to have the hydrogen strategy as part of the climate action plan for 2022.  I agree that this is an opportune moment.  We now have the basis for our actions in the climate action plan for 2021.  This is not agreed legislation but at least it shows clearly the pathway for the market and we can now prepare our strategy on that basis.</p></speech>

As for our energy supply, we know what it going on globally.  Our trucks need to be able to move and our homes need to be heated.</p></speech>

I mentioned the SEAI.  It has a research role.  Looking at the legislation, there will be roles for others.  We need competent authorities to set up and to regulate the market.  Our Department will have to prepare a strategy and identify how that will develop.  There is a significant need for investment and innovation in hydrogen.  Currently, the scale of hydrogen production by renewable means is quite small, so fostering research and development and working with our agencies on that will probably be one of the key things we can do to instigate this market.  Working with our European partners and fellow member states will be fundamental too, as will having a market and European access to that research and sharing.  I think there will be both, as Deputy Cronin said.  We need private investment, but Departments and Government agencies will have a key role.</p></speech>

I will understand if this question might be deferred to the strategy, but are subsidies for hydrogen seen as part of enabling the market and the sector in this country?  Is that the thinking in the Department?</p></speech>

The strategy will be developed.  We will consult on the different options.  I think we will look at other member states and see what they are doing.  We have a renewable heat obligation in the current climate action plan, so there will be an obligation on heat and we will see how that could work.  We have some schemes that may be adaptable to hydrogen.  As for the scale and extent of that, frankly, there is more work to do through the year.</p></speech>

The committee has agreed to do a significant piece of work in the next five weeks on that bigger ambition, that is, the west coast offshore potential of 30 GW as opposed to 5 GW.  That is very much coupled with green hydrogen.  We intend to bring in a series of stakeholders to discuss that and we may reach out to the Department again during that series of sessions we will do.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins is waiting to speak.</p></speech>

Deputy Cronin's framing of this is really useful, and I think it would be useful if that were the framing at EU level.  We should start mentioning green hydrogen every time we mention hydrogen.  One of my concerns relates to the issue of green hydrogen and the important role hydrogen can plan as a supplement and a support to electrification.  The area that electrification may not be able to reach through green hydrogen has been muddied a little by placing it in the hydrogen strategy.  As for the proposed new body, the European network of network operators for hydrogen, ENNOH, the concern is that green hydrogen may end up being a smaller player within that new network and that many of the oil and gas representative organisations will still be there.  I am interested in that push towards the Beyond Oil &amp;amp; Gas Alliance, to which Ireland has signed up, and the EU and US methane pledge.  Those are two really significant signals that Ireland sent as to where we stand on an exit from gas, recognising it as a fossil fuel.  How are those commitments Ireland has made factoring into the positions we are taking in the negotiations on these matters?</p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the infrastructure surrounding gas?  I am concerned that the EU directives as shaped at present still prolong that infrastructure.  Could the witnesses comment on such ideas as the banning of venting and flaring, which has been proposed, mandatory leak detection and repair and some of the other mitigation measures surrounding gas?  The problem is that when that infrastructure is kept in place, there is the challenge of decommissioning it.</p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the Energy Charter Treaty?  The European Parliament, I think just last week, produced yet another really strong opinion expressing concern about the treaty.  The concern is that if, in full knowledge of climate impacts and of what the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, is telling us, that is, that we need to have exited from gas as a fossil fuel totally by 2035, if not 2030, we will create new strategies that will still lock that in and create hostages to fortune under the Energy Charter Treaty at the exact same time as Europe is trying to lessen the impact of the treaty.  We have had environmental policies come up against the treaty, and I am worried that if we create new environmental policies that embed the use of gas, we will make it extremely hard for countries to then exit from gas.</p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on those matters?  I referred to the Beyond Oil &amp;amp; Gas Alliance, the EU-US methane pledge, the Energy Charter Treaty and the dangers of a lock-in of gas there that would make policy choices down the line harder.  I also asked a question about the mechanics, the decommissioning, the fluting and all those damaging aspects of the infrastructure.</p></speech>

She is quite right that the Energy Charter Treaty is a moving field.  I think there was a case at the start of the month in Belgium, and it is very much moving.  Our Department is engaging with other member states and the Commission on that and on where it is at.  There is a review ongoing, so it is a relevant topic.</p> <p>  As for fossil fuels and fossil fuel infrastructure, if I may deal with those in one response, the package has some interesting proposals on fossil fuels and their reduction over time.  I will focus on just a couple of them.  First, it now includes an express requirement for planning of gas infrastructure and its decommissioning in the plans of infrastructure companies, so decommissioning is an actual requirement to be addressed.  The second thing it does is allow for a transfer of assets from a natural gas pipeline to a hydrogen pipeline.  As Senator Higgins said, there will be hydrogen grid operators and natural gas grid operators, and the legislation allows, quite simply, for a pipeline to move from one asset base of natural gas to hydrogen.  It is essentially a roadway away from fossil fuels.  Third, there is an express provision in the legislation that member states cannot enter long-term contracts for natural gas beyond 2049.  A long-term contract for gas is a one-year contract.  This is the first time we have seen an actual obligation that member states simply cannot buy long-term contracts beyond that period.</p> <p>  As for the methane pledge, this legislative proposal goes part of the way towards it.  The methane regulation covers energy methane.  I will focus on emissions outside EU borders rather than inside them because the majority of methane from fossil fuel use in Europe occurs outside our borders, so it is a matter of importation.  The legislation will now require importers to provide information on those methane emissions upstream.  The Commission has signalled that, with that information, and by no later than the end of 2025, it will consider if further obligations are required.  I think this is a world first in that the Commission is looking at methane production beyond the borders of where it is used.</p><p>That is going to be a very key piece of the methane pledge.  </p><p> The whole purpose of this legislation is to facilitate renewable and low-carbon gases.  I want to signal with regard to low-carbon gases and the definition I mentioned earlier of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the details of that will be done through a delegated Act, to be done by 2024.  In initial discussions I have heard it raised that people would like certainty on that earlier rather than waiting three years.  That is something we will also need to consider.  Do we need three years to settle that discussion?</p></speech>

If we are signing contracts on fossil fuels up until the year before we are meant to be at net zero, it could be seen as very bad faith.  We have seen rapid changes in ambition over the last few years and we would effectively be in a situation where we have contracts which mean we cannot meet net zero in advance of 2050.  The reference to 2049 was not something of which I was aware of and I just wanted to signal my concern.  I agree with the Chairman's comments on low-carbon gases.  Rather than having a plan for low-carbon gases by 2024 or strategies for integrating them into our system, we should be looking to exit low-carbon gases closer to that point.</p></speech>

The contracts have to end, essentially, by 2049.  On the second question around low-carbon gases, we must take it away and consider it more too.  There are circumstances where we might have an electrolyzer using electricity from the grid.  Ireland is going to be at 80% renewables by 2030 so it may make sense to use that electricity.  It might not be located right beside a wind farm, for example.  While the principles should be fairly straightforward, there are some details to be worked out in terms of making sure that the rules allow for different credible and reasonable scenarios.</p></speech>

The fear is that the roll-out of our own green hydrogen, offshore wind and floating offshore wind will be delayed if we leave the door open to the development of grey hydrogen which would be sourced from fossil fuels.  We have to stress those concerns.  I also echo the Chairman's point about the importance of this committee feeding in to the proposals and strategy going forward.</p> <p>  My fear is that we are potentially leaving two gates open, the first one being to grey hydrogen and the second to the importation of fracked gas through LNG infrastructure, in general.  In his opening statement, Mr. Regan referred to the importance of gas storage in the context of energy security.  There certainly has to be a place for gas storage in terms of a backup energy supply but one would hope that in the Irish scenario that would be done using the existing interconnectors.  I am fearful, not just in an Irish context but also in a European context, that this type of proposal and the encouragement of gas storage would potentially lead to the proliferation of LNG terminals.  Ireland has made quite a strong statement with its resistance to future LNG terminals being built but it is important that such an approach is Europe wide.  </p> <p>  At the end of his statement, Mr. Regan said that the proposals do not go as far as national policy envisages around the importation of fracked gas.  I am concerned that this represents another opportunity for the fossil fuel industry to delay the inevitable.  Mr. Regan referred to the definition of low-carbon energy or hydrogen energy coming forward in 2024 but we need to start getting these things defined now and proposals set out on moving away from fossil fuels all together.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#K00700"><p>In response to the Deputy's question on gas storage, I will try to clarify what is in the legislation on that.  It is not seeking new investment in gas storage; rather the legislation provides that member states have the right to ask their gas pipeline operator to ensure that there is a certain level of gas in the storage reservoir that is currently there.  Gas storage levels have been decreasing in recent years which means that when we hit winter, and if the weather is particularly cold, it puts the system under stress with price rises.  There is nothing in the package to facilitate new investment in storage.  Rather it provides that during the winter, if there are concerns, there is enough gas in storage to manage the peak essentially.</p> <p>  In terms of what is proposed in the legislation versus Ireland's position, which the Deputy correctly described, the approach lends itself to that in the sense that it seeks to gather data on the full life-cycle emissions of gas imports.  The Commission has raised the flag that before 2025, once it has that data and evidence, it will look to strengthen the position.  Step A is to get the data and evidence and step B is to act.  This means that essentially with high-emission gas like fracked gas, for example, steps can be taken to reduce its use.  It will lend itself to the discussion and to the Irish position.  We will have to consider how we build it into the discussion but it is certainly very helpful for opening that debate.</p> <p>  Another proposal from the Commission, which is also new, is to set up a system of global monitoring of methane.  The Commission will be able to see where methane emissions are occurring across the globe and then, using diplomatic language, it will let countries know, in the first instance, that there is a methane issue.  That is a positive proposal.</p> <p>  Finally, on hydrogen, the package is designed with a lot of incentives for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.  It is designed around a suite of incentives for them.  It is also designed to reduce fossil fuel use.  Frankly, we need to do more scrutiny to see how it all knits together because while this is a gas package, it also involves the electricity system, the natural gas system and the hydrogen system.  We are working through it to understand the implications.  While not wanting to complicate matters too much, it is also very much linked to the renewable energy directive, the definitions therein and how it all knits together.  The Deputy's points are well made and we are trying to understand the implications for different sectors.</p></speech>

Is that related to these proposals?</p></speech>

The member states would not contract it but would make rules so that there are certain levels of storage in the reservoirs.  We do not have a gas storage reservoir in Ireland.  We used to have one in south-west Kinsale but that has been decommissioned.  There are rules to allow member states to hold that storage in other member states but that is somewhat complicated for us, obviously, now that the UK has left the EU.</p></speech>

All members of this committee are clear that we do not want any new LNG infrastructure in Ireland.  I note other news from the past 24 hours.  The Shell oil company expects a doubling of the LNG market by 2040.  Members can see where this is going.  This is not a quick exit from fossil fuels.  In many respects, we see them being locked in.  I welcome the proposal to look at methane leakage outside the EU, because that is largely the problem with fracked gas.  There is research to suggest that there is significant methane leakage from fracking operations, especially in North America, and that it has a substantial contributory effect to increasing global temperatures.  It is important that we get this right.  As Mr. Regan said, it is a world first.  It is critical that we do not rely on fracked LNG, whatever about LNG from conventional sources.</p></speech>

We can reduce the demand.  There is a suite of proposals in the climate action plan for 2021.  I know the retrofit plan was launched just a couple of weeks ago.  Reducing the energy we use is the first and probably the best tool that we have.  We need more renewable sources for the energy we use.  Every wind turbine built means a bit less natural gas or oil will be used.  Electrification of transport also helps.  Implementation of the policies now set out is the key tool.</p></speech>

The concern is Europe and countries that may not have the renewable resources that we have.  They may rely on fossil fuels, albeit cleaner fossil fuels.  Maybe the path for Ireland is to say that we are not just going to supply clean energy to our own market but also to Europe too, to make it easier for Europe to get to net-zero emissions.</p></speech>

Other European countries can take advantage of the countries with better resources for renewable energy.  For example, solar energy is better in southern Europe.  Maybe this is not a matter for me to comment on, but those countries are more exposed to natural gas supply issues than Ireland, because Ireland is connected to the UK, which has a diverse source of gases, whereas countries in eastern Europe are more exposed.  The appetite for action will be strong among member states.</p></speech>

I am sorry that I did not get in earlier in the first round.  The heat study announced today showed that Ireland is doing poorly when it comes to renewable energy and heat.  That is concerning, especially when the climate action plan was just laid down.  As the Chair said, there will be a greater reliance on LNG globally.  The programme for Government states that the Government will not invest in more LNG.  We need to ensure that we do not go down the wrong route as we deal with these crises.  We can clearly see that Ireland has the natural resources.  Will the witnesses comment on what we can do with regard to the heat study and how these regulations will help us to get to where we need to be?  We have a concern about the EU taxonomy, which we have raised with the Minister for Finance.  We are concerned that it may benefit those investing in fossil fuel industries and create a relatively difficult financial situation for those involved in renewable sources.  We may be getting further away from our targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#L00600"><p>I will address the heat study first.  It is true that Ireland has a low level of renewable heat.  We are at about the European average for renewable electricity and for renewable energy in transport.  We are at about one third of the European average for renewable heat.  The European percentage is in the high teens and we are at 6% or 7%.  The main purpose of the heat study was to look at how we get out of this.  It does not just look at 2030 but also at 2050.  It looks at how Ireland's heat sector should be to have net-zero emissions by 2050.  2030 is a milestone but the question is about how we get to net zero.  It was only published today, so I accept the Senator will not have the details.  There are a few key answers.  Mr. Regan mentioned them earlier.  Electrification of heat, both direct electrification and via heat pumps, is a substantial factor in heat in buildings.  Another matter is district heating in denser areas.  The report highlights the need to address higher temperature heat and for another zero-carbon energy carrier besides electricity, which is where green hydrogen comes in, particularly in higher-temperature industries.  That ties back into the package that we are talking about.</p> <p>  The heat study adds to Ireland's journey or pathway.  It shows that we have a specific issue and what different things we need to do.  The study fits neatly into recent Government policies, such as the retrofit scheme, with the idea of electrifying the heat in our residential building stock.  It identifies gaps, such as the heat in our commercial building stock, and how we use higher temperature heat for industry.  Mr. Regan mentioned the idea of a renewable heat obligation.  One can look at how we are doing so well compared with the European average for electricity or renewable energy for transport.  Schemes in both of those sectors socialise the cost across all consumers.  The public service obligation, PSO, in our electricity bills pays for wind energy and will soon also cover solar energy.  The biofuels obligation scheme in the transport sector requires a certain proportion of the energy used in the transport sector to be renewable.  Fuel pump handles are marked with either B7 or E5, which means up to 5% of petrol or 7% of diesel is renewable.  The Minister for Transport has published a policy statement and increased the biofuels obligation rate for this year again.  That is increasing, but the cost is socialised.</p> <p>  There was a consultation before Christmas on a renewable heat obligation.  It is a similar scheme to the biofuels obligation.  That consultation was extended, because there were concerns about the cost, which we would share.  When we talk about socialising costs, that means that energy prices might increase for consumers.  We are acutely aware of that when examining how we decarbonise heat and pay for it.  That is a challenge we are looking at.  The Senator made a point on the heat study.  We view the study as a blueprint of what 2050 should look like.  The policies and measures that we put in place now should be in keeping with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#L00700"><p>Issues relating to investment include measures for socialisation of the cost and another key element, which is how investment is supported in some types of fuel but not in others.</p><p>That goes back to the point I made about EU taxonomy, which while not directly related, is an example of how we can move away from promoting renewables over something else, from an investment point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#M00200"><p>I might move that back and use hydrogen as an example.  Most people will agree that the use of hydrogen in the high-temperature heat sector is something Ireland should pursue.  The renewable heat obligation consultation proposed giving a higher weighting to certain fuels, such as green hydrogen.  It was proposed that if a unit of green hydrogen was used instead of a unit of biofuels or bioliquid for heat, it would have a multiplier effect.  That would bridge the cost gap so that a greater weighting value could be placed on certain types of development technologies or fuels that we want to incentivise.  There are ways and means of doing that as the policies and measures are developed.  Again, I suppose it is about having a view of the outcome that we see and need.  I agree that we cannot just have a market; there certainly need to be incentivisations.  If we look back at the gas regulation and directive that has been proposed by the EU Commission, we can see these tariff reductions.  The regulation and directive do not contain everything on hydrogen, but there are significant reductions in entry tariffs of putting hyrdogen into the grid, etc.  That is a way of promoting it above other fuels.  There are definitely ways and means of doing it.  That is what we need to focus on.</p></speech>

We are going to do a series of sessions on that, and building energy as it extends to the policies that have been launched in the past few weeks, including those on the retrofitting scheme and so on.  Does Senator Higgins want to come in again?</p></speech>

One relates to LNG.  It is positive that there is an inquiry and a focus on emissions at production point, as the witnesses mentioned.  It is in line with some of the scoped rethinking around emissions captures.  There is huge concern around methane emissions from fracking, in particular.  It is the question on the locking-in of imports.  A previous regime in the US was looking at withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.  There is a concern - and perhaps the witnesses might comment on it - about how we would basically insulate if, for example, infrastructure around the importation of LNG was put in place, contracts associated with that infrastructure were concluded, and subsequently, we found ourselves in a position where a country, such as the US, decided to roll back on any monitoring or proper engagement on methane.</p> <p>  I will ask two or three specific questions.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen, ENNOH, which is a new body that has been proposed to regulate the hydrogen market, and the concern that at the moment there does not seem to be a requirement for unbundling.  Oil and gas producers could effectively play a key role in that new regulation of hydrogen space if they also have a hydrogen division.  Again, I highlight the importance of separating that.  Of course, it does create a tension and a conflict of interest if major gas companies are playing a key role in hydrogen.  That, of course, pushes us towards green hydrogen again.  </p> <p>  The Chairman asked a question on the grid.  Is the vision electrification with support for electrification from green hydrogen or a new version of gas infrastructure with perhaps a little more green hydrogen in there?  They are almost different visions for what comes next in Europe.  They are major questions regarding investment.  That is why Ireland really should champion the fight against the dilution of the taxonomy.  Ireland is in a position to paint that picture of green hydrogen as a supplement to electrification image and, indeed, to support that across Europe.  In respect of the taxonomy piece, if there is dilution, it will not only mean investment going in to gas, gas infrastructure and the prolongation of gas infrastructure, but it is also investment that will go against the truly sustainable future in terms of green hydrogen.  There is a tension.  I ask the witnesses to comment on whether Ireland is really championing that alternative vision.  Do we see that there is a conflict?  Is it the case that the interests of green hydrogen not necessarily being fully represented within the gas infrastructure narrative, and in fact, may be at odds with it in that sense?  While it can be a part of gas infrastructure, it is always going to be downstream in terms of investment, particularly when we see developments like the Nordstream 2 pipeline. In terms of security for the long term, we know there is greater security in a truly renewable source.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022022200002#M00500"><p>In the first instance, the ENNOH acronym is quite difficult.  It is a European hydrogen network operator.  The principle behind that is there is an existing network for electricity and for gas.  It basically makes the transmission system operators co-operate to facilitate a European market.  Largely, the network is born out of a previous gas crisis where it was found that the grids could transfer gas around Europe, but the rules and the market conditions were not there to facilitate it.  It was imposed on the gas network operators for that purpose.  It has proven to work very well.  Hence, we have a proposal for a new network for hydrogen.  It is important to note that the hydrogen network is separate from the electricity grid operator network and the gas operator network.  Co-ordinated plans must be made at member state level for all three - hydrogen, electricity and natural gas - so that we avoid having plans that essentially do not talk to each other and the line.  There are unbundling rules within this package for hydrogen.  Essentially, there is some flexibility up to 2030.  It is expected that as hydrogen develops, there will essentially be small clusters in member states, which over time will develop into a full hydrogen market.  I think the Commissioner is saying that investors can have some flexibility this decade in that investment and in creating hydrogen networks.  However, the Commission has been very clear from the outset that there is unbundling of operators and transmissions from 2030.  It is a good signal from the Commission.  It has been challenging, as I am sure Deputies and Senators will be aware, in gas and electricity.  The advantage here is that we have a clean slate almost.  The Commission is clear on the rules.</p> <p>  On the question of the vision, I look on this proposal quite positively in the overall sense, in that it creates a market for renewable gases and low-carbon gases.  It is very good.  It is a separate market to the current natural gas market.  It is a very complex package and there are levers in there.  We need to carefully consider and understand what the effect of those levers would be.  In terms of the overall vision, the focus is towards a net-zero 2050.  There will be a pathway to that objective, depending on different roads, such as blending and transitioning.  Currently, 10% of natural gas in Europe is used for hydrogen.  If that could be switched to renewable gas, that would be quite a dramatic change in Europe's gas imports and Ireland's.  The vision of the climate action plan is clear on energy efficiency,  and electrification.  Hydrogen will also have a key role in those hard to abate sectors.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Miley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to meet with them today on this important issue.  We have supplied the committee with a detailed submission so I will keep my comments to the main points.  Our universities have clearly shown their value to the country and to society in the response to Covid-19 over the past couple of years.  The value of our skills and research was never more relevant to the lives of our people.  As we now seek to recover from the pandemic, our universities have an equally important role to play.</p> <p>  High-skilled jobs, centred on talent and innovation, will underpin our future economic, social and cultural development.  As a nation, we face a range of challenges in the areas of climate change, housing, healthcare and social services and balanced regional development.  The higher education and research system will provide the bedrock of talent and innovation to meet those challenges.  The need for a sustainable funding model for the sector, repeatedly emphasised by this committee, must now be delivered if the potential of the sector is to be fully realised.</p><p> There is now universal acceptance of the need to increase higher education funding.  The long-awaited Government response to the future funding of higher education, which we are told will soon be revealed, must be ambitious and sustainable and reflect the realities of the current challenges facing the sector.  Access to higher education has been a particular success story in Ireland, as members are aware, with the proportion of people between 25 and 34 with a third level qualification at around 60%, which is well above the EU average.  However, investment in higher education continues to lag behind our competitors, with total public expenditure on tertiary education as a proportion of GDP, or GNI* in the case of Ireland, at 0.6% as opposed to an OECD and EU 22 average of 1%.  This puts Ireland joint second last in OECD league tables.</p><p> Public investment in research also lags behind that in key competitor countries.  The government budget allocation on research and development, GBARD, is 0.92% of total Government expenditure by comparison with the EU average of 1.43%.  Again, we are way behind many other small countries, such as Norway, Denmark and Estonia, some of which have a GBARD close to 2%.  We need a 50% increase in GBARD just to grow to the average.</p><p> On future funding needs, the investment required in our higher education sector was clearly set out in the 2016 Cassells report.  It called for additional annual core funding of &euro;600 million by 2021 and &euro;1 billion by 2030, a capital investment programme of &euro;5.5 billion over 15 years and an additional &euro;100 million per year in student-support funding.  The report also stressed the need to front-load investment in the first three to five years.  The actual increase in State recurrent grant funding in real terms in 2021 amounted to &euro;121 million, considerably less than the &euro;600 million per annum identified by Cassells.  The employer levy is generating additional annual investment through the National Training Fund of &euro;190 million over 2017 levels.  It is clear, therefore, the additional funding of the sector in recent years has been provided to a significant extent by employers.  The State investment to date is only a fraction of that recommended in the Cassells report.</p><p> The IUA proposes an investment programme for the sector totalling &euro;418 million in additional recurrent funding and &euro;490 million in capital expenditure.  Our proposals, spelt out in detail in our submission to the committee, provide for a number of measures, including a decisive lift in core funding to support our students, address quality-related issues, and widen access and participation.  Increased SUSI grant supports must be part of the package.  Further measures include sustained investment in talent and skills as the lifeblood of the economy and investment to support lifelong learning, which is critical.  Investment in innovation and research to prepare Irish society for the challenges ahead and to enable us to compete internationally is another key component.  The continued expansion of access programmes to give a fair chance to disadvantaged students and ensure no student is penalised because of his or postcode at birth is critical.  Investment to support universities in harnessing opportunities to develop international partnerships and enhanced mobility for students comprise a further key priority.</p><p> Much of the reinvestment in the sector since 2016 has been absorbed by standstill requirements, such as costs for national pay agreements and additional student places, in respect of which there has been tremendous growth over the past two years, in particular.  However, standing still is no longer good enough if we are serious about the future talent and innovation needs of the country.</p><p> Our research-intensive universities, which we represent, will comprise a key partner in addressing the major societal and economic challenges we will face over the coming decades.  We can and will deliver the talent pipeline for a knowledge-intensive and high skills economy and the research and innovation to underpin economic and social development.  We can do this only if we are adequately funded on a sustainable basis.</p></speech>

I commend and refer members to our written submission.  This is the critical conversation.  An agreed sustainable funding approach is the essential prerequisite for a healthy system of higher education.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has signalled openness to a reduction in the student contribution.  Members will recall that THEA advised against any increase and argued against the introduction of student loans.  This was on the grounds of sustainability but also because our experience was the contribution was proving a barrier to access for individuals and families.  However, in introducing this topic, the Minister has signalled the opening to the future funding debate.  With the student contribution capped or even reduced, and the employer contribution having reached the 1% and realising a billion in available funding, the only advance can be in the direct Exchequer investment in higher education.  This points to prioritisation.</p> <p>  Ireland has many assets: we are well located and anglophone, enjoy a temperate climate and have a stable democracy.  However, our greatest asset and native genius lie in our people.  Investing in human capital is critical to our well-being, culture and future prosperity.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, stated recently, "Our further and higher education and research systems represent a critical national asset which can be an engine for economic growth and support the future success of our citizens."</p> <p>  The transformation to technological universities is the biggest educational change of our times.  We have an excellent design, commendable ambition and willing and talented staff.  Let us match these with necessary and sustained investment.  Our system is a critical national asset.  It needs to be prioritised for direct and sustained investment as this will be repaid with greater economic activity and the enhanced well-being of our citizenry.</p> <p>  The lack of sustainable core funding is becoming increasingly obvious in the areas of research and innovation, where time-limited capacity-building funding is being used to support initiatives that would more sustainably be funded from core.  THEA has repeatedly stated the research and innovation allocation through the recurrent grant must increase initially to 5% of the total, as was recommended by the Higher Education Authority in 2017, rising to the 10% allocation, as is the case in the traditional universities.  The recent announcement on a capital programme of &euro;450 million over four years is welcome.  It comprehends both further education and training and higher education, and we advocate continuing this investment.</p> <p>  The increase in student numbers is creating an unprecedented demand for suitable, affordable student accommodation, which has been exacerbated by the wider societal housing needs.  Technological universities have long sought access to the borrowing framework.  The investment metrics have changed and direct Government investment and reform of the cost rental model is required.</p> <p>  A further challenge relates to the lessons from Covid-19.  Students appreciated flexibility and online access to lectures.  The NextGenerationEU package and our resulting national recovery and resilience plan emphasise the power of the latest digital and online technologies.  This digitisation challenge has been a consistent feature of recent THEA budget submissions.  Covid has highlighted inequalities in terms of housing, income and cultural capital.  Students shouldered more than a fair share of the impact.  Considerable support was furnished by the Government and is acknowledged.  The lesson is we need to build additional capacity and resilience in our caring services with a view to providing more comprehensive and equitable support for learners.</p> <p>  The deprivation index scores published last week by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, provide a rich data set that should be mined to inform policymaking and targeted investment.  This is revealing about the character and added value of the technological sector.  The overall score for our member institutions is 1.3 compared with a national average of 2.  THEA member institutions represent eight of the 11 higher education institutions, with the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged areas.  The data also show our institutions have a distinctively local geographic footprint in respect of student profiles, serve their regional and local communities and provide access to higher education to some of the country's most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.  This has consequences for pedagogy and both learning and pastoral supports and needs to be reflected in the funding model.</p> <p>  In any given academic year, up to half of all first-year entrants will have gained a place on a basis other than leaving certificate attainment.  Our advanced entry agreements with the further education and training sector maximise the potential of those entry routes for students.  In 2020-2021, 25% of students from institutions represented by THEA were enrolled part time by comparison with 17% elsewhere.  Some 12% of students are registered as remote by comparison with 3% in other institutions.  Students facing particular challenges frequently benefit from supplementary teaching and learning support or additional time.</p> <p>   The total number of students enrolled in THEA member institutions increased by 23.7% from 2014-2015 to 2020-2021 by comparison with an increase of 15.6% elsewhere.  Data available to the Department show that, despite our focus on small group teaching and focused support for students with lower prior attainment, the student&ndash;staff ratio in these institutions has, for more than a decade, been significantly higher than elsewhere.  Notwithstanding, the most recent analysis of completion rates demonstrates a comparative success.</p> <p>  We advocate increased direct Exchequer investment commensurate with the ambitions for the system.  We believe the current funding model does not adequately address the diversity of needs.  There is insufficient weighting for student access and no weighting for the smaller student groups that our pedagogical model employs.</p><p>We believe the current funding model does not adequately address the diversity of needs.  There is insufficient weighting for student access and no weighting for the smaller student groups our pedagogical model employs.  Technological universities do not enjoy well established pipelines of philanthropy and alumni support.  At a time, therefore, when higher education is under major financial pressure the impact on technological TUs is comparatively greater and in this formative stage they require targeted support to deliver on balanced economic and regional development and access to education for all.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Diarmuid Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#C00300"><p>On behalf of the Higher Education Colleges Association, HECA, I thank the committee for inviting us to make this submission.  Future funding models must change to include all students, public and private, and must promote accessibility and progression.  HECA is proposing several ways in which funding should follow the student.  The committee should reiterate its predecessor committee's recommendations, which were made four years ago, that student supports be extended to private higher education institute, HEI, students.  This should include the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, disability, student assistant fund, Gaeltacht, mental health and well-being, digital and the disability access route to education, DARE, and higher education access route, HEAR, supports and be extended  to part-time and blended programmes.  We propose that ring-fenced quotas for delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, students in high-demand programmes should be introduced to guarantee them minimum numbers of positions.  Resources should target increasing learner participation from disadvantaged areas in all third-level pathways.  We stress that the committee should be mindful the participation rate in third level in Dublin 10 is 16% whereas in Dublin 6 it is 99%.</p> <p>  Published data show private sector average costs of &euro;6,500, yielding average savings of &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,500 per student per annum, indicate that if the argument is that money is not available, then cost economies should be availed of in the private sector.  That was the argument made against this committee&rsquo;s recommendation to the Civil Service, which said no money was available.  That is despite an amazing miracle where &euro;250 per student was found during Covid-19, which shows money can be found if the will is there.</p> <p>  The resources of private higher education should also be harnessed to address the increasing demographic and national skills challenges, which is already happening to some extent with Springboard, and to widen participation and lifelong learning.  Some governments utilise private HEIs to address national demands, for instance, Poland, Hungary, Spain and Japan.  Springboard has presented the successful precedent of providing thousands of students from all sections of society with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, validated qualifications in skills areas to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.  HECA providers have the physical and teaching capacity to ramp up provision to 57,000 places, if need be, on their programmes that are validated.  Given the skills shortage imperative, obstacles blocking the inclusion of private HEI representation at the National Skills Council and its regional skills fora should be removed.</p> <p>  In my view, random selection is an obscenity and should be eliminated.  That could be done by increasing places available to meet the demand for high points courses at the margin where random selection is necessitated.  Alternatively, randomly excluded students should be fully funded to study abroad and, in the long term, alternative private and public pathways should be funded to rid us of this obscenity.</p> <p>  Alternative pathways need to be supported by Government funding.  In certain instances this is happening, for example, with apprenticeships and traineeships, foundation courses, community further education and higher education colleges, but these should include transition to private institutions and would be more effective if that were the case.  Part-time, blended and online methods of attaining qualifications need to be considered.  Coherent stacking of micro-credentials should be considered.  Academic thinking is open to that.</p> <p>  The national forum for teaching and learning, effectively funding for continuing professional development, CPD, to support staff should be extended to private institutions.  We need to greatly expand a new generation of apprenticeships.  We need most of all to change the attitudes to apprenticeship funding.  We need a promotional campaign highlighting the career achievement of top-level people who started life as apprentices.  For instance, I do not think many people present will be aware that Peter Drucker started his life as an apprentice.  There are many such examples.  I will give an outstanding example in Ireland of a person who is alive and working - Ralf Brandst&auml;tter, the CEO of Volkswagen cars, who started life as an apprentice.  There are many more who started out as apprentices.  We need to get that message out.  Parents need to recognise an apprenticeship is a very effective way of starting one's career.  </p> <p>  On research and investment, we think the obstacles to private colleges being involved in research tenders should be removed.  I acknowledge we need to do more research.</p> <p>  We recognise that the question of loans is politically toxic but the reality is that families and students are increasingly relying on expensive commercial loans to attend higher education.  We propose a not-for-profit student loan company should be established to support students attending HEIs.  This would not be a substitute for fees and current supports but would be additional in assisting access for people who are already very hard-pressed.   </p> <p>  The European fund for strategic investment skills and education aims to offer financing options through financial intermediaries to be made available to students who meet its criteria.  We think this is a distinct possibility and should the committee favour this, we would be happy to develop the proposal further.   It is an opportunity for students to get funding.  It is important that it would be done through a not-for-profit means.  It should not be used to increased the profit of financial institutions.</p> <p>  I wish to briefly refer to funding of protection for learners.  At present, learners in private HEIs have the benefit of a learner protection scheme.  Academic bonding is a scheme that enables a student to transfer to another institution and complete his or her study in that other institution in the event of discontinuance of the course where the student started it originally.  HECA is concerned the members' predecessor committee was informed that &ldquo;academic bonding has not been achievable by providers&rdquo; when discussed in the 2019 Act.  At that time, the HECA academic bonding scheme was in operation in its third academic year.  It provides support for students through an arrangement whereby each college is backed by two protecting colleges in order that students can transfer to one of two protecting colleges.  Furthermore, there is a system in operation whereby the colleges are required to prepared action plans to cover the contingency of discontinuance.  All of this is backed by a fund that now amounts to &euro;4 million.  The system is working.  If it is not broke, why fix it?  There is a proposal for an Irish scheme.  I stress this arrangement is overseen by an oversight committee chaired by an eminent past president of a public sector HEI.

The Chairman and Senator &Oacute; Cathasaigh will also welcome his appointment.  I am sure Dr. Prendergast's experience will be of enormous benefit.  We should record that appointment.</p><p>I thank the witnesses very much, but in a general context dare I say, "Tell us something we do not know".  We have known for quite a long period that there has been a crisis in higher education funding.  We do not need any more reports.  We are coming up to the sixth anniversary of the publication of the Cassells report.  The Minister had indicated that 2021 would be the year that this issue would be addressed.  I will put a number of questions and each of the speakers might respond.</p><p> The Covid-19 pandemic would have had significant impact on non-Exchequer income in all of the institutions.  Can the witnesses quantify that?  Obviously, significant additional places were provided to deal with some of the challenges presented by the leaving certificate, which had its own costs, but perhaps some of that direct impact could be quantified.  Given that some of the universities are borrowed to the hilt, the scope for borrowing is going to be limited to address some of the initial concerns.  The witnesses might also be able to touch on that.</p><p> I agree with Professor Hegarty's point about micro-credentialism, while Mr. Miley made the point about sustained investment in talent.  Ireland is experiencing rapid technological change and it will be up to the higher and further education institutions to upskill and reskill all of our citizens.  That has costs.  Who is going to pay for those micro-credentials?</p><p> The core issue here is funding.  The witnesses will be aware that the Minister has recently announced that he is considering a reduction in the student registration fee.  The proposed reduction is welcome but it must be very clear that this cannot happen unless the funding shortfall is replaced.  It will be extremely short-sighted if the overall package is not put in place.  If he was to proceed with a cut in the student registration fee of &euro;1,000 without necessarily replacing the full amount that would be derived from those sources, what would be the likely impacts on institutions?  I am not just talking about cost terms; I am referring to the levels of service that would be made available to students.  There is a process regarding SUSI reform, and if there is time the witnesses might focus on that.  There is probably enough however in those initial questions, which I hope get to the meat of the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Miley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#D00200"><p>On the question of the impact of Covid, I do not have up-to-date data, but the two main areas of pressure arose from the reduction in international student fee income and in the commercial revenues from the various activities our members are involved in, from the Book of Kells down the road from here to the Helix, and members will be aware of the various facilities that have a commercial or a part-commercial component.  In the first year of the pandemic, both of those were badly hit.  In the past year, international student revenue has recovered to a significant extent.  It is not fully recovered but to a large extent it has.  Over the past year, however, commercial revenues have not recovered at all for obvious reasons.  They have been entirely closed.  For some individual institutions this amounts to loss of funds in double figure millions of euro.  The concern, as with all commercial event-based facilities, is that there will not be an instant recovery on that.  It will be a gradual recovery and it will take some time.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned borrowings.  The borrowings of seven of our members that are currently enabled to borrow is currently reaching &euro;1 billion.  A number of those borrowings are locked into low exchange rates, but as is the nature of borrowings, there is a rolling renewal of loans.  In the context of potential rate rises and an inflationary environment, the repayment on those loans certainly will not go down and is likely to increase in the coming years.  Some of our institutions are nearing the end of the borrowing capacity, which is upwards of 40% of their annual income rating.  There is a risk that they will not be able to borrow further.</p> <p>  The last point to address is the student registration fee reduction issue.  In the Oireachtas last autumn the Minister confirmed that a &euro;1,000 reduction in the student contribution would have a net cost to the State of &euro;81 million.  That would be &euro;250 million if the student fee was entirely eliminated.  I made the point in our submission that standstill is not an option.  If there is an existing black hole in the funding of the sector of some hundreds of millions of euro - and I am aware that perhaps there is an argument to be had about the full extent of that but it is some hundreds of millions of euro - and if the starting point is to increase that hole by a further &euro;100 million with even a &euro;1,000 reduction in the student contribution, then the position is, as the Senator has outlined, that it must be replaced by State funding.  If that were not to happen then we are into significant quality issues.  We already have student staff ratio issues that have risen from 20:1.  The latest OECD report shows that this is now 23:1 in Ireland versus 15:1 or 16:1 across the OECD.   There will be further pressure, and ultimately, the quality of what we offer to students will be diminished.</p></speech>

I will be quick-fire on the answers.  I will complement what Mr. Miley has said.  We did look to the national steering group, that was set up through Covid.  Mr. Miley and I sat on that.  We looked at the impact upon institutions of Covid.  It is exactly as he said; we were looking particularly at the international and commercial hiring piece.  At first, the figures looked very bad.  We were talking earlier that it was stronger in the university sector than in ours, but we are certainly looking at up to &euro;100 million of a loss.</p></speech>

Again, the international piece has bounced back and a lot of that has to do with the way Ireland cared for international students.  It did us well on reputation there.</p> <p>  On the question of upskilling and reskilling, that is a big debate between the further education and training sector, FET, and higher education.  There is an integration piece there.  There is opportunity attaching to the new Department, which might not be caught.  We are also conscious of European funding in this.  We have just completed an application under the national recovery and resilience plan around upskilling and reskilling, which comes under the NextGenerationEU programme, which I mentioned in my submission.</p> <p>  The borrowing instrument is provided for under the Technological Universities Act 2018, as the Chairman will be aware, but it has not been activated.  There is an openness to it, and that is what has been indicated.  However, the reason I mention the cost-rental model in my piece is that the metrics have now changed and to make this sustainable will require Government support.  That is essentially the issue for us.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the impact of a reduction in the student contribution.  At the moment we are looking for extra places and all of those possibilities go if the student contribution is reduced.  I referred to the three-legged stool that we have always been working to, and if we take money out of one, I fully agree with the Senator that it must be replaced from elsewhere.  Reference was made to the level of services that we offer students.  We have seen, for example, through the pandemic the use of caring services, mental health services and so on.  In fairness, the Government has been very good in coming in to support that in those one-off pieces but if we take away part of the core funding on this, these things will not be sustainable.  I also agree with Mr. Miley that the big hit on this will be the quality of the system.  If one loses reputation internationally in this game, it is very difficult to recover it.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being present but I listened to them on my journey into Leinster House this morning.  I thank them for their assessments and contributions to this debate.  It is difficult to have a meaningful conversation with them in the context of a decision to be made rather than being made.  I am sure they will understand this puts us at a slight disadvantage.  It is welcome, however, that a statement has been made by the Minister that he intends to move in the area of student fees and the overall funding model for third level.  In the absence of the Cassells report, for debate purposes it is difficult to have a meaningful conversation with the witnesses.</p><p>I very much appreciate the contribution made by my colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, in terms of his expertise and what he brings to the Seanad and the Houses in general.  I find it beneficial to speak after him.</p><p> When we compare ourselves to other countries it is important that we compare like with like and across the board, rather than comparing educational outcomes or the number of students who are enrolled.  As the witnesses outlined, we have an extraordinarily high attainment rate for third level degrees.  That is a testament to the educational sector and everything our third level has done to maintain high standards.  The standard of teaching is high and student attainment is extraordinarily high.  From a brief reading of the statements, I cannot recall what the attainment level is in the EU, although I know a rate of 60% was mentioned here.  The witnesses stated clearly that the level here is substantially higher than the EU average, which is to be noted and welcomed.</p><p> The question of core funding from the Exchequer is a subject in all of the submissions.  It is very clear that we do not contribute enough, regardless of which measurement tool we use.  There is, therefore, a simple Government decision to be made on whether we want to fund education to a higher level or not.  The clear indication thus far is that we do.  In saying that, I am concerned that if the Exchequer stumps up and reduces or holds fees at a particular level for the student, would that automatically increase funding to third level.  The answer to that is "No".  One does not flow from the other and two decisions must be made.  Should increases be suspended or should fees be reduced by 20%, 30%, 50%, 100% or whatever the percentage may be?  On the other hand, funding must be increased to compensate for that.  Therein lies my questions for the witnesses.  Are we comparing ourselves with our EU partners in the same way?  For instance, are the overall running costs of third level here and in other jurisdictions comparable?  Are they higher or lower here?</p><p> The witnesses mentioned staff ratios.  They are clearly not at the same level as the ratios in some other EU member states or OECD countries, which the witnesses also cited.  What is the comparative difference?  Do the witnesses have those figures to hand?  If they happen to have them in written format, I ask that they be provided to the secretariat because they would be very helpful in our deliberations.</p><p> The witnesses mentioned reputation, which is a critical part of this conversation.  We all know and appreciate that we cannot afford to stand still.  I do not think there is any disagreement across the political spectrum on the need to do more than we are doing.</p><p> I did not agree with all that Professor Hegarty said but he made a valid point about the inherent disadvantage in the system and cited Dublin 10 and Dublin 6.  I can give similar figures between outer orbital towns in north County Dublin.  I am not proud of that.  I have been a Member of the Oireachtas and a member of a Government party for 11 years.  There was not very much we could do for quite a bit of the past 11 years.  However, if we park Covid for a moment, we have not faced the same financial constraints since 2018, at least in terms of the balance sheet.  I am not convinced we have done enough at third level to improve outcomes for and inputs from disadvantaged communities and schools.  I am not sure the playing field is entirely level.</p><p> I ecstatically welcome the inclusion of further education and training or FET in the CAO in terms of terminal examinations process for second level students.  That is a fantastic step in the right direction.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on what the impact of that will be in the coming years.</p></speech>

I thank him for his gracious comments about his colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, who has worked very closely with us in higher education and brings that insight, which we all very much appreciate.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a fair question about the overall running costs.  Both Mr. Miley, Professor Hegarty and I work very closely in European alignments and utilise the OECD, so there are benchmarking exercises.  Rather than make the case here, we will supply the figures to the committee.  We would make the argument that Ireland has been losing ground and we are comparing like with like.  Having said that, there is an awful lot that we do well in Ireland and we should be very proud of that.  The work of this committee has been hugely to the fore in supporting that and we very much appreciate that.</p> <p>  We should consider the ratios in 2007, before the downturn happened, and then look at the costing.  It has been acknowledged that funding increased in recent years but we are still not back to where we were and that has an impact on real lives, access, etc.</p> <p>  I will briefly discuss the attrition point.  That was one of the big concerns as we hit Covid and it was difficult for us to get a picture around that.  Again, with the support of the Minister on the national training group, we did a lot of work to get a better picture.  I am pleased to say, and we can provide the figures, that it is a far better picture than one may have imagined it would be.  Maybe it could be argued that, in a time of Covid, what else would one be doing.  Emigration was not possible and there was no work outside, etc.  Equally, it goes back to the services point that, I think, was made by Senator Byrne.  The fact that the services were there for students was a huge part in keeping the connection.  That is not to deny the point we made previously that Covid exacerbated inequalities.  If someone did not have Wi-Fi or a laptop or there were too many people in the family trying to use the only computer or the only table, those were the sorts of things that pointed to inequality.  It meant that we had to try to roll out, with the assistance of the Government, a lot of direct support to keep the attention of students and to keep them supported.</p></speech>

The benefit to the Irish economy of the active policy on the part of the universities and the THEA sector in terms of recruiting international students has saved Irish education.  That has been a tremendous piece of work and it is important that is understood and appreciated.  We in the private sector have known that we rely very much upon international recruitment.</p> <p>  To answer the question posed by Senator Malcolm Byrne about the impact of reducing fees, that has competition implications.  We feel that we are in competition with institutions and at a disadvantage because of State funding.  That will be intensified and is something we will have to look at.</p> <p>  A question was asked on costs.  In the public sector, a degree course costs on average between &euro;9,000 and &euro;10,000 depending on the course, while the average cost in the private sector is &euro;6,500.  That does not mean there is overspending in the public sector but probably reflects the fact that we have the opportunity to extract economies that the public sector does not have.</p><p>That is the reality and the comparison if you are looking for those figures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Miley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#F00300"><p>I will not repeat the points already made.  I will make a number brief points.  On the cost issue, as part of the funding analysis in the follow-on report to the Cassells report by the expert group on funding, which was chaired by Ms Br&iacute;d Horan, there was some comparative analysis in it that showed the Irish system compared very favourably on a cost-efficiency basis with other systems around Europe.</p> <p>  On the access or progression issue that Deputy Farrell referred to, we need to recognise that the two Covid-19 packages supplied by the Government helped our institutions to supply the services and provide some direct support to students which helped to mitigate some of the effects of Covid-19.  The good news, although I do not have the data to hand, is that there are no indications from what we have seen of any diminution in progression levels as a result of Covid-19, perhaps because of the factors outlined by Dr. Ryan or otherwise.  A combination of the supports and the fact there was nothing else to do except study may be the dominant issues.  Progression levels across our institutions are very high and we compare very favourably with other countries in that.  Among the universities we represent, the non-progression levels are below 10%.  In some European countries from first year, they can be 30% to 40% to 50% where they have more unfiltered access to their systems.</p></speech>

I fully agree this is a critical conversation.  Indeed the Minister himself has said the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>for the setting up of the new Department is to get the funding model right.  This is an opportunity for us to do that.</p><p>I am very disappointed that despite the Minister promising month after month to have the economic analysis from the EU Commission, we could be having a much more informed conversation here were we to have that economic analysis in front of us to save us reinventing the wheel.</p><p>I 100% welcome that the Minister has taken the loan scheme off the table.  If we are to look at a loan scheme even for a nurse in a public institute for higher education, she or he would come out of college &euro;12,000 in debt, or &euro;27,000 in debt out of a for-profit private college.  It is very important we agree on that from the outset.</p><p>In looking at what our guests have been saying, this presents a stark picture when we look at the funding per student.  There is 37% less funding per student today than there was in 2008.  We now have of all the advances, all the technology and all the investments that have needed to be made in higher education.  The difficulty I have is reconciling this.  If we are going to have a proper discussion about this, we need to be honest across the board.  The Minister will say he is providing the greatest level of funding to third level education this year than ever before.  This is what people are hearing.  Yet, when we look under the bonnet, we see 37% less funding per student.  Does that 37% less funding per student figure include Covid-19 funding and how much of that is outside the standstill cost?  I am trying to get at how much goes to the student.  I would ask that we talk to that issue for the moment, namely, the standstill costs and the 37%.  Would Mr. Miley like to take that question first?</p></speech>

The challenge last year for our member universities was they took in just short of 10% extra students on a full-time equivalent basis in a single year.  It was an extraordinary increase.  There was the normal growth, if one calls it that, and then we had the extra numbers arising from the grade inflation and Covid-19.  We were asked on two occasions by the system to provide extra places and on both occasions we responded favourably.  The headline figure for the increase in funding last year looks attractive, but when the fact 10% extra students are being paid for is included, along with the national pay agreements, over which we have no control, the rates for which the Government sets for our staff, and which we must pay, the net increase for the core grant for the eight institutions that we represent was &euro;22 per student.  That is what it came to.  Effectively, it is a standstill situation.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  In fact, looking at national pay awards, the amount of money the HEA provided to our institutions did not cover in full the extra staff costs we had to pay out.  Our universities actually lost money in the national pay round last year, to put it in very bald and simple terms.  Those are the realities.  What we are saying is that whatever package comes through in the coming weeks and if there is a political decision taken to reduce student contributions, that is a political decision-----</p></speech>

There has been no other engagement on that.  The question then arises that if there is a reduction, there then needs to be a commensurate filling of that gap by the State, in addition to filling the gap that is already there.</p> <p>  The needs of students must be paramount here.  In our submission we have made it very clear we believe the student supports in the form of SUSI grants must be a significant part of the package as well.  We believe the supports should go to where they are needed most.  I said in my submission that it is unacceptable in 2022 in Ireland that a student&rsquo;s educational future is determined by his or her postcode.  Therefore, the reform package must address that issue also within the overall-----</p></speech>

It would make for a much better conversation.</p> <p>  Mr. Miley mentioned a package.  I do not doubt for one moment there is a great amount of work going on between the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this.  We have indications but have no definite news on that.  It raises the question as to whether we are going to have a decision or a debate.  This is such a complex area and is so important for the country that we need an inclusive debate around this.</p> <p>  The genius of the Irish people is that we want a Rolls-Royce service with a Lada outlay, and this goes to the heart of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  The truth is that our system, which was acknowledged by Deputy Farrell, has done very well, but we should think of what it could do with a little bit more.  That is always the way.</p> <p>  This goes back to the point Deputy Farrell made and that I made in my own submission, which is that it is very much about prioritisation here.  When it comes down to the hard politics of it, looking at housing, the health services and education, it is a question of how we make our case.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy's question on the metrics of this, Mr. Miley and I could possibly do some work on it and come back to the Deputy to try to give her some substantial ammunition on this.</p><p>I am very happy to do that.  This speaks to the Deputy's point as to how this funding issue is to be reconciled.  The truth is that this is a pot of funding that is not sufficient, with an increasing number of students.  There is a move to encourage students into other areas, including apprenticeships, which is absolutely correct, further education, etc., but students will vote as they vote.  Overriding all this are the sustainable development goals, particularly goal 4, which refers to access and equity for everyone.  Then we are talking about regional sustainability etc.  It is a complex mix and it seems to me to invite a fuller conversation.</p></speech>

It needs to be triggered.  There is an openness to this and, in fairness to the Department, we have set up a working group that is looking at this under the Secretary General.  The difficulty now is that the economics of it do not make sense.  It would need some assistance from the Government to make sense.  In other words, the cost to the student cohort if this accommodation were built and then rented out would be too high.  The impact is on opportunity and equity, and we saw that through Covid.  Mr. Miley and I were involved in talks on this, including on international students and where we could put them.  We talked at one stage about Citywest.  It just pointed to the fact that we do not have the infrastructure at times.  There is an element of resilience and learning to this, it seems to me.</p></speech>

I agree with Dr. Ryan that this is a critical conversation, but we have to be careful it does not become an endless conversation.  It is important we get a decision on this.  The fact that we have a new Department set up means that it is inevitable a decision will have to be made on this issue.  We all seem to agree that there is no sustainable funding model in place at present.  May I ask Mr. Miley what impact that is having on Irish universities?</p></speech>

In the first instance, and as Dr. Ryan said, the quality of what we provide has been maintained to a great extent.  However, our student-staff ratios have slipped down to 23:1 as opposed to the European average of 15:1.  That sounds fine and dandy when compared with the ratios in primary and secondary level.  In reality, however, the difference in the third level context is tutorials and the way in which teaching is structured.  It needs that much more intensive, one-to-one feature.  Students are not getting that.  That came home to roost particularly in the Covid scenario, when students were operating digitally and they lost a significant component of that.  That quality-related issue is the biggest risk.  As Dr. Ryan has pointed out, if the quality is lost, one's reputation is lost.  It takes not a month or a year to recover that; it takes a decade or more.</p></speech>

There can be no doubt about that.</p> <p>  The second area is capital investment.  Our universities have borrowed &euro;1 billion but, in doing so, they can borrow to build facilities only if they can match their borrowings, in some cases with State funding and in other cases with philanthropy funding.  One cannot get 100% borrowing to do anything.  In spite of having borrowed &euro;1 billion, we still have a major capital funding deficit.  Br&iacute;d Horan, who chaired the funding committee, has made a submission to this committee and outlined to it that, since 2016, taking the Cassells recommendations, we are now of the order of &euro;2.5 billion behind the curve on core recurrent funding for the system and &euro;2.2 billion behind the curve on capital funding.  There is therefore a huge demand for extra facilities, and we are now bulging at the seams.  We are in a discussion with the Government about producing extra places on medical courses.  There is absolutely no lack of willingness on the part of the sector to do that.  The reality, however, is that if a medical student is to be trained, labs and facilities are needed.  In some situations they are now up against a brick wall on that, so unless the investment is made, we cannot do that.</p></speech>

Does Dr. Ryan think there is a role for the private sector in making funding available to third level institutions?  I ask Dr. Ryan in particular because I was recently at Munster Technological University and was very impressed by the fact that students on the Bishopstown campus were being trained to make medical devices for companies in the locality.  Does Dr. Ryan see an opportunity for the State to avail of that?</p></speech>

That is a very good point.  We have the national training fund.  The issue with that is and always has been how it is best utilised.  The technological sector is very much linked into the region, business, etc., and there is a willingness on the part of business to support this, but doing so in a structured way is one of the issues.</p> <p>  Going back to a previous point Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, and Mr. Miley mentioned capital investment, to give the Deputy an insight into that, we have wonderful research centres throughout the country, from the established university sector to our sector.  We had a window into that through Covid.  We saw it through some of the commentary.  I have talked to colleagues in those sectors and they do not compare with their European peers because they just do not have the infrastructure to advance.  Researchers can be hired now; the difficulty is where to put them, where the machinery they need is and where the space they need to work is.  People ask where the deficits are.  That is where we see the deficits.</p></speech>

The third option put forward by Peter Cassells was that there be deferred payment of fees.  I would say that an assessment would show that one of the major avenues to availing of and to getting high disposable income is having a third level education.  Huge numbers of people have been able to become wealthy and successful as a result of their third level education.  What is Professor Hegarty's view of that deferred system, whereby people would not pay fees at the time of their education but, when they reach 40 or 50 years of age and a certain income threshold, they would repay loans?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Diarmuid Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#G01400"><p>I think it is eminently sensible, but the reality of the matter is that students loans are politically toxic.  I believe it is right.  Deputy Conway-Walsh was worried about the &euro;27,000 people would have to repay after leaving university.  That same person will probably borrow up to &euro;400,000 as a mortgage on a house.  In that context, a &euro;27,000 student loan to be repaid is very small.  We are not talking about the hundreds of thousands paid in the UK, so I think there is a lack of balance here.  The idea that the loan does not become repayable until an income threshold has been reached is very fair.  In the event of redundancy, unemployment or whatever else, the student loan should not be repayable during that period.  It is workable.  I proposed in my paper that we should have not a student loan system as a substitute but that there should be a student loan system through a not-for-profit entity providing loans at no more than 4% such that it is not designed to enrich the coffers of financial institutions but, rather, provides the additional funds people need to survive third level.  If we propose a student loan system as a substitute, I do not think that will be a runner politically.</p> <p>  I wish to come back on an earlier point about student accommodation.</p><p>There is a serious problem of trust in Government.  Members must let me tell them what exactly happened in respect of the tax-based funding of student accommodation.  It was introduced in the Finance Act of 1999.  The deadline was to be December 2004 and it was extended to June 2006.  It had the aim of encouraging private funds into building student accommodation, which it did.  Then, in the Finance Act of 2006 that funding was effectively withdrawn.  People had borrowed money on the basis of substantial funds to build student accommodation.  The deals with the banks were done on the basis that the repayment would be made out of tax-free income because that was what was offered.  The D&aacute;il chose to withdraw that relief so that the prospective rental income, which was really effectively scheduled for repayment, was taxed.  To my mind that was a reprehensible breach of trust.  I am not sure developers are going to trust Government if it offers tax-based funding for student accommodation.</p><p> If we want student accommodation, we have to support it in a number of ways.  It could be done by providing tax relief on the rent that is paid, through a similar provision to the Finance Act of 1999 which gave relief immediately, but with the clear promise that it will not be withdrawn halfway through.  It could be done through student supports, through SUSI.  There are a number of ways.  Right now, student accommodation is very expensive and not open to students in lower income groups.  That is the reality of the matter.  Having said that, we built our student accommodation in 2004 and it is now full.  It reflects what Deputy Conway-Walsh was referring to, a shortage of accommodation.</p></speech>

It is correct that we are having a conversation, as all the witnesses have pointed out.  We need an ongoing debate around it.  We are behind the setting up of a new Department on the basis that this will be sorted out.  It should be sorted out in two ways.  First, some of the money that is going in at the moment is clearly to keep things at a stand-still position, as the witnesses have outlined.  That needs to change and requires significant investment.</p> <p>  Alongside that there has been an ingraining of inequality over the past few decades.  It is always displayed in our education system when it comes to who has access and who does not.  We have had conversations about private schooling and we are now having conversations about who can and cannot afford to go to college and who can and cannot afford accommodation.  I take on board the different points of view as to whether fees should be abolished.  Apart from anything, an expansion of SUSI grants has to be provided at the very minimum for those who are entitled.  It was part of previous budgets but it needs to go beyond that.</p> <p>  I believe we are in the middle of a revolution comparable to the industrial revolution.  We need massive amounts of new skills and new investment and capital to get us over the hump of a lack of skills.  That is where we are at the moment.  We are putting money into retrofitting and so many different green areas.  We have to get over the hump and get a massive number of people skilled in those areas.  I do not think the system is up to scratch at the moment.  That is not the fault of anybody here but it is the fault of decades of underinvestment, as has been outlined.  I would appreciate any thoughts the witnesses have on this new aspect that is being demanded of them and of us all as a society.  Many of these kinds of revolutions go unseen because we are in the middle of them.  That is exactly what is happening at the moment.</p></speech>

We wholeheartedly support that.  There has been an increase in the recent budget but it is critical that it is a key component of any future package as we go forward.  On skills and the revolution, as the Senator rightly calls it, we are conscious of the need to adapt the system of third level education.  The traditional undergraduate and postgraduate degrees will remain key pillars of our system into the future.  However, we need to supplement them substantially with a suite of flexible learning programmes.  One of those, which has been funded under the human capital initiative, is the micro-credentials programme we are running.  It is a four-year programme where we are getting all of our universities to develop a suite of small-scale but fully university accredited programmes.  Already, a number of our universities have those in the market.  We are trying to pull them together on a common platform with common standards, accredited by QQI, as the national accreditation body, so that a person who has an IT degree but wants to do a top-up in business law or <i>vice versa</i>, or any other combination, can do it easily and can get access to those accredited programmes in a very flexible way.  The next step would be to stack those so effectively an individual would have the opportunity to stack credits from different universities into a composite qualification.<br/><br/>That is a key priority project for us.  The work is already under way.  We hope it will be formally launched later this year or early next year on that common platform.  That is just the start.  We need to drive it forward.  As we go forward, the notion of coming out of college with a degree and that doing people for life is dead.  Everyone will need top-up qualifications and we think our institutions are best placed to provide them.</p></speech>

The lack of flexibility in our system was clear throughout Covid.  It is an opportunity for us all but it also takes significant investment in the kinds of programmes Mr. Miley is talking about.  We believe it is essential.</p></speech>

We will have to move to a lifelong learning model.  That is exactly the way the Government shaped the Technological Universities Act as it is now.  It is a cultural change.  We will move from the front-loaded education system to a much more lifelong model.  We are sharing work on micro-credentials, on which the Irish Universities Association is leading.  We are doing a parallel piece on recognition of higher learning, working with Mr. Miley.  These are key facilitating instruments to allow for this.</p> <p>  To try to fuel that, we have had to go through the national recovery and resilience plan to try to get some of the wherewithal.  Through the HEA, we pressed the button on that just last night.  It is a very complex piece of work.  I am happy to share it with the Senator so she can see the design that is going in to try to deliver on that.  One of the factors that militates against this is that we have so much competitive funding now.  That tends to put people's eyes on the close win rather than the longer strategic horizon, which is where we need to be thinking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Diarmuid Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#J00100"><p>The Senator asked for solutions.  I have three of them.  The first is a proposal we made to the Government in 1999, basically in response to a tender to create places for students on programmes in IT.  Our proposal was that the Government would pay for the first two years of the course and the employers would pay for the remaining two years.  We did not levy any capital; the college funded that itself.  The cost of that at the time was &pound;5,000.  Under the traditional model, the Department of Education funded &pound;30,000 per place, broken down into &pound;10,000 capital and &pound;5,000 a year for four years.  Effectively, we were training five students at the same cost as one student in the traditional sector.  We believed this was what the Government needed and the Department would be delighted with the proposals.  In retrospect, we realised what fools we were because, in fact, there was no appreciation of it.  Indeed, it created so much embarrassment that the Government felt constrained to actually block private institutions from making subsequent tenders.  If members want to deal with this problem and to have open solutions, that is possible but there is a need to engage.  The Government needs to engage.  By the way, we are talking here about students who studied for two years and then began working.  Their employers were more than happy to pay their fees.  They were glad to get the students because they were very useful to them after two years.  We are back to there being a significant shortage of staff, and imaginative solutions such as that will work.  It would not have worked two or three years ago.</p> <p>  My second suggestion is to consider tax relief on fees.  After all, if a person is bearing an expense which would otherwise be borne 100% by the State, why not have the State support them by giving tax relief on fees?  At most, the State will be paying 48% and it may be paying only 20%.  That is another solution.</p> <p>  Another possibility is to encourage institutions to work with employers to put in place a student loan system.  Under the European strategic investment fund, it is possible to arrange student loans.  I referred to this in our paper.  Those who are already in employment are obvious candidates for this and will be able to repay.  We are not talking about large sums.  If the committee wants the funding to fill the skills gap, that is definitely possible.  It just needs imagination and engagement.</p></speech>

I do not want to leave people with the sense that I am in agreement on it.  I do not think it is an appropriate solution.  There is probably not enough time to have a full discussion on it.  My main point is this will require huge investment.  I look forward to seeing what it is because I think the deficit at the moment is underestimated, quite apart from the inequalities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1657" speakername="Eileen Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#J00400"><p>I am delighted to have third level education behind me.  Young people watching this debate will have heard the likes of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan saying students could pay back college fees when they are in their 40s, but people in my generation cannot even afford a house.  It is ever so daunting a conversation we are having.  As for looking at the European level and trying to compare ourselves with Europe, let us start with where we are as a nation and comparing levels within Ireland.  Professor Hegarty rightly pointed to the 16% participation rate in Ballyfermot.  I am a Ballyfermot woman myself.  Actually, that figure has risen through the years.  In 2009, it was only 7%.  That increase is positive.  The rate in Dublin 6, however, is 99%.  Let us look at how the education system works as a whole.  I know Deputy Farrell was talking about how great it is, but it is good for the few, not for the many.</p> <p>  That leads me to my question.  Do our guests believe the current funding model addresses the diversity of needs when it comes to marginalised communities?  I refer to students who not only struggle to access third level education but also experience many other barriers when they do get that access.  Some degrees require financial and social capital for students to progress and reach their potential.  Even when a student from a marginalised community has access, he or she may not be able to go on and become a solicitor or barrister because of the requirements relating to that course.  In terms of figures, the Traveller community makes up 1% of the population, with 40,000 Travellers in Ireland, yet less than 1% of Travellers go on to third level education.  Do our guests believe the right measures and funding are in place for people from ethnic minority groups or marginalised communities?</p> <p>  On DEIS schools, is there enough funding in the context of reinforcing quotas for DEIS schools?  Are young people getting the equality of education that is being delivered in other European countries?  A solution suggested earlier is to fix the system.  That would involve investment in the education system for all young people.  We are falling miles behind other European countries when it comes to investment in the education system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Miley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#J00500"><p>I will address one of the Senator's points and then hand over to colleagues.  Her core question was whether the model addresses the needs of all students.  It is clear it does not do so at the moment.  That is why in our submission we have outlined that a package of measures is essential.  It would be damaging to address the student fee issue but not address the core funding issue, or <i>vice versa</i>.  In an ideal world where there was an open chequebook, third level education would be free for everyone in all its respects, including the fees and all the related expenses associated with it.  However, we need to be pragmatic.  We do not live in an ideal world and there will always be a limited budget available.  We recognise that in any discussion we have with the Government.  In that context, choices have to be made in respect of making the limited budget available and prioritising those who need it most.<br/><br/>That speaks to the point the Senator is raising.  Although the SUSI system has done a lot to give some students an opportunity they may not otherwise have had, some of those students are not getting enough.  They are getting their fees paid but are still unable to afford to live while going to college.  There are other prospective students who still are not getting in the door.  We believe that needs to be reformed.  There are preferential access routes through the disability access route to education, DARE, and higher education access route, HEAR schemes.  The points system has been moderated to give opportunity to people who have a disadvantage, and that needs to be continually upgraded and improved.  There is no point in opening the door in the context of the points system if the funding is not there to support the student on the other side.</p><p>We think this part of the package is fundamental to any Government decision that comes.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Miley on whether the core funding model supports it all.  No, it does not.  If ever we saw a light shone on that, it was through Covid.  It certainly showed up the inequality.  I have mentioned sustainable development goal 4 and the question of equity.  As Mr. Miley said, it should not be down to postcode.  It should be available to everyone who has the determination, ambition and willingness to go.  Some people will need more support.  Access is one question but the Senator is absolutely right to focus on it.  It is only one part of it.  We then have to support people when they are in the system.  Some good work was done and continues to be done by the HEA on these questions of indicators of success.  It has looked at measures such as numeracy and literacy.  This work has been going on for more than ten years at this stage.  In fairness, it helps to focus where supports are given.  As I have said, Covid has shown this.  Other work is being done by the national forum, which has done some great work.  The students themselves have also done work on this.</p></speech>

It is all about equality of opportunity.  It is about more than just being at college.  It goes right back to primary level.  It goes back to the family.  Students in Dublin 6 have the advantage that their parents probably went to third level.  They are committed to third level.  What will change things significantly is learn and earn.  Apprenticeships will change things.  We have a scheme with the Central Bank whereby it employs students from leaving certificate and pays their fees to study by night.  It is schemes such as these that will change things.  It needs to go further back.</p> <p>  We have made endless submissions to the Department.  I must pay tribute to the work done by universities, technological universities and schools on getting people into third level.  More funds need to be focused on this.  We have made endless submissions to the Government asking for a target to be set and to pay on results.  We have asked for performance to be paid for based on the numbers who get into and succeed at third level.  This would concentrate energies on achieving results.  We have made submission after submission on this but they are falling on deaf ears.  This is largely due to ideological obstacles.  If we want the problem dealt with, we need to get energy focused on it right from primary level.  It can be done but it needs imagination, energy and determination.  We have offered it but it has fallen on deaf ears.</p></speech>

This is a very important issue.  The programme for Government has committed to utilising the National Training Fund surplus.  The suspension of EU fiscal rules due to Covid also provided a window of opportunity to do this.  This has not happened so far.  The reserve was as high as &euro;817 million a year ago and was projected to increase.  This money was supposed to be invested in training and education.  Do the witnesses believe the National Training Fund should be used to provide core funding rather than the current situation of allocating to higher education through mechanisms such as the human capital initiative?</p> <p>  My next question is on the stark inequalities that were exposed again in the CSO figures last week.  The gap between the northern and western regions and the national average is now estimated to be three times higher than it was a decade ago.  That is disgraceful.  Underinvestment in key infrastructural assets is likely to have contributed to the rising disparities.  The economist John Daly has looked at further education.  He says that higher education institutes based in the northern and western regions on average received capital funding of &euro;316 per undergraduate enrolled between 2010 and 2020.  This was below the corresponding national figure of &euro;375.  Capital investment in the same regions was below the State average in eight out of the past ten years.  What needs to be done in the northern and western regions to address this disparity?  I very much welcome the  Atlantic Technological University.  How much funding will have to be weighted?  We need positive discrimination to address the imbalance.</p></speech>

The question is whether it should be used for core funding.  We speak to IBEC, which represents employers.  Its members contribute the levies to the National Training Fund.  As I said, an extra &euro;191 million a year has been going in since 2017.  We understand the surplus is now approaching &euro;1 billion.  Frankly, it is bizarre we are here speaking about a scarcity of funds in the sector while &euro;1 billion is sitting in a bank account somewhere in the State.  This issue has to be fixed.  Employers who contribute money are equally adamant it needs to be fixed.  Its current framing in a very rigid skills framework is too narrow.  If we look at IBEC's submissions on this, it has made the case it needs to be broadened.  All of our institutions are involved in producing graduates and in doing research to provide skills or to provide the base for skills in the economy.  We need a broader interpretation and a mechanism for this.  It cannot be beyond the ingenuity of the system to come up with this.  It is obscene that the money remains unspent while there is a glaring need from students and the institutions that house those students for funding.</p></speech>

If it was invested, it would be multiplying.  It just does not make economic sense that this is not being done.</p></speech>

Our understanding is that the fund stands at approximately &euro;1 billion, which is what I said in my opening statement.  It should definitely be used for core funding.  One of the questions we have asked continuously is on the governance of this.  I do not mean this in a bad sense.  If employers see this as a tax, they want to see a return in terms of skills.  How they feed into skills priorities goes to the Deputy's question.  In this regard, the north west might be somewhat different from the east coast.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy on positive discrimination.  I have to acknowledge the work done on the Technological University Research Network report.  It invested money to try to get these nascent technological universities up and running.  It has been very helpful.  We have been speaking about continuing this.  I mentioned the work done on the national recovery and resilience plan.  The Deputy is well aware of the work done through the Royal Irish Academy's higher education futures group.  This had a particular focus on the north west and cross-Border education.  I mention this because there is probably a question as to how we inform public policy on detailed questions such as this.  Very good work is being done on this.  The Deputy has done her own work on it as we well know.</p><p>That sort of work will be critical to this.</p></speech>

Senator Pauline O'Reilly referred to the significant skills challenge.  What is needed is a significant expansion in the Springboard+ programme.  If this money was used to acquire, if one likes, skills education on a tendered basis, it would be more effective.  I referred to the situation back in 1999 when there was a tender to create IT places but that was subsequently blocked by the Department of Education.  When one goes to tender, one gets the kind of economies whereby five students are educated at the same cost as one student and they come out as graduates with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, degrees as good as those from any other institution.   If the national training fund is to be used, that should be focused on skills training and skills education and it should be allowed to go out to tender.</p></speech>

I passionately believe that higher education and further education is a public good.  I have put my cards on the table.  That is why I believe that in order to have the type of model we require, we need to invest in core funding in the way it is done very successfully in other countries.</p> <p>  If I have time, I will ask-----</p></speech>

I very much agree in the context of the exchange of learning and all that can be done there, but I refer to the possibilities for all-island partnerships as well and their development.  The lack of funding is a significant impediment to such partnerships.  What can we do across the island in that regard?  I am thinking particularly in terms of medicine and addressing the labour shortage in hospitals and primary care on an all-island basis such that we can have those partnerships and the exchange of learning.  That is being done in the context of cancer research and the all-island strategy in that regard.</p></speech>

The shared island fund has opened a window of possibilities in that regard, with funding available for research on both sides of the Border.  There are structural barriers to all-Ireland partnerships.  I have raised previously at the committee the issue of the timing of leaving certificate results, for example, which mitigates against Northern Ireland students applying for places in colleges down here.  Consideration should be given to a change in the timing of those results.  That does not relate to funding, which is the topic for this discussion.  As regards international partnerships, we welcome the supports the Government has given to the European Universities Initiative and the universities participating in it.  We need much more such support going into the future.</p></speech>

I was listening to the meeting in my office upstairs earlier.  Several of our guests spoke about the opportunities for students coming from DEIS schools at secondary level.  I taught in the secondary sector for the best part of 15 years, 11 or 12 of which were in a DEIS school.  Professor Hegarty mentioned the idea of expanding quotas for programmes of higher demand.  How can we expand into DEIS schools and give those students further opportunities?</p> <p>  To follow on from the remarks of previous speakers in respect of funding, this might not be a popular question but is there much to be said for expanding the existing SUSI offering and strengthening resources targeted at those students, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds?  A level of funding could be maintained, though perhaps not the existing level, and funding could be prioritised for those who need it most.</p> <p>  I have no doubt that student accommodation was discussed earlier in the meeting.  In my city of Cork, there is considerable demand for it.  We are always hearing stories about student accommodation, whether on local radio or from students on social media platforms or whatever it might be.  There is a significant amount going on in the context of the provision of accommodation for students and how difficult it is to get it.  There are issues relating to putting down deposits and losing deposits and the whole thing.  There is no panacea or silver bullet that would cure our woes overnight.  What are the views of our guests in respect of providing better access to funding or whatever the case may be for higher level institutions to address the student accommodation crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Diarmuid Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#L01200"><p>On the issue of student accommodation, before the Deputy joined the meeting I mentioned there are several solutions to the student accommodation issue.  Tax-based funding would be helpful but it has to be tax-based funding that is not withdrawn almost immediately on its provision.  Tax-based funding would help in the context of the life of the loans people take out in order to fund student accommodation, as would honesty on the part of the Government in terms of keeping to its word in respect of not withdrawing the scheme.</p> <p>  I refer to the point made by Deputy Conway-Walsh in respect of the staffing of the medical sector.  We have an opportunity here in terms of progression.  It took five years to happen but we have established the national apprenticeship in healthcare for health carers.  There should really be a progression path for health carers to go beyond that and become advanced health carers, assistant nurses and so on.  We need that and I think it would greatly help students in DEIS schools.  If students can get into a lean-and-earn model fairly quickly whereby they are working, learning and advancing, that will help greatly.  As long as we have a situation where the only way to get into work is to get into college, we will need to have quotas for students from DEIS schools.  There are other ways, however.  The apprenticeship and traineeship routes need to be developed and supported by the Government.</p> <p>  Student accommodation is very expensive.  We in Griffith College are fortunate that we built our student accommodation in 2004 and it is two to a room so we are in a position to charge approximately 70% of the rate that would be charged for single-occupancy accommodation.  As a result, the accommodation is full.  It is very difficult to fight the market and the reality of the situation is that the market for accommodation actually determines the prices students are paying.  Some form of support in terms of enhanced SUSI grants would deal with it immediately but there is also a need to expand the stock of accommodation.  That requires tax-based funding that is given and not withdrawn.</p></speech>

I share his background in teaching at second level.  I loved those days.  We have agreed through the conversation this morning that equity of access is key.  I think we are all agreed on that.  The technological sector, of which I am part, is the sector that has really given that voice to democratisation of opportunity for students.</p><p>Again, the point we are making is that access must link to the supports for those students when they are coming in.  People are coming in with different indicative chances of success, so the supports must be targeted.</p><p> We are starting a conversation again with the further education and training sector.  It is about continuity of education; it is not just about progression, etc.  I am looking forward to a productive conversation.</p><p> On accommodation, I will not repeat what we said earlier.  The student bodies, to which we are talking, say accommodation is the highest priority and the biggest problem they have had over the past year.  It emerged again under Covid.  There is great pressure.  We would love to get into the borrowing framework, as I said, but we would need Government support on that because the costing model will not work with the students.</p><p> This triangulates with the broader housing issue because students are now competing for the same housing that families are competing for.  In fairness to the Department, it is examining this in a more holistic way.</p></speech>

Our members are very reluctant to go down a pathway of developing accommodation that is beyond the means of students.  We have had a discussion with the Government and are awaiting a response.  Student accommodation is part of the public good that Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about in the broader scheme of third level education.  In that context, the State needs to come up with some mechanism to support the building of additional student accommodation if it is to be made affordable for students.</p></speech>

His submission states, "Given the skills shortage imperative, obstacles blocking the inclusion of private HEI representation at the National Skills Council and Regional Skills Fora should be removed."

We are talking about future funding at third level.  The allocation of over 6,000 student places over the past two years, in incredible circumstances, including Covid lockdown, was a phenomenal achievement on the part of third level colleges and the Department.  I note there is an additional &euro;430 million in capital funding and that 45% of that will go towards the technological university sector, particularly for growing apprenticeships.  Mr. Miley spoke to us about building, but even getting the apprenticeships and craftspeople in place is an issue.  This is why we need to see the centres of excellence across the country.</p> <p>  I have a few comments before I ask questions.  It was said that 60% of those between 25 and 35 have a third level qualification.  We need to ensure students currently in primary and secondary school will achieve that level, if not higher.  We need to ensure students at primary and secondary school will have access to third level.  I acknowledge that numbers are increasing no end at third level.</p> <p>  It was positive to hear that non-Exchequer funding is returning to pre-Covid levels, particularly in respect of international students.  That is due to our reputation.  I would welcome the witnesses' comments on that.  On the non-Exchequer funding package, I have a few questions on Horizon Europe.  Some &euro;95 billion has been allocated for that programme at European level.  Over the past two years, how have researchers managed in applying for the funds?</p> <p>  From speaking to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and his office, I note that funding at third level is crucial for him.  He will be bringing packages on this for review very shortly.  It is crucial to have the correct lecturer&ndash;student ratio in so many areas.  I studied history and French in NUIG and do not even want to say how many students were crammed in to listen to fantastic history lecturers.  There are certain subjects, particularly in laboratory-based education, in respect of which the student&ndash;lecturer ratio has to be very small.  We must have the infrastructural facilities to meet the demand for STEM subjects.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Miley of the IUA.  He referred to research and development.  He compared our funding for research at third level with that available elsewhere.  The funding level is a bugbear of mine.  We must increase our funding drastically.  Mr. Miley referred to GBARD and pointed out that we need to reach the EU average of 1.43%.  I would be very supportive of an increase in funding for research and development.  Could Mr. Miley comment on this?  When we have to fight for funding, we show its benefits by demonstrating Ireland's innovation, the talent that third level research produces and what is delivered for communities and society and businesses in general.  We demonstrate how investment results in jobs in our regions.  We need to show that.  Are the walls around third level colleges coming down to show the impact of research on society?  If Mr. Miley wants to make a couple of comments on that, he may do so.</p> <p>  Senator Flynn spoke a little about my next point.  NUIG has an inspirational leader in Mr. Owen Ward, who is now the first full-time Traveller education officer at the university.</p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. Ryan.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, was in GMIT regarding the development of our new Atlantic Technological University, which will open on 1 April.  I was delighted, of course, to see much more gender balance.  Ms Maura McNally, chair of the Bar Council, will be the chair of the governing body of the Atlantic Technological University.  Dr. Ryan spoke about how the technological universities reflect their geographic areas and where we come from and referred to how university campus towns will attract investment.  Could he comment on what he has seen over the past year or two regarding how this is happening?  As I asked Mr. Miley, how can we fight for investment in research, which we clearly need?  I am referring to how we show the impact of third level education and research in communities in rural and regional areas.  It could be a matter of delivering through the rural networks and Irish Rural Link and of funding under Horizon Europe.  It could also be a question of how we develop transport links and broadband in rural areas and drive investment in this regard.</p> <p>  I very much appreciate Professor Hegarty's comment on apprenticeships and on the head of Volkswagen having been an apprentice.  I was listening to the professor's comments earlier.  While I very much agree that we need to consider the rules, including the financial rules, concerning the National Training Fund, it must be opened up.  Our apprenticeship programme and the investment we are seeing in apprenticeships is to drive that.  We need to make sure the fund is being used.  It funds minimum training allowances for craft apprentices over 25.  I ask Professor Miley to start.</p></speech>

We were recently involved in an RT&Eacute; series called "Change Makers" which told the stories of various researchers in our system who are doing things of direct benefit to society.  There was a very interesting example from Galway.  I have forgotten the professor's name.  He calls himself "physicianeer".  He is a medical guy and an engineer all in one</p></speech>

That is just one little vignette of the value of research.  One of the challenges in our system and what we have been trying to do with that series and elsewhere is to show the real practical value of what happens.  People sometimes think of people locked behind doors wearing lab coats and wonder what difference it makes to their lives.</p> <p>  Another example would be in Limerick.  We now have very strong collaboration from the University of Limerick, which has started an immersive software programme, working directly with some of the leading ICT companies in the world.  That is a teaching element but also has a research element.  The connections are very much there.  We probably all need to tell the story of it better.</p></speech>

She mentioned the prologue about international reputation.  We are working on the international strategy at the moment.  The Department is working on that and we are feeding into it.  That question links into the broader policy question of demand for places in higher education.  Mr. Miley and I spoke about this privately earlier.</p> <p>  The Senator asked me directly where we come from.  I noticed her Twitter feed earlier this morning extolling the praise of central Ballinasloe which Mr. Miley will be delighted to see.  I am very impressed with her being here with us in person.  When we were setting up these technological universities, including the Atlantic Technological University, ATU, part of that was about telling the story.  It was very much about engaging with the region to convince the region to bring people with it.  This was not just about the institutions.  The Senator knows this.  She has supported it, as did Deputy Conway-Walsh.  It was about the ambition of our region to come together.  These are catalysts for the sustainable growth of that region.</p> <p>  I take Mr. Miley's final point and what is implicit in the Senator's question.  There is something about how we together tell the story.  It goes back to my point about prioritisation and there may be some work to be done on that.</p></speech>

Let me explain what the obstacle is.  The problem with apprenticeships is often getting the mentors.  Small and medium-sized firms in many ways provide an ideal surrounding in the sense that the mentors are actually there and they are doing it day to day.  Those mentors might be owners of the business or their relatives or senior people in a small business.  The main obstacle is that the small to medium-sized firms cannot afford the two days when apprentices are out attending tuition.  If that were funded through the National Training Fund, that would significantly increase the uptake of apprenticeships in small and medium-sized firms.  I accept Deputy Conway-Walsh's point that that is where private funds could be used to fund a public good.  We need to remember that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  If employers feel they are paying for it, it is important they should see a return and the return is very much in the public interest.</p></speech>

I echo what Senator Malcolm Byrne said earlier in welcoming the appointment of Patrick Prendergast to the board of the governing authority in what will now be the South East Technological University, SETU.  It is a clear indication of the ambition for that institution to have somebody of that calibre.  I also welcome the Minister's appointment of Jim Bergin and Ruth Beadle.</p> <p>  I find myself at variance with Professor Hegarty's position on the provision of loans.  We can consider the social and cultural capital for someone from Dublin 10 versus someone from Dublin 6.  It may be very easy for somebody from Dublin 6 to take that level of debt on board to participate in third level education, but that will not be true of somebody in Dublin 10.  I come at that from a personal point of view.  My generation is the first in my family to access third level education.  Had that bar been raised in front of us, I am not sure if we would have cleared it.</p> <p>  I have some questions for Mr. Miley.  I suspect I may know the answer to this already.  He made a comparison based on relative funding and he referenced GNI* when he mentioned 0.6%.  I want to make sure we are comparing like with like.  Because of our frothy GDP figures, we tend to use GNI*.  Are we on a firm footing when we are comparing GDP figures in other countries with GNI*?  Are we comparing like with like in that?  </p></speech>

Those are the OECD figures.  They are not the headline GDP figure.  That true GNI* figure is used in the OECD comparison.</p></speech>

If we are the second worst in overall funding based on GNI* when we have those high levels of participation, I suppose the logical outworking of that is the cost may be subsumed into the increased pupil-teacher ratio that Mr. Miley mentioned.  I absolutely agree with him that 23:1 is much too high to provide the level of education we need.  The other component of that must be the cost to the individual student.  Where does Ireland rank in the OECD on the cost to the individual student to access third level education?</p></speech>

The direct contribution by students of &euro;3,000 is now the highest within the EU.  I do not have those figures right across the OECD.  We know the UK charges &pound;9,000.  We are probably in the top one third in that.  I will look at that OECD report and I can send the Deputy the details from that.</p></speech>

For a long time, cost rental has been a core Green Party housing policy.  I was a member of the policy group that wrote it in for the first time, possibly going back to 2016.  It strikes me now as that type of a jumper that is being worn by many people.  I am not sure I recognise what cost rental now means when people refer to it.  I would have factored in things like security of tenure and long-term tenure.  That clearly does not apply in a third level context.  Presumably these would be nine- to ten-month lets with a short-term letting element within that for a summertime letting.  When Dr. Ryan says cost rental, what does he mean?</p><p>By the way, I very much welcome the fact that technological universities can borrow for student accommodation within Housing for All.  That is pivotal in the case of Waterford, for example.  It is very much required to provide income on campus for the new South East Technological university, SETU, and in terms of alleviating the pressure on the rest of the housing market.  I would like to hear the nuts and bolts of how our guests envision a cost-rental model applying to this particular type of accommodation.</p></speech>

We are not coming with the solution; we are coming with the argument for the conversation.  It goes back to the point made earlier by Mr. Miley that demand is certainly there for accommodation but the metrics are not working now for the students.  If we are allowed to borrow now and we do build accommodation, it just is not going to be within the budget of students.  My office is located not too far from here.  There is beautiful student accommodation right across the road from it but one will not find the average Irish student living there.  That is not the ballpark they are in.  I am open to advice in respect of this and how it is done but, as Minister himself has said - he is open to this conversation - it seems that without direct Government support on this, the model of us building accommodation and then selling it or renting it out at that price is simply not going to be within the purview of students.</p></speech>

For cost rental to be really effective within the housing market, we need a specific definition of what it should do and should not do.</p> <p>  I will turn briefly to Professor Hegarty.  In broad terms, I agree with his observation that random selection is an obscenity.  What that throws up, however, is that there are high-competition courses.  I am wondering a little bit about whether throughput is being planned.  I trained as a primary school teacher after training as a medievalist, a field I found out had a limited labour market.  I turned to primary school teaching.  There was a shortage of primary school teachers and places were scaled up as a result.  There was then a failure to scale back those places.  I sometimes worry that people are being trained for emigration.  We have high-competition courses that are desirable for several reasons but are we matching third-level provision to what the needs will be?  I do not necessarily believe in matching educational outcomes to the marketplace.  That is not necessarily how one should guide educational outcomes.  That said, is there an awareness of the danger that we may be educating people for emigration, particularly those in training to become veterinarians, doctors or educators, for example, whatever about broader education such as arts degrees?.</p></speech>

I will first address the Deputy's question on student loans.  One of the things that concerns me is that because student loans have become so politically divisive and the subject so toxic, anybody who makes a suggestion in that connection is viewed as a purveyor of poison.  In fact, I would be completely supportive of Donogh O'Malley's decision on free secondary education.  We all see the benefit of that now.  I am also completely supportive of the point made by the Deputy.  The very fact that he could get access to third level and become a primary teacher and now represents his constituents in the Houses of the Oireachtas is testament enough to the benefit of that education.  He should not get me wrong on that.  In the context of the proposal we have made, we are talking about loans at the margin that would help people who could not otherwise take advantage because their family would not be able to support them or to suffer the income sacrifice to get them through third level.  That is what we are proposing.  We are not proposing a student loan system that acts in replacement of the existing grants.  This can be done.  It can be done with European support.  I have no doubt about that.  The money is there in Europe and a structure needs to be established to avail of it.</p> <p>  On the issue of cost rental, Mr. Miley made a very good point earlier.  It is linked to the overall housing market.  The sums are not right now but it may be the case that with some kind of joint venture arrangements involving private funding and public funding - State support that is delivered and adhered to, rather than State support that is promised and then withdrawn - it might be possible to square that circle.  I would encourage developers, the State and the institutions to discuss options.  </p> <p>  I refer to the Deputy's question on skills and preparing people for the right things.  Ironically, the Deputy can point to the fact that he became a primary school teacher and then suddenly there was a surplus of primary school teachers, but the skill set he was given in terms of dealing with parents and young children stands to him today.  We need to recognise that people's lives will change.  People will change.  Most people coming out of college now will have 15 different jobs in the course of their working lives and it will be impossible to prepare them for every one of those but we have to give them transversal skills.  We have to give them the skills that enable them to effectively self-educate and transfer from job to job.  They will need all these skills of dealing with people, acquiring knowledge and communicating.  I could continue that list at length but the real point is that we need education to actually develop the individual personal skills.  It is the most important thing.  If that is done, the graduates will be equipped to make the transfers they-----</p></speech>

On the Deputy's final point, again, it is that broader view of an education.  If we were indentured to an economy, it would not be a proper education.  Are we mindful?  We have to be mindful because this is public money.  We are informed by the National Skills Council and the regional skills forums.  There is a significant amount of work that goes in with industrial liaison bodies, etc.  The professions are a big part of it, as Mr. Miley will attest, along with ourselves.  They are mindful of the numbers of people coming in.  Placements are themselves a limitation.  As a registrar, I developed a veterinary nursing course in Athlone.  That involved talking to the veterinary council all the time, it outlining the demand for veterinary nurses, and then calibrating to that amount.  It is not a free for all.</p></speech>

There is a differentiation in focus between technological universities and the other universities in that regard.  Traditionally, the institutes of technology had a closer working relationship with industry and were guided in course development and so on, whereas the universities may have a wider remit.  I am heartened that there is an eye to where people will go after their qualification.</p></speech>

What is required to get this to where he would like it to be?  Is it political will?  From where does he need support?</p></speech>

I have only looked at it on a preliminary basis.  There is funding available from the European Social Fund.  It is a matter of putting together a proposal involving a partnership between the State and a financial institution.  I have been talking to the credit unions on this.  That must be done on the basis that there is a limit to the interest.  It cannot work for the student if the interest rate is more than 4%.  Can it work for the financial institution?  One must bear in mind that Europe will actually guarantee 80% of the loan.  At the same time, an interest rate of 4% is only attainable if there is a very high level of repayment.  I think it is possible.  The sums need to be done.</p><p>A process of discussion needs to start with the European strategic investment fund.  If the State were interested, I would be more than happy to do the investigation on this and come up with the proposal.  However, one can spend one's life on something that is going nowhere.  If the State is not interested there is little point.  If the State is interested in this, I think there is a significant opportunity and potentially extensive funds available.</p></speech>

The committee can look at it if Professor Hegarty would bring something forward.  We are interested in anything that would assist students in getting where they want to get in their education.</p> <p>  Mr. Miley noted earlier that the report on the future funding of higher education will soon be published.  He said that it needs to be ambitious and sustainable and to reflect the realities of the current challenges facing the sector.  He spoke about SUSI and its reform.  As a public representative I have many examples of issues with SUSI.  One that still frustrates me seven or eight years later was the case of a student who was from a large family.  His parents would have probably gone through second level education but definitely not third level education.  The son going into third level was totally breaking the mould.  He was going to Waterford.  He was a fraction of a kilometre out of the catchment for SUSI.  I happened to hear of the situation.  The parents did not come to me looking for assistance; I went to them offering my assistance.  After the most painful and ridiculous phone calls and conversations back and forward with SUSI, this guy is now fully qualified and working in a very professional job.  Had I not been involved, he would not have got to where he got to.</p> <p>  Reform is probably an understatement of what is needed in SUSI.  I think it needs to be torn asunder and re-examined.  We need to consider what SUSI is actually doing.  I think it is about giving people an opportunity.  SUSI is financed by the State but you would swear it was coming out of their own pockets in cases like the one I have just described.  I really feel that reform is a very light word to be using here.  It really needs to be an in-depth reform of what SUSI is about.  I will ask the three witnesses a really important question which I have asked before.  What sort of reform is needed for SUSI?</p></speech>

It has been a very useful discussion overall.  This issue is very close to my heart.  I got a grant to go to college; I know what this is about.  On the person the Chairman referred to who had a life opportunity because of an intervention he made, the story is encouraging but it is also frustrating that the intervention had to happen.  I will go back to the point I made earlier.  The needs analysis is absolutely critical to this.  I do not go with the open-ended chequebook that opens the door to everyone.  We have to be sensible and pragmatic.  Coming in here with our proposals, we try to be that.  We recognise that there is and always will be a limited budget available to the system.  We have to change the rules.</p> <p>  There are some people going to college at the moment who are not getting enough support.  There are others who are not able to go at all because they are not able to access the supports.  The Chairman has illustrated one example of that.  There have been some changes to SUSI in the more recent budget, introduced by the Minister, Deputy Harris.  They are welcome but I do not think they will go far enough.  This relates back to the student contribution issue.  Our members have no opposition to a political decision being taken to reduce student contributions overall.  The question we would ask is whether it is appropriate, just or fair that a person from a family that can afford to pay whatever level of fee - &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or more - gets a free ride while somebody cannot afford at all to go to college cannot be supported.  In our view there is only one answer to that question.  We have to have a more refined needs analysis within the SUSI system.  It is too crude at the moment.</p></speech>

I echo what Mr. Miley said.  We really appreciate this opportunity to feed into an important discussion.  The reform is absolutely welcome.  The Chairman's example shows how a small degree of flexibility can make a big difference to a life.  It is repaid not just through that person but right through society.  From my own experience as a registrar, if we went by a rule book all the time we would not get very far.</p> <p>  That brings me to the point of what we could do.  We could employ more discretion and invest more discretion in the professionals on the ground.  I watched what was happening in institutions.  There is a massive body of experience and knowledge in all of our support and caring services throughout the system.  They know the students.  They read the students very well.  If they had "fraction of a kilometre" discretion in everything they were dealing with, we would have a much more effective system.  It can still be absolutely accounted for.</p></speech>

It should be told more often.  Well done, Chairman.  You must have got great satisfaction in winning that battle.  The one reform I would like to see in SUSI is for students to be treated equitably and fairly.  Two students came before the committee during the Wake Up SUSI campaign.  I do not think Deputy Kehoe was the Chairman then.  One of their fathers was borrowing from the credit union to fund his fees in the private college he was going to.  The other was being supported by the St. Vincent de Paul.  Both of them would have qualified on a means test basis.  It was absolutely unfair that they should have found themselves without access to those funds.  They were looking for the same funds a student would get in the public sector.</p> <p>  I completely agree with the Chairman.  If one looked at the student assistance fund and where it is helping students one would get some insight into the types of situations of which SUSI needs to be mindful and supportive.  From looking at that, we might get the flexibility we are looking for in SUSI.  That is a suggestion.</p> <p>  I would like to finish by thanking Senator Dolan and the Chairman for staying with us to the bitter end.</p></speech>

We are still playing catch-up after the financial downturn in 2008 and 2009.  I am not sure if the witnesses have a figure for what is needed to really bring us up to where we need to be.  When they look at our world counterparts, is there a perfect example where third level funding is fantastic and in the premier division?  Is there an example we should be bringing here and implementing somehow?  Mr. Miley spoke about philanthropic funding.  Many universities would be in serious trouble if they did not get philanthropic funding.  I am not sure if the TU sector, now that it is up and running, will be able to get the same philanthropic funding as the universities.  Will there be the same appetite from those philanthropists out there?</p><p>I was listening to a radio station yesterday - I will not say which one, but it was not my own - and they were talking about the TUs as if they were not real universities.  It is such a downgrading of students who will be attending those colleges in the future.  It was almost a slap in the face to some students to hear the radio presenter say that they were not real universities.  These students will be coming out with a parchment that will open huge doors for them in the future.</p><p> If we continue on the path that we are on of recovering from the downturn, we will never reach the point we want to get to.  Where has the best example of philanthropy funding that we should implement here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Miley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022022200002#Q00200"><p>On the overall figure, Cassells said &euro;600 million a year.  There has been some bridging of that gap in the meantime, but we are saying it is of the order of &euro;400 million to &euro;450 million a year, and that needs to be done consistently between now and 2030.  That core funding, and we have outlined the capital funding separately, gets us to a place that is comparable to a number of other smaller countries.  I am not talking about comparing ourselves to Germany or anywhere else.</p> <p>  On the philanthropy issue, the one point I would make on that is that some of our members of done reasonably well on philanthropy funding and continue to try to push that, but it is very difficult.  It does not come easy.  It requires a lot of upfront investment from the institution to equip itself to be able to do it.  There are tax instruments that need to be looked at by the State.  Various proposals have been put forward to Government in this regard over the years.  That huge sums of money are given to schools, colleges and various other causes in the US and elsewhere is not all because of the goodness of heart of citizens or wealthy people.  It is because the tax structures incentivise it.  We need to look seriously at upweighting our tax structures in that regard here.</p></speech>

Obviously, chances are we might be stepping up towards that as a target figure.  On the question of philanthropy, yes is the answer, but it would be a slow burn to build that.  There would be much regional interest and interest from people who have gone abroad in the new TUs and as more and more of their graduates come through.  However, it will take time to build up that sort of association.  I remember being in UCD at the time it was starting its alumni network and it was a slow build.</p> <p>  On the reputation of the TUs, I fully agree with the Chair.  Much work has gone in over many years.  When you look at the impact of the old institutes of technology on the region and on sustainability, it is a very proud record.  We have to educate those who are opinion formers and opinion influencers around this.  As the Chair knows, the TUs have come through a peer-evaluated and very difficult passage to prove they are worthy of this.  That the recent appointment of the chair is at the level it is at is a great signifier of the promise and the worth of these institutions.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of sitting on the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, for ten years, from its establishment in 1991 until 1999.  On that council, I sat with presidents of many of what were then the institutes of technology.  I saw them getting their delegated authority and developing further, and I was finally able to congratulate them on becoming universities, not when I was on HETAC, because my membership ended in 1999, but subsequently when I met them.</p> <p>  I also have taught accountancy to many of the people who are now lecturing in those things.  I know the quality of their intellect.  I remember teaching in National Institute for Higher Education, NIHE, Limerick back in the 1970s, and people would say it was not a real university.  Would anybody say that of the University of Limerick now?  Government should probably have thought of making the institutes of technology universities ten years ago.  When they have been universities for ten years, you will not hear of this distinction.  They have also proven themselves in terms of the international market with recruiting international students.  Ask the international students if they are attending a real university and if they are going away with skills they need, particularly in the technological area.  There are many answers to that very facile remark.  I just wanted to put my answer on record.</p></speech>

I can call him early if it helps.</p> <p>  Joining us today from Amnesty International Ireland are Mr. Colm O'Gorman, executive director and a former Member of these Houses; and Mr. Tim Hanley, campaigns officer.  Joining us remotely from South Africa is Mr. Saleh Higazi, deputy director, Middle East and north Africa region of Amnesty International.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome them all.</p> <p>  I remind our witnesses that we have not yet left the Covid restrictions entirely behind.  In view of that they will see some members of the committee here wearing masks.  Some members of the committee are joining us remotely from their offices, including Deputy Stanton and Senator Wilson.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Gorman is no stranger to the committee and I welcome him back.  The format of the committee is that we will hear the opening statements of the witnesses and we will then proceed to a discussion, involving questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow all members an opportunity to participate.</p><p>We may have a second round, should members so desire.  </p><p> I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that we should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person or entity identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks and it is imperative than any such direction be complied with.</p><p> For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they might not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness physically present in the room.  </p><p> I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in a way that makes that person identifiable.  I remind members that they may only participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  That is either in this room or from offices within the Leinster House complex.</p><p> I am very pleased to call on Mr. O'Gorman to introduce his colleagues and make his opening statement.

Mr. Saleh Higazi is attending online.  He is deputy director of our regional office for the Middle East and north Africa region, and head of our office in east Jerusalem.  Seated on my left is Mr. Tim Hanley who is the campaigns officer at Amnesty International.   We very much look forward to discussing our research in-depth with the committee  following my opening statement.</p> <p>  Our report details how Israeli authorities are enforcing a system of apartheid against all Palestinians living under their effective control.  This includes Palestinians living in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories as well as Palestinian refugees in other countries.  The report documents how Israel treats Palestinians as an inferior racial group, segregating and oppressing them wherever it has control over their rights.  It provides new evidence of the institutionalised nature of Israel's oppression of Palestinians, and of how Israeli laws and policies are designed specifically to deprive Palestinians of their rights.</p> <p>  Amnesty International adopted a global policy on the human rights violations and crime of apartheid in 2017.  This has enabled us to examine the potential situations of apartheid globally on a consistent basis.  For example, in 2017, we released a report which found that the Myanmar Government subjects the Rohingya people to a system of apartheid.</p> <p>  For too long the international community has sidelined human rights when dealing with the question of Israel and the Palestinians.  Palestinians experiencing the brutality of Israel's repression have called for an understanding of Israel's rule as apartheid for more than two decades.  Over time, a broader international recognition of Israel's treatment of Palestinians as apartheid has begun to take shape.</p> <p>  Amnesty International's findings build on a growing body of work on the question of apartheid by Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organisations, as well as lawyers, writers and academics.  Palestinians have called for an understanding of Israel's rule as apartheid for more than two decades, and have been at the forefront of advocacy in that regard at the UN.  More recently, research by the Israeli human rights organisations Yesh Din and B'Tselem, as well as Human Rights Watch, has contributed to a spectrum of analysis within the legal framework of apartheid.</p> <p>  The scale and seriousness of the violations documented in our report make it clear that the international community must drastically change its approach.  It must recognise the full extent of the crimes that Israel perpetrates against the Palestinian people for what they are, which is apartheid.  Through its failure to take any meaningful action to hold Israel to account for its systematic and widespread violations, and crimes under international law, against the Palestinian population, the international community has contributed to undermining the international legal order, and has emboldened Israel to continue perpetrating these crimes with impunity.  Apartheid is a crime against humanity and the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account.</p> <p>  The report analysed Israel's intent to create and maintain a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians and examined its key components, that is, territorial fragmentation; segregation and control; dispossession of land and property; and the denial of economic and social rights.</p> <p>  Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued a policy of establishing and then maintaining a Jewish demographic majority, and maximising control over land and resources to benefit Jewish Israelis.    Today, all territories controlled by Israel continue to be administered with the purpose of benefiting Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians, while Palestinian refugees continue to be excluded.  Our research has also documented unlawful as well as inhumane or inhuman acts committed by Israel against Palestinians with the intent to maintain this system, including forcible transfers, administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings, the denial of basic rights and freedoms and persecution.  It has concluded that such acts form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population, and amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid as defined in the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  We found that these constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid because they are committed in a context of systematic oppression and domination, and with the intent to maintain that system.</p> <p>  Amnesty acknowledges that inhuman or inhumane acts inside Israel occur to a lesser degree, and in a far less violent manner, than in the occupied Palestinian territories.  However, our report documents violations inside Israel that amount to inhumane acts and, in the context of the wider system of domination and oppression of Palestinians, the crime against humanity of apartheid.</p> <p>  Palestinian citizens in Israel enjoy greater rights and freedoms than their counterparts in the occupied Palestinian territories, while the experience of Palestinians in Gaza is very different from those who live in the West Bank.  Nonetheless, Amnesty International's research shows that all Palestinians are subject to the same overarching system.  Israel's treatment of Palestinians across all areas is pursuant to the same objective, to privilege Jewish Israelis in the distribution of land and resources, and to minimise the Palestinian presence and access to land.</p> <p>  We make a number of very specific calls at the end of this lengthy research report.  With regard to the Israeli authorities, our primary call is for Israel to end the international wrong and crime of apartheid by dismantling measures of fragmentation, segregation, discrimination and deprivation that are currently in place against the Palestinian population.  In our report, Amnesty provides numerous specific recommendations for how the Israeli authorities can do this.</p> <p>  We call for an end to the brutal practice of home demolitions and forced evictions as a first step.  Israel must grant equal rights to all Palestinians in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories in line with the principles of international human rights and humanitarian law.  Israel must recognise the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to homes where they or their families once lived.  Israel must also provide victims of human rights violations and crimes against humanity with full reparations.</p> <p>  The scale and seriousness of the violations documented in our report calls for a drastic change in the international community's approach to the human rights crisis in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.  We call on the international community, including Ireland, to put pressure on Israel to end this system of oppression and domination.  We call for the Israeli authorities to be held accountable for </p> <p>committing the crime of apartheid against Palestinians, and for all those with jurisdiction over the crimes under international law committed to maintain the system of apartheid, to investigate them.</p> <p>  Our recommendations to other states, including Ireland, are: to publically recognise that international crimes, including the crime of apartheid, are being committed in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories; to not support the system of apartheid or render aid or assistance to maintaining such a regime; and to co-operate to bring an end to this unlawful situation.</p><p>We call on governments to immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer, including transit and transshipment, to Israel of all weapons, munitions and other military and security equipment, including the provision of training and other military and security assistance.  We call on them to institute and enforce a ban on products from Israeli settlements in their markets and to regulate companies domiciled in their jurisdiction in a manner to prohibit companies' operation in settlements or trade in settlement goods.</p><p> We call on governments to use all political and diplomatic tools at their disposal to ensure Israeli authorities implement the recommendations outlined in this report and ensure that human rights are central to all bilateral and multilateral agreements with the Israeli authorities, including by exercising due diligence to ensure these do not contribute to maintaining the system of apartheid.</p><p> We call on governments to exercise universal jurisdiction in investigating any person under their jurisdiction who may reasonably be suspected of committing crimes against humanity or other crimes under international law.  We call on them to ensure all proceedings meet international standards of fairness and do not involve seeking or imposing the death penalty.  There should be no time limit for prosecuting crimes against humanity, nor should immunity from prosecution or amnesties be granted for such crimes.  We call on governments to ensure their legal and institutional frameworks enable the effective investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of the crime against humanity of apartheid.</p><p> We have recommendations for Ireland as a member of the UN Security Council.  We call on Ireland to support action to impose targeted sanctions such as asset freezes against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of apartheid.  We call on it to support action to impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel.  As I have said, the embargo should cover the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer, including transit and transshipment of all weapons, munitions and other military and security equipment, including the provision of training and other military and security assistance.</p><p> We call on Ireland to support action to explore avenues to bring perpetrators of crimes under international law to account, in particular if Israel itself fails to investigate and prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and other human rights violations perpetrated against the Palestinian population in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.  This could include referring the entire situation to the International Criminal Court or establishing an international tribunal to try alleged perpetrators of international crimes.</p><p> Apartheid is both an international wrong and a crime against humanity.  When a crime against humanity is committed the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account.  We hope that by shedding more light on Israel's discriminatory system of domination over the Palestinian people, we will intensify efforts to dismantle the harmful policies and practices that prevent Palestinians from living with equal rights and dignity.  This can only be achieved when the international community holds the Israeli Government and other complicit parties accountable.  Apartheid has no place in our world and states which choose to make allowances for Israel will find themselves on the wrong side of history.  Ultimately, Israel must dismantle the apartheid system and start treating Palestinians as human beings with equal rights and dignity.  Until it does, peace and security will remain a distant prospect for Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p></speech>

They are very welcome to the committee to discuss what is a very important publication.  It follows previous publications from B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and most recently from the former Israeli attorney general, Michael Benyair.  They have all come to the conclusion that Israel is operating a system of apartheid.  This is something people have been saying for a long time.  There is overwhelming and convincing evidence now to show what is being operated on the Palestinians is apartheid.</p><p>The committee has done extensive work on this issue and Israel's brutal policies against the Palestinians.  A witness who previously came before the committee, Professor Noura Erakat, told the committee what Israel's goal is and it summed it up for me:</p> <blockquote> 	Israel's goal is to take as much Palestinian land, with as few Palestinians on the land as possible, and to concentrate the greatest number of Palestinians onto the least amount of land possible. This is evidenced in, and explains, the 29 contiguous bantustans in the West Bank, the concentration of Palestinians in an open air prison in the Gaza Strip. </blockquote> <p>That is what this is all about.  Of course, we know exactly where bantustans originated.  It was in the apartheid system that was in operation in South Africa.  Unfortunately it took far too long to dismantle it and that only happened when the eyes of the world were opened up to the brutal actions of the apartheid system in South Africa.  Unfortunately, the world continues to look away when fantastic and hard-hitting reports such as this are published.  They show clearly what is happening on the ground.</p><p>I have several questions and perhaps the witnesses can answer them at the conclusion.  Mr. O'Gorman said work on the report was done between July 2017 until 2021.  We know Israel has dismissed every report that has criticised it.  It has said it is refusing to embark or engage with the investigation by the International Criminal Court, ICC.  Was research and analysis carried out on the ground?  Was there any support from the Israeli occupation authorities?  How was the research and work carried out?</p><p>I have listened to the international reaction to the report and the attempts to dismiss it.  I saw the response from our Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was asked for our response.  He said he has highlighted Ireland's clear position expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians and the application of different standards in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.  He stated Ireland will continue to raise our concerns regarding discriminatory practices towards the Palestinian people.  This response is exactly why we have the report we have.  Ministers such as Deputy Coveney and the international community throughout the world continue to bury their heads in the sand and allow this system of apartheid to carry on.</p><p>The report contains some very good recommendations.  I want to hone in on some of them.  Along with others I have highlighted how Ireland is complicit in the apartheid system in operation in the occupied territories and throughout Palestinian lands.  We have seen the continued opposition to allowing the occupied territories Bill coming forward.  It would be a definitive measure and a stand against the brutal occupation and apartheid system.  We see the refusal to bring it forward.</p><p>Last year, after considerable debate, Ireland was the first EU country to declare that Israel has breached international law in annexing Palestinian lands.  Since then the silence has been absolutely deafening.  We find that Israel has breached international law but we are not prepared to do anything to hold it to account.  This is a major failure.</p><p>What is the view of our guests on that issue?  It stands in stark contrast to what is happening in other parts of the world at the moment in the context of the territorial integrity of Ukraine being at serious risk and the brutal actions of Russia.  Swift action was taken in respect of that brutal occupation - measures and sanctions were imposed straight away - but we see the inconsistency of the international community in the failure to impose similar measures, or any measures whatsoever, in respect of the brutal actions of Israel.</p><p> There are several recommendations relating to military co-operation between states and Israel.  From 2011 to 2014 there was &euro;3 million in trade between the Irish Defence Forces and the Israeli defence forces.  That involved the buying of weapons that have been tested on Palestinian citizens.  The response of the Minister is that there is a proper procurement process in place.  It is absolutely crazy that the State is carrying on any trade, but particularly military trade, with Israel.  I note that is one of the recommendations in the report.  All of the recommendations need to be adopted straight away but I refer in particular to the recommendation relating to the UN General Assembly and calling for the re-establishment of the special committee on apartheid.  That is something that can be done and must be done straight away.  </p><p> I do not disagree with anything in the report.  It is about how we make the international community and the Irish Government take action when they continue to stick their heads in the sand.  They are seriously in breach of so many international laws.  These are crimes against humanity but those in the international community, including Ireland, continue to stick their heads in the sand.  How will we force the Government to take action?  It seems to be hiding behind the EU but the EU is not interested and does not want to take action for whatever reason.  Fundamentally, ordinary citizens need to take a stand in the first instance and force the Government of the day to take action, as the Dunnes Stores workers did back in the 1980s when they took a stand against the apartheid system in South Africa.  I commend the report but it is critical that political pressure is exerted on those who have the influence and power to actually bring an end to the crimes against humanity and the flagrant breaches of humanitarian law that are being carried out.  There are so many recommendations in the report that relate to the UN.  UN expert Michael Lynk has stated the Israeli settlement expansion tramples on human rights laws.  That is a UN special rapporteur himself stating clearly that what Israel is doing is trampling on human rights laws.  There are voices pointing out the flagrant breaches of international law and criticising that but how can we force those in power to take action and stand up against the brutal actions of Israel?</p></speech>

Although the Government has yet to officially respond to the full findings of the Amnesty International report, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, have answered questions on the floor of the D&aacute;il regarding its conclusion that Israel is enforcing a system of apartheid against Palestinians.  The Taoiseach and the Minister have indicated the Government does not use the term "apartheid" in describing Israel's policies against Palestinians, with the Taoiseach stating he is not sure using the term "will add anything right now" and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, saying the Government is conscious of how the language one uses can be interpreted and that he does not think the term "apartheid" is helpful.

Yoseph Haddad, an Israeli Arab activist, is due to speak here in the Oireachtas later this week.  He is reported as saying he is coming here so that people can listen to the voices of his community rather than others who speak over them.  In undertaking this research, did Amnesty International speak to Israeli Arabs to get their perspectives?  How does the research accurately reflect their lived experiences as Arab citizens in Israel?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022022200002#D00800"><p>I welcome our guests.  Right across the committee there is an acceptance of the fundamental findings of the report that there is systematic oppression of the Palestinian people, that there are illegal settlements - in fact, they have been increasing - and that there is an entire system of control and oppression right through the occupied territories.  I do not think there is any question about that.  It is accepted.  The report is very thorough and detailed in that regard and Mr. O'Gorman got that point across succinctly in his presentation.</p> <p>  Party politics is not an issue within this committee or others like it.  Rather, it is about the matter confronting the committee.  However, I feel it is incumbent on me to state that one of the points made by my very good friend, Deputy Brady, is not objectively the case.  I invite him to comment further if he so wishes.  In fact, another friend of mine who is in the Gallery and has listened to many debates in the Seanad has accepted the bona fides of the Minister.  I think the current Minister for Foreign Affairs is very concerned with this issue.  He has visited Palestine on several occasions and is occupied by and sincerely engaged with the issue.  He recognises the wrongs in this situation and has put that on record repeatedly, including in debates in the Seanad initiated by my friend in the Gallery.  That is objectively the case.  If I understand his contributions to date correctly, there is not one finding he would challenge in terms of the detail of the report but his contention is that he has to maintain the moral authority and capacity to advance the two-state solution and the peace process which, tragically, is not very live at the moment.  I would be interested in the views of our guests on this.  That potential must be there.  He must have the moral authority and be able to speak to both sides while being unequivocal on this issue.  He has repeatedly been unequivocal on it.  I am not aware of any Member of these Houses who for one moment would suggest there is not systematic oppression here.</p> <p>  I am aware of Council of Europe reports on minors being victims of police harassment or being jailed and raids taking place at night.  The litany goes on.  I sat through a plenary session of the Council of Europe at which we dealt with a report specifically about the oppression and criminalisation of minors.  They are being taken from their homes and, in some instances, tortured.  They and their families are being terrorised.  That is all on record and nobody is suggesting the contrary.  I would like our guests to respond on the basic contention that the moral authority of a neutral country such as Ireland might be challenged or compromised if we do not maintain the capacity to speak to both sides, particularly in the context of the UN.</p><p>Amnesty's response to that will be interesting.  That is the fundamental question I would ask.  I am not here to challenge any of Amnesty's findings.  Indeed, I am not aware of any person who would wish to do so and nor could he or she factually do so.  What we do with the findings?  How do we progress them and get the correct outcome?</p><p> For the sake of balance and objectivity, which I am sure Deputy Brady would welcome, we must explore both sides of this argument.  How do we proceed here?  Do we go for the nuclear option?  In that case, the Minister's capacity to progress things would be damaged.  That is the fundamental question and I am interested to hear the answer from the witnesses.  Sadly, the facts are the facts and, tragically, it is all true.  It is only a question of how we deal with it, how we approach it and where we go from here.</p><p> Things look very bleak at the moment but does Amnesty see any prospect of a fledgling peace process or any initiatives in that regard?</p></speech>

Then I will resume with Deputy Clarke.</p></speech>

In a moment I will defer to our colleague, Mr. Higazi, who is on the line from South Africa, to speak specifically to questions around how the research was carried out and where but also to add his perspective to some of the nuance of the other questions that have been asked.  I will answer some of the finance and other questions in some detail and then hand over to Mr. Higazi.</p> <p>  I will begin with Senator O'Reilly's comments because they allow me to deal with some of the questions from Deputy Brady as well.  Then I will move on to Deputy Gannon's questions.  It is heartening to hear Senator O'Reilly's view that there is nothing in this report with which members of this committee, or indeed the Irish Government, might take exception.  That is incredibly important because the first thing, and this goes to one of Deputy Brady's questions, that all states should do, including Ireland, is acknowledge the simple, established fact that Israel is perpetrating the crime against humanity of apartheid against Palestinians and against the Palestinian populations wherever it exerts control over those populations.  That is critically important.  We must be able to name honestly what is happening and then work to hold to account those who are responsible for such crimes.</p> <p>  The committee heard what we said earlier about applying all possible influence and pressure on Israel to ensure it dismantles this system.  The simple reality, which we must begin to acknowledge, is that under the cover of political process and the pursuit of a peace process that seems to deliver for everybody but the Palestinians, Israel continues to build and develop further this system of apartheid, oppression and control of the Palestinian population.  The approach the international community is adopting at the moment is not in any way addressing the grave crimes that continue to be perpetrated by Israel.  Indeed, it is allowing Israel to advance and even increase the egregious nature of those crimes.  There must be a fundamental rethink and shift in approach on the part of the international community.  Any state that wants to maintain moral authority and to advance the cause of peace, security and human rights must stand for the rule of law and must be prepared-----</p></speech>

It is the case that all of the Minister's speeches since he became Minister for Foreign Affairs are consistently condemnatory of oppression.  I just want to put that on the record.

It is a matter of fact.  I would not like this meeting to be turned into an attack on the Minister for Foreign Affairs in any way.  We expect him to be here at this committee within a few weeks and, as is always the case, I will be inviting Deputy Brady and others to make commentary in his presence.  As he is not here today, he is not in a position to reply but I would not like to leave allegations of a political nature hanging.  The Minister will be in a position to reply in two week's time.  I am sorry to cut across Mr. O'Gorman.  I do not wish to hinder him in his endeavours to reply to questions.</p></speech>

We want to see that continue.  If it is the case that Senator O'Reilly, all members of this committee and the current Irish Government, including the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, agree with everything that is revealed in this extensive, detailed research report, then there is only one possible outcome.  Ireland must immediately recognise that Israel is perpetrating the crime against humanity of apartheid and should use all mechanisms available to ensure the system is dismantled and those responsible for those crimes are held accountable.  I do not believe it is possible to hold any kind of moral authority to advance the cause of human rights, peace and security if one is not prepared to stand up for and defend the rule of international law.  I very much hope that is what we will see from the Irish Government.  We have seen it repeatedly from the Irish political system and from successive Irish governments in the context of this particular question, and I hope we can do so again.  We are engaging directly with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister and that will continue.  I understand there will be statements in the Seanad on this matter in the coming weeks and that the Minister will participate in that, so I am sure we will hear more then.</p> <p>  On the question of maintaining the capacity to speak to both sides, I do not believe it is possible to engage in meaningful efforts to move this matter forward if we do not name simple facts.  We must start from a position of establishing truth and then require all parties to any discussion to respect their obligations under international law.  On the question of Ireland recognising the facts set out in this report and responding appropriately, Ireland along with all other states has an obligation under international law to name this wrong.  It has an obligation simply to name and challenge this wrong and to stand up for and defend the rule of international law.  That means, particularly in the case of a very grave international crime against humanity like apartheid, naming that, seeking an end to the perpetration of that crime, and ensuring those responsible are held to account.</p> <p>  In some ways that starts to respond to Deputy Gannon's questions about the comments made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I understand that, in political terms, it might be felt that language can be unhelpful at times.  The Taoiseach is on the record as saying the Government would not use the term "apartheid" in describing Israel's policies against the Palestinians.  We are not using terms.  We are providing evidence that makes it very clear that, as a matter of law, the crime of apartheid is being perpetrated.  It is not a term, a turn of phrase or a glib, throwaway statement.  We are applying international law to the specific context and making findings grounded in law.  It is not about phraseology or terms.  It is about law, respect for the rule of law, human rights and the dignity of the millions of Palestinians the international community has failed to protect for many decades.</p><p> On the question of the speaker who, I understand, is due to speak in the Oireachtas in a couple of days' time, all perspectives to this discussion are important and are welcome.  Mr. Yoseph Haddad is somebody who has spoken very often about his particular perspective as a former member of the Israel Defense Forces and as an Arab citizen of Israel.  Our research involved speaking to and engaging with Israeli Arabs to get their perspectives.  However, on that specific question and other questions to do with the research, I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Higazi, who, as it happens, is a Palestinian citizen of Israel and can deal with that more substantively.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Saleh Higazi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022022200002#F00200"><p>I thank the committee for having me here today.  I will start with the last point.  I am a Palestinian citizen of Israel.  To address Deputy Gannon&rsquo;s point about speaking to Palestinian citizens of Israel, and it touches a bit on the research methodology of this report, the 280-page report consists of more than 20 years of systematic documentation of human rights violations, which we revisited, carried about Amnesty International, both in Israel and occupied Palestinian territories.  We have more than 30 case studies in the report.  The majority of these are case studies we have reported and campaigned on for more than 20 years, including case studies inside of Israel, particularly in the Naqab-Negev Desert, where there is a situation whereby Palestinian citizens of Israel live in what are called &ldquo;unrecognised villages&rdquo;.  They are denied basic services, including electricity, water and education.  Although they are citizens of Israel, their right to political participation, including in municipal and parliamentary elections, is impeded by the lack of the infrastructure that Israel does not provide them with.</p> <p>  A system of oppression and domination will indeed create a hierarchy among those who are oppressed and dominated.  Therefore, the experience of oppression may be different from one place to another.  This is not limited to geography.  Some of the Palestinians living in Ramallah may be living a less oppressive reality than those living in Al-Naqab in unrecognised villages.  Mr. Haddad may be living a less oppressive reality or experience than me, for example.  We, as Palestinian citizens of Israel, are prevented from access to 80% of the land.  I am, for example, prevented from passing my status as a citizen to my wife.  My children are not registered to her and therefore cannot travel with her outside of the country, only with me.  Therefore we have to go separate ways &ndash; me through the airport and her through Jordan.  I am prevented from taking my wife, for example, to visit family in Jerusalem without a permit.  As members may know, the process of applying for permits can be and is, most often, a degrading, humiliating and often dangerous process.  It may include interrogation by Israeli security forces.</p> <p>  On top of that, in 2018, to crown a body of laws, policies and practices that are discriminatory against Palestinians, Israel passed the nation state law, stating very clearly in a claw of constitutional value, that this state, Israel, is only for Jewish people and only Jewish people have the right to self-determination in this state.  This also angered many Arab Jews in the state who serve in the army and have protested and continue to protest this law.  Indeed, the experiences of oppression are different.  They are not all equal, but we are all equal under a system of apartheid.</p> <p>  If I may just return a little bit to the issue of methodology, the report consists of in-depth legal analysis of a body of laws, policies, and practices that Israel has put in place with regard to Palestinians, from the time of establishment until today.  We look at laws that relate to nationality and status, land and property, and social and economic rights.  As I mentioned, we revisited our documentation over the past couple of decades.  We carried out new documentation on the ground.  I am speaking to the committee from South Africa, but now we are based in East Jerusalem in Ramallah and I have a team there.  Along with other colleagues who usually also carry out field research, including by visiting the communities and victims and getting testimonies and collecting evidence, including court documents, video and photographic evidence, medical reports and whatever corroborative evidence related to the specific case we are documenting, our team carried out, also in the context of writing this report, research on the ground specific to this report.</p> <p>  There was a question from Deputy Brady about the co-operation by the Israeli authorities.  Unfortunately, despite us requesting information and meetings on a number of occasions, including sending a letter last July to request a meeting between our secretary general, Agn&eacute;s Callamard, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid, which has gone, as usual, unanswered, the Israeli authorities do not respond to our requests for meetings or letters to request information.</p> <p>  Also, it is very important to highlight that Amnesty International, as well as Human Rights Watch, has been denied access to Gaza since 2012.  I was on the last delegation that visited Gaza in 2012 and that was to document violations by the Hamas authorities there as well as the effects of Israel&rsquo;s illegal blockade amounting to collective punishment.</p> <p>  I want also to comment on Deputy Brady&rsquo;s point on impunity and world inaction.  Indeed, Israel has been held to a lower standard than other countries when it comes to international law and the violation of human rights.  This is what we certainly hope to change with this report.  By issuing this report, Amnesty has now completed a circle of consensus among human rights organisations.  Deputies have mentioned other reports, including by B&rsquo;Tselem and Yesh Din.  It is important to note that Palestinian human rights organisations, academics and intellectuals have been using this legal framework of analysis for more than 20 years now.  They have paved the way.  Israeli organisations followed, and now international human rights organisations like ourselves have joined to complete this consensus.  We hope this will create a turning point towards dismantling this system of oppression and domination amounting to apartheid, stopping the crime against humanity from being perpetrated, and towards those perpetrating it being held accountable.</p> <p>  On the last point, if I may just comment also on the issue of the peace process and the two-state solution, this has, unfortunately, sidelined human rights and international law for too long, allowing for a situation like this one of apartheid and a crime against humanity to be perpetrated and to continue to be perpetrated.  I just want to note that, since the beginning of the year, we heard on at least two occasions from Israel&rsquo;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid, that Israel will not continue with negotiations, it will not return to the two-state paradigm and there will not be a Palestinian state.  We also heard, over the past couple of the days, I believe at the Munich Security Conference, the Israeli Minister of Defense also saying there will not be a Palestinian state.  There are these statements from Israelis that are saying the peace process is not here, it will not be here, and that Israel, and this is a position that did not change from previous governments, will not recognise a Palestinian state.  We as a human rights organisation are calling for international law and human rights to be centred in any engagement with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities and in their relationship with each other.</p><p>Without doing that, the current crisis will continue.  I hope I have addressed some of the points.  I am happy to come back to them.</p></speech>

We would encourage the Oireachtas and Government to get behind the Bill and allow it to pass through the Oireachtas as the clear will of the Parliament.

We called for an end to the unacceptable practices of forced and continuing demolitions and evictions.  In terms of the next steps in the report published by Amnesty International, many recommendations mirror what we have already said and done.  I say that to Mr. O'Gorman merely to set the context for today's meeting.  This is an area on which our members have engaged with some specialty over a period of time.  The latest report will assist us further in our engagement in the Houses of the Oireachtas, as public representatives and in the international field.  Senator Joe O'Reilly is a member of the Council of Europe.</p></speech>

I thank our guests.  As Mr. Higazi said, the circle put in place by the report captures where we are today very well.  Amnesty International is not the only group to come forward with a report like this.  Other reports have come from very different perspectives and from people with very different backgrounds.  In terms of this report's place in that group, it is important, as it is as a stand-alone piece of work, and Amnesty International needs to be commended on the time, effort and work it has put into that.</p> <p>  I welcome the replies to the methodologies behind the report.  As we have this discussion, there can no longer be a defence of ignorance, lack of understanding or knowledge of the reality of a system of segregation through laws, policies and practices that put so much horror into people's lives on a daily basis.  I listened with some interest as Mr. Higazi spoke of oppressive areas.  Less oppression is still oppression.  It may look like something different in different areas, but it does not dilute the impact that oppression has.  </p> <p>  If we are committed to recognising international law, the very basis of that is the recognition of basic human rights that goes along with it.  I take what Senator O'Reilly said regarding the amount of talk and detail that has gone into the Council of Europe.  While that has a place, there is now a diminished defence of a failure to act and failure of movement that cannot be allowed to continue.  We can only speak about issues for a certain length of time.  We can only debate issues for a certain length of time before that needs to result in the next step, whatever that may lead to.  While we can express and raise concern, that does not improve the lives of the people most impacted by the actions of the neighbouring state.  </p> <p>  The witnesses touched briefly on the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill.  I am curious as to the witnesses' feedback on the report that the committee produced last year.  I would also like to hear their opinion on the potential UN treaty on business and human rights that is to be published quite soon and the impact it could have and role it could play here.  When something is named and called out for what it is, I agree with the witnesses that it brings an additional focus to an issue, regardless of what it may be.  </p> <p>  This committee has, as part of its remit, spent a considerable amount of time considering Israel and Palestine, and the various different wrongs that are happening.  I cannot say that we have had a report quite like this to date.  I again congratulate the witnesses on the work they have done.  It is an important piece of work.  I ask for their feedback on our committee report and the potential role for the business and human rights treaty.</p></speech>

Most of all, I thank Amnesty International for what is an excellent report and one that has the most profound implications for anybody who accepts, which I believe they should, its findings and conclusions.  It is an amazing thing to have, in such a forensic way, detailed the instances of oppression, discrimination and injustice that have been visited on Palestinians, which many might acknowledge.  However, it goes further and explains that the policies of apartheid, oppression and persecution are not the incidental result of this or that government, rather are the outworkings of a system and state that is an apartheid state.  It has been an apartheid state from its very foundation.</p> <p>  I would like Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi to comment on that point.  I would say it is impossible to deny the systematic nature of the oppression, persecution and discrimination that Palestinians suffer.  However, we are breaking new, and absolutely correct, ground in saying that those are the outworkings of an apartheid system and are written into the DNA of the Israeli state.  That has very profound implications.  </p> <p>  In my case, without any political tutoring I came to those conclusions in 1987 after a few weeks of working in an Israeli moshav in the Negev and then walking a few weeks later into Al Fawar refugee camp in Hebron.  It was apparent to me in the first few weeks of the first Palestinian intifada that I could not describe what I saw as anything other than apartheid.  It screamed at me that this was apartheid.  It was systematic and institutionalised, and in the very nature of the state.</p> <p>  I would like Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi to elaborate a little on what that means.  For example, much of the political debate, even though it has been critical of the Israeli state in the treatment of Palestinians, would say that if we change one bit of policy, behaved slightly differently elsewhere and worked genuinely towards a two-state solution maybe we could address the problem.</p><p>It seems to me, however, that that cannot resolve the problem.  This is my view and I want to know if it is the view of Amnesty International resulting from its findings.  The inevitable conclusion of this report and of the facts on the ground is that the apartheid system and the state that operates and is based on that apartheid system have to be dismantled.  That has questions for the two-state solution.  In fact, the two-state solution institutionalises apartheid, even by definition.  Will either of the speakers comment on this?  There is a certain analogy here to the extent that very few of us would accept a two-state solution to the conflict in Ireland.  We would reject it.  There is no two-state solution as that is a recipe for sectarian division and conflict in perpetuity.  Yet much of the international narrative is that somehow a two-state apartheid segregation and separation of Jewish and Palestinian people is somehow a viable solution.  Is it the conclusion based on this report that this is not only a fantasy but actually perpetuates the apartheid system because it is based on the separation of Jews and Arabs based on racial differences and that has very profound implications for how we understand the need to address this problem?</p><p> Amnesty International has argued for comprehensive sanctions.  If we accept that Israel is an apartheid state, as evidenced by the Israeli law of return which gives Jewish people the right to return to the state of Israel even if they have never set foot in it but denies that right to millions of Palestinians, as set out in the basic law of the state, and extends to such things as the Jewish National Fund and its policies in regard to land and the nation-state law, do we have to say that it is not only about particular sets of sanctions to address this, but that we are duty-bound to have the same approach to the apartheid state of Israel as we had to the apartheid state of South Africa?  Is that not inevitable?  I ask Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi whether the inevitable conclusion one has to draw is that we simply cannot allow an apartheid state to persist and that we cannot give it any kind of legitimacy or credibility at any level if this is a system as bad, or arguably worse in its institutionalisation of apartheid structures, as the apartheid system of South Africa.  Those are my questions.  I commend the Amnesty International team again on putting together a fantastic report.  </p><p> To give some breaking news, as well as the Seanad, the D&aacute;il will also be discussing this report today.  I asked for that today and the Chief Whip has indicated that the D&aacute;il will also discuss the report next week.  We have to make our decisions on this report and we have to act.</p></speech>

I welcome this report.  It was joyful to read it and look at the recommendations.  This report lays bear in brilliant detail what Palestinians have said for decades, namely, that they are living under a system of apartheid.  There is no doubt about that.  We know that B'Tselem and others have said the same thing.  B'Tselem is Israel's biggest human rights organisation.  We in Ireland have stood for human rights and played an important role in opposing apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s.  Ireland has an obligation to act on this now.</p> <p>  In 2018, I was in the West Bank and Gaza.  I do not know how I got in but I did.  I cannot explain the big impact that had on me.  It left a mark on me that I will never forget.  I saw the blatant apartheid with my own eyes.  I went to Hebron where I saw how Palestinian people were moved out of their homes and businesses, up into the mountains.  They were not allowed to walk down their own streets.  Imagine if, on Dublin's Grafton Street, people were moved out of where they lived, apartments or businesses, taken out somewhere and then not allowed to walk up even to look at where they used to live.  This is in the West Bank under the so-called two-state solution.  I drove through the settlements.  People have this image of the settlements being little huts, but it was like driving through Florida.  There were palm trees, shopping centres, big fountains, swimming pools and when you drive around the corner people have no water and their electricity has been cut off.  They are living in deprivation and poverty.  People cannot drive down their own roads.  If they have a certain licence plate, they are not allowed to drive on the main roads but must drive another route.  Kids in Hebron, instead of going 200 m to their school from where they live, have to walk two miles because soldiers were there.  We were allowed to go down those streets because we were with an Israeli citizen, an ex-Israeli soldier from Breaking the Silence.  He told us, on that trip, that when he and other soldiers were going on duty from midnight until 8 a.m., they were told to make their presence felt.  He said they had to go into homes in the middle of the night and terrorise those people so that all their neighbours would hear them.  That was making their presence felt.  Sometimes they would insult the women to get the men going.  They would do that from midnight until 8 a.m.  The chances are that will happen tonight while we are asleep in our beds.  That is the reality.  That is what I saw.</p> <p>  I cannot tell our guests what this means to me.  The International Court of Justice, ICJ, states that these settlements are illegal and break international law.  We are trying to do something that is not major by any means.  All we are trying to do to make a point is not receive goods from settlements.  By receiving these goods, we in Ireland are breaking international law.  When I started to campaign for the occupied territories Bill, I held public meetings around the country.  People were hanging from the rafters at those meetings.  They were crowded.  People were turned away from them.  In this country we know what it must be like for the Palestinian people.</p> <p>  This report means so much to me and the Irish people.  I cannot thank Amnesty International enough for it.  At last, we have an organisation like Amnesty International saying that this is apartheid.  It was the same in the 1980s.  The Irish Government in the 1980s would not support legislation at that time, and it was the people in Ireland who changed the course of what happened in South Africa in the 1980s.  I believe the people might do the same again.  I intend to hold meetings again in this country, with this report, to say "This is apartheid".  That is what I would like to see happen in this country.  It is not just about the Government and what it is saying.  This is about what the people are saying.</p> <p>  I have two questions for Mr. Higazi.  One is about the occupied territories Bill.  What would it mean to the Palestinian people to have the occupied territories Bill passed in this country?  I have been invited to many countries in Europe, as well as Chile and other countries to talk about the occupied territories Bill because people in those countries want to introduce similar legislation.</p><p>I have not got around to visiting them all.  What would it mean to the Palestinian people?  I remember when we could not get the occupied territories Bill in the programme for Government.  When we brought it in during the last term, all Opposition parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, supported us.  When it was discussed as part of the programme for Government, it was taken off the programme, which was devastating.  What was that like for the Palestinian people?  Is Mr. Higazi aware of what that was like for them, because I know I got hundreds of emails from them asking what was going on.  They thought Ireland was going to help them.  They thought Ireland was going to stand up for what was right, and for them.  The Palestinian people are looking to Ireland to help them.  That is why this report is so important, and I cannot thank Amnesty enough.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is as simplistic as suggested by Senator Black.  It is a light piece of legislation.  The House will have an opportunity to discuss it.  It is not just an issue of political will.  There are some legal issues attached.  However, I do not wish to pre-empt what Mr. Higazi might say by way of a response.</p> <p>  I will come back to Mr. O'Gorman and his team in response to the very strong contributions of Deputy Clarke and our visiting representatives from both Houses, Deputy Boyd Barrett and Senator Black.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has asked for an elaboration of the terminology of "apartheid".  As a reminder to members and, indeed, Mr. O'Gorman, last year we produced what we described, and was independently described as, a pretty comprehensive report calling for an end to practices we described as unacceptable.  We forwarded copies to the Government and to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I put it to Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi that, while we all acknowledge the importance of the report, we should go further in terms of next steps to look at the recommendations.  For example, the report calls for an end to home demolitions.  We already accepted that.  The report calls for an end to forced evictions.  We accept that.  It states that Israel must grant equal rights to Palestinians in Israel and in the OPT, in line with principles of international human rights law.  We have accepted that as a committee.  It further calls on Israel to recognise the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return home, to where they or their families lived in the past.  We, again, called for that.  The report calls for the international community to step up its engagement to end the cycle of conflict.  Nobody would disagree with that, least of all members of our all-party committee.  However, I note that Amnesty's Israel chief criticised the group's report, which accused Israel of apartheid.  One might expect a refusal by Israel to accept the report would not be in any way surprising.  It is what one would expect from the usual suspects.  However, it seems to me that there are suspects who may not be "usual".  I refer to Molly Malekar when she said that Amnesty International's report is too sweeping an indictment, ignores human rights work and wrongly depicts Arab-Israelis as helpless victims.  It was very strong criticism.</p> <p>  In addition to Senator Black's question, would Mr. Higazi like to comment on the head of the Ra'am party in Israel, Mansour Abbas, who said he would not use the word apartheid to describe relations between Jews and Arabs within the country?  Mr. Abbas noted that he is in a position to join the cabinet, which he may well do.  He felt that it was a little unhelpful to use the very strong terminology in the report.  He is looking for solutions and to bring people together.</p> <p>  In terms of next steps for the report, I acknowledge that members of this committee and the Houses of the Oireachtas will have a role in what Deputy Boyd Barrett said about debates next week perhaps in the form of a motion from the Parliament.  I have not seen the detail, but Deputy Boyd Barrett might help me in that regard.  I thank Mr. O'Gorman for dealing with the queries and questions of the members so far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022022200002#J00300"><p>The Chairman might assist me.  I have tried to make a note of the significant number of questions that have been asked and I want to try to deal with them all.  If there is any we do not get to, perhaps the Chairman will remind us, particularly the questions he raised.</p> <p>  A general point I wish to make is that we of course recognise the extraordinary work many people have been doing for a very long time on this issue.  One of the things we think is significant about the publication of this report is that it now establishes a consensus across the international human rights movement that the crime of apartheid is being committed by Israel.  That is an important moment.  There is now a clear consensus on that fact and we are calling on others to step up, to name that wrong, to acknowledge that crime, and to take the steps that flow from that.  We recognise the work of B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and other organisations in that regard.  We were very conscious of that fact when coming before this committee.  This is an issue on which this committee has been very engaged.  We welcome, appreciate and value the calls made in the committee's recent report that reflect many of the steps we are taking which are critical to dismantling the system of apartheid this report reveals.</p> <p>  However, we urge the committee to go one step forward and recognise that all the violations that members have identified and called for an end to, constitute a system of domination and control over Palestinians, who fall under the control of Israel, and that that amounts to the crime of apartheid.  We ask the committee to look at the evidence collected in its own work and the sum of all the recommendations the committee made.  It made those recommendations on the basis that there are breaches of international law being committed by Israel.  Members must realise that there is a system at play here.  Please look at the very solid and extensive evidence that has been presented by us and so many others for so long.  We are talking about a system of oppression and control.  Even if the members are not inclined to listen to that evidence, I ask that they listen to what Israel says.  Israel talks about maintaining a system of control in order to achieve very particular outcomes on its own part.  Israel is very clear about this.</p> <p>  That leads to me addressing some of the questions from Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He might not find these answers particularly useful, but I will explain why they might not be particularly useful.  We are a human rights organisation.  We operate within the context of the framework of international human rights law, and our analysis is within that framework.  I say that to explain an answer to some of the Deputy's specific points.  He was talking about Israel as an apartheid state.  That is one of the questions we have been asked since we issued this report.  Are we saying that Israel is an apartheid state?  We are not, and there is a reason for that.  Apartheid is a grave violation of international law, as everybody knows, where one racial group exercises oppression and domination over another racial group.  It is a crime against humanity committed by individuals who perpetrate serious violations in order to maintain such oppression and domination.  Thus, under international law, there is no such thing as an "apartheid state" and that is why we have not used that phrase or made that particular finding in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked questions about political solutions to this conflict and whether two-state solutions and other solutions might deliver.  We are asking the international community to step up and go beyond the question of political frameworks that provide solutions and instead start to respond to the very grave crimes and grave human rights violations that are being perpetrated in the midst of this conflict.</p><p>As a human rights organisation, we do not comment on political questions such as the legitimacy of any particular state or ideology.  We do not take a position on Israel as a Jewish state or on the rights of Palestinians to an independent state, since we do not take a position on the measures taken by people to exercise their right to self-determination.  We simply cannot do that as an international human rights organisation.  We recognise that both the Jewish and the Palestinian people claim the right to self-determination, but in the context of any process that seeks to arrive at a political solution to this conflict, there needs to be recognition that the promise of a political solution or the dancing with a notion of it, as undertaken by Israel, has been used as cover to build and maintain a system of oppression and control.  We support all efforts to bring an end to that conflict.</p><p> Of course we, as individual human beings and as an organisation, support every possible effort that might be brought to bear to provide a solution to this conflict.  It is now many decades since the foundation of the state of Israel and the beginning of the development of this system of oppression and control.  The international community has to recognise that the role it has played so far has granted Israel absolute impunity to continue to commit these grave crimes under international law.  We are now at a point where Israel will suggest that stating that fact is anti-Israeli, as if there is something inherent to Israel as a state that demands or requires that it be permitted to perpetrate these violations.  I cannot imagine anything being more anti-Israeli or against the integrity of any state than the political leaders of that state asserting that it is central to its character that it be allowed to breach international law and violate the human rights and dignity of millions of people, including citizens of the state, to whom it denies equal rights and nationality.</p><p> I will move on to some of the other questions.  I am sure Mr. Higazi will want to speak too.  The Deputy asked about comments from one member of Amnesty International in Israel.  The report was produced by Amnesty International's international secretariat.  Our secretary general flew from London to launch the report in east Jerusalem.  Amnesty Israel was not involved in producing any research for the report because that role is reserved for the international secretariat.  Of course individual people, including, perhaps, one individual in Amnesty Israel, might have a different analysis based on elements of the report, from its first reading.  The report is the outcome of four years of exhaustive research and legal analysis that have been carried out by Amnesty International's international secretariat.  It chimes with and accords fully with findings made by other leading international rights organisations.  It accords with a view, as articulated by Deputy Brady earlier, of a former attorney general of Israel.  Is he anti-Israeli?  It chimes with comments and statements made over many years by senior political leaders from Israel.  For over a decade, former Jewish political leaders of Israel have talked about how Israel has been building a system of apartheid.</p><p> Before I hand over to Mr. Higazi to see if he would like to add anything and before I am reminded if there are questions that we have not answered, I return again to one of the key requests we have for this committee.  That request is for the committee to build upon the important work it has done so far and to apply the lens that we have applied.  When one looks at a range of human rights violations, one is looking at a system designed to produce a particular outcome.  It is a system of domination and control that is intended to favour one racial group over another and to discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians wherever Israel controls their lives.  In doing so, it perpetrates grave human rights violations.  By any standard, including a simple reading of the apartheid convention, that is apartheid.  Stating that and calling for an end to that system of apartheid is a critical next step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Saleh Higazi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022022200002#K00200"><p>I will start with the Chairman's question about Amnesty Israel's position and the head of the Ra'am party.  Our report details how the state of Israel has established a system of institutionalised discrimination, oppression and demolition against the Palestinian people.  This is a clear breach of its obligations under the customary international law.  As the world's largest human rights organisation, Amnesty will not shy away from these findings.  All research and analysis that was carried out was done according to strict research methodology and legal standards, as I explained in my previous interventions.  Recognising the complexity and sensitivity of the issue, Amnesty International engaged with colleagues in Israel as well of members of the Knesset, including reaching out to the Ra'am party, for example.  There were some positive engagements with the Joint List, which is a group of Palestinian parties in the Knesset.  They were involved in the planning and drafting of the report.  Different stages were discussed with them.</p> <p>  The report makes for difficult reading.  Our conclusion may be shocking but it cannot be ignored or altered because it is disturbing, because of criticism or opposition, or because it may be inconvenient for some people.  It should prompt intense debate at various levels, including individually, institutionally, in civic society in Israel and everywhere else, and hopefully in the political establishment in Israel and elsewhere.  This is one objective of the report.  Amnesty International's future campaigning, including our colleagues in Amnesty Israel, will seek to dismantle the system of apartheid and institutionalised discrimination against Palestinians, and to uphold human rights for everybody in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, as well as for Palestinian refugees who are continuously denied the right to return.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, we need to deal with a system and not the symptoms of a system.  There is a story that I tell about this report.  In 2014, I was a researcher with Amnesty International and I wrote a report on the pattern of unlawful killings of Palestinians, including children, by Israeli forces, in the occupied West Bank.  A case study for that report was Nabi Saleh, where there were two unlawful killings in the context of protests against illegal settlements and occupation.  When I went to present the report, I was happy about it because it was a well-researched, detailed investigation, with what I thought were strong recommendations.  One of the leading activists there, Bassem Tamimi, was also a prisoner of conscience in recent years.  He took the report and thanked us for it.  He said that they appreciate Amnesty's work and think it is important.  He opened the report to the recommendations page and said that he sees that we are asking Israel to oppress better and perhaps to kill better, but that we are not dealing with the root causes or dealing with the systematic violations.  That was a wake-up call for me and other colleagues at Amnesty.  To stop the perpetration of the human rights crisis, we need to deal with its root causes.</p><p>Last year, Palestinians protested in solidarity with families in Sheikh Jarrah and there was a general strike unseen perhaps since the 1930s.  It involved Palestinians from across historic Palestine in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, from Haifa in the south of Israel all the way through Ramallah, Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank all the way down to Naqab.  All these people protested and one day all held an act of civil disobedience whereby they did not go to school or work.  They did not open shops.  There was a general strike held by Palestinians across the green line.</p><p> In a way, this report is a response to that.  Palestinians, through this protest and strike, were saying they were one in defying fragmentation.  Most important, they were saying it was one system of oppression and domination that they were standing against.  The executive summary at the beginning of the report is basically giving that context of the support as a response to Palestinian movement and Palestinians acting under agency, both inside Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p><p> I have a point about the system, apartheid and when it started.  The report finds the system of oppression and domination leads to the crime against humanity of apartheid that exists today.  This system consists of four main pillars.  These are the fragmentation of Palestinians into different geographic areas, segregation and control of them within these areas, the dispossession of land and property and the deprivation of basic rights.  That is what exists today.</p><p> In the report, we needed to trace the roots of the system to be able to understand the system fully, which is a necessity to be able to tackle the issue more effectively.  Going back to the year of the establishment of the state, there was ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, which the Palestinians call Nakba.  There were massacres and forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.  That was, basically, the initial act of fragmentation.  We can then look at how Palestinians who became citizens of Israel were put under military rule while Jewish Israelis were not.  They were segregated into the towns and villages and they were controlled violently, including the right to freedom of movement.  In the early 1950s, there was the establishment of what is now called Israel's land regime, with a body of law and policies that were put in place to take away land and property in a discriminatory and racist manner from Palestinians and not allow them access to it.</p><p> In the report we have a case study of Iqrit, a village in the Galilee in the north of Israel, where Palestinians were forcibly displaced from the village, promised a return but the promise was never fulfilled.  The houses were blown up by the Israeli army after the displacement and the lands were taken away and given to Jewish Israeli settlements that were established around the village of Iqrit.  Even up to now, Palestinians of Iqrit are not allowed to return to their homes, although they try.  Again, we have been speaking about agency.  Palestinians from Iqrit have their weddings in the church that remains standing; all the houses were blown up, leaving only the church and cemetery, which remains.  They use these two places and the church in particular whenever they have ceremonies of death or marriage, basically celebrating life and death.  They are continuously trying to return and Israeli authorities are continuously denying them the right of return.  They are internally displaced Palestinians within Israel.</p><p> The roots of the system are there but apartheid was not codified under international law as a crime until 1973 and then again when the Rome Statute came in 2002.  The system of oppression and domination started being established around the time of the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and then with a body of laws, policies and practices put in place against Palestinians afterwards.</p><p> It is very important to stress that what is happening today is Israel is perpetrating crimes, including forcible transfer, arbitrary detention and torture, unlawful killings and the deprivation of rights to maintain this system of oppression and domination.  These crimes form part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Palestinian population and, therefore, there is a crime against humanity of apartheid being perpetrated in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories against Palestinians.  The roots of this are very important to highlight and this is what we tried to do in this report through documentation of the laws, policies and practices.</p><p> With regard to Senator Black's point, I cannot stress how important it is to have a measure of accountability.  This breaks the impunity that Israel enjoys, particularly with regard to Israeli settlements that continuously expand, including with housing units and infrastructure, leading to the continuous dispossession of Palestinians and the continuous violation of their human rights in a systematic manner on a daily basis.  The settlements are the heart of this myriad of violations that millions of Palestinians suffer on a daily basis.  There has never been accountability.  Palestinians were celebrating when they heard about the occupied territories Bill and they are still very hopeful about it.  Ireland inspires much hope and this is expressed in talking to human rights organisations or people on the ground.  The people of Ireland are seen as people who stand in solidarity with Palestinians in defending their rights.  That will continue.  There is hope and there continues to be hope.</p><p> If that Bill is passed, it will be part of the chipping away of one of the pillars of the apartheid system.  We would be chipping away at Israel's impunity when it comes to violating international law.  I cannot stress how important that would be and I hope we can see the Bill passed soon.</p></speech>

The report indicates the geographic scope is essentially Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories but another piece of work was done by Amnesty International on Palestinian refugees in host countries.  I believe it was in 2007.  What reports have since been received on the position of refugees abroad, their perception of what is going on in their homeland and a desire to go back?</p></speech>

I asked whether the apartheid system that has been identified by Amnesty International as being operated by Israel will lead us to the same conclusions as we eventually took in dealing with apartheid in South Africa?  The sanctions being called for should be of the same sort as those that eventually brought about the dismantlement of the apartheid regime in South Africa.  As the witnesses know, there is a difference in emphasis.  Some people would say we should put in place sanctions for one particular aspect, such as illegal settlements, or a particular form of behaviour.  The witnesses are saying this is a system and I agree, with the system going right across the state of Israel, not just Gaza and the West Bank.  That system has been operating for a very long time and is institutionalised.</p> <p>  It seems that this means the international community is duty-bound to take the same attitude to the Israeli apartheid system as it took to the apartheid system in South Africa?  Do the witnesses agree?  It is the inevitable conclusion but is it the conclusion being drawn by Amnesty International.  It is certainly the conclusion I have.</p></speech>

I would rather come back to colleagues directly if that is okay.  Mr. Higazi will reply to her second question and I will also ask him to speak to Deputy Boyd Barrett's points.</p><p>I might frame that by saying, in the first instance that it is, of course, understandable that when people think of apartheid, they think of South Africa.  When we have examined what is happening in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and indeed, the impact that Israel has on Palestinian refugees in other countries, we are looking at it purely in that context and applying the framework of international law to that context.  We are not comparing it with South Africa.  I am not saying the Deputy is doing that either.  I certainly remember that period in Irish life.  The world was very slow to get to grips with it and to acknowledge what was happening in South Africa.  I hope we will see a better response to what is now being revealed in respect of Israel.  Equally, many of the mechanisms that are currently available were not available then.  The ICC was not available as a mechanism, for instance, to refer the situation in South Africa to.  That is why we are making that specific call.  The situation in Israel should be referred to the ICC and this specific issue should be investigated by the ICC.  There are new mechanisms that are available to us.</p><p> To make a general point, I suspect that unless the international community gets serious about taking meaningful action to ensure that Israel is held to account and to challenge the impunity granted to Israel to continue with these egregious, flagrant breaches of international law and the commission of crimes against humanity, it is not going to end.  We agree that until the international community starts to respond in a very different way, it is not going to end.  That is why many of the findings that we made in this report have been made.  It is why we call on this committee, at least as a first step, to accept the findings of this report; to state clearly as a committee that it agrees with the analysis in the report that Israel is perpetrating the crime against humanity of apartheid; to accept and support the recommendations set out in this report, including the recommendations to other states, including Ireland; and to communicate that directly to the Irish Government.  That is something we would very much welcome.</p><p> I might refer to Mr. Higazi on the Deputy's specific question about the 2007 study on the situation of Palestinian refugees in other countries, if he is aware of it.  If Mr. Higazi is not aware of it, I am sure he will be able to talk about it in the context of the work we have done over the past four years.</p></speech>

Perhaps our colleagues in Ireland can share the link to the project with members.  We worked with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and the West Bank.  It was called Seventy+ Years of Suffocation.  We worked with an award-winning photographer who, along with our researchers, went to speak to Palestinian refugees in refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and the occupied West Bank about the 73 years and what it means to them, and about their return, their situation right now and the suffocation they feel.  Suffocation is mentioned in the title of the project.  It is about the sense of suffocation of being there and stuck in time and a place for 73 years.  That was our last attempt to do such work since the previous reports that we have done.  We also continuously work on the situation of Palestinian refugees in terms of their rights and the respect or violation of their rights in the host countries around Israel and Palestine and also elsewhere.  We can share that project with the committee.  I highly recommend it.  It is hard to describe, but it is a very powerful project.</p> <p>  I wish to make a minor point on the comparison with South Africa.  I agree that a system of apartheid cannot be reformed or amended.  It needs to be completely dismantled.  I agree with Mr. O'Gorman that in a way, we are working with the same formula that was applied to apartheid in South Africa, namely, international pressure and sanctions from outside, coupled with support for peaceful resistance from inside.  It is a very crucial formula.  It still holds.  The only addition here, as Mr. O'Gorman has said, is that we have this mechanism of international justice, through the ICC, available to us.  There is a open investigation.  We want the office of the prosecutor to include an investigation into the crime against humanity of apartheid.  We also have universal jurisdiction.  We think it is a very important tool that needs to be mobilised.  We did not see apartheid litigated in South Africa.  We want to see it litigated here.  International justice mechanisms are key when it comes to dismantling Israel's system of apartheid against Palestinians.</p></speech>

As we have been informed, a D&aacute;il debate will take place next week.  There will be a Seanad debate which will take place at the earliest opportunity, I am sure.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is coming in on 9 March.  I am sure there are issues that have been raised in respect of this report that will be raised with him on that occasion.  He will also be in a position to inform us of what he has done, which is a matter of fact on record, and more importantly, what he intends to do.  We know, in this committee, that he has vociferously made his criticism known on aspects of Israeli Government policy.  Indeed, he has done so in the context of deliberations with this committee.  I am sure he will do so again.  Let us await his attendance at our committee meeting on 9 March.</p> <p>  On behalf of the joint committee, I wish to thank Mr. O'Gorman, Mr. Hanley and Mr. Higazi for meeting with us.  I thank them not only for the overview they have given us of this very comprehensive and detailed piece of work, but also for dealing with the questions of members in such a comprehensive manner.  I propose that we go into private session for the benefit of members who are with us.</p></speech>

I will get down to business because a number of people are under pressure with different meetings taking place this afternoon.  I hope those attending remotely can hear me.  I will welcome the witnesses attending remotely shortly.  People might like to check their connections.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Senator Martin.  If anybody wants to bring other apologies to my attention, they are welcome to do so.  Some members and witnesses are physically present in the committee room while others are dialling in remotely.  They are all welcome to our deliberations.</p> <p>  I remind all participants to turn off their mobile phones or to switch them to flight mode as even though they may not appear to be interfering during the meeting, they can difficulties for the recording.</p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting today is to discuss the topic of anti-social behaviour.  A number of organisations made written submissions and that list, as usual, has been whittled down to a number of groups which will make presentations to us day, and we look forward to that engagement.</p> <p>  Witnesses who are on the call are appearing virtually.  Most, if not all, of them are in locations outside of the Leinster House campus.  I ask them to be mindful that while we have made best efforts to cover all eventualities, there is somewhat of a grey area remaining in terms of hybrid participation and privilege.  If they say something that may be dubious in regard to a matter, they should be particularly mindful that the usual rules of privilege they would enjoy when physically present may not be applied in full.  The courts have yet to test that.  Let us hope they never do.  Members should also be aware of that when they make their contributions.</p> <p>  I will run through the witnesses attending, give some background information and take an opening statement from each of the organisations.  The witnesses might raise their hand as I introduce them so that we can see who is who.  On the call, we are joined by the following witnesses: Ms Kayleigh Canning, senior youth officer, and Ms Bernie Meally, south east regional manager, from For&oacute;ige; Ms Una Doyle, director of operations, and Ms Olivia Keaveney, assistant principal probation officer, from the Probation Service; Mr. Richard Guiney, CEO, and Mr. Gerard Farrell, director of operations, from Dublin Town; Ms Carol Hyland, project leader, and Mr. Thomas McCarthy, drug and alcohol youth worker, from Core Youth Services; Ms Molly Joyce, acting executive director, and Ms Sarahjane McCreery, senior policy and research officer, from Irish Penal Reform Trust; and Mr. Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, chairperson, and Ms Sonya Kenir, partnership co-ordinator, North Dublin Inner City Local Community Safety Partnership.  The members of the committee will make themselves known as the meeting unfolds.  I want to check that everybody can hear me.  The sound appears to be travelling.</p> <p>  On a housekeeping note, which I am sure we are all used to at this stage, when people are not contributing to the meeting, they should mute their device to ensure we do not have background inference, and, when they want to speak, they should unmute their device so that we can hear everything they have to say.</p> <p>  I mentioned privilege already and members will be aware of the rules on privilege.</p><p>Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity, particularly if he, she or it is not present to rebut.</p><p> Members, where possible, should stick to the subject matter under discussion and not stray into ancillary matters.  However, if there is a matter related to the subject, I will allow a little discretion, but we are present today for a particular purpose and it is important that we keep the discussion on topic. </p><p> We have organised the meeting in such a way as to allow maximum engagement and questions and answers.  The time allowed for an opening statement by each party is somewhat short, at three minutes, but that will allow more time over the course of the meeting for engagement.  There will be many opportunities for witnesses to say what they want.  I will first call on a representative of each organisation to make an opening statement and inform each of those called upon when his or her three minutes is up.  We will then proceed to the members.  There will be a seven-minute block per member in which he or she can question and get responses from witnesses.  We can go around the table a little, but when a member's seven minutes are up I will move on to the next member.  This is effectively how we manage our business.  It works quite well and it is fair to everybody.  If needs be, if there is time and if questions remain, we can have a second round, whereby we will go through the whole process again in a slightly shorter timeframe.</p><p> There will be a couple of housekeeping matters to address at the end of the meeting but they are not for the witnesses to worry about.  Members should note that we might have a very short private session at the end of the meeting to tidy up some housekeeping matters and so forth.  I invite Ms Canning to make an opening statement on behalf of For&oacute;ige.  She has three minutes.  When the time is almost up, I will indicate that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.301" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kayleigh Canning" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022022200002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting For&oacute;ige to speak today on antisocial behaviour.  I am a senior youth officer with the best practice development team for Garda youth diversion projects, GYDPs.  I am accompanied by my colleague Ms Bernie Meally, area manager for For&oacute;ige's south-east region and a member of the expert steering group for the recently launched youth justice strategy.  For&oacute;ige is a national youth development organisation working with over 50,000 young people aged from ten to 24 across Ireland through a range of universal and targeted youth supports, including GYDPs.  Funded by the Department of Justice, these projects seek to divert young people from entering or remaining within the justice system by providing a range of evidence-based, outcome-focused interventions.  There are 105 GYDPs across the country, and For&oacute;ige manages over 40 of these.</p> <p>  In our experience, based on our targeted and universal youth services, there is a spectrum of behaviours displayed by young people that may be perceived as antisocial.  These range from congregating in public places to deliberately causing disruption, harassment and intimidation.  However, there is an important distinction to be made between antisocial behaviour and criminal behaviour, and it should be recognised that while some young people may engage in antisocial behaviour, this may never result in a criminal offence due to several factors, such as age, detection and reporting. </p> <p>  International research has identified risk factors directly related to criminal or antisocial behaviour among young people &mdash; for example, family circumstances or substance misuse &mdash; and we now have a clear understanding of these risks and other relevant community, geographical and socio-economic factors that contribute to youth offending.  While crime patterns can differ depending on the locality, national trends indicate that young people engaging in offending behaviour in Ireland are typically males in their older teens who carry out thefts and public order and criminal damage offences.  However, the age&ndash;crime curve demonstrates that while offending increases from late childhood and peaks in the teenage years, it tends to decline in the early 20s, and the majority of young people in Ireland who offend do not go on to reoffend.</p> <p>  In addressing antisocial behaviour, For&oacute;ige recommends the following: enhanced investment in the provision of universal youth work across the country; investment in research and evidence-based and targeted programmes and approaches designed to address the issues and needs underpinning criminal or antisocial behaviour, such as restorative practices and motivational interviewing; implementation of the youth justice strategy, prioritising nationwide GYDP service, early intervention, family support and inter-agency collaboration; the strengthening of youth justice policies and practices, taking account of age, maturity, disadvantage and diversity, which includes enhanced effective services for young adults aged from 18 to 24, recognising their unique stage of development; the enhancement of the capacity of all professionals working with young people at risk to engage appropriately and from a child-centred perspective, ensuring the voice of young people informs policies, programmes and systems; and the timely processing of young people in the justice system.</p> <p>  For&oacute;ige believes the recommendations will assist with targeting the behaviours, risks and needs underpinning antisocial behaviour among the youth population.  We thank members for taking the time to listen to our statement today.  Ms Meally and I would welcome any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Canning.  She came in on time, which was nicely done.  We now move on to Ms Keaveney, who is to make an opening statement on behalf of the Probation Service.  She has three minutes.</p></speech>

Its primary purpose is to assess and manage people who have offended and are subject to supervision in the community.  Those referred to us have committed offences across a wide spectrum of crimes.  On any one day, the service engages with 9,000 offenders in the community and up to 2,000 persons in custody.</p> <p>  The Probation Service provides those subject to supervision with individualised structured supports in their community to address the factors contributing to offending.  Our core aim is to motivate people to change and help them to increase their ability to change while facilitating improved opportunities for change.  While each criminal justice agency makes a unique contribution, no single agency has all the answers.  We work in partnership with the wider statutory, community and voluntary sector.  The Probation Service is a community-facing organisation.  Annually, we fund over 60 community-based organisations to support our work.  Services provided include education, addiction support, mentoring and outdoor pursuits, among others.</p> <p>  Antisocial behaviour impacts severely on businesses, communities and individuals.  While those we work with are, in the main, people who have committed offences, a central focus of our work is addressing the impact of offending on victims.</p> <p>  In considering the specific issue of antisocial behaviour, while there is no agreed or shared definition of the term, it tends to capture a range of behaviours that cause harm and distress to individuals and communities.</p> <p>  There is a lack of relevant data and research on antisocial behaviour in the Irish context, yet we know there is no single cause.  Causes include educational disadvantage, unemployment and adverse childhood experiences.  Relevant factors include gender, age, family environment and peers.  The biggest challenge is breaking the cycle.  An effective response has multiple strands, including direct work with individuals; awareness of the family and social context; adopting a cross-sectoral response; and building community capacity and solutions.</p> <p>  In working with individuals, we use evidence-informed practices and interventions to address the underlying causes of offending.  Change can be difficult to sustain, and there is a high risk of relapse and reoffending.  We regard restorative justice interventions as an integral part of our work with offenders.  Effective and meaningful collaboration is critical.  An example of this is our involvement with the joint agency response to crime, JARC, initiatives.</p> <p>  Providing opportunities for the community to engage with the service is an important feature of our work.  Our volunteer mentoring schemes comprise an example.  Working with community activists and leaders is another important feature of our approach.  For example, we are involved in the antisocial behaviour forum and the community safety partnership pilots, which prioritise local community concerns and topical issues such as knife crime.</p> <p>  Probation work, done well, makes a significant difference.  It adds value to the criminal justice response and ultimately contributes to safer communities.  I thank the members.  We look forward to taking their questions later in the session.</p></speech>

We are pleased to participate and hope that our contribution to the discussion will be considered beneficial.  Dublin Town is Dublin city centre&rsquo;s business improvement district.  It was established in 2008 following a vote of ratepayers in the core Dublin city centre district from Parnell Street to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  Our role is to improve footfall and business within the city&rsquo;s commercial core on behalf of our 2,000 business members, 85% of whom are consumer-facing and engaged in either the retail or hospitality sectors.</p> <p>  We pay tribute to the ongoing and tireless work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is very much appreciated by the business community.  However, we recognise that many of the root causes of antisocial behaviour are beyond the control or jurisdiction of the Garda and therefore require inclusive multi-agency responses.  While Dublin is a safe city by international standards, it has suffered from poor perceptions of safety for some time.  This unease is evident in press reporting and consumer surveys.  These consumer surveys reveal very poor perceptions of Dublin when compared with other international cities.  We believe that it is now time to address the underlying issues constructively and comprehensively.  The most effective way of addressing antisocial behaviour is to replace it with pro-social behaviour.  To achieve this, local communities, be they business or residential, should be included as part of the solution and in co-ordinated responses.</p> <p>  Over the past ten years, we have witnessed successful interventions aimed at reducing antisocial behaviour.  Our experience is that when such initiatives come to an end, the issues tend to arise again.  However, such successes give us confidence that we have it in our power to improve community well-being and the city experience when we apply greater consistency to our structures and approaches.  Examples of successful interventions in Dublin include the Better City For All process.  This independently chaired, multi-stakeholder programme was an effective mechanism for identifying, considering and addressing the majority of issues pertaining to drug-related antisocial behaviour.  Dublin Town would strongly support the re-establishment of such a mechanism.</p> <p>  We further believe that the principles of crime prevention through environmental design, CPTED, should be deployed more systematically throughout the city.  Some of these principles are basic, such as increased lighting provision, while others, such as the constructive use of laneways for residential and other engaging purposes, would require planning.  We also need to eliminate dark recesses and improve waste management and street presentation in order to enhance the sense of security among the public.</p> <p>  Legislative enhancements could assist in creating a more welcoming environment.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011 could be tweaked to provide greater protection for the public.  However, greater success will be achieved by considering non-criminal sanctions.  My colleague Mr. Gerard Farrell, who is attending today, has worked with restorative justice in the Probation Service and has found this to be a rewarding exercise.  We also believe that there is scope for enhancing antisocial behaviour orders and using them not only to address difficult behaviour but also to provide supports which could assist those involved in addressing their underlying challenges.</p> <p>  Once again, we thank the committee for inviting us to attend and we look forward to engaging with it further to consider the often complex issues arising.</p></speech>

Our service was established in 1986 in response to the heroin epidemic that ravaged our city.  Since then, we have continued to work with families and young people who engage in and are affected by drug misuse, antisocial behaviour, early school leaving and unemployment.  These are often deep-rooted in intergenerational issues.  Our funding comes through the local drugs task force and the City of Dublin Youth Service Board.  Many of our young people suffer adverse childhood experiences.  When we tackle the puzzle of antisocial behaviour and the connection with young people, what is rarely mentioned is that young people can equally be the victims and perpetrators of this behaviour.  Psychologists and child therapists have also told us that all behaviour has meaning.  What is this meaning?  Is it that children are just badly behaved or are there more underlying issues at play?  In our experience working with children and young people for many years, it has become apparent to us that children are inherently good.  However, internal factors such as psychological issues and genetics, along with external factors such as childhood traumas both inside and outside the home, their interaction and lack of interaction with services, poverty and multiple existential disadvantages have an influence on children as they grow and develop.</p> <p>  In addition to these factors, services located in the community, which are best positioned to work with the needs presented by these young people and have a relationship with them and their families, are hugely under-resourced.  Capacity remains a central factor in the level of intervention these young people receive and can often determine if the measures taken are preventative or an intervention, where both are clearly a necessity.  As Ms Canning mentioned, we also worked with restorative practices and we take a trauma-informed approach when working with young people, particularly in terms of antisocial behaviour.  I thank the committee for listening to our opening statement.  We have a lot more to contribute and are open to any questions throughout the meeting.</p></speech>

The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, welcomes the decision of the committee to address the issue of antisocial behaviour in detail, as well as the opportunity to feed into this process.  The IPRT is Ireland&rsquo;s leading NGO campaigning for rights in the penal system and the progressive reform of Irish penal policy.  Our core message is that a penal system that protects and promotes human rights, equality and social justice, and relies upon prison only as a measure of last resort, will contribute to safer communities for everyone.  We will focus on three key issues in this brief opening statement, namely, the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour; the need for a whole-of-government response to antisocial behaviour; and the need for community-based and restorative responses to such behaviour.</p> <p>  On the underlying causes, antisocial behaviour is an issue of great complexity which is often characterised by multiple layers of disadvantage.  That point has already been made this afternoon.  Research in Ireland has linked antisocial behaviour to issues such as socio-economic disadvantage and marginalisation, a lack of adequate guardianship, poor supervision, issues engaging with school, and alcohol and drug use.  The importance of further research in this area cannot be overestimated.  Our first recommendation is therefore that further and ongoing research on the backgrounds of individuals caught up in the criminal justice system be conducted and routinely published so as to support targeted, best practice interventions and support for people at risk.</p> <p>  The second point is the need for a whole-of-government response.  The links between antisocial behaviour and socio-economic disadvantage make clear that solutions do not lie solely with the criminal justice system, but instead require a whole-of-government response.  The State should accordingly approach the issue as one that stretches across a number of Departments.  This approach has been embraced to a certain extent by the Government but might require legislative action.  Our second and third recommendations are that a positive statutory obligation be imposed on all relevant agencies to co-operate in respect of a child identified as being at risk, and also to co-operate around prisoner release from prison. </p> <p>  On the need for community-based restorative responses, the IPRT is clear that purely punitive responses to antisocial or criminal behaviour, such as increasing penalties or introducing harsher sentences, are unlikely to be effective in preventing or reducing such behaviour.  This is evidenced in part by CSO data, which highlight that prison does not work to deter people from reoffending, especially with regard to young people and those involved in more low-level crime.  Responses that focus instead on the underlying root causes of antisocial behaviour are more likely to be successful in preventing and reducing this behaviour.</p> <p>  Our fourth recommendation is for investment in existing interventions that have been shown to work, such as the bail supervision scheme and restorative justice projects.  Our fifth recommendation is that the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill 2014 be progressed without further delay, and our sixth recommendation is that the commitments in the youth justice strategy for pilot programmes for the extension of diversion measures to 18- to 24-year-olds and youth joint agency response to crime pilot be progressed.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to attend today&rsquo;s session, and its attention to these important issues.  My colleague Ms McCreery and I are ready to respond to the committee&rsquo;s questions as best we can.</p></speech>

We thank the committee for the opportunity to be here today.  We have detailed in our written submission our views on the topic of antisocial behaviour and how it currently presents in the area of north inner city Dublin.</p><p>We have outlined a number of strategies which may be considered by this committee in addressing the issue, in particular, review of judicial procedures, legislation, and judicial and community engagement.  We are happy to discuss the content of our written submission further with members, but for the purposes of this opening statement I wish to outline the structure and intended role of local community safety partnerships in addressing matters of local community safety.</p><p> The concept of community safety is about people being safe and feeling safe in their communities.  The new community safety policy is intended to ensure communities are safer and feel safer by making community safety a whole-of-government responsibility and priority, with a focus on prevention and early intervention.  Community safety in the most complete sense requires the proactive and ongoing input of a range of public, community services and, importantly, local residents and cannot be met by any single State agency or voluntary organisation alone.</p><p> The landmark policing, security and community safety Bill will provide for this key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice alone.  Rather, it will be best achieved as a whole-of-government responsibility, with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda and the wider community all working together.  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative local community safety partnerships to develop local safety plans tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities.  The partnerships will replace and build upon the existing joint policing committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns about antisocial behaviour.</p><p> The goal of the partnerships is that all relevant State bodies and voluntary organisations will work together effectively, in partnership with the local community, to prioritise and address issues in their area.  Three local community safety partnerships are being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, Waterford city and county and Longford county.  These pilots will run for 24 months and are subject to a robust independent evaluation.  The learnings from the pilots and their evaluation will be taken into account and will be applied to the national roll-out of the local community safety partnerships throughout the country.</p><p> Membership of the partnership pilots include residents; community representatives, including representatives of youth, new communities and the voluntary sector; business and education representatives; and representatives from relevant public services in the area, including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the local authority and locally elected councillors.  As residents and community representatives are central to identifying problems and solutions for their local communities, the partnerships have a 51:49 split in their favour on the committee.  Each local community safety partnership pilot is also supported by a full-time co-ordinator and an independent voluntary chairperson.</p><p> Each partnership is hard at work addressing local issues and working on developing a local community safety plan tailored to their area to guide future actions and interventions.  The plans will identify issues most in need of prioritisation, ensuring actions taken are strategic and effective.  They, along with the actions taken to address their content, will also serve as templates for the work of future partnerships.</p><p> I thank the committee again for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the local community safety partnerships and antisocial behaviour, and I look forward to continuing to actively support collaborative progress towards achieving a safer society for all.  Ms Keniry and I would be delighted to engage in that conversation as we proceed.</p></speech>

I thank all representatives for those.  We also received their written submissions, which will form part of the report.  Any group that did not come before our committee today but sent submissions in writing will also be factored into the report we will produce at the end of this engagement.  I will open the floor to questions from members.</p></speech>

There is a significant range of knowledge and experience in front of us and the time available does not really do justice in trying to learn from that knowledge and experience.</p> <p>  I wish first to focus on two areas.  When Ms Keaveney talked about probation issues, she mentioned restorative justice and restorative practices.  Will she give us more information about what has been done in that area and what has worked well that we are currently doing?  Has the State ever invested properly in restorative practices?  The idea of restorative justice has been talked about a lot, but it is never really something that gets the money needed for it actually to work.  I would expand that question to the other services here.  From their experience, have we meaningfully tried restorative practices?  What can we do to improve that?</p> <p>  Policing is one part of the solution, but it is also one part of the problem, particularly as regards kids on the street who have entrenched views of the Garda that are not very positive and entrenched views within the Garda of the same kids that are also not very positive.  Both groups will happily call each other "scumbags".  Essentially, there is an othering and an "us and them" mindset.  Policing can be part of the problem as well.  I would love to hear some of the experiences of Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; in working with the police in trying to undermine that othering and "us and them" mindset, or in new forms of policing.  Community policing gets talked about a lot and has had some success.  Part of this is about the learnings the committee can take into the policing, security and community safety Bill.</p></speech>

Our deputy director for operations has accompanied me today.  She has a broader view in terms of the restorative justice brief of the service and I will ask her to come in on this question.</p></speech>

We see restorative justice as an integral part of probation practice.  In terms of the investment, in response to the direct question asked, in recent years we have invested in continuing professional development for our front-line probation officers for the delivery of restorative justice interventions as part of their work in both assessments for court and case management, working with people who are referred to us.  I refer to both adults and children in that regard.</p> <p>  The Children Act provides for a family conference, which is very much in the ethos of looking at a restorative model of practice.  In any of our work with young people referred to us, and annually we would get about 500, we would always seek a restorative intervention, be it at report stage or during a supervision order.  Similarly, we would do so with adults, as I said.  As a community-facing organisation, we fund in excess of 60 community-based organisations nationwide, three of which are dedicated restorative justice services.  A number of our other community-based projects either deliver restorative justice services on our behalf or engage in restorative practices as part of the value base and culture they are trying to display in terms of the work they do with the young people on their books.</p> <p>  Restorative practices and restorative justice in particular speak to repair the harm caused by offending.  That is one of the key themes that has come through in the presentations this morning - including the relevant stakeholders in the solution.  Restorative justice does this.  It has benefits for the offender in terms of developing empathy, understanding and knowing the consequences of his or her behaviour.  It also holds him or her to account, but it does so in a very safe and structured manner.</p><p>Similarly, restorative justice done well enables victims of crime to feel that they have a proactive and positive role to play in a very safe way in responding to the harm that was caused to them.  That has a ripple effect in the context of the community.  That is also very important in developing those practices and responses. </p></speech>

There has been significant investment in restorative practices for the Garda youth diversion project, GYDP, network, funded through the Department of Justice.  The best practice development team, my team, has worked with Ulster University to develop a bespoke restorative practices model that is being implemented across the Garda youth diversion project network.  It is at the early stages of implementation but the investment is there.  It will focus on some of the formal processes but really embed an informal restorative ethos across the GYDP network.  As the Probation Service said, it is about instilling those restorative values in the everyday practices of the Garda youth diversion project from the informal up to the formal processes.</p></speech>

We are producing an interactive map across our partnership to name the community garda&iacute; to try to build that relationship at a grassroots level.  The Deputy raised three particular issues around addressing the issue.  The first is resources, then there are transfers and the longevity of individuals to build relationships.  There is quite a lot of transfer of individuals within the force which is also somewhat down to resources.   The third issue is the perception internally in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the role of community police.  That is an issue that we think some work might need to be done around.</p></speech>

I know the wonderful work it does on the ground along with organisations such as Youth Work Ireland and around catching people who may fall through the net.  I know the benefits of these organisations particularly in rural communities.  That is my experience.</p> <p>  Prior to the pandemic there was difficulty in getting volunteers for For&oacute;ige and similar organisations.  Has that resolved itself?  Have we work to do in encouraging volunteers?  In my home town of Ballieborough the Garda and other volunteers set up a For&oacute;ige and we had a huge response from young people.  There were 125 young people looking to sign up.  Our biggest difficulty then was getting volunteers to run the organisation and ultimately it did not continue because of that.  Will For&oacute;ige comment on that?</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; gave us a very good briefing on the local community safety partnership pilots.  I am delighted to see that one is in a rural joint policing committee, JPC, area like Longford.  How long are those pilots running?  He said that they would run for 24 months and then there would be robust reporting on them.  I think the JPCs are very effective and important in constituencies and communities because they have input from the Garda, education, young people and the local authority and all those at the coalface of dealing with antisocial behaviour.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; have any further thoughts on the role of community policing in antisocial behaviour?  My experience would be that in the past ten years or so we have seen that community Garda presence vanish.  That was to the detriment of society and communities.  I see them becoming more visible in communities again and more resources being put into that but my feeling is that we need additional resources put into it.  The benefit to the Garda, communities and young people is great.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; also briefly mentioned education representatives.  I assume we are not only talking about the Department of Education schools but also our ETB schools and Youthreach schemes which have a part to play in responding to antisocial behaviour.  </p> <p>  I have a broad question on antisocial behaviour for the Dublin organisations.  Do we have a particular issue in the city centre?  Is it being policed adequately?</p></speech>

The majority of the young people engagement is done through volunteer-led services, whether that be For&oacute;ige clubs or Big Brother, Big Sister.  We also have volunteers engaged with our very targeted services.  Those volunteers are highly skilled in working with young people, supporting them to build skills and capacity.   Another important thing is building their connections to their community.  That is particularly relevant in what we are discussing today because if you have young people who have a safe place to hang out in their community and they feel connected to the other adults in their community and have a space to experiment, learn, grow and develop and to engage in educational as well as recreational programmes, then they are less likely to go on to be involved in antisocial or criminal behaviour.  We are hugely indebted to our team of volunteers who support youth work across the country and not just in For&oacute;ige.  A huge number of youth work organisations depend on those volunteers.  Throughout the pandemic, so for the last two years, a large army of volunteers has continued to support young people during one of the most difficult times they or we have experienced.  They have engaged in digital services and supports with young people and have been a lifeline for many.  </p> <p>  Recruitment is always a challenge.  We are now about to go back out to the communities.  Some clubs and groups have taken a bit of a pause and some have lost volunteers for various reasons during the pandemic but we are embarking on a national campaign to try to raise awareness of our organisation and the value of volunteering.  We are having a great response so far.  People will see a lot of ads on social media and advertising locally and nationally calling out for volunteers.  It is a really important element of universal youth work in this country which has huge benefits for preventing -----</p></speech>

We are looking for more long-term commitments rather than short-term commitments.  That can be a challenge for people.  We are all busy.  We have families, jobs and other responsibilities.  You are asking people to give up their time.  Within youth work, you are asking people to have a particular interest in young people and to be engaged.  You are looking for people with a specific set of skills and sometimes it can be quite daunting.  Not everyone is comfortable with teenagers.  Some people can feel intimidated and find that quite challenging.  A large number of supports is put in place by organisations such as For&oacute;ige and similar youth work organisations to train volunteers to the highest standard, to ensure safeguarding of young people and to ensure that there are really good and interesting programmes relevant to the needs of young people.</p><p>There are always challenges, but we have a presence in more than 500 communities throughout the country.  There are always people within a community who are willing to engage.  It is about trying to motivate others to come along and engage with the right people at the right time.</p></speech>

Dealing with all these issues is a very hands-on job.  Turning first to the IPRT, I was struck by the data on the Oberstown detention centre campus, where the trust has identified that of the children's experiences in the centre, 31% had experienced a loss of parent, 41% had experienced issues of mental health, 71% had experienced substance misuse, while 57% had a lack of engagement with education.  The interconnectedness of all that is probably the big issue that goes to the core of much of this.  If we were to examine that, we would probably find that many of the reasons people end up misusing drugs and so on relate to chaotic and difficult life circumstances they are in, poverty of ambition and a sense of hopelessness regarding their circumstances and the community in which they live.  All those issues are very much interconnected.</p> <p>  I might direct my next question at our guests from Core Youth Services, given its emphasis on substance misuse.  What connection is there in that regard?  Having spoken to people at the coalface, I know an awful lot of problems result from people who have addiction problems, and there may be mental health problems as well.  They often end up inappropriately in the justice system, including in prison.  That is not a good outcome and it compounds their problems.  How can that be resolved and how can we change that?</p> <p>  The Probation Service does great work and I commend it on that.  How many probation officers are there in the country?  How under-resourced and understaffed is the service?  In my experience, the issue is significant.</p></speech>

We are embedded in a community where there is a history of drug misuse.  Young people now use drugs and alcohol at a much younger age, and to fund their drug habits and fit in, they engage in antisocial behaviour.  There is a great deal of peer pressure on the young people we are currently working with to engage in antisocial behaviour.  There is peer pressure on them to get substances and continue with their habits.  Moreover, they tend to have poor coping mechanisms.  These young people, in some cases, come from dysfunctional families and there may be mental health issues within the families.  They will have learned poor coping methods throughout their lives.  They will have experienced trauma and their way of coping with that is to misuse drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>  I might hand over to Mr. McCarthy, who is our drug and alcohol worker.  He will have more to say on this matter.</p></speech>

In areas such as ours, the illegal drug market needs to be considered as a precursor to young people becoming involved in drugs and drug addiction.  From the day a person is able to walk around here, he or she will be passing by people who are dealing drugs.  It is a very difficult environment to be in and to stay away from getting involved in the drug market.  That is particularly true when people see older people with a flashy lifestyle and a bit of money, with something about them.  The young person may not have anything and may come from poverty, deprivation and addiction in the home.  If there is addiction in the home, it tends to translate into the young people.  That is not always the case but there is definitely a connection.</p> <p>  It takes a long time for young people to see how bad it is going to get when they start using drugs as a young teen.  They do not see it and they cannot hear the warnings.  There are just not enough workers on the ground to support them through those choices.  We work consistently with young people who use drugs but it is a significant challenge when the illegal drug market is all around them.  Unless there is a better approach to how we deal with the illegal drug market in Ireland, little will change.  We have been fighting a war on drugs for years and nothing has changed, so it will continue the way it is.  Investing in our drugs services and in early intervention is vital.</p></speech>

We recently completed a survey of those subject to Probation Service supervision and, regrettably, eight of ten people have a significant substance misuse issue.  The highest rate of substance misuse relates to those aged 25 to 34.  There is a direct relationship between their offending and their substance misuse.  We found that ranged between 48% and 53%.  The first use tended to occur between 12 and 17 years of age, which would support the Oberstown figures.  Two issues are significant in respect of the response.  The peer group relationship is significant in regard to young people's engagement with substance misuse, and the gateway substances we tend to see are alcohol and cannabis.  They are issues we all need to consider.</p> <p>  To return to the question on staffing figures, approximately 240 probation officers work at the Probation Service, along with an additional 40 senior probation officers.  They are all front-line staff and managers working nationwide throughout our estate.</p></speech>

I am struck by the words we use when we talk about antisocial behaviour and its presentation within some communities.  Everywhere experiences some levels or variations of antisocial behaviour but it is highly concentrated in some communities.  Our guests have drawn a direct correlation to poverty, family and safety, but when I think of community safety, I do not think about it only in the context of those who say they are intimidated by others within their communities.  I think also about those young men and women who are seen as antisocial and their safety.  I would love to explore the degree to which people's perception of intimidation plays into the labelling of people as antisocial.  It is relative.</p> <p>  In my community, one woman might be intimidated by 20 lads standing on a corner, whereas I might not be bothered by that at all.  If that behaviour keeps being reported such that the lads hanging around are repeatedly moved on, young people will not have a sense of safety themselves or a sense of space.  If you come from a community where Garda cars crawl around your estate all day, that in itself feels unsafe for young people and they will respond to that negatively, which can create very negative scenarios and relationships, such as those that have been mentioned.</p><p>That in itself feels unsafe for young people.  People respond to that negatively, which sometimes creates the negative situations and relationships we have spoken about.</p><p> Will Mr. McCarthy talk about the importance of youth work, the intervention of youth work and the advocacy for young people who may be seen as antisocial in the development of all the forums we have spoken about?  What do these young people see as safety?  How does Mr. McCarthy, as a youth worker, engage with young people and how can the relationship with the Garda be improved?  We speak to community garda&iacute; but it would be silly to imagine that community garda&iacute; respond to calls.  There is only one community garda in each geographical area.  It is usually other garda&iacute;, not the community garda, who intervene and move people on.  The relationship with the community garda can be as special as we like but the issue is the Garda institution and how it intervenes.</p><p> I ask Mr. McCarthy to speak on the importance of support and addressing some of the class issues that result in antisocial behaviour, which is different from criminality.  We need to make that distinction.</p></speech>

I will tell a short story.  One day at a meeting in the area, a person who I will not name but who wears a professional hat said that a young person was in the middle of a field talking to another young person and the two must have been doing a drug deal.  I know the two young people and neither of them is involved in drug dealing.  Just because two young people were talking, they were assumed to be having a conversation about drug dealing.  That is the perception that some people have.  To get into a class argument, the person in question was from a middle class background and had experience in working in the community but probably did not have experience of living in or coming from that type of community.  That is just one example.</p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned police interaction.  Police are in our area quite often.  At certain times when they get a load of overtime, there are more police in the area than at other times.  For a short period, a couple of things happen.  First, if there is any antisocial behaviour going on, it reduces a little.  However, what happens when garda&iacute; come into the area is that all young people are tarred with the same brush.  As a result, young people who are not involved in antisocial behaviour are also targeted by these garda&iacute; and their interactions with them can be quite negative, although that is not always the case.  From a very young age, the first interaction of young people with the Garda can be terrible.  We have been told countless stories by young people about how they have been mistreated, brutalised, abused, ridiculed and physically attacked by garda&iacute;.  Such behaviour would get me fired from my job but is acceptable when a garda does it.  We find it unacceptable in this youth service.  That is a short description-----</p></speech>

We need to work with people younger than that for various reasons.  By the time we get them into the centre and work with them, much of the behaviour is already entrenched and we end up fighting for the rest of their teen years.  Puberty, in particular from the age of 12 to the age of 15 or 16, is an incredibly difficult time.  It takes years of work to build a relationship with young people.  Good youth work happens when that relationship is ongoing, has been consistent over a period of time and we know the families, the parents and the kids from when they were young.  I do a lot of street work so I get to know the smaller kids quite young because I see them on the street but we are not allowed to actually work with them until they are ten years old.  I find it incredible that that is the case.  To be honest, we do not have enough funding to be able to do that work with these young people, so it is a combination of not being allowed to work with them and not having enough funding to work with all the young people who present.</p></speech>

I will ask the IPRT one question while I have time.  Previous reports indicated that there was a disproportionately high number of young people aged between 18 and 24 in prison.  This suggests that intervention supports at an early stage are either absent or ineffective.  It follows on from what Mr. McCarthy said.  Will either Ms Joyce or Ms McCreery speak to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.341" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Molly Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022022200002#G00800"><p>I can speak to that and I will check whether Ms McCreery wishes to add anything.  We have published a number of reports previously talking about the importance of the 18 to 24 cohort as a specific cohort that needs specific kinds of approaches.  As the Senator said, that is a demonstration that early interventions have not actually worked.  One of our reports, which I identified in my submission, is about the importance of identifying that the right intervention at the right time can make a real difference but the wrong intervention, and this ties in with the point the Senator made about wrong interventions, for example, bringing a young person into the criminal justice system or a young person having a negative interaction with the police, can cause a significant amount of harm.  It can entrench that young person in criminality or in a criminal identity, which can then increase the amount of time the young person ends up within the criminal justice system and make it more difficult for him or her to break out of it.  The way I would describe it is that the stakes are higher when working with young people and that the right intervention can have a really positive impact but the wrong one can have a really negative impact.  I would be happy to share the report with the committee because it goes into more detail about the evidence base for that.  I will check if Ms McCreery has anything to add.</p></speech>

While I am not surprised, it is slightly depressing that many of the problems I saw when I worked in the Children's Court 25 years ago and also in Oberstown are still occurring.  The difference is that St. Patrick's Institution closed in the intervening time.  I have a question for For&oacute;ige.  The timely processing of young people through the justice system was one of its recommendations.  What does it mean by that?</p><p>Diversionary mechanisms and early intervention were mentioned by Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;.  What are the best interventions the Probation Service has come across?  What should be expanded?</p><p>I will touch slightly on what Senator Ruane said about the fear of crime, which is important.  One of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's core messages, which is not emphasised enough, much of the time by politicians, is that its job is to eliminate causes of crime as well as the fear of crime.  What restorative justice programmes has the Probation Service seen that have worked well?  Working in the courts I often found that <i>ad hoc</i>or informal restorative justice worked quite well.  For example, if there was a burglary or an assault, an introduction of the person who was charged to the victim often worked quite well.  It eliminated the fear of the unknown if the person whose house was broken into could meet the person who had broken into it.  They could get some sort of communication going.  Where has the Probation Service seen that working well?</p><p>I thought the IPRT's third recommendation was very good.  It relates to placing a positive statutory obligation on the agencies to co-operate around prisoner release.  Time after time in Kerry, I saw people released from prison who had been suspended from the housing list.  The council's obligation to house them was met by putting them into a hostel with other people who were taking drugs or drinking.  They had no chance of escaping from the reasons that had put them into prison in the first place if they were put back into that environment.  What does the Probation Service suggest in that regard?</p><p>We see long waiting lists for therapies, psychologists, etc.  Ms Hyland of Core Youth Services spoke about services in the community.  What services does she mean and how can they best be resourced and expanded?</p></speech>

By the time that young person faces the consequences of his or her behaviour, his or her circumstances may have changed and he or she may not remember the act or the issues or needs that led to him or her being involved in that particular situation.  That makes it challenging for any youth justice agency that is engaged with the young person to support him or her to change behaviour.  These young people have many risks and needs in their lives.  If time has moved on and things have changed dramatically, it can be difficult to support them to reflect on their behaviours, to understand how and why they engaged in that behaviour and to formulate strategies to deal with them more appropriately in the future.  In the past, we have seen a number of young people brought to court at the age of 18 for offences committed while they were under that age.  That is also very problematic.  For us, a more timely processing of those young people would have a much greater impact in terms of allowing them to address their behaviour appropriately and to change their behaviour.</p><p> Senator Ruane raised the age of intervention for young people.  The new youth justice strategy recognises the need to engage with young people at an earlier stage in order to prevent an escalation of criminal or antisocial behaviour.  GYDPs work with young people from the ages of eight to 11.  There is a huge piece in regard to how professionals in the Garda or the Judiciary deal with young people appropriately.  There is a piece in the new youth justice strategy around building capacity-----</p></speech>

It would strengthen inter-agency co-operation.  Some really good work was done at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic but it has subsided slightly since then.  It was a very concentrated period.  As stated by the Deputy, this recommendation has been around for a long time so a statutory underpinning might help with getting it across the line and embedding it across the system.  It occurs to us that Part 3 of the policing, security and community safety Bill might be an appropriate place for that because it speaks to a whole-of-government approach to community safety.  That upcoming legislation might present an opportunity in that regard, but it will be a matter for the legislators to decide where it fits most appropriately.</p></speech>

The Probation Service has established a region specifically to work with young people who are before the courts.  We fulfil the statutory obligations of the Children Act 2001, which it is important to say is very much in the spirit of diversion of young people at all stages away from the criminal justice system and from conviction and detention.  We work directly with young people using a very individualised approach.  Within that, we also engage with the family.  To respond to one of Senator Ruane's questions, we also engage with siblings and we can signpost to appropriate services if there is a recognition that siblings in a family may be on the trajectory of moving into the criminal justice system.  We would be in support of early interventions.</p> <p>  In terms of fear, that is an issue for young people.  It can be perceived that they are up to something when they are simply passing the time.  Some of the victimisation studies that were released by the CSO indicate that there is a perception that people in what are classified as disadvantaged areas are more at risk and that their safety is compromised by them being residents in those particular communities.  </p></speech>

The first is the Early Learning Initiative run from the National College of Ireland which is involved in prenatal support for young women and detailed parenting support as the child progresses.  It is worthy of closer examination by members.  The second example is City Connects, my understanding of which is that it identifies all individuals attending primary school across a geographic area and does its best to connect the individuals with relevant services.  It is a holistic overview of every individual in primary school.  As I said, these are worthy of some further examination.</p> <p>  My final point is in regard to the point made by Ms Joyce that the local community safety partnerships will put interdepartmental engagement on a statutory footing.  This will put a statutory obligation on other Departments to engage in community safety on a local basis.</p></speech>

We believe that a multidisciplinary approach based in a youth service can only have a positive effect on young people.  It is about creating an infrastructure around the young person in terms of youth workers, family support workers, drugs workers, counsellors, social workers, employability workers and sports workers.  If the young person feels comfortable coming to the safe space that has been created, his or her behaviours in terms of antisocial behaviour can be challenged in a collaborative manner with all of the professionals who are needed to engage with the young person.</p></speech>

When listening to the stats from the IPRT, I was struck by how much they reminded me of research published in 2007 by the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development in regard to young people in the Children Court.  The study looked at 400 children in the Children Court at that stage.  Although the language in it is slightly dated, it is exactly the same story.  I am sure many of the witnesses are familiar with it.  I will refer to some of the bullet points from the study.  Young people who were before the Children Court were predominantly male, living in specific and recurring disadvantaged localities in each of the areas examined and were not in full-time mainstream education.  Some 86% of those for whom education data were available on the District Court files had no engagement with mainstream education.  By far the most common offences were road traffic offences, theft offences and public order offences.  In the case of the public order offences, the circumstances were overwhelmingly linked to alcohol consumption.  As in the case of current experience in courts, young people waited on average six months for their first court appearance.  The approximately 30% who had a court appearance within a month and had their case concluded within six months had made, on average, eight court appearances in respect of each charge.  This is a system that brought young children to the Children Court and kept them there for a period as they were brought before the court again and again.</p><p>It was notable on the files that one of the most common bail conditions applied by the Children Court at the time was not to attend at court 55, the Children Court in Smithfield, because it was apparent that young people were turning up too often, essentially, and were not in education.  It was becoming too routine for them to be there.  It is disturbing to hear that little has changed in that regard.  On the other hand, it is very welcome to hear about the change to the Garda youth diversion programme, GYDP, and its opening up to children as young as eight, which is so important.  </p><p> Having noted all of that, I want to ask about the impact of the pandemic on the operation of the GYDP.  I apologise for arriving slightly late to the meeting and if the witnesses have already addressed this, there is no need to respond.  One of my particular concerns about the GYDP is that when the office decides not to take forward a prosecution and insists on a welfare-based referral with Tusla, there is no oversight of how or even whether that is delivered.  I would like to hear our guests' perspective on that.  It seems to me that there is not much point in the Garda office deciding not to refer a child for prosecution because what that child needs is a welfare-based intervention while not having any certainty that such an intervention, whether it is anger-management, sexual therapy or some other referral that the child needs, actually happens and is effective or successful.  </p><p> If we have time, I would also like to hear their views on the impact of the victim's directive on restorative justice programmes and about the application of an extension of the Joint Agency Response to Crime, JARC, to 18 to 24 year olds.  Ms Joyce might be able to address the latter issue.  I ask her to outline the practicalities of that.  We may have identified young people in that age category who are committing a lot of offences but that is also the time of greatest vulnerability for them.  It is essential that JARC be extended so that they get more supports throughout that period.</p><p> What I am really concerned about, if I am to get any responses today, is the follow-up on welfare-based referrals. </p></speech>

What we have found is that the number of young people going forward to Oberstown is decreasing, which signifies that the Act is effective.  In terms of the conferencing that the Deputy has referenced, there is a number of such opportunities available under the Children Act.  One is family conferencing which the court can order us to convene and then we bring back a particular plan to the court which can be accepted.</p></speech>

We would not necessarily be aware of that level of oversight.  In individual GYD projects, referrals are received from a number of different sources, one of which is the GYDP.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might refer into the projects.  However, if they choose not refer into a project, then the project would not necessarily have a lot of information on those young people because consent would not have been sought to share that information.  That would be outside our level of knowledge in terms of the oversight from a Tusla point of view.</p></speech>

One point I would make though is that the youth justice strategy talks about a pilot approach.  It would be really important to try to progress this as soon as possible and not let it sit for too long.  The reason the youth JARC pilot is so important is that it is about addressing those young people who are engaged in the most serious type of offending.  Feedback we received previously from those working the GYDP is that there is a sense that the most difficult to reach young people are not being picked up by the GYDP in all cases.  Obviously, many people on this call would be able to speak to that in more detail but that is something we have heard.  It is important that the pilot is actioned so that we can target our interventions at those who really need help the most and who are potentially going to cause the most harm if they are not engaged with.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am naive or simply wrong but one of the things that strikes me is that we seem to be having a Dublin postcode discussion.  It seems that antisocial behaviour only happens in certain areas and that those are the areas that come into contact with the Probation Service and the Penal Reform Trust.  If I am wrong, I would be grateful if the witnesses said so, but as I understand it, antisocial behaviour happens in all communities.  It happens in middle class and well-off communities as well and has an impact there too.  Statistics have been quoted here about people who come into contact with the criminal justice system but people in middle class and well-off communities largely do not come into such contact.  How realistic are those figures in that context?  Is it an issue that cuts across all communities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarahjane McCreery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022022200002#J01400"><p>First, I want to come back to a comment made earlier by Senator Ruane on perceptions of crime and community safety.  Someone also commented on moving from antisocial to pro-social behaviour.  That is the real issue and Deputy Pringle is correct in what he says.  In some areas, antisocial behaviour is not considered antisocial; it is considered regular behaviour by young people.  They are hanging around in certain areas mainly because there is nothing else for them to do.  That was particularly true during the pandemic.  It is the case that where there are high concentrations of drug use and drug-related crime and we see young people hanging around on corners, there is a perception that they are, automatically, engaging in antisocial behaviour.  This, coupled with over-policing of these areas because they are hot spots for drug selling, means that young people naturally come in contact with the police.  There is definitely an issue with certain areas being over-policed but under-protected.  We need to move away from over-policing areas and increasing policing resources towards changing the type of policing, which everyone has referenced today.</p> <p>  On the restorative piece, restorative practice does not have to be limited to those engaged in antisocial or criminal behaviour.  It can also be effective before that happens.  Residents who have the perception that young people are engaged in antisocial behaviour might just need to build up a relationship with those young people, have a dialogue with them and discuss what is really going on.  This is where local community safety partnerships can play a vital role, given that 51% of such partnerships are made up of community members, which is brilliant.  How many of them are young people who are just harmlessly hanging around on street corners because they have nothing else to do?  It is about engaging those young people in the process and having that dialogue.  That will automatically reduce the perception of antisocial behaviour and as a result, young people will be less likely to be engaging with the police.  It will have a ripple effect.  It is important to make sure that the voices of young people are included and that the restorative piece happens.  </p></speech>

If I have time, I would like to come back to the impact of the victims' directive on restorative justice, which is a very important piece we all need to be very mindful of.</p> <p>  What tends to happen with antisocial behaviour is reporting and newsworthiness tends to land the story and the experience in the significant urban hubs, namely, Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  That said, if we went to any community throughout the country, we would see they are experiencing antisocial behaviour at different times and in different patterns than might be experienced in the cities.  As a national service we have a network of offices with 40 locations nationwide.  I assure the committee that the District Courts and Probation Service are quite busy across the board in all those locations, which just shows the impact of that behaviour on people.  The issue of fear in rural communities is also quite significant.  It is different from the urban experience but is no less significant for the people who perceive themselves to be under threat or at risk of harm.  We should not undermine their experience.  Antisocial behaviour in different parts of the country may be experienced differently but is there nonetheless.  Certainly, we know anecdotally that weekends, starting on Thursday and going through to Sunday, can have a significant impact across communities.  That is also quite an important point to remember.</p> <p>  I will come back to the impact of the victims' directive on the restorative justice piece, which follows on from the last contributor.  The EU directive on victims and, in particular, the provision of restorative justice has been transposed into Irish legislation.  In that context, the directive very clearly states that it is affording and safeguarding the rights of, and protections for, victims in the criminal justice system.  That is a very important point for all of us whether we are working with younger or older people, with those in communities or with people who feel separated from their community.  The victim experience of the criminal justice system in particular is something we have to be very mindful of.  That legislation brought in two very important things.  One is about consistent, professional practices and engagement with victims throughout the process and their rights to be protected in that regard.  Second, on restorative justice, the EU directive is very clear in stating that where restorative justice provision is available it must be delivered to the highest standard and to best practice and delivered by trained competent staff.  That is a very important point for all of us.  We have to ensure that our interventions are not inadvertently causing extra harm for victims or secondary victimisation elsewhere.  </p></speech>

Senator Ruane asked me a question earlier that I do not think I answered.  It has been talked about a little more during the meeting.  People are drinking in the city centre every weekend.  I am sure there are hundreds of arrests; I do not know the numbers.  There are loads of broken cars and windows and people who get beaten up and end up in hospitals and so on.  It happens every weekend and is never reported but if one incident happens in an area like ours, it is all over the newspapers.  There is a perception of antisocial behaviour in certain areas that get scapegoated for it.</p> <p>  I will mention that 99% of the time, if somebody walked by a group of young people where I work, absolutely nothing will happen.  Young people on the corner are not involved in any antisocial behaviour 99% of the time.  If they were playing sports and people walked by, those people would not be scared.  The point I am making is that young people are hanging around on corners because they have nowhere else to go.  They are either in their gaff on a PlayStation or on the corner with their mates.  They do not have anywhere else to go.  In Dublin city, more and more space is being taken for housing, businesses and hotels.  Every time a little space is taken away, it means less space for young people to have a place to go and the more they will hang around on corners in areas where they become a nuisance to other members of the public.  I would like to talk more about this when I have a little more time, if someone else wants to ask me about it.</p> <p>  One of the things we need to think about when we build cities - I am just talking about Dublin because I work there but it could apply throughout the country - is the need to recognise that we build them for people and not for builders, not for people to profit from and not for hoteliers.  We are building cities for the people who live in them.  In cities and urban areas in particular, and I am only speaking about urban areas because I work in them, there is no space, infrastructure or resources for these young people who are getting condemned and scapegoated across the media and throughout our country.  That needs to be talked about a little more.  That is all I wanted to say about that. </p></speech>

I thank Mr. McCarthy.  He is right that it is about Dublin city but it also concerns every other large town and conurbation in the country.  That point is well made.  I will go to Mr. Guiney.  I am conscious that he has not had a great opportunity so far to contribute and I want him to have his time as well.  We have, in effect, just completed the first round of members.  I am conscious Mr. Guiney has not contributed an awful lot during the meeting.  He is welcome to make his points now if he wishes.</p></speech>

What Senator Ruane had to say about perceptions of safety was absolutely spot on.  In Dublin city centre, we do not have the kind of levels of crime there are in other cities, yet people do not feel safe.  For example, we do not have the levels of knife crime that are in a number of UK cities or the gun crime that occurs in other cities.  We have been very conscious of why it is people do not feel safe.  Why do we have very low perceptions of safety?  One of the things we did during the Better City For All process was to look at people who are very vulnerable.  As Senator Ruane said, young people are not consciously engaging in behaviour they believe to be intimidating.  They are not engaging in criminal behaviour but they are behaving in a way that instils a degree of fear or anxiety in others.  Better City For All was about addressing the needs of people who, for various reasons, find themselves on the street in congregated settings.  In the city at present a lot of very good work is being done by voluntary groups, but it is not integrated into the overall supports and addressing the needs of people be those addiction or mental health issues.  Those services exist and can be better co-ordinated.  There is more to be done in the space of what we were trying to do with Better City For All.  We can achieve a lot in assisting people with their needs and addressing those perceptions of safety held by the wider community.</p> <p>  The engagement between the Garda and communities has been mentioned a few times.  There was a small areas policing initiative a number of years ago, which we found to be incredibly effective.  That was where members of the Garda were assigned a specific location in the city.  The same principles were also applied in the north-east inner city.  People got to know a garda in that community Garda response.  We found that was very effective in addressing many low-lying issues on the ground and engaging with people who were behaving in a way that was instilling anxiety in others.  I would like to see more being done with that kind of community Garda approach.  We found it to be incredibly effective.</p> <p>  More generally, if we can focus on some of those overall solutions, we will get a lot out of the processes.  We do not live in a society that is as dangerous as other locations.  We can certainly match the general levels of safety and well-being if we just make those correct interventions. </p></speech>

I wanted to make a couple of acknowledgements.  I have been following the debate online.  I welcome the massive breadth of experience and expertise before us.  I also welcome the fact that many commentators said this is not an issue for a single agency, body or group to solve.</p><p>Everybody must come together to solve antisocial behaviour.  It is very easy sometimes when we talk about this in the abstract to ignore just how pervasive and damaging antisocial behaviour can be to individuals, obviously, but to communities and societies as well.  I congratulate everybody for the work they do to help us move towards a resolution of this issue.</p><p> I particularly acknowledge the Probation Service, which I have cause to deal with in my day-to-day life.  I do not think it could possibly get enough resources.  I know that things are tight but it does excellent work with the various people who come before the courts and benefit from liaison with its officers around that country.  I particularly want to acknowledge that.</p><p> A number of speakers mentioned restorative justice measures.  I must say that restorative justice has been shown to work really well, not just because it works for the individual who has committed the offence, perhaps, but particularly because it works for the injured party, victim or person who was subjected to whatever criminal activity it was.  We do not put enough focus on it.  It seems to me to have dropped off the radar slightly.  Much of the focus on restorative justice has fallen into the lap of the judge of the day, whoever he or she may be.  Some judges are very proactive in pushing restorative justice solutions.  I know one who is now retired who was very good at always laying that out.  I am conscious that Ms Joyce is here from the IPRT as well.  We shared a discussion on this at an event at University College Dublin recently.  Is there a role, and I do not know whether it is with the Department of Justice or any of the witnesses' agencies, to push that restorative justice agenda with the Judiciary?  What training is available for judges as it stands?</p><p> I know the IPRT particularly champions the notion that custody or prison should be a last resort.  I agree with that, particularly when we are talking about these types of offences.  Although they can do enormous damage, it is also behaviour that can be addressed if we come at it from the right angle.  In the same way that the Children Act 2001 provides an obligation for the Judiciary to consider all solutions other than custody first with regard to this kind of behaviour, I worry that maybe the Judiciary has not got enough training or information with regard to the restorative justice solutions that are available.  Is there a role for some agency to push harder to provide judicial training or equally, provide training to barristers or solicitors who are working in the criminal courts?  Does anyone have a view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-22a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Molly Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022022200002#L00200"><p>I am happy to jump in with a quick observation on that.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  The key agency that comes to mind is, of course, the Judicial Council, which was recently established.  I know there was a report today or yesterday, which I have not had a chance to look through, identifying some concerns about the resourcing available for judicial training.  That will obviously be an issue.  Judicial training will be absolutely key.  That seems to be the most obvious way in which we can potentially address the gap the Senator has identified in respect of actually providing judges with training about the options available and the reasons restorative justice might be more effective than sending someone to prison.</p> <p>  In addition, the sentencing guidelines and information committee is part of the Judicial Council.  It has started some really good work in terms of building research in the area of developing sentencing guidelines.  Again, something that could be explored through that work is whether restorative justice measures could actually be included.  Certainly, we do and will be advocating for the principle of prison as a last resort to be embedded within any sentencing guidelines going forward.  That is probably the key agency but someone else might have some additional input on that.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Ward for the endorsement of the work of the Probation Service.  It is nice to hear.</p> <p>  Building on the response I gave the Senator's colleague earlier regarding victims of crime and the impact it has had on restorative justice here in Ireland, one of the things it has done is open up and broaden the debate on restorative justice.  A debate and conversation that probably would have been in the realm of community sanctions within criminal justice has now actually opened up to a much wider discourse in terms of other stakeholders, including the community.  That is really important.</p> <p>  Much work is going on in the background at the moment in terms of looking at how we might further develop our restorative justice services and interventions.  When I say "we", I am not exclusively talking about the Probation Service.  We are one organisation that would see restorative justice as an integral part of our work but there are other organisations too, such as our colleagues in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, etc., and the direct provision some of the projects provide.  That is also important.</p> <p>  I am not sure if people are familiar with a working group called Restorative Justice: Strategies for Change, RJS4C, which is looking at strategies in relation to the promotion, pushing out and development of restorative justice, and how we might approach things differently in that space.  Again, I think potential developments are coming down the track in that regard.</p> <p>  From a probation perspective, we have developed our restorative justice and victim services unit.  Although it is a small unit in headquarters, it has a key function in providing the leadership and connectivity around best practice in restorative justice interventions, which actually stems out nationwide to all our offices and in turn links in with the Judiciary.  Obviously, different judges have different preferences in terms of options available to them.  Certainly, however, much has been done around education and information sharing and working with the Judiciary around that.  Yet, there is much more to be done.  It is certainly a space that will grow.  There are interventions from the perspectives of the various stakeholders, whether it is the offender, the victim or the community, that yield benefits for all and is cost-effective.</p> <p>  Without getting too much into anecdotes, something came up around people's perceptions of harm, etc.  We had an experience where we held a restorative conference that featured a young man who had stolen a car from an elderly couple.  In the process of the conference, the young man learned that the car was technically that couple's legs for going to their various appointments.  He then began to empathise.  He could see his grandmother in the lady who was there.  Similarly, from the perspective of the couple whose car was stolen, it was really important that they heard that it was random.  People who are victims of crime often worry that they are a target.  They worry that they were deliberately focused on when the reality, while not excusing the behaviour, is that it could have been any car.  They needed to hear that to know there was not some particular vendetta or targeting going on.  Those are just some of the examples or flavours around the restorative justice interventions we can see yielding benefits for all concerned.</p></speech>

When we speak about restorative justice, obviously it is really important to meet the needs of the victims.  For me, however, restorative justice is also about the rehabilitative aspect and recidivism.  We are inclined to focus on the victims in that conversation but if we all have the same agenda, say, for communities, then it is also about that healing aspect of the rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.</p> <p>  Should we have a targeted body or branch of the justice system that looks entirely at restorative justice in order that it is being implemented as a broad concept, principle and policy?  I have worked with young men who have done some of the harshest of crimes, moving beyond antisocial behaviour.  Some of them have expressed their want, I suppose, to engage in a restorative justice practice.  They might mention it to their parole board when they are up for parole.  It will always be a victim's choice whether to do that but having the option is important.  It never seems to go anywhere, however.</p> <p>  Is there also a role for parole boards?  Where do they go with questions like that if somebody in the criminal justice system asks to engage in a restorative justice practice?  What are the steps for somebody to engage in a restorative justice practice?  Are they clear?  How are they followed up on?  How are they engaged in from a practical perspective?</p><p>Anyone who feels that he or she can contribute to that is welcome to.</p></speech>

She is absolutely right.  Opportunities for restorative justice interventions for those who are convicted and imprisoned should be, and are, available.  In my comments thus far, I focused very much on what is available within the context of the community because we are talking about antisocial behaviour and that tends to display in the community.  Certainly, we have experience of and engaged in restorative justice interventions with people who are in prison who have committed offences some time ago and have served a significant part of a prison sentence, and that has involved victim-offender mediation.  That is available and it is being delivered through the Prison Service with ourselves.</p></speech>

I wanted to come in on restorative justice, as it is obviously the topic of the afternoon.</p> <p>  Some of the difficulties with restorative justice might be that there is a long lead-in into it.  It is a voluntary process and those who have survived a criminal event might not want to come in initially.  A lot of work needs to be done to support them to come in to a restorative event.  Equally, a young person might need a lot of work to encourage them to participate.  However, if both parties become involved, it is a win-win situation for both.</p> <p>  I understand the Senator's concern to concentrate on young people who are involved in the perpetration of some of these events but it is kind of a circular process for people that they can come in and go out of.  If the heat is taken out of the scenario for the community, it takes the pressure off the youth, and that is a win-win.</p> <p>  The Senator was wondering about where young people gather in groups.  We are new to the community.  The community safety partnership is up and running eight or nine months; I am there approximately three.  Anybody gathering in groups is a cause for concern for people coming into our office and telling us what is going on.  I refer to anybody who they perceive themselves to be possibly at risk from.  It can be new nations, it can be the Roma community, it can be groups of men who are gathering and, of course, it can be youth.  People who perceive themselves to be in a particularly heated scenario will identify risk wherever they see it, whether that be right or wrong.</p> <p>  Small area policing is ongoing.  We have a map that will identify individual community garda&iacute; across the north inner city so that if a community member wanted to reach out to that community garda, the community member could do that.</p> <p>  We are anxious to support restorative practice.  It can go beyond the restorative event itself.  For instance, intergenerational communities can be supported to come together in a collaborative way so that they learn more about each other and they take some of their concerns about each other out and talk about them and allow that to dissipate and for communities to move on.  The more that we engage in dialogue with different sections of the community, the hope is that the community would move on in a more effective way together.</p></speech>

The data from the IPRT mentions the very high levels of reoffending, particularly among younger people, in Ireland.  I wonder is there any comparative data for people who have engaged in the restorative justice process in respect of that.  I suspect that there would be a much lower rate of reoffending because of the nature of that.  I wonder how much study and work has been done in respect of that.</p> <p>  Mr. Guiney spoke about the fact that we generally live in relatively safe communities and yet we have this perception that they are not safe even when they are.  I have spoken on numerous occasions to people who work in Dublin city centre, perhaps in the night-time economy, who leave a bar after a shift late at night and have to make their way home.  There may not be a taxi close by.  They feel fearful trying to get to a place where they can find a taxi.  There is a sense, while I absolutely respect that we know it is relatively safe compared to many other cities in the world, that if people have a perception of not being safe they are not safe in themselves.  We have to respect that.  One of the big issues that comes up in this regard is that they do not see local garda&iacute; in the area.  They do not see the patrol car.  They do not feel that they are protected in that way.  The small area policing is part of that but, particularly in that late-hour scenario and after dark, in the public transport services, DART stations, Luas stations and such places, there are similar issues where people feel unsafe.  We can say sometimes it is unwarranted but, at the same time, there are incidents that people will point to which will give them clear verification of the reason they feel unsafe.  We cannot be blind to that.  We need to make sure that we have adequate policing in place so that people have that sense of security as they move around, particularly late at night or in the evening.</p></speech>

In our submission, we cited the 62% of people released from prison in 2015 reoffending within three years.  The comparative figure for people for that period who had engaged with probation was 49%.  Therefore, it was lower.  Unfortunately, I do not have a breakdown of exactly what engagement that was with probation services.  It may be something that the Probation Service can pick up.  It certainly is something that I can look into further and come back to the Deputy on.  It is important to see whether we can show the impact of restorative justice.  It is something we would be interested in exploring further.</p></speech>

We are trying to encourage people to spend their time in Dublin city centre and if they do not feel safe, that is a significant issue for us.</p> <p>  We can look at things such as the crime prevention through environmental design, CPTED, principles, that I mention earlier, which is basically how we lay out our city and use more innovative ways of instilling a degree of comfort in people.  That has been used effectively in other cities.  They are something well worth investing in.</p> <p>  Operation Citizen was addressing some of the issues in terms of the Garda presence on the street but we can always do with more garda&iacute;, particularly at night.  What we saw before the pandemic was an increase in the evening and night-time economy, and perhaps a decrease in the daytime economy.  In all our emergency services and all the services we provide, including the transport the Deputy mentioned, we need to look at providing more at night.  That is the where, internationally, the trend was going before the pandemic and we assume it will kick off again as the pandemic recedes.  It is an important part of the overall economy that we address the needs of people, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, not only who are patrons of venues at night but who work in those venues.  They deserve services such as night transport and they deserve to feel safe when they come out of their place of work.</p></speech>
