    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#A00200"><p>Good morning.  I would like to welcome everyone to this public meeting of the Joint Committee on Autism.  We have received apologies from Senator Garvey.  Before we start business today, I would like to read some formal notices and the Covid-19 code of conduct.  The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community in May 2022.  Members, staff and visitors are requested to continue to be vigilant and follow public health advice on preventing the spread of Covid-19 infection so that we can continue to manage risk for ourselves and for others who are more vulnerable, including colleagues and their family members who may be elderly or have underlying health conditions or both.  All members of the parliamentary community and visitors are strongly encouraged to wear face masks, not a visor, in busy or crowded locations in the Leinster House complex.</p><p>Medical grade masks should be worn wherever recommended by public health advice, and for ten days after a diagnosis of Covid-19.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation on this matter.</p><p> On privilege, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p><p> For the information of the witnesses, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> The first item on the agenda is the minutes from our previous meeting, the private meeting held on 14 July 2022.  These minutes were already approved at a virtual private meeting but I ask for their approval in public session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> On behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the parents' groups who are with us today.  We are joined by Ms Ger Kenny, Ms Ciara Jones and Ms Caroline Poole from the Autism Support Hub based in Luttrelstown in Dublin; Ms Margaret Lowndes from the Dublin 12 Campaign for Autism Inclusion; Ms Karen O'Mahony, CEO of the Rainbow Club in Cork; and Ms Sarah Murphy, Ms Miriam Jennings and Ms Elaine Jenkins from the special needs schools and classes.  We are very grateful to our witnesses for taking time out of their schedules to contribute to the public session of the joint committee on autism.  We are particularly grateful as it can be particularly challenging to make arrangements, especially during school time.</p><p> The committee is pleased to hear directly from parents today as they have first-hand lived experience of the challenges associated with accessing assessments, school facilities and, indeed, services for their children.  It is imperative to the work of this committee that we hear from families of autistic persons and to ensure their views inform our committee's final report.  Before we hear from our witnesses, I propose that we publish their opening statements on the committee's website.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p> We will now hear opening statements from our witnesses and we will then have questions and answers with members. I propose that each organisation represented here has five minutes to make its opening statement.  Each member will have five minutes for questions and answers.  We will call members in accordance with the list we circulated.  If there is time afterwards, members may ask additional questions.  As this session is scheduled to last a full three hours rather than a split session of one and a half hours each, I suggest we take a five-minute sos, roughly one and a half hours into the session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> First, we will hear from Ms Ciara Jones from the Autism Support Hub.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara Jones" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#B00200"><p>We would like to thank the Chair, Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to speak to them today.   Ms Kenny, Ms Poole and I are from the Autism Support Hub, based in Dublin 15.  In the first instance, we are here today as parents of autistic children, and second as advocates trying to make a difference to help and support families.  It is important to say that while today is a great privilege, we, as parents, should not have to be here, but the sad reality is circumstances necessitate this due to the blatant failures of the State to provide basic supports for our children.  We, as individuals, have to constantly fight, fight, fight for the basic supports for our children to allow them to prosper and grow to reach their full potential.  This should not require a battle.</p> <p>  Back in 2020 I decided to set up the Autism Support Hub, and with the support of three other mothers, two of whom are with me today, we set out on a journey that has been a privileged one, a journey into the private lives of many families we meet each week.  The original purpose of the hub was to help and support parents of recently diagnosed autistic children, but it soon became apparent the remit of the hub was far greater than this.</p> <p>  At its essence, when setting up the hub, I did not want parents of recently diagnosed children to experience the same sense of loss, worry and helplessness that I experienced when my son, Gavin, was diagnosed just over ten years ago.  I am sad to say that ten years later families are still experiencing the same sense of loss upon receiving their child&rsquo;s diagnosis, and this is not right.  Families need to be better supported from the get-go.</p> <p>  We open our doors to meet parents in a private capacity and safe space where we share our own knowledge and experience.  Through this engagement with parents, we offer them support and information they need to navigate their own personal journey.  We stay with them on this journey until they feel empowered to go it on their own.  Each week since the opening of the hub, we have met families in crisis who are battling the unfair system we find ourselves in when it comes to accessing services and supports.  These services are seen as a luxury, but they are the difference between our children thriving and barely surviving.  This is the reality for many of us.</p> <p>  We see so many families struggling around school places.  Either they have none or the one they have is unsuccessful due to the lack of training of teachers and, therefore, there is no understanding of the child&rsquo;s needs within the school setting.  As we know our children having the appropriate school setting is of the highest importance.  We need principals, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to have mandatory and continuous training for our children to have a positive school experience and not have parents worried sick for the day when their children are gone and often suffer the backlash when their children are home - for example, around masking.  Where parents express difficulty with their school, we suggest Ms Kenny contact the principal to offer free Tusla accredited autism training under autism clubs and education umbrella, ACE, also founded and supported by Ms Kenny for teachers and SNAs.</p> <p>  The Autism Support Hub at its essence provides moral support to the parents who walk through our doors.  Sometimes this is a chat, a hug or  simply saying "we understand", but we also offer practical support.  Week in, week out we support families with the many burdensome forms that exist when trying to access support, be they educational or financial, from home tuition, domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and carer's allowance to mention but a few.  Parents come back on many occasions for the continued moral support and, unfortunately, for the support in appealing the many DCA applications refusals.  Reform of how these forms are assessed will go a long way in supporting families.</p> <p>  We also offer families the opportunity to attend professional talks through the Parent Led Autism Network, PLAN, again set up voluntarily by Ms Kenny.  She has rolled out PLAN in other parts of Dublin where they are a much needed support for families.  PLAN offers free talks by professionals on a wide variety of autism topics.  These talks are booked out month on month and again have proved an incredible support for parents trying to cope.</p> <p>  In Dublin 15, we have Little Seeds autism arch club, which offers a social outlet to more than 70 autistic children.  Only last week Ms Kenny opened Little Seeds autism support therapy services to these 70 families.  As we know, such therapies should be offered by the HSE and disability services but are not.  She went about not only finding the therapists but setting up the service.  The reason for these therapy services existing within this group is due to the hard work of local fundraising.</p> <p>  We also rely heavily on the support of AsIAm, as some situations require more professional support and advocacy which is beyond our expertise and knowledge.  We direct these families to the community support team in AsIAm through their autism information line.</p> <p>  We would like to thank members for listening to us today and we hope going forward they agree that what we are doing in Dublin 15 can be mirrored on a national level with the support of the members and Government bodies.</p></speech>

We will now hear from Ms Margaret Lowndes from Dublin 12 Campaign 4 Autism Inclusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Lowndes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#C00100"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the Dublin 12 parents autism support group and the D12 Campaign 4 Autism Inclusion to present to the Joint Committee on Autism today.  I am a parent of two children with additional needs and the chairperson of the support group and campaign.  I acknowledge the input of our vice chairperson, Helen Holmes, who worked with me on today's submission but is unable to attend.</p> <p>  Our organisation was set up in 2018 due to the frustration of parents regarding the lack of education provision, support services and therapies for children in our area.  We advocate for equal opportunities in education and improved disability services and to promote acceptance for our children with additional needs in our community and beyond.  The work of our campaign over the past four years has resulted in the opening of a brand new autism special school in Crumlin in 2021.  Thirty-six children were enrolled initially and that has now increased to 48.  In addition, according to the website of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, the service provision in the Dublin 12 community has increased from seven primary autism classes and one early intervention class in 2018 to 16 primary autism classes and three early intervention classes now.  It is also worth noting that, at secondary level, there are currently only six autism classes.</p> <p>  We achieved this by presenting our autism inclusion proposal for Dublin 12 to show there were not enough suitable placements within the community for our children and that children as young as four years of age were continuing to be placed on home tuition or bussed out of the area.  Continued pressure and meetings with the Department of Education, the NCSE, Ministers and our Deputies and Senators followed, as well as the arranging of local protests.</p> <p>  While we are happy with the progress to date, there is more work to be done to ensure all schools in the locality have an autism class to ensure inclusivity for all.  There are only three primary schools and three secondary schools across Dublin 12 with no autism classes and no immediate plans to open one.  We continue to liaise with these schools and the NCSE and Ministers on how they can be assisted.</p> <p>  In addition to this, we advocate for children with additional needs who attend a mainstream setting to receive the extra support and the correct resources needed to assist them and to support teachers in their roles, be it full training in autism or training in other comorbid conditions.  The NCSE provides training but places are extremely limited.  Teachers need training when in college so they have more time to understand the different abilities of the wonderful children they will meet in their classroom.  In January 2021, the first national training programme for special needs assistants, SNAs, was introduced by UCD.  This is a positive step forward but the course needs to be accredited as the SNAs need to be able to work and look after our children every day.  We look forward to the course being rolled out further.</p> <p>  At present, special schools throughout the country have no therapists.  The new special school opened in Dublin 12 was given the school inclusion model, SIM.  The SIM is not fit for purpose.  It does not allow therapists to work directly with children but instead gives teachers advice on how to handle situations.  This model is not suitable for a special school, or any school.  Our vision is for all schools in Dublin 12 to have at least one autism class and for children to receive suitable educational placements.  We want schools to be able to liaise with each other while building their autism school communities and to have support from the Department of Education and the NCSE to do this.</p> <p>  Our autism support group for parents was also launched four years ago in response to a massive need for families to have a place to go in the area where they could meet other families dealing with similar issues.  We pride ourselves on our three core pillars of inclusion, support and advocacy.  We provide monthly support groups for parents and a safe space to come and chat or just listen.  Our community has grown, and it is great to see parents now connecting with each other.  We have been organising activities for children with additional needs for more than 40 families in our community since 2018.  We have run family Lego clubs, sports clubs, sensory play activities and trips to jump zones and farms.  We have held Christmas parties and arranged socially distanced visits from Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny during the Covid pandemic restrictions.  In partnership with Dublin City Council, we were asked to hold an autism awareness morning and a celebration party for World Autism Day in April to promote awareness and acceptance in our community.</p> <p>  A common theme among our families is that their children have very limited opportunity for social interaction, so we reached out to sports and swimming clubs.  We liaised with the local library and now we have an amazing cubby that children can use.  Many of our local sports clubs offer neurodiverse children an opportunity to take part in football, GAA, boxing and swimming.  These sessions are specifically tailored to meet the needs of our children while also providing them with a safe place to enjoy sports like their peers.  To promote advocacy for parents, we invite a number of key speakers to talk to us to ensure we understand our own rights and those of our children in areas such as education and disability services.  Parents want to be empowered when it comes to their own children, and there is no better advocate for a child in their early years than their own parent.</p> <p>  The roll-out of the progressing disability services model, which has been delayed, is fantastic on paper but in reality it is a different story.</p> <p>  We spoke previously at a joint committee in May 2022 on the main issues, including communication, inconsistencies across the teams, waiting lists, recruitment and grants for families to access therapies.  We also met the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to discuss these issues and, most important, to make recommendations for the improvement of services.  Families are waiting too long for interventions for their child, and big social media announcements in advance of any real action give false hope to parents.  A child who is referred to the disability teams will not be seen by a member of the team for up to two years.  That is two years of families being left in limbo with no support.  Families seek out our local support group as they want reassurance, understanding and to be supported.  As parents we need a clear pathway to services with the HSE.  A letter saying your child will be seen in two years and no other communication during that time is simply not good enough.  A key area affecting families right now is the cost of living.  Private therapies are in increased demand due to the failure of the HSE.  This time last year a 45-minute session with a private occupational therapist cost &euro;100.  Now it costs &euro;120.</p> <p>  If the committee takes only one thing away from this meeting, it is that it really listens to the parents and caregivers on the ground supporting their children and young adults.  We are the people who can tell the committee the reality of dealing with the health service and accessing education.  Too much time is spent discussing the same issues year after year with absolutely no change.  While the system fails the people it is trusted to help, local support groups are left to support families through these challenging times.  Families support families.  Support groups need to be recognised for the voluntary work they do.  These are parents who come together and help their communities.</p> <p>  When parents start their journey, it can be very lonely, but in Dublin 12 they now know there is a group to support them and that makes a huge difference.  It gives them peace of mind in a space where they can build friendships for themselves and their children.  As the saying goes there is strength in community.  Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#C00300"><p>I am a mum to four children.  Two of my sons, Sean and Stephen, are autistic.  I am also a co-founder of the Rainbow Club Cork Centre for Autism.  I am grateful for this opportunity to come before the committee today and discuss the many issues we see in our lives and the lives of the 1,028 families who attend our service weekly.  For years, families like ours have been treated badly by heavily funded State agencies, left behind without support, put into situations they do not deserve, and our teens, children and young adults discriminated against and neglected in so many ways.  This story is not uncommon.  I am sure the committee members have all heard these stories, but the reality is this is our life every day.  My sons have been let down by the State and the education system that did not cater for their needs, breaking the trust of Sean and Stephen and leaving them with trauma and emotional fallout that was often aggressive and which our family had to endure.  The current provision of child and adolescent mental health services needs to be examined, and there are many teens like my son Sean on medication that is not being monitored appropriately.</p> <p>  A black hole we ended up in with no one to get us out led Jon and I to campaign and set up the Rainbow Club so that children and families could receive support in an holistic, caring and loving manner which they deserve and in which will thrive.  We provide 21 activities and interventions six days a week.  We cater for children from two years old up to adults of 23.  We provide a place that can help them to cope daily, build friendships, reduce anxiety around sensory issues, regulate themselves, accept themselves for who they are and what they need, and encourage them on their pathway, being by their side along that journey.  We provide sibling support, parent training, counselling and support groups.  We advocate in schools for families.  We support families with housing difficulties or difficulties with forms and service provision, or who are experiencing hardship and homelessness.  Our sports department has many programmes, all of which target the difficulties that stop and exclude children and teens from participating in mainstream sports daily by building a model that will allow them to learn, with no expectation or stress in an activity that is supposed to enhance positive mental health and well-being.  Computer and games programmes is the future for many, and is the skill the children need to know about and learn.  The groups are all set up for every child so he or she can be part of a group enjoying activities, growing in confidence and equipping them with what that child needs for his or her adult life.</p> <p>  We are proud of what we have built.  Shame on this State for not supporting us with the funding we so desperately need to expand and provide more services to families in Cork city and county.  Families are so desperate that they travel to us from Limerick, Kilkenny, Waterford and now Killarney, all because there is nothing there for them.  We will replicate.  We will get our forever home because I will not stop until Rainbow Club is national so no one is left behind.  I will never give up fighting until this country sees the child and family at the centre.  Rainbow Club is a universal model for autism which is now seven years old, thriving in a little corner in Mahon, Cork, and filled with laughter, healing and progress every day.  It is a community model that has the family at the heart of it with a strategy that is actually achieving its goals.  Our organisation, including our caf&eacute;, offers an inclusive environment for all and provides jobs for local people and autistic adults.  Our caf&eacute; is a training caf&eacute; that welcomes students from the National Learning Network, NLN, L'Arche, Aspect, schools and colleges.  It is where Se&aacute;n, the Autistic Baker, found his love for baking.  It is a haven for all, buzzing with chatter and modelling acceptance every day.</p><p> Rainbow Club is a beacon of hope.  It shows the way services should be provided, the impact this model has on families' quality of life and the impact of the wrap-around support to the autistic person to thrive and live a fulfilling, positive life, allowing him or her to participate and give back.  Autistic people have the right to be included, accepted and supported in their life but this is not the case.  They are made to feel more excluded and rejected every day in the society we have created, and that needs to change.</p><p> The committee has the opportunity to listen to all sides.  Autistic persons, advocacy groups, community groups and parents should all be part of the discussions and debates for this new policy, ensuring every voice is heard.  &ldquo;People first&rdquo; should always be our goal.  Trying to put supports in place is not acceptable anymore; action is now needed.</p><p> Alternative education is another programme we want to provide in education, with a sensory diet for the child and teen who cannot cope, and if the correct supports are in place, it can provide a wrap-around for the individual and a transition back to school, all catering for the needs of the person in a caring nature.  Summer provision is also a must.  Without appropriate respite, these families need support and consistency throughout the year.  We also supply that, again without State funding.  Too many schools refuse to do it or to carry it out effectively.  Too many children go without help, routine or structure during the summer months and the fallout for them and their families is a high price to pay.</p><p> I ask the committee members for three things, namely, a plan and policy that will provide what autistic people and their families need, support for the Rainbow Club model and the impact it has and can have for families in Ireland if replicated, and a thought for children such as my sons, Sean and Stephen, when they make decisions, implement change and continue their oversight of the policy that will impact on their future.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Miriam Jennings" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the opportunity to address them.  We are a parents' group whose children attend special schools and classes countrywide.  The vast majority of our children have complex needs and life-altering disabilities.  Their needs are severe, multiple and present from the cradle to the grave.</p> <p>  The July provision school programme came about following a High Court judgment in 1993 that recognised that children with severe needs lose skills over the long school holidays that may never be recovered.  It was replaced by the expanded summer programme in 2020, which saw an increase in eligibility from 15,000 children in 2019 to 80,000 children in 2021.  We believe, however, that our children's need for a school-based summer programme was not safeguarded.  No plan was put in place to ensure that complex-needs children, for whom the scheme was set up, would access it.  Department of Education figures from 2021 show that 80% of children in special schools had no access to the programme, while less than 5% of the 8,000 children in special schools got the full recommended four weeks.</p> <p>  The home-based programme promoted by the Department is not an appropriate alternative.  The National Council for Special Education has stated this is the least effective way to deliver the programme, given many children with autism and intellectual disabilities cannot cope and will not tolerate strangers in their home environment.  A home-based programme cannot be mooted as an alternative to the school-based programme to facilitate children for whom it is not suitable.</p> <p>  The school day provides more to our children than a curriculum.  It provides routine, stability and an opportunity to be a part of a world outside of their home.  Our children have access to school facilities such as sensory and occupational therapy rooms and secure play areas.  The impact of the long school break during the summer is significant and frightening.  Our children's essential routine stops abruptly and they cannot understand why.  They cannot communicate their multiple worries and uncertainties given so many are non-verbal.  They regress rapidly.</p> <p>  We have submitted real-life stories from ten our families, as the committee will have seen.  The pressure on the child, parents, siblings and extended family is immense.  There are no summer camps, playdates or family holidays during the nine or 13 weeks away from school.  The long break causes an increase in the number of episodes of sensory overload, a regression in skills and a greater incidence of anxiety, self-injurious behaviours, aggression towards parents and siblings, destructive outbursts and absconding.  When a child is regressing and losing the ability to cope, this puts a strain on families trying to support him or her.  Family relationships come under immense pressure.  Siblings end up assisting with care and are left with no summer holidays themselves while parents try to hold the family unit together under incredible levels of stress and in a constant state of hyper-vigilance.</p> <p>  We ask, for the sake of our children and their families, that the committee fight for complex-needs children to be fully included in the school-based summer programme.  We ask that a tiered approach to the provision of the programme be established based on absolute need.  We voiced our concerns to our schools, local representatives and the Department of Education, along with the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, earlier this year, yet we still watched from a lonely distance as families prepared for a summer break, anxiously wondering what would happen to our children over the summer.  Many families learned only in June that their school would not provide the programme, while many parents scrambled to ask their employer for unpaid leave, just to cope.</p> <p>  We have been proactive in our advocacy for our children and have worked hard to propose solutions.  We have contacted the departments of education in all 36 jurisdictions in Europe.  We have identified, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, a highly effective special school summer model in Malta.  The Maltese utilise a combination of school staff and external multidisciplinary professionals, students and trainees, such as nurses, doctors, speech therapists and respite workers, to work with the children over eight weeks of their school holidays.  A fresh approach benefits not only the children but also the professionals, who gain valuable experience.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has received information from interviews with three Irish special school principals running very successful school-based programmes.  These principals often employ external professional staff and trainees and they start planning in January.  We need the Minister of State and the Department of Education to design a fresh approach and to commence work on it urgently.  We need collaboration between Departments to ensure our complex-needs children will get access to our next summer programme.  They cannot afford to lose another year.</p></speech>

Will she please explain why it is not being supervised?  How often should he be seen in regard to his medication?  When has that happened and not happened?

I commend them on all the work they are doing to support their autistic children and autistic adults in their community.  I have a question on financial supports which some witnesses mentioned.  Does this all come through fundraising or do they get any Government support whatsoever?  Are any grants available?  I know they indicated that the HSE has not been forthcoming.</p> <p>  Some of the witnesses also mentioned that they had managed to engage therapists to offer interventions.  We have heard from the HSE that it cannot find them in the community.  How come they seem to be available?  Is it just that they are not willing to work for the HSE because of various conditions?  What is the witnesses' understanding of it?  </p> <p>  I congratulate Ms Lowndes on the number of schools which have been opened in her locality and the pressure she applied to bring that about.  When a special school or an autism class is opened are the staff who are put in adequately trained?  We frequently say that we need more autism classes and need them in every school and in every community so that children do not have to travel miles to get to a suitable school.  While that is correct, they are often opened without the proper planning and the proper resources being put in.  Is that a major issue?  </p> <p>  Because of the lack of assessment of children, they do not get the school place they deserve to get.  As it could be years before they are properly assessed, does that delay mean they are not being put in the proper placement which does damage to them?</p> <p>  A number of witnesses spoke about proposals on the summer provision.  I could not agree more.  This is something that needs to be planned now for next year.  We need to start the planning process now and put it in place from January onwards.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Jennings for the examples she provided from principals and people working in various services.  They give an insight into what is required.  Many schools are not given approval until May which is far too late.  They may be using it as an excuse not to proceed with the summer provision.  However, it is a problem that they are not told what funding is available until May or June which is too late.  This process needs to start much earlier.  It needs to ensure that the children with more complex needs are catered for first and not left on their own at home maybe with unsuitable home-based tuition if they are lucky enough to get a tutor.</p></speech>

She might take that first and then we might deal with funding for special schools.</p></speech>

It is not just about getting that building open; it is everything else that goes with it.  When we campaigned, we wanted trained teachers, SNAs and therapists on site.  We asked for that.  Teachers are not given sufficient training.  Teacher training is the bare minimum when it comes to children with special educational needs.  When they go looking for NCSE courses, there are very limited places.  We recently discovered that when the first autism class is opened, the school gets some NCSE training programmes.  However, there is no training for the second, third and fourth.  The trained teacher has to train the other staff which makes no sense to us.  Training should be mandatory.  About two years ago the North of Ireland was looking to introduce mandatory training for teachers.  I am not 100% sure if it has gone through; I do not think it has.  Mandatory training should be brought in down here.  It is up to teachers as to which side they go, but they need to learn the whole aspect of education.</p> <p>  It is the same with the NCSE which does not seem to think this is urgent.  It is a case of open an autism class, give the go-ahead and the teacher is trained two days before they go in or in some cases there is no training until the children are in there.</p><p>We have an autism class at the moment that was due to open on 31 August and did not open.  It will not open until the first week of October.  There are actually children sitting at home, and that teacher is currently training.  If she was just trained up and there was continuing professional development, CPD, we feel that would be a better way around it.  Teacher training needs to be mandatory.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, and the teacher training colleges need to sit down and discuss having a proper programme in place.</p></speech>

We were lucky that we secured a small amount of funding last year from the HSE for one part of what is a very big entity at Rainbow Club.  We have been six years trying to secure even that.  We are continuing to fundraise and do everything we can to keep our doors open, but we are not fitting into boxes.  The Rainbow Club is such a unique model, we come under different Departments.  We have loads of different elements.  We have summer provision that we roll out ourselves in Rainbow Club and we are looking at an alternative education piece there.  We are constantly told that we do not fit into funding streams, so that is what we need to be able to fall on.  There needs to be more collaboration around the funding pools.  We have done what we have in seven years on our own.  We have not had help.  If we had funding, we could do so much more.</p></speech>

This year, in Dublin 15, there were, I think, 15 children who had come through primary school and there was no secondary school place for them, so some of the schools in Dublin 15 were asked to open an autism class.</p> <p>  Two years ago, I set up ACE, which is Autism Clubs and Education, so I receive funding from Tusla.  I source speakers to provide free training workshops to teachers, SNAs and professionals.  I will be starting a workshop in October and I will be notifying the schools.  We also have a Facebook page.  That workshop will go back to the beginning on topics such as what is autism; understanding autism; setting up an autism class; and dealing with anxiety.  I would love for it to be compulsory for schools.  I do not think that they should have a choice in whether they take the training or not.  It should be compulsory, whether they come to ACE and do it through me or they do it through the Middletown Centre for Autism or other organisations that offer workshops.  No teacher or SNA should be in a class teaching a child with autism who has never had that experience before. </p> <p>  On another matter, I also have the Parent-Led Autism Network, PLAN, which provides free parent information talks.  It is funded by Tusla.  They have been going on for the past four years.  There are free training workshops to help parents who are struggling with their children.  We have both Zoom and in-person information talks.  All topics are autism-related.  It went nationwide, particularly during Covid-19.  A lot more families, with the pressure of homeschooling their child, were reaching out and looking for help.  </p> <p>  PLAN has been replicated in Dublin 5, 13 and 17 for the past two years.  They have a big launch night coming up in October.  PLAN in Balbriggan is very successful as well.  For me, the dream would be to have PLAN rolled out nationwide.  I would love to see every county in Ireland having one - PLAN Galway, PLAN Limerick, PLAN Kilkenny, and so on.  Even if they had the budget for one speaker per month and a Zoom licence, they could reach out to so many more families while they are on waiting lists.  Tusla recognises that this is a bit of a stopgap.  This is help that people can get through Zoom for some of the talks or meet with other parents and have contact with them.  That is a little of what I have been able to set up myself in the last few years and it has been a big success.</p></speech>

We are really in the middle of a perfect storm at the moment, because we have a combination of no staff training and no therapists.  When my son was diagnosed eight years ago, we had some access to speech and occupational therapy.  There was a plan at that stage.  When he started school, the teachers had somebody to refer to around his sensory needs.  He had a sensory programme.  Now, there is nobody in our Children's Disability Network teams, CDNTs, to see those children.  They do not know them in school, they do not know them starting school, they do not know them as they grow up, and the teachers are not trained to understand the absolute depths of the behaviour, of how to teach these children to communicate or how to manage their sensory needs.  It is not really about education or health.  The two matters are absolutely knotted together, for life, but we are in a very bad place at the moment when the teachers do not understand the behaviours that are arriving into these many autism classes.</p></speech>

That is my experience.  It is very hard to teach in an autism class if you have no training.  It is very stressful on the teacher.  The schools are kind of making it up as they go along.  I am sure not all schools are, but that is my experience.  It is the most inexperienced teacher or the teacher just out of college who gets the autism class.</p></speech>

I have met a number of the witnesses in the flesh over the past few years and a few on Zoom as well.  It is nice to put the face to the name.  We only have five minutes, which is very short.  I would prefer to hear from the witnesses.  I have two specific questions and then perhaps I could come in at the end again.  One relates special school classes.  The summer provision programme does not work.  It is great for me as a Government TD to be able to say to people "you have more funding than ever before" but, on the ground, obviously, that is not translating.  People are not taking up the scheme for one reason or another.  There are difficulties there.  I think Mrs. Jennings hit the nail on the head that the people that that course was originally designed for are not benefiting from it.  They need the most help and attention, specifically during those months where there is no school.  I would like to ask the witnesses about the staffing of that course.  I sat in a staff room for 15 years professionally and I cannot recall, and I may be wrong, a principal or teacher coming in saying "anybody up for doing summer provision this year?"  I genuinely cannot.  Is it a case that we need to look at a regional model where schools would band together or is it a case that we are going to compel schools to do it?  If we continue to use a discretionary element and allow schools to make the decision, we might end up on the same road we did with the ASD classes, which is part of the mess we are in today.  I would be interested if the witnesses could give me a two-minute answer on that.</p> <p>  Ms. O'Mahony is up from Cork, like me, so I may have to go to her for my other two minutes.  I know the work Ms O'Mahony does, I know the confines of the space that she is in.  It is not practical.  She is making the best of what she can, but when I hear that there are 1,028 families coming through her doors every week, bearing in mind the setting she is in, I ask myself how they manage it.  Could she give us a picture of how she manages it day to day and what a new site would do for her?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elaine Jenkins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#F01300"><p>What we are proposing is to step somewhat outside of education, particularly for the children with more complex needs.  As Mrs. Jennings mentioned earlier regarding the Department of Education freedom of information figures for 2021, only 410 children in special schools had the school-based programme.  A bigger figure is that 80% of them had none.</p><p>We spoke to the parents in our group earlier this year and as of June the attendance numbers look to be down somewhat, even on 2021.  We can sit here and complain or we can do something about it.  What we do as a group is to try to find solutions that we can bring forward.  As Ms Jennings mentioned, one angle we took was to find out what the other jurisdictions in Europe are doing.  We contacted each of them and many replied.  The one we had most interaction with was the Maltese department of education.  We met them three times.  They were extremely helpful.  They talked us through what they do in summer.  They have a similar system to us in that they have special schools.  They are now copying our model for special classes and rolling that out but they also have a lot of autistic children in mainstream education.  They offer a programme which is available to every child, every year, for the full summer break.  They offer the work initially to educators early in the year who decide whether they will do it.  If not, then it is offered to others, for example, speech therapists, OTs, doctors, nurses, trainee police etc.  We believe everybody who will be working with our children as adults should know them as children and they benefit as much from that as our children do.  </p><p> The Maltese programme is an eight week long summer programme.  They cover the curriculum in their winter school.  Summer is basically camp-based in school with school transport.  Some of the school staff participate but not all.  The difference between our programme and theirs is that theirs is equitable.  Every child gets the opportunity to attend.  In our case, some schools offer a severe to profound class, but not an autism class.  Sometimes 10% of a school can attend and there is a lottery.  The Maltese programme is reliable.  It is run for eight weeks every year so parents can plan the summer.  They do not have to take unpaid leave.  Siblings can have a life during the summer.  Finally, it is flexible.  Not every child will be able to attend for the full summer so parents can choose which weeks the child attends.  </p><p> We are asking for a Maltese-type programme to be introduced from 2023 onwards and, as Ms Jennings said, we need a tiered approach.  That is what we are hoping for.</p></speech>

It is State funded.  A sum of &euro;40 million was allocated to the summer provision programme last year but only 410 children received the full four weeks of school provision out of &euro;40 million, which is what is required for children who have complex needs.  Complex needs can mean autism, intellectual disability, including a moderate intellectual disability with medical needs, for example epilepsy or other comorbid mental health issues.  It also includes other syndromes like Down's syndrome, which my son has.  He has a combination of all of those.  Autism and disability are wide spectrums and the children who have missed the summer programme are those complex needs children.  The summer programme was set up for these children.  Only 410 children were provided with the full four weeks which was recommended by that High Court judgment nearly 20 years ago now.  Here we are.  Loads of money is being thrown at it; t is a State funded system but it is not State controlled.  Every school can decide and they use the excuse that they did not find out until May or June.  The Department does need to get the guidelines out a bit quicker every year, but the programme has been in place for nearly 20 years.  It is not a surprise and the special schools in particular do not offer the programme.  Some 80% of children in special schools had no access to the programme in 2021.</p></speech>

Today we are share a community centre with 32 other groups.  The community centre has been amazing.  It has given us the car park.  We have eight modular buildings that cater for social groups, computer training, siblings activities, therapies, etc.  We have also brought a sports hall on site and established a horticulture site.   We take up about 18,000 sq. ft.  We have used every little piece of space we have, but this is not the ideal dream for Rainbow Club obviously.  Many of our members come from right across the spectrum and they have many complex needs so keeping them in a safe environment is really important for us.  We have identified a site in the local area that is owned by the HSE.  We had looked at it six years ago as well.  It is a perfect site for us as it would cater for all of our current needs and allow us to expand.  There is a lot of conversation about what we do.  We delivered the summer provision programme this year but we did not receive any funding for it.  Many of the children who attended were children with complex needs.  We catered for that.  </p> <p>  It is not that hard to implement a service when you have the right people who know how to do it.  We have worked hard on the extra parts of the club, the new cookery school, the new horticulture site for young adults and we have also been working on an autism course over the past five years.  Rainbow Club is providing lots of different pieces and on one site it can have that lovely unique model under one umbrella.  I have looked at the Maltese model as well.  It is amazing.  The model that we are looking at needs to be holistic, child-centred and family based.  It must wrap around the whole family.  Departments need to collaborate and that is the one message that comes out of Rainbow Club all the time.  We are doing a bit of everything but we are making it work.  It is working and it is helping.  We have huge impact, and a lot of positive outcomes.  We work 50 weeks of the year.  We only close for Christmas.  This is manageable if people have vision.  We just need to get people to buy into that to see how it can happen with the right people.  We have our eye on the health centre in Mahon and we really need to secure that in the long term.</p></speech>

Last night I sat down and read your submissions for the best part of two hours.  In all honesty I could hardly bear to read them and then I thought, what am I talking about?  These are the lives the witnesses lead.  The submissions were very powerful, especially where the different parents of children A-L spoke about the impact on their families.  There was one phrase that somebody used which I think will stay with me forever.  They said that they were literally living in the shadows of society, that they do not belong anywhere.  </p> <p>  It is clear that the members of the committee are very concerned.  Some people have lived experience of this.  I do not personally.  I have family members who do, but I do not.  The submissions made me aware of the huge responsibility that we have in this committee, that in 12 or nine months time when we have finished our work that we make progress.  One of the good things about all of the documentation that we received from the witnesses is that it included some solutions and some ideas.  It referenced the model in Malta and what I really liked about that model was how flexible it is and I would like to hear the views of the witnesses.  In the past, in Malta, if they could not get enough people to run the programme they increased salaries to make it worth people's while.  As Ms Jenkins said, they include everybody from students, to graduates, to police trainees.  They mixed school and non-school, medical and various different sectors to make sure that they could run the programme. We have had teachers' unions in here.  We have spoken to others who are all part of this system, including the Minister.  We need to try to find a system that works and the Maltese one seems to have a lot of positive aspects.  I think the question was asked a few moments ago whether the witnesses believe it should be mandatory and I think Ms Jenkins said that the answer to that is above her paygrade.</p><p>I think what the Maltese model allows for is a model where we do not have to say to schools that every single one of them must do it next year, but where we can say we have a model here that will reward those who want to do it.  Literally, every day that goes by, when something is not happening to put things in place for next year, is a day lost.  I would like the witnesses view on that because there are a lot of pieces to this jigsaw.  What do we need to do now so that we are not running after our tails next March, April and May?  I thank the witnesses again.  They certainly gave me a great deal of food for thought.</p></speech>

The first thing I would say is that I think everybody here is a very reluctant advocate.  We certainly would not choose to be here but we come here because this is our lived experience.  To answer Deputy Harkin's question, we want to come with solutions.  It is very important to us to be part of the solution and to bring what we know to those who have the power to do something.</p> <p>  We looked at the couple of schools providing a more or less full summer in-school programme, and the committee has received the information.  We contacted three special school principals who sat with us and went through a full case study.  They were fantastic.  The first thing I will say about those principals is that each and every one of them said the reason they do it every single year is that they could not imagine these families being without this for nine weeks, not to mention that some of our children in the secondary school system go without this for 13 weeks.  They said they could not not do it.  They work all year round to identify and line up people to work in the programme.  They are seeing a pattern where it is getting harder every year to obtain staff and retain their own staff.  One principal said that perhaps the expansion of the programme and allowing their current teachers to work in the community on the home model, with children with less challenging needs has maybe resulted in the loss of a couple of staff from their in-school programme.  They work all year to plan it and they ask their own staff in January who is available.  They work from there and they rely very heavily on keeping intensive local lists and students who have been in on placement.  They have a very good relationship with universities from which they place students.  Special schools would have students coming from all the disciplines within the multidisciplinary team for experience.</p> <p>  This year we took one of those schools as a case study.  It had lost a significant number of staff who had normally done the programme and who were not available this year.  We took a look at who it had available and at the multidisciplinary students who were available there.  We also interviewed three of those students as part of the case study.  The bottom line was that it really was a win-win.  Those students could not talk enough about their whole experience and what they had learned.  It was what they went to college for and it was the icing on the cake.  The experience over three to four weeks in the special school was something a couple of them had never been exposed to.  They all said it was extremely daunting to start with but they got magnificent support.  It just brought out so many positives for them in terms of capitalising on all they had learned in college and of a commitment to continue to be available and to work with the school going forward.  </p> <p>  This is what our schools need.  Our school principals tell us they need these local lists and these people to call on, so that certainly was a win-win.  I refer to the practicalities of it and of how these schools are delivering a very detailed programme.  Let us not forget that to deliver a special school programme for children with very complex needs and where you are talking about a 1:1 ratio nearly all of the time, you are talking about a huge responsibility for the principal and the child, but also for the student or that person who is coming in that is supporting.  Each of the schools needed a significant hand-over time.  That was done by one of the schools in June and it paid for it from its own board of management fund in order to have those students in from five to ten weeks on placement and for a hand-over for the specific child they would be working with.  They made it work.</p> <p>  What we identified were the lengths these principals were willing to go to in order to ensure those families had the remaining support in the summer.  A principal told me that each week they can gain from the summer programme, hopefully, means slightly less regression in September.  The principal said that regression is inevitable as the school holidays are simply too long, but they are trying to work on lessening that regression.</p> <p>  The school on which we did the case study was quite unique.  It had a good working relationship with its overnight service, that is, the respite services for the few children availing of that service.  In that case, because it had the problems with employing staff this year, each child in the school had a four-day week.  However, it immediately identified the children who would be with the overnight service within these weeks in July.  It worked with it so that the night the children were with the overnight service could be the fifth day they were not at school and that it would have them the other four days.  It was an example of cross-department or cross-service partnership working really well for the benefit of the child.  The child was the focus.</p> <p>  These principals know exactly what our families are living with.  They really identify the absolute strain and difficulties our families face for nine weeks.  The Deputy will have read the stories and they are not easy reading but I can guarantee they are the reality and all of our families are always available to speak.  In terms of the reality of raising a child with very complex needs, in many of our families, a lone carer cannot do that and a second parent has to take unpaid leave.  Two parents have to be at home for that period of time.  In many case their siblings, their younger brothers and sisters, take over some of those care needs.  It is wholly inappropriate for a child to be a carer when that child is under the age of ten.  That is what is happening in the summer with our complex needs children.  We find siblings want to leave home a lot sooner as they cannot cope with living with their brother or sister.</p></speech>

It is very, very difficult.</p> <p>  I refer to unpaid leave and the extended families trying to cover.  Seventy to 80-year-old men and women coming in to cover care needs is not appropriate.  They did not work and pay taxes all their lives to do that.  You are talking about the sibling relationships that are decimated in many cases.  Many of these children, because they do not get the care in the summer they absolutely require for survival, are fast-tracked into our residential care system.  As we said in our opening statement, while the care of these children is cradle to grave - let us face that reality - many of our families do not want to be talking about or having discussions on residential care due to just a lack in summer provision.</p></speech>

I sometimes go back to the saying that nobody knows the shoe is cutting a person except the person who is wearing it.  That is the reason this committee was set up, that is, to listen to the voices.  However, I am sick of listening, and that is the God's honest truth.  I am sick of listening to the issues across other committees without any action.  I hope this committee will implement some of the actions each and every witness brought up here today.  It is a prime example of the saying that if you want the job done, you have to do it yourself.  I refer to many of these organisations, parents groups and hubs were set up.  I know that in Ardara, County Donegal, parents, and more so women, are coming together and setting up support groups for each other.  AsIAm, the national organisation, provides training and we, as a committee, have had that training.</p><p>AsIAm provides very appropriate training and that should be implemented in every school.  We must provide children with whatever supports they need.  Not every child requires a place in a special school and may only need a special class.<br/><br/>I do not mean to be controversial but there are a hell of a lot of Ministers.  We have  the Minister for Education; the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, who <font color="#00241A">has responsibility for special education and inclusion; and the </font>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  With so many people the can is kicked down the road.  I have seen that myself as an activist and as a person who works closely with organisations such as AsIAm and Independent Living Movement Ireland plus there are autistic adults too.  Do the organisations represented here find that when they raise issues with Ministers that have been told that the issues are not within the remit of that Department?<br/><br/>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is a very effective committee as there is cross-party support for issues.  I also work closely with some of the Departments, unions and the Department of Education on issues which cry out for mental health supports to be provided in all of the schools.  These supports must be implemented as well.  Parents, young people and organisations provide solutions and answers but there is a lack of political will.  This committee enjoys cross-party support for the provision of better services.  We are not looking for autistic children and adults to receive special treatment just to receive their basic human rights and supports.  There are no supports in place for parents or families so they and the organisations must find that draining and feel like they are banging their heads off a brick wall when they seek answers.  This committee has only recently been established and it is good to bring people in here such as the mothers of autistic children and the people affected but we need implementation.  We know the situation with the summer programme, having listened to parents, so now there must be implementation because otherwise we could be here this time next year talking about what we need.  We know the answers and this is really about implementation.  In terms of dealing with different Departments though, not Ministers as such, have the delegations experienced the same as what I think others have experienced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#J00200"><p>A few years ago I sent an email describing what my organisation does to the then Minister who had responsibility for disability services.  I received a return email that stated that my organisation and its work did not come within the remit of the Department, which is strange when our children are autistic and have a disability.  The response has stuck in my head and I still have the email.</p> <p>  We have engaged with so many Senators and local Deputies, and have had huge support from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, who constantly tries to support.  There is a lot of goodwill but nothing has happened.  Recently the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, visited us and acknowledged our work.  We constantly repeat our message that an entire pathway needs to exist for each child and everything needs to work together to provide enough support for the entire journey, which applies not just to school but to services as well.  There must be a very clear pathway for each child and his or her future.</p> <p>  One constantly worries about the next step.  For example, while these children attend national school one wonders whether placements will be found in secondary schools, and also what will happen after respite.  There are families who have children in primary services that are planning as far as three years ahead for the onset of adult services.  I know of a family who, a fortnight ago, had found a respite place for their young adult but the transport service was cancelled at the 11th hour.  The mother in that family had lost her husband previously and she worked on the pathway for two and half years only for transport to be dropped at the last minute.  There is a breakdown in communications which makes it seem like there are steel walls between Departments.  I urge people to start talking together and allow for Department officials to work with families and organisations.  I also want Departments to be receptive to our clearly telling them what works and does not work, and to be receptive to our clearly identifying what services must be put in place.  Our experience is that there is a lot of goodwill but nothing has happened to provide long-term plans and an ability to implement stuff.</p> <p>  The summer provision has been a big issue this year.  I have tried to engage on getting home tuition and summer provision for the past four years but have encountered one barrier after another.  On inquiring one is bounced from one person to another and nobody can give a final answer as to what we need to do.  We face that reality every day after we have gotten up in the morning perhaps without having slept that night and still having to do a whole day.  We are not here because we want to be but because we need to be.  We are here because we are all trying to fight for families who may not have a voice as strong as ours.  We are also probably further along this journey than some of the newer families.  They are only starting their journey and they are lucky to have people like us around them because when I started my journey there was nobody available.  If what I have learned and experienced over the years can help somebody else then that is what I will do but we should not have to sit here with us all pleading and begging for help to be provided for our children when that is a simple human right.  They are entitled to such just like everyone else.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Miriam Jennings" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#J00300"><p>I shall respond to the point made about responsibility for issues being passed between Departments and Ministers.  A number of our special schools are a dual model so a health and education model.  Many of our families would say that many of the needs of their children with complex needs concern more of a health model.  Some children follow a curriculum in special schools but many of the children for whom we advocate do not.<br/><br/>We definitely have some dual conversations with the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and, <font color="#00241A">concerning disability, with the </font>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We keep them constantly up to date with our research and the models that we propose.  In addition we have had numerous meetings with them where we told them everything, which we have identified this morning, about the absolute need for survival and support in the summer.<br/><br/>Interestingly, based on further research we conducted this year, we envisage another issue for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We have all of the information now so we know how valuable placements are for our students in third level colleges.  One student has told me that they only got to go to a special school, do a placement and get experience because they knew the lady who worked there who, in turn, said a placement could be organised but none of that person's classmates got the same opportunities.  It is crazy that we are not seeing these advantages and opportunities.  On this specific issue there is a three-pronged ministerial approach and Ministers should talk to each other.  Yes, there certainly are areas where we have found a 50:50 split within ministerial communications. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Lowndes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#J00400"><p>The same applies to everything and not just autism classes or special schools but mainstream schools.  There are a lot of autistic children who are in mainstream education but they do not get any support whatsoever and that is really bad.  We advocate for all autistic children but currently the parents we know of autistic children in mainstream education have huge issues because they do not get anything.  There are not enough National Educational Psychological Service assistants and therapists.  Also, teachers are not trained enough.  Therefore, children suffer because they are left in the mainstream system.  We have asked for therapists to be brought into the mainstream system, first in special schools but the provision needs to be across the board.  The children in mainstream education who may have an exemption from studying Irish could, for example, receive assistance from therapists at that time whether speech and language therapists or occupational therapists.  This what we must do in future.</p> <p>  We have heard stories about children going to school and see the coke bottle effect.  They get in the school door and they are masking all day.  God love them, one wonders how they feel about the situation.  Just because some of these children can communicate or are verbal does not mean that they can actually communicate and, unfortunately, things escalate when they get home.  The parents and their families try their best to help their children but when there is nothing from the HSE and mainstream education is not supported then we fail these children.</p><p>However, when you have no support from the HSE and mainstream schools are not supported, we have to consider who is being failed and we are failing the child.  It is definitely all the way across, including the mainstream, the special classes and special schools regarding the HSE and a clear pathway between the HSE and education.  With the change of the Minister responsible - I believe it is now the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman - these need to be working together to find one big pathway by which a parent can get the diagnosis and can take their time to understand the diagnosis.  It is an awful shock when you get a diagnosis.  Sometimes, it can be a bit like a funeral.  Parents bounce back but they cannot do so when they are fighting.  Parents are fighting the NCSE and are looking for places and spots.  A clear pathway is needed in which parents can enter a system and log everything in with information about where to go, instead of being handed a load of sheets of paper to look for schools.  This is where parents' groups come in.  This is what we all do because parents come to us to ask where to go, where are the suitable schools in the community, where is the nearest children's disability network team, CDNT, what do they provide etc.  It is awful for parents who have been in the system for so long like most of us here, who have kids who are eight, nine and ten years old, to have to sit brand new parents down who think they will get everything and explain the reality that they might need to take out a loan to access private therapies.  When we are talking about everything in this committee, I really hope that members take notice that there are autistic children in mainstream education.  They may be in an inappropriate setting or they might be in the right place but they still need extra help, especially as they go forward.  Respite or adult services might not be for them but we also know through As I Am that a lot of adults do not have employment.  These are the big issues.  The committee needs to be looking across the board at a whole system change. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#L00200"><p>The witnesses have all said that they are very reluctant advocates.  All of my colleagues and I are deeply appreciative of their attendance plus the testimony from all of them has been harrowing to say the least.  As a Government representative, I am deeply embarrassed by the provision of services and the complete disconnect across multiple Departments, which the witnesses have properly articulated.  I was particularly struck by a comment made by Ms O&rsquo;Mahony who said that families have been badly let down by heavily funded agencies over many years and that is the reality.  We are an advanced modern economy yet we look to Malta for a blueprint of a model on how to do things.  The money is there and without question the challenges can be addressed but the problem is the different silos and trying to navigate across different Departments.  I know that she got an email saying it was not a certain Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.  I am sure that the witnesses will not be surprised to learn that we get the same email, which shows the disconnect in the public service and that this is not just experienced by witnesses, as parents.</p> <p>  This committee has the best of intentions but the delegations need to see results.  An immediate result that we should aim for is probably the summer programme.  As Ms Jennings pointed out, the whole idea of the summer programme is not progression but to address regression, which is a very telling point for us to take on board.  We are not being asked for supports to improve the education but to address regression.</p> <p>  My first question is for the delegation from Special Needs Schools and Classes.  In terms of its aspiration to have the Maltese model in place for 2023, has the Department done anything yet about the matter?  Department representatives have visited Malta but has the delegation seen practical steps taken in regard to the scheme?  According to the group&rsquo;s case study the programme needs to start from January onwards.  Let us bear in mind that we are almost in October so is January realistic?  Have they received an indication from the Department that the scheme will be rolled out in 2023?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has set up a special education forum to examine matters like this one and we know that it has been discussed at the forum.  Both the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, are well aware of the advantages of the Maltese programme.  As far as I can remember, the latter Minister of State has commented on the programme.  We do not have anything firm to update the committee about but we are working as hard as we can and communicating on it.  As Ms Jenkins has said, we have communicated in meetings with Malta three times to constantly get to the bones of what they have established that can work here.  We will meet the Minister of State very shortly so we may receive an update.</p></speech>

Three months ago we sent the information on Malta but as of yet there has been no update.  I am not sure if work is going on in the background with regard to teaching staff, unions and so on.  I do not know if we have reached that stage but we have not heard anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#L00500"><p>It is very important that this committee lists the adoption of the Maltese model as one of its key actions.  We need to start putting pressure on both of the Ministers of State to ensure action is taken to ensure this model is in place for next summer.  We have heard how the lives of siblings have been affected and that grandparents must step into the role of carers after having worked all of their lives.  Those situations are unseemly for a modern and so-called progressive nation.</p><p>One hears about grandparents having to step into the role of carers, having worked all their lives. It is unseemly for a modern and so-called progressive nation that this is happening.  I will be impressing upon both Ministers that it is critical that action is taken on this.  It is not a big demand and if Malta can do it - it is now looking at our special classes - there is no reason we cannot action it.</p><p> I am delighted to see Ms Jenkins here.  She has been a great champion of those with special needs.  We have had many engagements and it is important, having brought her all the way to Dublin, that we give her an opportunity to highlight a more parochial challenge.  She spoke earlier about the connection between special schools and the children's disability network teams or CDNTs and how important it is that we get the information we need from the CDNTs and that such information is given to the schools.  It is fair to say there has been a complete breakdown of the CDNT in Longford.  Regardless of what figures one uses, we are all agreed that there is a staff allocation of 12.5 for the team in Longford but at the moment there are only 2.8 staff servicing that operation.  There is only 0.5 out of 4.5 in speech and language therapy and the social worker has been off since just before Christmas.  It is fair to say that it is a crisis situation in Longford.  Ms Jenkins was one of the parents who, on behalf of the special needs classes and schools group in Longford, wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about this and copied in the local Oireachtas Members.  She asked for an external review of the staffing in what is a calamitous situation with the CDNT in Longford.  It is clear that the system is broken and is failing children and parents.  Has Ms Jenkins had any response to the email she sent to the Minister of State?  Has she received any update on what action has been taken to remedy what is, in effect, a crisis in the CDNT in the Phoenix Centre in Longford?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elaine Jenkins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#M00200"><p>No, unfortunately not.</p> <p>  The example I used that may have caught the Minister of State's attention, as well as that of Deputy Flaherty, is that of my own son.  He started in an absolutely beautiful new, purpose-built special school in September but he was not seen by any therapist that year.  The speech therapist from the HSE who came to the school talked to the teacher for 45 minutes about the six children in the class and then left.  There was no plan put in place.  Parents in Longford have been having conversations with the CDNT but we all have different needs.  My son has sensory and speech needs while other parents have children with behavioural needs and so on but what we are getting is the same as every other CDNT.  We are getting offered parents' online courses and are being told what we are not doing right.  The most recent figures the parents group got are that there is only 0.5 out of 4.5 in speech therapy, 0.5 out of 4 in occupational therapy and 1 out of 2 in psychology.  If memory serves me, there has been a shortfall in psychology for two years.  As I said earlier, all of that is impacting how our children get on at school.  If our children do not have a sensory programme in school and our teachers do not know how to put one in place - it is not their job to know - then there are issues.  If our children have behavioural issues in school and our teachers are not trained in how to deal with them and we have no external behavioural specialist, then there are issues.  The numbers are bad and the far-reaching consequences make them even worse.</p></speech>

We have many special classes in Longford that straddle a number of different counties and the principals in those schools are telling me the only engagement they have from therapists is from those in other CDNTs and other counties.  An important message from today's meeting is that there is a crisis in the service in Longford and we need an investigation into the virtual collapse of that service.  How is it the case that experienced therapists who worked there for years have,<i>en masse</i>, upped sticks and left to take up other roles in other counties?  I will follow up with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I am disappointed to hear that Ms Jenkins has not had a response to her specific request but I will follow that up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#M00400"><p>I thank all of our guests for coming in today.  The great value of this committee is that we get to hear of the first-hand, lived experience.  What Ms Jones started off her submission with really struck me.  She should not need to be here.  There will always be a role for emotional support across parent groups, especially when parents first get that diagnosis, and for a sharing of experience and knowledge but parents should not be sourcing services themselves.  They just should not have to do that.  They have enough to do without that.</p> <p>  As Ms O' Mahony said to this committee, there must be much more of a focus on the child.  The support services have to follow the child.  I was looking at an organisational management chart recently and was reminded of it when mention was made of the NCSE.  Just in terms of education alone, there are so many pieces to such charts.  That is not to mention autism, where one is also dealing with health services, speech and language therapy and so many other bits and pieces and it is so fragmented.  I do not know how parents manage to get their heads around it, especially new parents.  </p> <p>  Ms Lowndes spoke about the situation in schools.  I was a primary school teacher for 15 years before I arrived here but I know that if I was put into an autism classroom, I would feel like I was at the bottom of the mountain again.  I would be relearning my job from scratch.  I have talked to primary school teachers who are in autism classrooms.  They are afraid to go out sick or to take time off for training because they know that a substitute teacher will arrive into the classroom and even with the best will in the world, that is going to be so disruptive for the children.  As a result, they are turning up to school in all sorts of conditions in order to provide the best service they can with the training they have and the facilities that have been provided.</p> <p>  There are so many issues that we could focus on, including summer provision which is very important, but I want to talk about the CDNT structures.  To pick up on what Deputy Flaherty said, I do not think that Longford is on its own in this regard.  As I said to Ms O'Mahony, I know of one school in Waterford where children in the autism classroom are going to three different CDNTs within the county.  The principal of the school would love to see the services provided within the school.  My God, the children are there.  Could we not have speech and language therapy provided in the school?  Could we not have occupational therapy provided in the school?  What is our guests' experience of the new CDNT structure?  Is it working for parents and the schools?  Is it working for everybody within the system who should be providing wraparound supports to children?  When I was a primary school teacher I taught children with autism and I, like most people within the system, wanted to do my very best for them but I was not always able to put my hands on the levers that I needed.  I was not always able to figure out the pathway to talk to people in CAMHS, to talk to the SENO or to the NEPS psychologist.  There are so many bits on that organisational flowchart.  I ask our guests to share their experience of the CDNT structure.  Is it working for parents?  Is it working for children?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#M00500"><p>I can talk about my experience.  My son is 14 now.  When he was younger, we lived in St. Catherine's catchment area and it provided a lot of the services.  It had a multi-disciplinary team.  However, Progressive Disability Services, PDS, has watered down those services.  The aim was to remove the geographic element whereby the kind of service one got depended on where one lived.  The idea was good, that there should be national provision and everyone should be getting the same services.  It should not matter, in terms of one's diagnosis, whether one lived in Galway or in Wicklow.</p> <p>  My son went to a preschool which was run by St. Catherine's.  They rented a house in the middle of Bray.  They had a lot of students in there and provided speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychology services.  There were new graduates in disability studies, people who had done social care and people who were training to be social workers.  It was absolutely brilliant.  He was there for three or four years before he started school.  He did not start school until he was six.</p><p>That service is gone because the funding is gone from St. Catherine's.  I think it went a good bit before that.  Then he went into mainstream, and then it was the HSE's services.  He has Down's syndrome as well and most children with Down's syndrome have speech and language problems.  Within the HSE disability services, it took maybe two or three years to get things up and running and meanwhile he is growing up.  Now with the new progressing disability services, PDS, he has moved on and is in a special school.  There was a speech and language therapist in that school but that therapist is long gone.  He has not had speech and language therapy for six years or maybe more.  I cannot even recall.  Unless I pay for it myself he does not get it.  The social worker from the services came out but that is it.  I feel a bit sorry for her because she has nothing to offer.  She has come with empty pockets because they do not have the therapists.  The therapists who are in there are so inundated with so many needs.  There has been such a lag because it took so long to implement the thing in the first place that the therapists are moving to the private sector where we pay them to do the services.  We had something ten years ago that really worked for my son.  It was absolutely brilliant.  But anybody who has a four-year-old now has nothing.  We had a good start for him and I am very grateful to St. Catherine's for that.  There was a very good CEO there who, a bit like Miriam's school principal, thought about how they could make this work for the child.  It was all focused on the child but in my opinion, what happens now is that everything is very systems led.  It is about the Act or the school or the service.  There is lip service paid to "It is about following the child".  In fact, none of these people would have jobs if it was not for our children, but it does not follow the child.  It is really about the system.  One must fit in.  Any services to which my young fella had access, for example when he was six and in St Catherine's, he completely lost when he moved schools.  It took years to get those back up and running.  Once they did get back up and running we made a few relationships with therapists.  Then that was lost again because the new progressing disability model was brought in and the new CBT team.</p></speech>

I found the support from them fantastic in the school.  If I had an issue they would go in.  He was in mainstream.  I would just ring them and within a couple of days they were in.  Now, I am constantly emailing and told that he is going onto the older team.  He has been with the team since he was six and I was never told there was an older team that he was moved on to.  If he is not in crisis they would see him for a few days.  When we email they would see him for a few appointments and then say, "We will ring you."  That is it.  The last one was in August and I am still in the same situation and he is still in the same situation.  He has just been forgotten.</p></speech>

They just seem to say "Okay, we are with you, we will bring him back." and then they say he seems okay but he is not.  It is just exhausting to keep ringing them and chasing them.  Do they think I want to be doing this?  I was happy with the school-age team because as soon as I rang them they went into the school, I went in, and we met to come up with a plan that would work for a while.  If that fell through, I would ring them again and the same thing would happen.  We are in the system and yet are getting absolutely nothing.  I asked them to go into his new school to his autism class.  The psychologist went in and she came back out.  I feel that just because he is in an autism class that he is forgotten about, and they feel the school can deal with it.  It is a new autism class, they are new and as they have said to me themselves, "We are only teachers."  They are fantastic teachers but they do not know how to help him.  It is the Coke bottle effect: they do not know how to reduce that so they send him home and then he is exploding at home.  But we have nobody.  Then I will have to send another email and I might get another three more appointments and then we are dropped again.  Where do we go from there?  If the family has other children who are struggling, a parent cannot split themselves into two to try to look after a new diagnosis plus the child who has been diagnosed from a young age.  It is not fair.</p></speech>

It is very sad.  It is a reality.  It is a very sad consequence, and an unintended consequence, of parenting a child with a lot of needs.  We ask for very little and very little can make the difference there.  Consider a little child getting her summer holidays at the end of June but her brother, who might be five or six years older and be a big lad at 6 ft with a lot of medications going in and a lot of issues going on, is also getting his holidays at the end of June.  There are no days out.  There might not even be a summer camp for the little sister or the little brother because mum cannot physically get everyone in the car to bring them there.  It is very sad for that child.  It is very difficult and stark.</p></speech>

I can speak to two services in our area, both of which are doing different things.  One is constantly doing parents' courses and the other is starting to bring in group interventions, if you want to call them that.  These are six weeks of Lego therapy, which is fantastic but it is only six weeks.  By the time you get to know that child - or the eight kids that you have there - you are finished and left for the next few months without them.   While the CDNTs look really well on paper, the reality is absolutely totally different.  You have to be at crisis point and on your knees before you will get anything from them or before they will enter your school in our area.</p></speech>

Some families have three and four children diagnosed.  It is not an easy journey for one child, so consider the navigation for families of four and five with two or three children on the spectrum and two that maybe are not.  There has to be somebody there to support that family.  It is not okay any more to say that PDS will do.  It has been spoken of over the past nine years but it came in at a time when we were already at a crisis point.  There were already waiting list numbers through the roof.  The pandemic was another excuse for them to pull back loads of stuff.  They could have very effectively still rolled out services in a very safe way.  They could still have come back earlier in Covid and done that but the support was not there and it is still not there.  That needs to change massively for families.  There will be massive fractures.  A lot of our young adult non-autistic family members have mental health issues because of the life they have been living and are living.  They are falling through the cracks also.  Families are trying to navigate it all and they are expected to be the occupational therapist, the speech and language therapist and the psychologist.  It is easier if the supports are put into the school where they can help to support the teachers to do their job better and to be more confident about teaching in that environment.  We know then that the family has a little bit of a buffer.  The child is in school and they have the therapists in the school so the educators and the therapist are working together.  That makes life a little bit easier but it makes a hell of a lot of difference to that child.  That is the most important thing.  The children are the centre point here.  This country is not child centred and it is shameful that our children are not looked upon as being the centre point.  That really does need to change.</p></speech>

Prices are increasing constantly and there are huge waiting lists for them.  It is hard to see what motivation there is.  However, we must refer back to families.  In many families, one person, myself included, would have left work to become a carer.  A person can start out with a two-income family to get the mortgage and then there is only one family income.  This winter, there will be people who, if they are able to get private speech therapy, will have to ask if they pay for that or the gas bill.  We have created an industry which is only detrimental to our families.  We need to figure out how we get therapists back into the system so that families are not left with the burden of choosing what to pay for.</p></speech>

They were our future therapists.  I am thinking of the experience they had there and the commitment they felt to those families.  They are now signed up with those schools to come back on a locum basis.  They have committed to the vision.  Is that a way of retaining our therapists here in the schools and being our future supply?  Supply is a huge issue.  There are benefits to sorting out one thing and getting an additional benefit and flow through.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming.  It is nice to meet the others too.  It is to be hoped we can stay in contact after this.  The system is upside down.  We do not have a system that supports parents.  The parents support the system.</p> <p>  Ms Jones' submission spoke of how these things are considered a luxury when they should be basic.  Ms O'Mahony spoke today about how it is not child-centric or joined up.  It is fragmented and piecemeal.  Ms Jenkins is right that an industry has now developed.  An ecosystem that is not working for families has developed around its survival.  It highlights how important this committee's work will be.</p> <p>  I find it hard how it is often one step forward and two steps back.  We opened a special school, Dan&uacute;, in Dublin 15, but the behavioural therapist is there to engage directly with staff, not with children.  It is not a full-time therapeutic service.  I do not understand that.  The summer provision is there to support the most vulnerable children, yet they are not the ones seeing the benefit.  During the summer there were parents identifying the gaps in data and the need in Dublin 15 for special classes.  It was not the NCSE leading this but a parents' group.  We talk about these children being our most vulnerable but we do not have mandatory training.  We expect the schools and the principals to adapt but we are not making that happen.  All the answers are there.  That is another frustration.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Kenny, Ms Jones and Ms Poole tell us what it is like when a parent comes to the support hub and how it helps them practically?  What is the Dublin 15 hub doing that can be rolled out nationally?  I ask that of the others too.  I believe the answers are in this room.</p></speech>

I wanted to create some sort of safety net for parents of newly diagnosed children.  When they come through the door, they are really in crisis.  They are in an awful state.  Initially, when they contact us we read their emails, which are very much about the child, their diagnosis and what they feel they need to put in an email to get an appointment.  Very soon, after the parents come in, it is about the emotional support they need for themselves before we even move on to the children.  We see parents who are broken and are very lost.  As parents or as expecting mothers, we have expectations.  We assume our children are going to go to school and to talk, but when your child is diagnosed as being autistic, those expectations do not exist anymore.  The child might not go to school and they might not be able to speak.  I never thought my child would be unable to say "I love you".  I spend some of the time wondering if he even feels loved.  They are not things we expect to have to deal with as parents.  Parents who come through our doors are so desperate.  It is the breakdown of everything that has led to that point: the lack of support and information.</p> <p>  The reality is simple things like putting a schoolbag on a child's back does not always happen for a parent of a child who is autistic.  They do not even have a school place half the time.  I had to fight very hard for a secondary school place.  We imagine when we put our children into school, they will thrive at five years old.  As parents of autistic children we are lucky if we get a school place, and if we get a school place, we are lucky if it is in the appropriate school setting.  If it is not, it is just an avalanche of pain and regression.  When somebody tells you your child is autistic, it is like they take your child from you.  Everything you thought is gone.  They hit a reset button.  Your child is given back to you but everything is gone.  The expectations, dreams and what you thought would be is gone.  You are on your own journey and it is a lonely journey because nobody is there to help you and nobody understands.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, we are in a situation today where, as parents, we are reliant on our children to teach us what they need because we are learning from them.  We do not always have the tools for our children to learn from us.  We are dependent on other people to help us.  That is through services and schools.  We assume our children are going to make friends when they go to school.  It can be a simple thing like that.  Our children sometimes do not even have the ability to make a friend.  That is another worry for us.  They are not in the appropriate school setting.  We are putting our children into autism classes when principals who choose the teacher to teach our children have received no training on what autism is.  How are they supposed to make the right decision on the right person to teach our children when they do not understand themselves?  There are little things.</p> <p>  We help our parents when the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, application is rejected.  We know that 60% of appeals are passed by the second officer, so what did the first officer do?  They did not even look at it.  I think of the hours we help parents to put into DCA applications.  It is traumatic.  They have to put in everything.  It is so much information.</p><p>It is almost like a counselling session for parents when we take them through the form, because they have to verbalise the reasons they feel they are entitled to DCA.  They have to verbalise their children's disability.  They are sometimes nearly hearing it for the first time.  We come in behind those parents, we listen and we help.  We empower them with information and we empower them with support.  We let them know that we are there each week and that they can come back.  Even if they are not stuck for something for their child but they are feeling low they can come into us. </p><p> The reality is that we are so busy trying to help our children and our children's mental health, that too often the parents mental health is forgotten about.  I see it all the time.  Week in, week out, we see parents, just like Ms Jennings said, who are worrying about the siblings.  My children would not even know to put themselves first.  They do not even know what that means.  They do not expect to be put first.  As parents, we always worry whether we are doing enough.  We are always worried about getting it right.</p><p> The hub has provided so much support.  We will open our doors on Thursday for the third year.  We have seen more than 160 families come through our doors over that period of time.  That includes families who feel empowered, who no longer feel alone and who feel supported.  Sometimes, if they are lucky enough, there will be a place in Ms Kenny's social club.  They can come and they can meet families.  It is an unbelievable service.  If we had one of them in every town and in every county, at least parents would feel that they were not alone, that they had this knowledge now and that they had this power.  At least they could stand on their own two feet and try to help their child in a little better than they had been able to because they are stronger.</p></speech>

I will continue from what Ms Jones said about the support in Dublin 15.  My own story is that my son has now just turned 21.  Nearly nine years ago, there was nothing for him there socially, nowhere for him to go and nothing for him to do, so another parent and I set up the club Little Seeds Arch Club.  We are affiliated with the Arch Clubs umbrella, which is for children and adults with special needs in Ireland.  I would love to see similar clubs in counties in Ireland and for them to have their own support groups.</p> <p>  Little Seeds opened its doors nine years ago to seven children and we now support 70 families.  The children are from the age of seven to 22.  We have a girl who is 22.  It is fantastic for them to have their own safe environment and they love that hour.  We do Lego with them, we play basketball and we get professionals in to do occupational therapy with them.  We have outings in the summer when the club stops, because it is like the school year and it runs from September to June.  We organise outings where we bring the siblings along and make them feel just as special.  I would love to see this rolled out across all the counties in Ireland.  Many of them have clubs, but I know there are not as many in the midlands.  I would love to see Little Seeds replicated.  </p> <p>  Many of our families are on waiting lists for therapies, both private and public.  Little Seeds provides autism therapy services through fundraising.  Ms Jones has done fundraising for the club.  We are able to offer subsidised therapies which include music therapy, play therapy, sibling workshops, yoga, well-being and art.  Through our own fundraising there is so much that we can subsidise for families who are struggling.  The parents get on so well and they are not alone on this autism journey.</p> <p>  I will speak for myself.  My son, Mark, is 21 now.  I know what it was like 15 years ago when services were still as bad.  It was a lottery as to whether we got a little therapy and whether Mark had a class to go to.  I can remember ringing and being told they would put my son on a waiting list.  In the years that have lapsed since Mark was diagnosed, we are probably still in the same situation with waiting lists for therapies and for everything.  Really and truly, we should not be.  Ireland is such a great country in a lot of ways.  It is not a Third World country.  Our children and our parents should be at the top of the list.  We are the spokespeople here today for our children.  We are their voice and we need to make a difference.</p> <p>  There is the idea of rolling out what they have in Malta was mentioned.  We should be replicating that.  That model seems to be going so well.  Ireland should be far greater at catering for our children than what it is.</p></speech>

For example, in Bray, Bray Lakers is a very good service and it provides an after-school activity.  It has an hour class here and an hour class there.  However, I cannot bring my son to that because he will not go in.  This is particularly the case if there is an intellectual disability with autism and with other things as well, in particular a moderate intellectual disability.  He needs stability, routine and predictability.  School provides all of that for him.</p> <p>  I have tried every special group.  I said I wished I lived in Cork because the Rainbow Club sounds great.  Everybody does little bits here and there.  I tried special needs rugby, soccer, Bray Lakers and everything else.  I have tried every group out there to try to progress, but he does not have the capacity.  It is so stressful for him and for me trying to get him to do these things.</p> <p>  We have schools everywhere in the country.  Every town, city, county and village have schools.  That is what he loves.  He loves school.  Schools run all day and this allows me to work.  I am a single parent and this allows me to work to earn the money to pay for everything like we all have to do.  We already have a lot there.  We just need to tweak the school system.  While I am all for the extra clubs too, many complex needs children cannot access those clubs, just like they cannot access home-based provision.  The Department states all the time that one can a home-based tutor if they cannot the July provision in school.  However, there is so much about being in school, such as getting on the bus and all the minutiae of life that is important to people, both children and adults, who do not really understand because they do not have the intellectual capacity.  We build this life for them that they can enjoy and that they can progress in but we have to do it within the boundaries of what works, so introducing lots of new things like a tutor, for example, for home-based provision does not work for my son and for many children with complex needs.  It is so stressful.  He could not tolerate a stranger in the home.  We could not have him going on an outing, for example, with a tutor.  He is 6 ft., he is a massive, they would be terrified that he would run off and there would be safety issues.  He is not really verbal so he could not say if anything went wrong.</p> <p>  The GAA and soccer clubs all get money.  All these mainstream social groups get money to provide a service, which is great for the kids who can access that.  However, there are a number of children, mine included, who have an autism and intellectual disability, ID, diagnosis along with other issues and who cannot access that.  That is what happens with summer provision.  There is a lot of money going into it, but the people and families who really need it are not able to access it.</p></speech>

It is left to parents to put campaigns together.  They can find this data.  I find it amazing that the majority, including ourselves, have found this data.  One of the reasons is that the NCSE does not keep data.  The committee should know it is something that needs to be brought in.  We need a centre and a database system.  The NCSE needs to work on how it keeps its data.  As far as we are concerned, when we started out, we were told there was very little in our area, which was true.  It did not have the number of children or anything.</p></speech>

It is an absolute shock that it is one of the biggest systems.  The Department of Education relies on it for information.  However, its information is not always correct.  As people know, when talking about preschools, we are also talking about children who are on waiting lists to be diagnosed.  They are not taken into consideration either.  They also add to the waiting lists for databases for autism classes and such.  It is a shame that it is down to us to have to do this.  We have to do it through parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests.  Why can the NCSE not do the same thing?  The committee needs to look at why there is no data available through the NCSE or the HSE.</p></speech>

I am conscious that I am the only person from Cork here today.  We have been talking to Ms Lowndes about how the model that Rainbow Club is offering.  The youngest children are two years of age.  These children are not in school or preschool.  Some of them cannot go into the preschool because there is not enough access and inclusion model, AIM, provision.  Therefore, we are now having these children as well.</p> <p>  Quite a number of our children have complex needs.  We have certain rooms to cater for those children&rsquo;s needs.  However, it is all about the model and the pathway.  When a family comes to us, they are giving us their information, the child&rsquo;s diagnostic report comes to me and I read through it.  We look to see where the child&rsquo;s difficulties are, the challenges and what we need the staff to know and how they can provide support.  The next thing is that the child is placed and mom and-or dad will come to meet with us and see where the other provisions need to be put in place.  The siblings are sent to sibling group.  If there are other therapeutic interventions that they need, that is all done through us.  Again, we do the school liaising, forms and phone calls.  We recently sent out packs to all of the GPs in County Cork because they needed to know where we are and what we do.  There is a very clear transition for a child.  We send out photographs of the room and the staff.  We tell the parents what to do when they come, such as not to come too early so as not to wait, and all of this other stuff.  The information is given to the staff.  All staff have access to that.  Every staff member who interacts with that child knows exactly what he or she needs.</p> <p>  We are adding to that all of the time.  As challenges come up - and there are difficulties - we are adding to that information and addressing them.  We are putting in the whole sensory diet.  We have families that will have their children come to us after school.  Some will stay two and three hours because mam is on her own, she works and the grandparents will be minding this child with very complex needs and are not able to, so we take the child.</p> <p>  It can be done and it is working.  It is already in play in Cork.  We did not have anything when we started.  There was nobody I could go to for information.  We started everything - policies, all of our implementation, all of our strategy and what we were going to do.  The pathway is there for the child.  When we feel the child is ready for another step, we bring the parents in tell them we think the child is ready to move on.  A load of our children graduated to the teen hub this year.  They were ready for the next step of the journey.  Our life mentor coach will go into schools and help many of our older lads with the next plan for college.  It is very doable.  We have been doing it, and we are not a Department.</p> <p>  We have had loads of conversations with Ms Lowndes as well.  We are also talking to Waterford about replicating its model.  We are looking at the Dreambig Project down there.  They have a very similar vision.  This is something that can happen; it has already happened.  We are all on the same page and want and need the same thing.  We have identified very clearly what needs to happen.  We should be getting support and help to make that happen and make life a bit better.  If we all come together, it can happen much faster.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for coming in.  I know that it is stressful for them to come here and describe the circumstances of their children's situations and what they have had to go through over the years.  I thank them for doing that.  I know that it is not easy.</p> <p>  The system Ms O&rsquo;Mahony described works because it is proactive.  It anticipates the needs of the child.  It could, as she said, be replicated by the State, if the State were to anticipate and co-ordinate the different things and come at it from the parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s perspectives and not its own perspective in the context of how matters have been organised historically.  I work with Vicky Casserly in respect of children in hospital.  Again, we try to anticipate things the child and parent need.  For example, if parents are in a multidisciplinary situation, we seek to ensure that all of the appointments are on Mondays, instead of three or four different days over two weeks, in order that people to not have to fill their cars with petrol three or four times or make three or four different childcare arrangements.  It involves thinking about matters from the perspective of the person who is using the service.</p> <p>  In that vein, I want to come back in very strongly on the points relating to CAMHS and medication.  Our guests are experienced in dealing with the education system, the HSE and all of these different things.  While I know all of those are very difficult matters, our guests have a level of knowledge of the system and their children.  That is an impossible thing to replicate when it comes to medication and the pharmacology of medication and what that means when it comes to managing side effects and the child&rsquo;s growth.</p> <p>  My son has very bad epilepsy.  His medication was changed in April.  We got a cancellation appointment with a neurologist tomorrow in Crumlin to go back and check that.  I was just thinking about our guests when I left.  My child has a neurological injury.  He is getting a follow-up appointment.  Our guests&rsquo; children have neurodiverse situations and they are also under medical supervision, albeit a different type, and their children, who are on medication, are not being supervised or followed up with in the same way. </p> <p>  I never do this, but I want to state my view on CAMHS and a system that allows that to happen.  It is negligent beyond words.  It is criminally negligent to put a child on mind-altering medication and fail to follow it up in an appropriate way, every six or 12 months over the period, and to fail to care about that child, not just proactively, but to make sure that it is done properly.  I am sorry to be so strong about something, but I feel that this is something that is out of our guests&rsquo; hands and their control and I just want to make the point very strongly.</p></speech>

A child can be diagnosed with ADHD without physically being seen by CAMHS.  They do not attend the school and they do not go to the home.  Many of our children would not readily go to these settings.  Trying to bring them into these settings and behave the way they normally do would be like putting a cat into a bath.  I know of diagnoses where they have relied on forms filled out by teachers and school staff, but they have not seen the children.  Those diagnoses then lead to medication.</p></speech>

Some of their testimony has been harrowing, but it was very important it that it was placed on the record.  One of the probably most alarming aspects has been what Ms Lowndes said in terms of the new CDNT and the PDS programme, namely, that unless people are on their knees, they will not get a service.</p><p>It seems that a monster has been created with the new structure that is being rolled out.  Somebody has to say "Stop" and that this is not working.  That is an important message to come from this meeting.  I know that one of the groups is to meet the Minister afterwards.  It is certainly a message we will be articulating.  We will reference the email that parents in Longford sent to the Minister earlier, just to give them voice as well.  Longford has been deteriorating under CHO 8 management for many years and the retention of local staff now seems to be another serious issue.  Other local counties, while not fully staffed, are managing to provide a service.  The progressing disability services programme has been in place for more than ten months but, rather than the support increasing, it is decreasing dramatically.  It goes to the heart of what Ms Murphy said in respect of it not being child centred and the services not following the child.  A very good example of that relates to special classes.  If a child comes in from another county and another children's disability network team, CDNT, an SNA for the child is not guaranteed and suddenly the primary school has to carve up its limited resources.  Everything the witnesses have told us today has cut to the heart of the problem, which is that the forgotten people in this are the children.  It is a damning indictment on us as a Government, and for that we apologise.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies are running to different meetings and so on.</p> <p>  I heard the remarks of Deputy Flaherty.  I missed part of the discussion while I was out of the room.  He referred to a monster being created.  I believe some of the witnesses will meet the Minister after the meeting.  If it is appropriate, I ask that they send us a short email or whatever to let us know what progress, if any, they make.  That can be sent either to individual members or to the committee - I will let the Chairman decide on that.  It is an area with which I am not as familiar with as perhaps I ought to be and I would be interested to hear of any progress they make.</p> <p>  My second point relates to Deputy Carroll MacNeill's comments on CAMHS.  I received emails from parents, especially after the south Kerry issue, regarding children being over-medicated or inappropriately medicated.  I would like to hear the views of our guests on that and how to protect children from that happening.  Parents go to the expert; the person who knows.  It is their child.  One is always in a more vulnerable position when one goes to a person who knows more; it does not matter who the person is.  How can our guests, as parents, advocate strongly in this position and feel that they really have a voice here?</p> <p>  Ms Jennings made the point earlier that principals have stated the numbers are decreasing and they just cannot get the numbers to work.  As regards the Maltese model, the documentation provided by the witnesses states that it is originally offered to school staff who not only earn an increased salary to work in special schools year-round, but are also well rewarded for completing the summer school.  That is something we need to consider because people have extra costs, such as on childcare, transport or whatever, but we should be upfront regarding people also needing a break and time off.  The document further states that when numbers to run the programme were not achieved, there was an expansion to recruit staff from other disciplines.  There are two important pieces there.  If we could use them, it might make the job of some principals a bit easier.  I read what the principals said and what the students said.  It was the only thing in all the documentation that gave me some hope.</p></speech>

I had to leave to attend another meeting.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on the issue of employment.  The difficulties we have in CHO4 are well known now.  On average, it is taking eight to nine months to employ a home care worker, let alone therapists and whatever else.  I am familiar with the Rainbow Club and how it successfully hired people in the recent past.  Have any of the witnesses who are involved in advertising for therapists or whatever the case may be found it difficult to hire those people?  The HSE is telling us that is its biggest difficulty.  In my CHO, there is 38% vacancy rate for employment.  That does not instil confidence.  Are the witnesses experiencing the same difficulty as the HSE in hiring therapists?  </p> <p>  I spent 15 years in a classroom as a secondary school teacher.  I never received any modules in special education.  That is going to back to 2002 or 2003.  If I were to lose my seat in the morning, I could well find myself in a classroom tomorrow, teaching kids with a variety of needs, or in the ASD hub that is in my school at the moment.  To be honest, I would not be prepared for it.  Is there a need for a new teaching degree that includes this specific pathway?  What is our guests' experience in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elaine Jenkins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092000002#R00400"><p>It is something for which we have advocated and we have discussed it with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  Our children are often difficult for us to understand, so, with all due respect, how can we expect an educator to understand all the children in his or her classroom, who have a variety of needs?  I do not pretend to understand dyslexia or dyspraxia because I do not have experience of them.  With one in 20 boys on the autism spectrum, according to a HSE psychologist, the teaching unions, the teaching colleges and the NCSE teaching council need to step up and face the reality that there are diverse needs in every classroom every day and those needs are not being met.  We covered the fact that the lack of therapists is exasperating the whole issue because children are not having their sensory needs met.  Teachers do not know how to teach children how to communicate.  They might do a two-week picture exchange communication system, PECS, course but that is not going to bring our children up a level.</p> <p>  A big concern we have is that there are no ambitions for our children.  A lot of the attitude is to get the children through this year.  A teacher will do his or her year or two years in the autism class and it will then be somebody else's turn.  We want our children to able to read and write when they leave school, however.  We need the basics for our children but that will not be possible until the teachers are trained.   Other countries do it well.  In Slovakia, students do part of their teaching degree and then focus on speech or occupational therapy to finish the degree.  There are examples of other countries in Europe that do it really well.  That should be the basic level; the minimum our children are getting.</p></speech>

That may be something they could do in the latter stage of their degree or as a postgraduate course.  It may be that they could specialise in a field, just as nurses do.  That is worth considering.  I invite our guests to comment on the difficulties in getting therapists.  It may be easier for them to do so than it is for the HSE.</p></speech>

I do not understand why people would not want to get this training.  Why does the teaching degree not include a module on autism?  That would allow teachers to be the best teacher they can be for all students; to be a teacher who teaches inclusive education rather than having continuous exclusion.  From the time a child is diagnosed, they experience exclusion every day, right through every step of life.  It is not rocket science.  We know that students studying for a degree in teaching will  have autistic students, so why does the degree not include autism training?  It is very simple.  If I was about to begin teaching, I would be very frightened knowing that I would have autistic students but I did not have the appropriate tools to be the best teacher I could be and to make sure that those children would receive an inclusive education.</p></speech>

I am conscious that one of the group wants to leave and I want to say a few words before it does so.</p><p> First, on behalf of everybody, I think, and on behalf of myself as a parent, I thank all the witnesses for everything they do.  They should not have to do it but they do it because, as has been said, they are child-centred and are thinking of the children and the needs of their kids and all kids throughout the country.  The Government and successive Governments have let parents and their children down, and that is not acceptable.</p><p> Deputy Flaherty mentioned a case in respect of Ms Jenkins in my county and where we are at the moment regarding a disability team.  We have 2.8 posts across the whole service.  Last April Ms Jenkins, Deputy Flaherty and I met with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  In our county we had more than 230 kids waiting on an assessment of needs and more than 700 children waiting on services.  At that time we had, I think, 11 posts.  Now we have 2.8 whole-time equivalents: one psychologist, half a speech and language therapist, half an occupational therapist, 0.8 of a physiotherapist and no social worker.  The reality is that we are not giving children the opportunity to fulfil their lives.  Early intervention is early intervention, and that is what we need.  I know from personal experience about going private.  In particular, music therapy is something we did as a family, and I found it fantastic.  It made a huge difference to my son's speech before he went to school.  Some parents, however, are not in a position to do that, and that is not acceptable.</p><p> We need to call out the HSE.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The management of the HSE that deals with the filling of these positions on all teams across the country need to be called out because they are a disgrace and they are not doing their job.  The Minister and the Government need to call them to account because their actions and inaction are failing children across the country.  It is not acceptable.  In other jobs and other lines of work, if you are not doing your job you lose your job and you are gone and replaced.  We have asked the HSE to appear before our committee in a number of weeks to discuss the disability teams and the staffing levels across the country.  What the HSE is doing now is disgraceful, as I said, and it is kids and families who are suffering.  It is not acceptable any more.</p></speech>

I have seen documentation for a particular special school to which I have referred here before.  It has already decided that it will not provide summer provision in summer 2023.  It has made that decision 12 months out.  That is not acceptable.  I think Ms Jennings made the point about a teacher in a school who took on and started work 12 months in advance and provided special summer provision for more than 70 kids who would not have got it otherwise.  Ms O'Mahony took children on board because services were not being provided in her area.  With no funding she provided summer provision for more than 1,000 kids.</p></speech>

It is highly inappropriate for parents to be making contact with schools and asking them about this, which then creates this really bad atmosphere.  It is not fair on any of the parties in education, parents or educators.  We recognise by our study and our conversations the real challenges for them.  It is really important we recognise and acknowledge also how hard it is to establish a programme in a school where there might be 70 children with complex needs.  A principal is not going to choose ten of those children and say to the remaining 60 of them, "I am having a little lottery here."  We need to recognise the challenges rather than having the same old arguments the whole time: "Why will you not do it?", "I do not want to do it", "I want to go on my holidays".  The children are very hard to manage, but they are very hard for us to manage too.  We hear the same arguments all the time.  We need to bring this up a level.  Let us look at the realities and find the solutions from today, based on the new research and the honest research.  It will not be an easy fix, but there most certainly is a fix and we certainly have a budget.  We had a budget of &euro;40 million last year.  We need to look at how we are spending that budget.</p></speech>

If I hear that again, I will crack up.  One of the parents in the booklet we put together contacted 37 tutors.  It is really awful.  You have to go on the Internet to find a tutor for the home-based programme, so you have to advertise your child on the Internet.  It is a terrible thing to say, but teachers and SNAs will choose kids they can manage.  Nobody will take my young fella.  To get that constant rejection is really difficult as a parent.  We polled the parents in our group of children with complex needs, and 94% of them do not want the home-based programme, so the Department has to stop saying to us there is a home-based programme for us.  That is just the emperor's new clothes.  If it does not work, it does not work.  The Department should stop giving us things that are not suitable and telling us, "There you go, you have it now, be happy with that."</p></speech>

Sorry.  I was just conscious that the three ladies were leaving and I just wanted to speak to them in particular about the issue of the summer provision.  I will let them go to their meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I thank them.</p> <p>  Funding was mentioned earlier and questions were asked about it.  I believe we need to replicate what Ms O'Mahony is doing in Cork across the country.  We need to replicate what Ms Jones, Ms Kenny and Ms Poole are doing with that wraparound parental support infrastructure in every single county in Ireland.  I see the need in my home area.  I have referred to the lack of services we have and the lack of summer supervision.  That needs to be funded by the taxpayer.  We cannot have the witnesses' groups out fundraising and begging for services to be provided to children, services to which they are entitled.  It is not acceptable.</p></speech>

The cost is the speaker and a Zoom licence, and that is it, per county.  Why can that not be rolled out?  I try to reach out with the plan to as many families as possible.  It has gone not only nationwide but also international.  I get requests to join the plan's Facebook page.  As I said, realistically, that is no major expense.  Surely a few bob could be found and each county would know that it was Plan Longford, Plan Athlone and so on.  Why can the money not be found?  I and two other parents run this on a voluntary basis.  We source the speakers.  We get the best of speakers in.  We alternate between doing it on Zoom and in person at a very small cost.  Surely that would not take an awful lot of planning, and each county would feel that it has something.  The presentation slides are emailed to the families afterwards so they can go over them again.</p><p>I was asked to do that by Tusla, which we are grateful has continued to fund that.  I was asked to do it and I did not know where I would start.  I enrolled a couple of other parents, we put our heads together and it has been a great success four years on.  We have plans for Balbriggan and I am working online helping them to source speakers, which we share.  We have plans for Dublin 5, Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 as well.  Those are three plan groups so surely it is an easy thing to roll out to other counties.</p></speech>

I have a specific case where one parent has given up work, they have two kids with a diagnosis, they have a third child with autism, the father is travelling to work at 6.30 a.m. in the morning to Dublin but they are just over the limit so they are not entitled to a carer's allowance.  That story is replicated in other families.  We need to look at this and it cannot just be income-based, it has to be on the basis of where there is a need.</p></speech>

It should not be the case that the parent is doing a job on top of that.  Being a carer is a job and we should be significantly able to support that person who is giving up his or her job.  We are one of those families; Jon had to give up his job years ago when Sean was not easy to manage.  Could it not be looked at in a different way?  The way that it is processed and the way applications are done is not fair.  It should be identified that this is that person's role and that he or she is doing the job for the State during the day.  It should be identified that he or she is the occupational therapist, the speech and language therapist and all of the other stuff during the day.  There is a significant amount of caring with a child and that should be identified as being a role and a job.</p></speech>

I gave up my job three years ago and my husband works.  I have two boys who are on the spectrum but one is worth a full carer and the other is only worth half a carer.  How can it be justified to do that to families that have two or three children?  They should all be equal and the money should be equal across the board.  It is not right that you can pick and choose a child.  It is those small things; whether you are over it or under it you are hit either way.  On top of that we have a few families in our support group that will hopefully eventually get back to work or would like to get back to work in the future.  They would like to upskill but there is no course for them.  A lot of them would like to go on and do speech and language therapy or occupational therapy but there are no pathways and when you find a pathway it puts them over the 18.5 hours.  You look at the way it works and we are hit left right and centre, whether it is money or whether we are over or under the limits, on top of wanting to be able to go back to work eventually.</p></speech>

The vast majority of carers do not get the carer's allowance.  It is a small proportion of them to begin with and you only get it if the person needs full-time care.  The system as it is constructed is such that only a small proportion of carers get it.  In that context, not having a means test is a reasonable ask.  It would be a different thing if everybody who self-identified as a carer could say there should not be a means test but that is not how the system works.  The witnesses are correct that this is something we should ask for because it is already restricted when it comes to numbers.  I fully support what was said about special schools.  They should be mandatory and parents should not be begging and asking.  As was said, they are fracturing relationships with schools and causing difficulty.  Perhaps this committee can do something about it but I thank the witnesses for that.</p></speech>

I know that is not always the case and lead-in times are nine to 12 months for it to hire a therapist, at best.  Do the witnesses have experience of that in their organisations and how has it worked out for them?</p></speech>

We have two occupational therapists working for us for seven years and we have been lucky.  Just last week we had a music therapist and a play therapist working on well-being.  A lot of it can be down to word of mouth.  For example, a parent might know of a therapist and give me the contact details.  I make contact with them, meet them, talk to them about the club, say what we are looking for and what the age group is and so on.  We have been really lucky and any therapist we have in Little Seeds Arch Club we have had for a number of years and we have been able to keep them.  It works both ways; we are so delighted to have the therapists in and working for so many families and the therapists are delighted too because they see the work that is being done in Little Seeds Arch Club and they see that we can reach out to so many families.</p> <p>  I would always say to our families that if they are on private waiting lists they should stay on them and if they are on public waiting lists they should stay on them.  What we can offer our families is something that can keep them going in the meantime.  We will have a sibling workshop, we have mindfulness and in October play therapists will be working with some of our children who have a lot of anxiety around school.  These will be much smaller groups so we could have 20 to 22 children in each of the groups we have in Little Seeds Arch Club.  For the therapists, this new therapy service that launched with us last week would have much smaller groups.  The music therapy will be on this evening so I had better get back in time for it and that is just for six young teenagers.  We have never had that before and it is something new we are offering our families.  We are delighted to say we are not Government-funded but that we are funded through fundraising and we can offer these therapies to our families.  We got a lot of the therapists through word of mouth and I made contact with the therapists, met them, did their Garda vetting and so on.  I spoke to them about the club, the families, the ages of the children and so on and everybody has been on board.  We are lucky in Dublin 15 and I am delighted with the service we have been able to provide but it is not Government-funded and it has started from a little seed.</p> <p>  We have been assisting other groups.  For example, in Athlone they opened their own arch club last Sunday and I was like a proud Mom looking on from the side.  I spoke to the girls about Little Seeds Arch Club on a Zoom call and about how we operate in Dublin 15.  Balbriggan is opening its own club in the coming weeks and Clondalkin and Skerries have clubs in the pipeline.  Nenagh has a big group of 100 children attending and all of it has stemmed from Little Seeds Arch Club.</p> <p>  The work that can be done is amazing.  We are a voluntary group, there are no wages and nor do I want any wages.  It is all about the hours put in and it has been created from my son being diagnosed nine years ago when there was nothing out there for him.  I could see how it was more difficult for him socially, including to make friends, because I have two older children, and I wanted something in the area for him.  It started from that little seed and it has grown and spread through other groups and clubs setting up, which is fantastic to see.</p></speech>

We had taken in students from University College Cork and the Crawford Art Gallery.  One of the art therapy students who has come out and is qualified will come on board with us.  Having students is valuable as well because you are not just giving them experience and a skill set but they are also getting the practical stuff during their time with us.  That is another part of what the ladies were saying a while ago about the schools and colleges and about training programmes.  Maybe it could be incorporated into their placements and they could be placed in schools and special school settings so that they can experience the practical side as much as the theory base.</p><p>Recruiting students is probably the way the next three to five years is going to have to go.  We have already started identifying where we can bring students in and will start looking at recruiting them then.</p></speech>

Ms O'Mahony mentioned trainees.  Two years ago, PLAN had a speaker for its parent talks and just before everyone came in on Zoom, I happened to mention my first baby and my club, the Little Seeds Arch Club.  The speaker said that she had trainee OTs who were looking to work in such a club environment.  This year we actually had 12 students who came out and worked for a number of weeks with our children.  They were glad of the experience and we were glad of their knowledge.  I am hoping to have speech and language therapist trainees as well.  Getting trainee psychologists is my next move so I am open to any contacts or help.  It works for the club and it works for the students as well.  It works both ways.</p></speech>

I will not say she found people easily but a lot more easily than the HSE seems to be able to source staff.  The HSE needs to see that and hear it.  Turnaround times for us to employ therapists in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 are not working.  It is like the situation described in Longford, there are posts ebbing away and falling away and not being replaced.  The HSE needs to hear that people are willing to go working for organisations such as the Rainbow Club and in the settings that they have.  This may be a question that only the HSE can answer.  Maybe it needs to look at itself and see if it can learn from this.  How can the HSE, as an employer, create an environment where people actually want to come to work for it like they do for these organisations?</p></speech>

The reality is there is not and the HSE has not engaged with them.  That is not forward planning or thinking by any organisation.  The reality is that it is our kids who are losing out because of it.</p></speech>

Even when they get them, they struggle to keep them.  That is really important because such people seem to be only in the position before they are gone.  As Ms Kenny said, some of the therapists have been with us for years but I think it is a case of what you give is what you get.  That needs to be looked at.  Why are they leaving?  What can they do differently to keep their therapists because they are not staying and they are not being replaced?</p></speech>

The clinical approach is not working.  That is why they are not invested in it.  Our children are looked at as numbers.  Every key worker has between 700 and 900 families, whereas for community groups and organisations like us, each family is not seen as a number.  There is a person.  A child is at the centre and that is what we see.</p></speech>

When we started out, Ms Kenny was growing her Little Seeds Arch Club.  Now we have 70 families being catered for, in terms of the social aspect right down to therapies.  The Autism Support Hub opened as a result of personal experience.  Everything we do comes from personal experience and because there are so many of those personal experiences coming together, we seem to be growing something very special.  If we could only get the people in power who have the funding to have the same will and intention as us, we would go a very long way.</p> <p>  I thank all the members for listening to us and for having us.  </p></speech>

We could talk about this day in, day out, and there probably are 40 other pages I could talk about but we need action.  That is the top priority.  We need action on the CDNTs, on education and then supporting all our support groups along the way.  I think it is time to step up and make it happen for us.</p></speech>

You are a model for parents groups across the country.  As a State, we need to support and replicate what you are doing across the whole country.  We need to support you financially as well for putting in a significant amount of your time to highlight the needs of our kids.  I will give a personal commitment and I can speak for all the members of the committee also.  This is a committee we wanted to set up because we wanted to make a change.  The commitment is there from the leaders of the three Government parties to set up this committee.  We want to put forward proposals next March when we will lay a report before both Houses that is going to make changes.  Some changes have started to be made as a result of this committee being in place and issues have been highlighted in the national press.  The will is there.  I firmly believe action will be taken.  I know that across all parties, we want to make a difference.  We want to see changes made for your children and for my son.  I have a young child who was diagnosed with autism and when Ms Jones was speaking earlier, I could remember when we were told the news as a family.  I am very positive for his future and it is my job as a parent to work to make sure he gets the services, the intervention and the help to be what he can be.  I give that commitment that we will work as a committee to make sure changes are made.  We will not accept the situation as it is.  The HSE needs to step up to the mark and make the changes and put the staff and levels in place for services our children are entitled to.</p> <p>  Your contributions will assist us in writing our final report.  At the first meeting of this committee after it was established, we decided to meet parents and get the lived experience.  We will formulate our proposals based on the lived experience of what is needed for our children.  I thank you all sincerely.  </p> <p>  As there are no other matters members wish to raise, that concludes our business for today.  The committee's next public meeting will take place on Thursday, 29 September 2022 and will be a joint meeting with the Joint Committee on Disability Matters at which we will discuss accessibility in the built environment, communications and information with a number of groups.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I would like to welcome the following representatives from the CRU: Ms Aoife MacEvilly, chairperson; Dr. Paul McGowan; Mr. John Melvin; who are all welcome back, and Ms Karen Trant, who is welcome.</p> <p>  As is usual before we begin, I will read out the note on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice whereby they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they may participate in this meeting only if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask any member joining us online, prior to making his or her contribution, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call now on Ms MacEvilly for her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife MacEvilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#D00300"><p>We thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss some of the work under way in relation to the strategic priorities within our new strategic plan.  I will start by outlining the current priority work we are undertaking to empower and protect consumers.  </p> <p>  In light of exceptionally high and volatile wholesale EU gas prices, retail electricity and gas prices are increasing dramatically, thereby putting pressure on all domestic and business customers, many of whom are already struggling to pay.   The CRU is deeply concerned about the impact these price increases will have on all customers and particularly on vulnerable customers.  We therefore have introduced a new suite of consumer protection measures to be in place for this winter.  The decision paper has been provided alongside this paper and in summary, the key measure include: extended debt repayment periods for customers in debt; lower debt repayment on top-ups for customers with financial hardship prepayment meters; customers on financial hardship meters to be put on the most favourable tariff available from their supplier; and extended moratorium periods for disconnections this winter.</p> <p>  We are currently working through the supplier of last resort process for Panda Power customers.  There have been three supplier of last resort events in the Irish market this year, through which we have ensured that supply is maintained for some 100,000 affected customers. </p> <p> The CRU has also just completed overseeing the implementation of the electricity credit scheme, along with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, ESB Networks and suppliers.  We are ready to support any future interventions in line with Government decisions. </p> <p>  Some further workstreams to protect costumers include: working with industry to provide the negative public service obligation, PSO, levy to customers as quickly as possible; continuing customer communication campaigns to highlight the importance of registering as a vulnerable customer, to be aware of your rights as an energy customer and to make the best use of the better information and tariff options for customers with smart meters; continuing the roll-out of smart meters and leveraging the benefits of smart services; working with our customer care team to assist customers in distress, and engaging with our Department and other stakeholders to implement market and consumer protection measures arising from the evolving European Commission policy. </p> <p>  We will be stepping up market monitoring activities this winter, focusing on key customer debt and disconnection trends, and have included with this statement some of the latest data in this regard.</p> <p>  Turning to our next strategic priority to drive a low-carbon future, we are working to both increase the level of renewable electricity capacity on our system and to ensure we optimise the use of those renewables, as well as the infrastructure and technologies that support their roll-out, for the benefit of customers and the climate.</p><p>We welcome the increased connection of renewables, particularly solar projects, at scale this year, which will deliver significant benefits for consumers.  This includes the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, contribution to the PSO levy rebate.</p><p> We are working to enhance the integration of these renewables through the publication of the single electricity market high-level design on system services future arrangements, with further work progressing on the detailed design.  The new high-level design allows for a phased approach and enables EirGrid to procure system services in fixed contracts and a layered procurement approach.  We welcome EirGrid's publication of its consultation on the low-carbon inertia competition.</p><p> One of the key enablers in achieving our 80% renewable electricity target is the delivery of offshore renewables at scale.  The CRU is holding consultations on offshore grid connection policy, which will enable developers to bid confidently in the forthcoming offshore renewable electricity support scheme, ORESS, auction.  A new CRU division will be established shortly to advance further work, including the regulatory framework for the offshore asset owner and operator and offshore network planning, standards and licensing. </p><p> We are concerned about the current gap in offshore safety regulation.  International experience suggests that offshore renewables require regulation from a safety perspective.  Ideally, a safety-by-design approach to the prevention of major accidents is required.  Recognising the ambition in terms of scale and timing that Ireland has for offshore renewables, it is imperative the country implements an appropriate legislative framework in this area at the earliest opportunity, including designation of the body that will assume responsibility for this.</p><p> Firm access is an important area for existing and new renewable projects, and a consultation on a new approach will be published shortly.  It is important to ensure this is facilitated by accelerated delivery of network infrastructure to provide value for consumers and generators.  This is especially the case as ongoing curtailments and the operation of a tight system at a time of high wholesale prices is driving imperfections market charges significantly higher this year.  Overall, lengthy planning and permitting processes and delays in delivery of critical energy infrastructure, including generation capacity, transmission and distribution networks, and the North-South interconnector, are adding high costs and increased security of supply risks for Irish consumers as well as delaying the achievement of our decarbonisation obligations.</p><p> As an example, Wind Energy Ireland advised us in March last that there were in excess of 1,200 MW worth of wind projects in the planning system, more than 500 MW of which had been in planning since 2020 or before.  We were further advised at that time that in excess of 600 MW worth of battery storage was in the planning process.  We will need this infrastructure to support security, sustainability and competitiveness for Irish customers.</p><p> It is clear that, given the scale of the infrastructure delivery required over the short term, we will need a change in the planning process and the resources allocated to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to expedite projects through the planning process.  We will also require the support of this committee and the Government to ensure delivery.  For example, the North-South interconnector, which is vital for security of supply, has not yet commenced construction, despite having full planning permissions in place in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p> As we discussed electricity security at length with the committee on 30 August, I will briefly mention gas security in light of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.  While Ireland is less dependent on Russian gas than other member states, it is important we play our part this winter and in the following winters by reducing our use of gas and electricity.  The CRU is working on a range of such measures, including through our network tariff decision.  Our objective to incentivise demand reduction at peak times and times of low renewable generation, which may also cause system stress, is aligned with the new EU proposals on emergency interventions to address high energy prices.  Such measures will also support our decarbonisation goals. </p><p> As the EU moves away from reliance on Russian gas supplies and develops new supply sources, it is also critical that Ireland enhances our security of gas supply.  This is particularly important given the key role of gas in electricity security of supply.  We welcome the publication of the Department's energy security review in this regard.</p><p> In relation to the CRU's people and organisational capacity, we are currently recruiting to expand our team to address some of the new requirements of the climate action plan and clean energy package while prioritising the use of our resources for the energy crisis in the short term.  The CRU notes that the committee has forwarded other topics for discussion and has included, as an appendix, the most recent and relevant historical data concerning domestic customers' debt and disconnections.</p><p>We are also happy to discuss the other topics highlighted by members, including demand management and the European response to demand reduction. </p></speech>

I ask members to indicate, if they have not done so already, if they wish to ask questions.  I propose that members have two minutes each to ask questions in the first round.  We will have a second and third round as necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#F00300"><p>I welcome representatives of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and thank them for coming before the committee again.  I have a number of questions.  First, I welcome the information provided by the CRU in relation to domestic and non-domestic disconnections and the moratorium we have discussed previously at this committee, including the new suite of consumer protection measures that have been introduced until the end of March.  This suite of measures is welcome, particularly given it was raised in the media last night as if it did not exist, despite being discussed and welcomed in the Chamber.  It is important we reiterate that to give confidence to people who might find themselves in difficulties this winter, notwithstanding anything that might be announced in the budget next week.</p> <p>  I also welcome the work the CRU is doing in rolling out the negative public service obligation, PSO, levy, which was announced by Government some weeks or months ago.  This will go some way to alleviating the pressures.  The one thing I want to focus on in relation to consumer ability to pay is the view the CRU may have on standing charges.  This has been raised in this committee previously.  I want to know whether the CRU has the legislative framework with which to address these charges and by address I mean lower.  I raise this on behalf of the many constituents who have been in touch with me because it is an increasingly large issue.  The variances between suppliers, for instance, can be quite significant.  I would welcome the views of the CRU on this issue. </p> <p>  I have two further questions.  Should the committee be concerned about the exists from the market particularly by Panda Power and other suppliers.  I understand a number of others have exited this year already.  Is this something we need to be concerned about?  Does the commission know why that exit took place?</p> <p>  Regarding the comments on safety regulation, and of course that is something we should all be concerned about, I am assuming the safety regulation to which the CRU has referred is not included in any legislation either passed by or before the Oireachtas?  I refer specifically to regulations that come under the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA.  Does the CRU have knowledge of other jurisdictions within the European Union which have brought regulations in or is there a European example that could be provided to the committee?  That would be rather helpful.  </p></speech>

I will start and will then hand over to my colleagues.  In terms of Panda Power and the supplier of last resort, it is unfortunate for customers that we are losing suppliers in the energy market at the moment.  It is a sign of the intense pressure the energy sector is under.  We have never had a supplier of last resort event in Ireland prior to this.  They can be common.  There have been quite a number in the UK over the last number of years and I think in the range of 30 in the last year.  We have seen these events happen across Europe because the challenge for suppliers is that they are also facing these really high and volatile energy prices.  Suppliers have to go out and spend more money to hedge for their customers, to post collateral to buy gas and electricity.  It is putting pressure on a number of the smaller suppliers in the market, Panda Power being the latest one.  That is broadly what Panda Power has told us in terms of it decision to exit the market.  That is why we have a supplier of last resort process.  It is in place through legislation and then through processes we have developed with the network operators and suppliers of last resort to ensure that where this happens there is protection for customers and security of supply in that they will be automatically transferred to a supplier of last resort with no discontinuity in supply.</p><p>We have done this to ensure that, where such a situation arises, there is protection for customers and security in their supply, in that they will automatically be transferred to a supplier of last resort with no discontinuity in supply.  Overall, it is not good for competition because the more suppliers we have actively competing in various ways and offering different types of products to customers, the better it is for customers.  We continue to work with all suppliers in the market.  We will continue to ensure that, at the end of this crisis, we will have a competitive market that delivers value and choice for customers.</p><p> I might ask Ms Trant to address some of the other points that the Deputy raised, after which Dr. McGowan will discuss the offshore safety regime.</p></speech>

We do not have the legal remit to investigate the standing charge.  We can ask for information.  Any review of the standing charge or the commodity price would effectively be price regulation, but we do not have that remit.  We would only do that in the best interests of the consumer, but we do not have the legislative ability to do that right now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.237" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen Trant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#G00600"><p>It is not.  Certain conditions would be put in place before it would be regulated again.  We can do it with one of the large suppliers, that being, a part of the ESB Group.</p> <p>  For a customer, the standing charge is based on the estimated annual bill and depends on what way the supplier has distributed costs.  For example, the supplier might have a higher commodity charge and lower standing charge or a higher standing charge and lower commodity charge.  For the customer, the best way to deal with the matter is to go to the switching websites and put in his or her usage figure to see what products suit him or her the best.  That is what we are telling customers to do.  However, we do not have the ability to investigate the standing charge in that level of detail or to regulate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#G00700"><p>Regarding the Deputy's question on offshore safety regulation, the best example is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway, which regulates the safety of offshore hydrocarbon facilities in Norway like we do in Ireland at Corrib and, previously, Kinsale.  The Petroleum Safety Authority Norway started a project, based on legislation, in 2020 to determine an appropriate safety regime for offshore renewables.</p> <p>  The matter is being examined more widely across Europe.  For example, the Health and Safety Executive in Great Britain has begun work on advising offshore renewable firms as to what a safety regime might look like.  It has been interacting with them in advance of legislation being introduced.</p> <p>  We are members of various safety bodies, the most relevant in this case being the North Sea Offshore Authorities Forum, NSOAF, whose members are safety regulators that are involved one way or another in hydrocarbons in the North Sea.  The NSOAF has established an offshore renewables safety working group to begin examining best practice.</p> <p>  Currently, we do not have a statute in place that identifies who is responsible for the regulation of this new sector in terms of major accident hazards.  Its hazards are different than those in the hydrocarbon sector.  Obviously, there are no hydrocarbons involved, but collisions, fires and other hazards can still occur on these installations.  As such, it is important that there be a safety regime.  Our perspective is that the priority should be to identify and put in place a safety regime and to identify who carries that out.  We are agnostic in the latter respect.  We have experience from the offshore hydrocarbon sector, so it is something that we would be equipped to do, but a statutory framework would be needed in order for that type of work to begin.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have knowledge of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife MacEvilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#H00200"><p>There can be different approaches to this throughout the EU.  My understanding is that not every jurisdiction necessarily has a fixed element of the charge.  Some go with pure per-unit rates.  In Ireland it has been traditional to have a standing charge-type arrangement because networks tend to be a higher proportion of the bill.  The UK also tends to have a standing charge arrangement as part of the billing.  The regulatory regimes vary from member state to member state.  In general, the EU has advocated for no regulation of price.  Obviously, different approaches are being taken now given the very high and volatile energy prices.  We may not, therefore, be fully up to date on where that is at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#H00300"><p>I thank the witnesses very much for their attendance.  To pick up on the issue of standing charges, the Minister for Finance stated yesterday that the energy companies must justify those standing charge increases.  I raised questions with the Minister previously regarding standing charges and he pointed to the CRU.  We heard today from the commission that it does not have responsibility in that regard.  To whom exactly are the energy companies accountable for these increases in standing charges?  To whom might they justify those increases?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  My second question is on the PSO.  In its opening statement, the commission stated it is working with industry to provide the negative PSO levy to customers.  Is it not the case that 85% of our renewables are under the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, scheme and 15% are under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, with an opportunity to claw back that PSO?  Is there any exploration, investigation or pursuit of a clawback with the significant number of renewables on the REFIT scheme because, obviously, that might return?</p> <p>  Separately, has the CRU explored or considered a ban on low usage charges?  Has it considered proposals in relation to the cheapest available tariff being available as standard, as opposed to just those vulnerable customers?  I acknowledge the CRU provided additional information for the committee.  Within any of that, however, is there an assessment of self-disconnection?  We hear from agencies that it is a matter of significant concern as we head into this winter.  Does the CRU have any evidence?  I thank the representatives from the CRU for the update on disconnections more generally.</p></speech>

On the PSO levy rebate, I am not sure whether I can confirm the exact percentages.</p></speech>

The PSO levy rebate is made-up of two elements.  One is that it will be clawed back from REFIT suppliers that were overpaid in a previous period.  We estimated that the price they would earn on the market would be at a certain level, which, if I recall, was around the &euro;50 per MWh rate.  As it turned out, prices started increasing, so they actually earned more from the market in that year because we operate on the basis of estimating.  The first part of the PSO clawback is from those REFIT holders that earned more on the market than was estimated at the time.  We will, therefore, be taking back those excess revenues because they went beyond what was permitted under their-----</p></speech>

When we were setting the PSO levy for this current period, it would have been the full year or two years ago, and we look at this year gone by when we are doing next year's PSO levy.</p><p>That is a constant part of the PSO levy calculation cycle.  There is an estimation forward and a look back to see what was actually earned and to make sure that nobody earned more than they were entitled to or, indeed, less.  There are sometimes corrections in the other direction.  Regarding RES, there is a different approach to the payment of support for renewables.  It is seen as a two-way contract in which, once the price suppliers earn on the market goes above a certain level, that will automatically be clawed back.  That is a feature of the design that has been built into our PSO levy calculations and will be in the future.</p><p> Separate from that, the Deputy is probably aware that work is going on at EU level.  The new EU regulation I mentioned is where the EU as a whole is looking at setting a reference price for companies that are generating on the market, which are being paid the higher prices but are not facing the higher costs gas generators are.  That is referred to as an inframarginal rent cap.  Again separate from the PSO levy, assuming that package is implemented or accepted through the EU processes, we will be implementing something of a similar nature in Ireland.</p></speech>

Ireland has a high level of low usage, which we understand relates mainly to holiday homes.  It is important to note that where people have holiday homes, even where they may not be using a lot of electricity, we support those homes through the provision of electricity networks that are there to ensure there is sufficient power whenever they use those homes.  It is right that people pay a fair share towards the cost of networks.  From the suppliers' point of view, the low usage charge in some cases relates to the fact they have costs in serving those customers, even when such customers are not necessarily using the charge.  We have not looked at that as a specific area of concern at this point.</p> <p>  On the cheapest available tariff being available as standard, we looked at what the best options are.  As the Deputy knows, the way competition tends to work for domestic customers is that suppliers have a standard charge and they then offer discounts to attract new customers.  They will often offer those same discounts to existing customers who sign up for an additional year or who avail of things such as paying by direct debit or getting paperless bills.  We think that is a useful part of competition in the electricity sector.  If suppliers are asked to provide those discounts to all customers regardless of whether they have lower costs, such as direct debit or paperless billing, then ultimately everyone is paying the same charge, there is very little competition and everyone is paying a slightly higher charge.</p> <p>  It is really about who we want to protect the most.  The people we focused on, through our current consumer protection measures, are vulnerable customers and customers on financial hardship prepayment meters because we believe they are the ones where we need to target the most support.  We are also asking suppliers to make it clearer to their existing loyal customers that discounts are available for them, especially if they are willing to commit for an extra year or a period of the suppliers' choice.</p> <p>  We have looked at self-disconnection and tried to get some figures on it.  Ms Trant will pick that up.</p></speech>

Normally, this is the case in the prepayment sector.  There are various reasons that someone might not vend or put credit into the meter for a period.  As a result, it is very difficult to get that kind of information.  The sophistication is just not there on the meters.  In time we will have smart meter pay-as-you-go options that may be able to give us some more information we can drill down into, but at the minute they does not exist.  Some of the more recent meters, say, those from the prepayment providers, are slightly more sophisticated, but they will still do not provide any information that we can verify or stand over.  There is anecdotal evidence that people are self-disconnecting.  When we deal with the NGOs, they say it is for various reasons.  It may be a lifestyle choice or the person may leave the premises.  It is something that we will continue to monitor.  We will look for information where we can and verify it.</p></speech>

There is the lifestyle choice prepay, which is offered as a choice, and there are the financial hardship meters.  We do survey prepayment customers as part of our annual consumer survey, but that tends to focus on consumer satisfaction.  There are reasonably high levels of consumer satisfaction with those products because people like to avoid both bills and the build-up of debt.  That is what we are getting from those surveys, rather than granular information on self-disconnection.</p></speech>

They have stated that there are no long patterns of self-disconnection.  There is not any trend that they can pick up on.

It will probably be a challenge increasingly this winter because the rates are higher and customers' credit will last for less time than they would have been used to previously.  We are concerned about this.  That is why we asked that the customers on the financial hardship meters be on the lowest rate.  We have reduced the level of debt repayment on the top-ups in order that the top-ups will last longer.  One of the other measures we have introduced relates to gas.  Previously, there was a charge if a customer wanted to switch away from using a prepayment meter.  We have removed that charge.  What we will be saying is that if customers find that they are on this product, it does not suit them and they are in difficulty, they can switch to a non-prepay option free of charge if they are on a financial hardship meter.</p></speech>

I have two questions; possibly three, if time allows.  I would appreciate as quick and succinct answers as possible to the two questions.  Reference was made to protecting consumers.  That is what I would like to focus on at the outset.  At the weekend we saw companies reporting six-monthly profits of almost &euro;400 million.</p><p>Consumers, both domestic and business, are experiencing the biggest hikes in energy prices in my memory, if not in living memory but I do not see any recommendations from the CRU on ways to curb or regulate those profits to the benefit of consumers.  There are recommendations that will impact energy companies including extending moratorium periods for disconnections and extending debt repayment periods and while these amount to regulation of energy companies, surely we should see recommendations that go further.  It is very hard for us to justify the use of six-month profits of around &euro;400 million for future investment in infrastructure.  Various arguments have been made in defence of that but we cannot justify it when consumers are at their wits' end, struggling and worried about repayments.  I ask the CRU representatives to comment on that.  There are no recommendations like capping unit prices or other measures that would have a real impact on consumers' bills.  The CRU has a role in protecting consumers and regulating energy companies in that context.  </p></speech>

Ironically, that announcement happened in the same week that Panda Power exited the market which highlights the fact we have some suppliers that are unable to continue while other larger companies, including ESB generation and ESB Networks, are making profits.  That is why the EU is stepping in with a new package which aims to limit the profits of generators, particularly those that are not facing the higher cost of buying gas on international markets, that is, those generators that have renewables and other technologies within their portfolios that are earning the higher prices but are not facing the higher costs.</p> <p>  We do not have anything in our regulatory toolbox to deal with that.  It is being tackled at a broader, EU level-----</p></speech>

The EU has recommended a windfall tax on the low-carbon, renewable energy companies.  Clearly the EU has seen an opportunity there to intervene in the market.  However, there do not seem to be any recommendations from the CRU that would directly impact things like the unit price, which would have a direct impact on utility bills.  Why does the CRU not have that regulatory authority?</p></speech>

That is tackled in the EU set of proposals or draft regulation and we believe that is the right way to approach it.  We also note that the Government has suggested taking a windfall profit and providing that benefit to all customers in Ireland and we would support that.  There are other means of tackling the issue that the Deputy has raised which are not necessarily for individual regulators to develop but which the EU has said need to be tackled across the Union on a consistent basis.  That is where those measures are being developed.</p></speech>

Reference is made to the different options around security of supply, including battery storage.  Is there an opportunity in the very short term to procure battery storage for public buildings?  I am thinking of public hospitals in particular.  Cork University Hospital, CUH, has always had a really good approach to energy and has tried to be as sustainable and green as possible but it is still a significant energy user in the Cork region.  The hospital would have peak-time levels of usage almost throughout the day.  It has been suggested that we could procure battery storage.</p><p>That battery storage would be acquired in off-peak times and distributed during peak hours of 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. or whatever it is.  I have heard this could be done in a place like Cork University Hospital, CUH, for around &euro;1 million.  It sounds like a lot but in terms of preventing potential electricity supply issues during winter, it is something we have to look at.  If on a wider scale across the health sector and HSE you can procure battery storage, charge the batteries off peak and distribute them during peak hours, it would take massive pressure off the grid during peak hours.  Has that been looked at?  Could it be recommended?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Melvin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#M00200"><p>Under the national emergency security framework, the public sector is being asked to take the lead in many of the responses, and peak reduction is one of the key responses.  Also, in the regulation currently making its way through the European Commission formation process, one of the proposals is to seek to procure demand reduction from entities.  For example, a university hospital may participate in this and, if it were to win the competition, would be paid for the reduction it provides at peak times.  There is a desire for the public sector to take a lead in this and, assuming that regulation makes its way into law, an outcome of that would be a proposal or mechanism whereby people would compete to provide reductions.  That could provide the revenues necessary for, in the case the Deputy described, battery storage.</p> <p>  In terms of security of supply, hospitals tend to have backup generation on site.  I engaged with HSE representatives last week.  They also tend to have backup batteries on sensitive equipment to protect it from voltage surges.  Rather than for the purposes the Deputy described, it is for continuity purposes and protection of the equipment.  </p></speech>

There should be a State strategy for the provision of battery storage in public buildings.  I used hospitals as an example because of the nature of their work.  Reducing the temperature to 19&deg;C, etc., will not work in every public building.  This technology is there but a big issue is if it costs &euro;1 million, then procurement could take months.  We are at the end of September so a strategy and mechanism for expediting the roll-out of such technology is what I am talking about.</p><p>Rolling it out in areas where there is a lot of usage, and I mentioned Cork University Hospital being a big user in the Cork area, could take a whole lot of pressure off demand during those peak hours and avoid potential blackouts.</p></speech>

They are and will be an even more vital part of the energy system as we move forward.</p> <p>  We typically run annual capacity remuneration auctions, but we also run on a T-4 basis, which means four years out from when it is required.  We also run T-1 options.  Typically, batteries would compete in that because they can actually deliver in that sort of timescale.  The mechanisms are there for the batteries and I believe the results show for themselves that hundreds of megawatts of batteries have come onto the system.  EirGrid is now looking at how it can use them really intelligently over the peak period.  Rather than taking a whole load of two-hour batteries they are daisy-chaining them so they can use them for four hours, that is, putting them into two packs and using for a longer period.  They get better value over peak periods out of that.</p> <p>  Absolutely there is a role for batteries.  I would say there is a clear route to market for batteries.  It would depend on the individual circumstances of the entity that wants to install batteries as to whether it has a commercial case, but there is definitely a route to market for commercial batteries, as is evidenced by the fact that we have now have hundreds of megawatts, and more in the pipeline. </p></speech>

More and more there is a case for smaller scale batteries, almost domestic and business scale, that would probably require a commercial case related to the individual location or site.  People with, for example, solar PV may find that it is more beneficial for them to charge a battery and use it at peak times than it is to export, depending on how they are set up and how their business or their home operates.  Again, this is probably more the commercial case for the individual location at that level.</p></speech>

It seems slightly counterintuitive to what the witnesses are saying that it is a very good way of shaving peaks.  I believe the domestic grant is gone.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  The point was raised, which we have heard on a number of occasions, on the delay in getting through critical infrastructure.  I am interested to hear what specific recommendations the witnesses would have for the committee on how that system can be improved.  Where is it falling down?  As we set out ambitions, as we have done for offshore and so on, it is a concern if this system continues to fail.</p> <p>  The commission is the regulator.  Does it not have more power than it is exercising to get demand management into the system through the entities it regulates?  For example, with electric vehicle, EV, charges the commission could seek to move our whole taxi fleet to EVs.  The public service vehicle could be much more efficient to run.  The commission could promote high utilisation and lower costs compared with each of us having our own car in our driveway and so on.  To what extent is the commission leveraging what it could do?  Is it leveraging, for example, status yellow weather warnings?  If we know that there is going to be cold weather of between 5&deg;C and 7&deg;C tonight with no wind should the commission not be out there saying that now is the time to trigger these changes?  Consider smart meters for example.  As I understand it, and maybe the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong, smart meters are not being utilised to their full extent because of GDPR objections to utilising them.</p><p>Surely in an energy crisis we can find a way to make use of smart meters, of which we now have 1 million - nearly half of all homes - to help us utilise this technology we have put in at very considerable expense.  It appears we are not utilising it.  I could go on with examples of things we could be trying to do that are relatively low cost and low-hanging fruit.  It seems to me that the witnesses are in a pivotal position to tell the regulated entities that they need to adopt this as part of the expectations of what they are doing.  It does seem to me that that is not happening.</p><p> To go back to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, I could imagine an energy-saving company going into Cork University Hospital - or any other hospital - with an offer, but it would be very hard to expect the hospital to do this given all the things on its plate.  Could the CRU not mandate its regulated entities to be such energy-saving companies for some of these areas of opportunity?  As I said before on this committee, we should not waste a crisis.  Perhaps the CRU is at a pivotal point to make that switch.</p></speech>

The Attorney General had announced a review of the overall planning system and we would welcome the expedition of that.  Very specifically, there are EU regulatory requirements for expedited processes for renewable projects, given their importance.  For example, there are periods within which the entire planning process - all aspects of environmental permits and so on - must be completed in order to expedite those projects.  We welcome seeing that being transposed.  More recently, the REPowerEU package last year noted the need to expedite the connection of renewables but also the supporting grid - in other words, the necessary network infrastructure in order to not just build the renewables but connect them effectively into the network so that they can deliver the benefits for customers and that those could be considered in the overriding public interest, which is a particular route and option that could be used to expedite planning.  Those are the kinds of areas that we think are worth considering, which are set out in the EU regulatory toolbox and that might support expedited planning processes.  We have also called out the need to support the local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure they have sufficient staff, inspectors and other resources to expedite the projects.  They are independent agencies that have to go through thorough processes, which they must ensure are robust, but they must have the resources to do it more quickly so that the projects that can be delivered can be delivered more quickly.  That is our view on the planning side.  It is about process and resources.</p> <p>  In terms of the demand side, generally I agree that we are at the very start of looking at what demand side can deliver.  For a system that has an 80% renewables target and, further, would be looking to be a zero-carbon electricity system in time, it is imperative that we optimise demand side as part of our future network.  We must change our thinking on how we plan electricity systems and incorporate demand side more effectively.</p></speech>

It is opt-in.  The provision of data is opt-in.  Ms Trant will talk about the improvements we are making to data accessibility for customers with smart meters.  We are at the start but measures are already in place which we will leverage more to bring this to the forefront of planning.  The new EU regulation that I have mentioned calls out the need not just to do more but also mandatory proposals for overall demand reduction, demand reduction at peak and at times of system stress.  We consulted on these kinds of measures for our network tariff proposals.  Those propose a different approach to how we incentivise that activity.  We are reviewing them in light of the EU proposals.  Those are the objectives and goals.  Does Mr. Melvin want to address demand-side units?</p></speech>

Removing an obstacle does not necessarily mean that the industry will take the removal of the obstacle as an opportunity to then participate.  We cannot mandate industry to participate in the demand-side, in a general sense.  All we can do is seek to remove obstacles.</p> <p>  Another aspect of the Deputy's question refers to work under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, more than the CRU.  Energy supply companies have obligations under a European directive from 2012 or 2014 to offer energy saving advice and engagement with their end customers.  This is done through SEAI's part of the energy sphere rather than us.  On the matter of accepting that demand comes and is not expected to be flexible, a significant change is required in the energy industry and among the demand customers.  The European regulation that is currently being developed seeks active participation from demand side, both at peak and with reductions in demand next winter, over the whole period and especially at peak periods.  We held a consultation on the network tariffs.  There are elements which we can address, barriers we can remove and signals which we can send.  Active participation has to come from the entities and, under the GDPR rules, it has to come from individuals in their homes, who would seek to participate and use those smart meters.</p></speech>

There have been barriers to engagement from consumers.  There is an information gap.  Customers do not really know what their consumption is like and they need to be able to see that before they opt to use a smart tariff.  One area which will be developed this coming quarter is a data portal and a hub.  Customers will have what is called a push-all.  Information from smart meters will be pushed to the hub.  It will be available to customers so that they can review their consumption.  The aim is to have a dashboard and portal in order that customers have an easy, accessible way to see what they are using.  We think this will send a signal for people to engage with smart tariffs.</p><p> The other area relating to smart meters we are looking at is that ESB Networks is prioritising those with microgen capability.  Those who have microgen installed will get smart meters to push that.  Once people are aware of their consumption and not afraid to make a choice, they will engage with it.  We are also running campaigns.  They are digital at the moment, but we will be increasing them to encourage the use of smart meters and smart tariffs.  It will take time.  We think that once the data hub and data portal are up and running, it will be six to 12 months after that before we see a real uptake in smart tariffs.  It is about information; people want information before they make the choice.</p><p> There was a point about the GDPR.  What we wanted to do there was bring customers with us.  We would not be able to mandate that information to transfer.  That would be in breach of GDPR rules.  A meter point reference number, MPRN, is personal data.  Without a customer's agreement, we would not be able to do that.  There is no doubt that this has been a sensitive issue.  We need to manage that carefully for both customers and the programme.  We would prefer that customers would consent and opt to avail of smart tariffs.</p></speech>

One was on energy demand growth in this country compared with the rest of the EU.  It clearly shows that Ireland is a complete outlier in the context of energy growth demand.  That was on the argument relating to data centres.  The second was on the specifics about data centres and their connections.  I really appreciate the answer, but it raises more questions.  Rather than focus on that now, I will ask the committee to write back to Ms MacEvilly with my questions because the urgent matter we have to focus on is the energy demand for customers over the winter.</p><p>The CRU has made proposals.  Considering the scale of the crisis, what the CRU is proposing is a bit piecemeal.  That is not to be insulting.  It is probably limited, but I want to ask a few question in respect of that limitation.  If we acknowledge that there has been a complete failure in the energy market - prices have gone up when they should not have, profits were being made when they should not have been and so on - would the CRU be in a position to demand that over the winter months nobody will be disconnected and that the limited definition of what constitutes vulnerability will not apply?  In other words, there should be no disconnection over the winter months and the moratorium should be extended to all household customers and businesses, particularly small businesses.</p><p>Would it be possible to extend the moratorium to prepay meters?  Would it be possible to just say that people should not be disconnected if they fail to put money in their meters?  Would it be possible for that instruction to be given by the CRU to the various companies?</p><p>It has come to our attention in the past week that many apartment dwellers live in areas with district heating systems.  For some reason, the price per kW/h for gas for these people is at least three times higher than it would be for those of us here.  There might be a technical explanation for that but these customers cannot switch.  They cannot go onto <i>bonkers.ie </i>and switch around different companies because they live in buildings that are connected to district heating systems.  The committee is constantly told that this is the future, that district heating is good for the environment and so on.</p><p>However, they are being left in a very difficult position.  They cannot switch and are being charged more than anybody else.  Can we find some way of putting them on a moratorium?  When we look at the figures 250,000 people are in arrears for electricity and 148,000 households are in arrears already for gas bills.  So this is a really serious crisis which we know and I argue that not enough is being done and that the extension of the moratorium must apply to everybody.  In particular, we must consider what is happening with district heating systems.  I am also told that the CRU does not regulate district heating companies.  If not, why not?  I ask because if there is no regulation then these over-the-top measures are imposed on people who live within them and if they are the future then where are we going?</p><p> On the question of vulnerability, we looked up the definition which showed two things.  One, is where people are dependent on energy for disability equipment etc.  The other day a 78-year-old person told me that she has stopped using her electric chair on her stairs because she is worried about using electricity.  So she needs to register as vulnerable but does not realise that and people who use electric chairs, hoists or special equipment for their children think that if they turn on anything they will be in trouble.  Dependency is definitely vulnerable.  The other definition for vulnerability concerns age, mental health and all the rest.  Is it not true to say that the definition for vulnerability could be extended way beyond those two restricted areas given the current crisis?</p><p> Lastly, can the CRU instruct all providers to put everybody on the most beneficial tariff rather than limiting it to only the vulnerable?  Is it possible for the CRU to ask all of the suppliers to give people all of the most beneficial tariffs, ensure there are no disconnections over the winter and, in particular, let us consider prepaid and district heating?</p></speech>

The Deputy should forward any further question.  Understanding more about data centre demand is something that we ourselves also want to put some effort into and we are happy to engage with her on that.</p> <p>  In terms of winter protections, I agree with the Deputy that it is just one small part of what needs to be done to support customers.  On its own it might be beneficial but we also need to consider the wider suite of social welfare and other Government supports that will be needed to assist customers in very difficult circumstances this winter.</p> <p>  The Deputy has raised some really good points about the different definitions and I will step through them.  First, the most critical group is the vulnerable customers who are reliant on medically assistive devices whether it is assistive living, oxygen condensers or other medical devices.  Those customers can never be disconnected for reasons of non-payment.  We need to get that message out there because people should absolutely not avoid using assistive technology in their homes because they are afraid of their bill.  We need more of those customers registered as vulnerable customers and that is one of the targets of our information campaigns.  That is a really important protection and we do not think that enough people are aware of it.  Maybe the people who are in those situations might not think of themselves as that vulnerable but their family members might recognise that these are people who would benefit from that protection and should be registered.</p> <p>  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, the next level of vulnerability are those who, because of reasons of age or health, might be particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter.  What we have done for those people is extend the definition of winter as far as it can go.  Can Ms Trant confirm whether it is from October to March?</p></speech>

We got important feedback to the effect that because suppliers were not engaging with customers in a disconnection conversation, if you like, many customers stopped paying and got themselves into considerable difficulty with debt.  We are seeing the outcome of that now.  Our customer care team is dealing with some difficult cases.  It is about balance.  Nobody wants disconnections.  The process is there not to have a disconnection at the end of it but to have an engaging customer who is still working with the supplier, entering a payment plan or finding an option that helps them to retain their supply.  We will monitor that over the winter.  That is why we are stepping up our monitoring of what is happening.  There have been quite low levels of disconnection since the moratorium for Covid was lifted.  We will continue monitoring the situation to try to understand what we are seeing.  The worst thing that could happen for customers is that they stop engaging, stop paying and get into a debt situation that is unmanageable for them.  That is the balance we are trying to strike.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the most beneficial tariff.  We focus that protection on customers who are facing financial hardship and using prepayment meters.  We focus on vulnerable customers.  If that beneficial tariff is extended to everybody, the price will increase for everybody.  We want to focus on the customers with the most need.</p></speech>

Those suppliers and generators are often not the same companies.  Some of them are and some are not.  That is why we have been trying to be careful to ensure our interventions do not drive suppliers out of businesses because customers need suppliers to be there, buying and providing the energy.  At the same time, we are supporting the interventions of the EU Commission in tackling that windfall and recycling it to the benefit of customers.  It is a complex picture.  That is the balance we have reached.</p> <p>  I will pass to Dr. McGowan on the question about district heating.</p></speech>

Unlike in the gas and electricity sectors, there is no customer protection framework or economic regulatory framework.  Having said that, the climate action plan contains an ambitious target for district heating.  In anticipation of that, a steering group has been established.  Consideration is being given to what an economic regulatory framework might look like.  In the meantime, the elements of the existing renewable energy directive and other legislation at EU level are being transposed and, as part of that, the CRU is being given some functions in the regulation of district heating.  Those functions have not kicked in yet so we have no function as of now.</p> <p>  The customers to whom the Deputy has spoken are not gas customers but heat customers.  The gas customer is the person who buys the gas and burns it to create the heat that is then sold on.  Those customers do not have any consumer protection under the current regulatory framework we operate.  The company that buys the gas has protection, and if it has an issue with its contract and feels the supplier has not dealt with it fairly, it can bring a complaint to the CRU.  Unfortunately, we have no statutory function in respect of individual houses that buy heat.  I hope that will be addressed as part of the new district heating regulatory framework that will be put in place.</p></speech>

That is as a result of what exactly.  How does that happen?  Is it just because the CRU has no regulation over it and because of that the companies can do what they want?</p></speech>

However, the price of gas on the international market is nearly ten times what it was a few years ago.  The input costs of the company that takes the gas, burns it and produces heat have gone way up.  I surmise that they are passing that charge onto their heat customers.  It is possible that some of these customers of these heat companies have seen huge increases in their gas costs, given the level of gas prices on the international markets.</p></speech>

One of the things that we are at pains to point out is that in looking at district heating, we first look at what district heating is and which customers are captured by the definition of district heating.  That is an important point that needs to be addressed.  Second, those customers should be afforded the level of protection that is equivalent to the sorts of protections that are in place for electricity and gas customers.  That is what we advocate for and what we are working towards in our deliberations in establishing a new framework for district heating.  However, it just does not exist at this moment.</p></speech>

I would imagine that over a short period of months or a small number of years that the whole system would be in place.  In the meantime, it is a matter of what the Government wishes to invest into delivering new district heating schemes, some of which are already under way.</p> <p>  In terms of the regulatory framework, it is my expectation that there would be a report available with a recommendation on how this should be looked at before the end of the year. </p></speech>

I find it staggering that there is no regulation of district heating because it is not new.  We have had district heating systems for decades, going back to social housing schemes.  Dr. McGowan is saying that it is clearly not the role of the CRU, which has not been given the powers to regulate.  That is something that the Oireachtas should pick up because it seems that if the energy supplier in any scheme goes belly-up and cannot pay the gas prices, then many people could be without heat.  They are very vulnerable.</p> <p>   I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and call on Senator Dooley next.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#T02000"><p>I welcome the regulator once again.  I want to concentrate on the issue of security of supply.  There was a report on "Morning Ireland" this morning by the political editor, David Murphy, who seems to have access to a freedom of information, FOI, request from the IDA, which showed a level of concern about the inability of some of the data centres to connect to the grid based on a direction from CRU and the impact that had had on the sentiment within foreign direct investment.  While we rightly have to concern ourselves with the vulnerability of citizens of the State at every possible opportunity, we also have to ensure that we are in a position to provide gainful employment for people.</p><p>Anything like the information that would seem to emanate from that report or through that freedom of information is concerning to me and to many people because it somehow sets a bad image of the country.  We have done well at attracting continuous investment from outside and that has benefited our citizens and State.</p><p> I have to go back to this issue of the vulnerability and security of supply.  It is not personal towards anyone but I wonder if the witnesses have done any analysis of the CRU.  Do the witnesses believe the CRU is fit for purpose in light of what has happened?  The CRU has the statutory responsibility and it was indicated in the opening statement that it intends to broaden its remit and employ more people.  Is it on foot of some analysis the CRU has done that it needs to broaden its work?  When something goes wrong, it is easy to have the benefit of hindsight and make judgements, but has the CRU done any critical analysis of how we have ended up in the situation we are in with the way those auctions were run, which we talked about the previous day?  We can say there were planning and regulatory issues but did the CRU look into its own heart, procedures and processes?  In doing so, will the witnesses talk to us a little bit about that?  I do not want to be critical but the way the CRU is constituted, it is answerable to this committee and this committee only.  Regardless of whether that is good or bad, it places a certain encumbrance on us in terms of holding the CRU to account.  Maybe it would suit us if the CRU was accountable to the Government.  Then we could be more critical of it and less critical of ourselves, but we have that responsibility.  I want to tease through the idea of the CRU being fit for purpose a bit more.  That is not a reflection on any individual but on the overall architecture of what the CRU is.  The CRU did not set it up either; it was set out in statute.  It would be helpful if the witnesses would like to comment on that.</p></speech>

We look at ourselves closely and you have to learn from when things are not going well.  You have to make sure you understand where the challenges arose so that you can fix the problems.  I will ask Mr. Melvin to talk about the EY report shortly, but one of the things we did was to recognise that we needed not just to expand in numbers to accept new roles and responsibilities but also to increase our internal capacity of challenge and analysis.  When we asked for additional staff, it included many new areas like offshore energy generation and the strategic impact of same in anticipation of new functions coming in.  We also looked to enhance the numbers and capability we have internally to ensure, from a strategic perspective, we are better fit to look at the enormous challenges that lie ahead of us.</p> <p>  We have a sector that is in incredible transition, with decarbonisation, security of supply and cost challenges all coming to a head.  We asked for and were fortunate to receive support for 73 additional staff.  Some of those are for the new areas I mentioned but some of them are to enhance our capabilities internally.  One of the areas where we want to enhance internal capability includes security of supply.  We had potentially become dependent on third parties giving us information and we probably need more of an ability to assess critically and come to views on that information ourselves.  That is the area and that would have then been highlighted in the EY report about how to apply critical assessment to some of those challenging issues ahead of us.</p></speech>

I want to be clear that the security of supply concerns we have predate the Russian invasion of Ukraine and they are not unique.  Other entities and countries across Europe see security of supply concerns for entirely different reasons.</p><p>France has security of supply concerns with regard to nuclear.  Norway has security of supply concerns this year with regard to low water levels for hydro.  Finland and Sweden have security of supply concerns linked to nuclear.  None of that is to say that the capacity remuneration mechanism, CRM, that we designed was perfectly put in place, perfectly designed or perfectly operated.  The point of the EY report was to examine the design and operation of the CRM to see how it might be made better.  Clearly that report is in the public domain.</p><p> The single electricity market, SEM, committee has a call for evidence whereby we are calling on industry and any participants that wish to respond to respond.  It is a comprehensive and thorough external examination of the CRM.  I think it is unflinching in its recommendations and in its examination.  As the Senator said, no one has hindsight in advance.  I think it is a thorough, impartial and unflinching examination.</p><p> As for the many complex issues we need to deal with, the last time we were here, the Senator asked about planning permissions as a requirement to enter the capacity auctions.  There is a balance to be struck in all these decisions.  For example, if there are too many barriers to get into the auctions, people will say there is a barrier to entry and we are keeping out, for example, new entrants.  Other people may then say there are not enough pre-qualification requirements.  Either way, there is no definite right or wrong answer in advance and balances must be struck.</p><p> In any complex mechanism like this capacity remuneration mechanism, people will have different opinions, with some suggesting X and others suggesting Y.  It is the job of the regulators, both North and South, in this case the single electricity market committee, to seek to strike those balances.  Some of those balances work well and some, with hindsight, could have been done differently.  The point of this review is to take stock of where we are now.  It is a very thorough review and we welcome anyone's comments on it.  If I say any more, I will be repeating myself.</p></speech>

I have seen the documentation and it is very clear.  The documentation was provided to the CRU.  It sets out a very clear pathway to how they might be able to participate and the encumbrances that would prevent them.  The documentation that was produced in 2014 and 2015 charted what happened.  I go back to what I said the last day about the way in which the criteria allowed the ESB to participate.  I have not suggested it did anything wrong.  It saw what was in front of it.  It cornered a big slice of the market and failed to deliver.  I find that hard.  I have said this to people in the ESB.  I have great regard for what the ESB has done over the years, both internationally and domestically.  It is a wonderful company.  I find it hard to accept it has failed in such a spectacular way, although I must take its word for it.</p> <p>  Those in the CRU are in a regulatory position and have a different role.  The ESB pays its fine and moves things on.  The CRU goes back with its T-3 auction and the bid goes from &euro;46,000 or &euro;47,000 per megawatt to &euro;138,000 within a very short period.  I believe that warrants deeper investigation by the CRU.  In fairness to the witnesses from the CRU, on the last day they asked me to provide the evidence or documentation I had.  Sometimes it requires a regulatory authority to put all the bits and bobs together.  If it starts to quack like a duck and walk like a duck, maybe it is a duck.  Maybe the ESB has not done anything other than play the market as it was, but the market regulator has a responsibility.</p><p>I am not trying to apportion blame but it would be helpful if, at some point, we could get all of this out there to say what happened, even if it had not been the intention.  Candour would be helpful, and we will be asking the same of the ESB in due course.  Many people invested with goodwill to try to be part of those new entrants, and candour would benefit everybody.  Many of them lost out and have left the scene, so there are problems there.  If the commission could analyse that further, that would be helpful.</p></speech>

That is laid out there and clear for all to see.  Every consultation we carry out attracts differing views from industry.  Some entities, as I said earlier, will ask for certain items, while other entities will say they are the wrong items and identify a different approach we should take.  Those responses can be seen on our website and we conduct our consultations in public.  One could pick any decision we make, look back on it in time and find someone who was against the decision the regulator made; that is almost inevitable.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, a significant number of what I would call non-incumbents have come in through the capacity market, some of which were entities that would have engaged with us.  For example, there are new entrants in both the Dublin region and the broader region totalling 1,450 MW of name-plate non-incumbent people.  As we spoke about at the previous meeting, we have a market-monitoring unit and if it receives complaints, it will follow up on them.   We have to treat any complaints we follow up on with the strictest confidentiality, both for the complainant and for the entity against which the complaint was made.  We have received a number of complaints and we are investigating them.  That work is under way.</p></speech>

We received dozens or even hundreds of items of communication relating to the design of that capacity remuneration mechanism and we analysed all of them.  As the Senator will appreciate, we receive a wide variety of views and we try to come up with a design we think is going to work.  It is not surprising, therefore, that he will have seen views expressed that were quite trenchant on one side.  Equally, however, on the same committee website, he will see a list of all the other letters setting out equally trenchant views on the other side of the argument.  That is part of the consultation we go through to try to determine what, on balance, is the best overall design for the capacity remuneration mechanism.  As the EY report has identified, perhaps we did not get it 100% right, and now is the time to start looking at that.  That is a natural part of the evolution of a market.</p></speech>

Each one is complex and is released in what is called a drop where we take five, six or seven significant pieces of software changes, test them with market participants and then drop them into the market.  Such drops can happen once or twice per year, so it could be some time before there is a more automated system.  However, the batteries are being dispatched.  In fact, the batteries currently on the system are being dispatched for the next period in a way that generally maximises their availability during the peak time or security of supply concerns.</p></speech>

As one of the many pieces of the complicated piece of software that has to be considered over the next period of time, batteries can be dispatched and are being dispatched.  It is labour intensive on the side of the grid-scale developer and on the side of the system operator.  There are many competing elements of the software that need to be upgraded.  For grid-scale operators, the incremental cost of the manual intervention is likely to be small in the context of the overall investment.</p></speech>

Has Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, been in contact with the CRU about the former's concerns?  Much of the focus has been on grid connection.  From looking at the graph using GNI's data, though, there is exponential growth in gas demand by data centres.  The concern is that, if we are not controlling that stream, the centres' other option is diesel generation, which would blow our carbon budget out of the water.  Has GNI flagged these concerns with the commission and what action is CRU taking on them?  To reduce our dependency on gas as part of the EU's solidarity with Ukraine's war effort, we have signed up to a 15% demand reduction.</p></speech>

It flagged to us that, from the time that we put in place the new connection policy on the electricity network, which would have precluded many new projects from signing up to the electricity network, it started seeing increased requests for data centre connections to the gas network on the basis that data centres would operate their own gas-fired generation on site.  GNI flagged to us that this could create a much higher demand profile on the gas network.  We are engaging with it on what the best way of managing that is.  We are in the middle of what is called a price control, namely, the five-year network review.  We are in the middle of planning what is needed in terms of investment over the next five years.  We will clearly prioritise for GNI that new generation facilities that will provide security of supply to all customers on the island must be prioritised in terms of gas network capacity.  With GNI, we are also examining the implications of the new Government statement on data centres.</p><p>I cannot remember the wording but a concern was raised around islanded data centres, which is what we are referring to here.  We are looking at how that might be addressed.</p><p> Most importantly, our focus is first on security of supply.  We need the capacity for gas generation.  Second, we also need to look at the implications for the carbon sectoral emissions limits.  There is a point at which we have to look at what impact demand is having on those sectoral emissions limits.  There is a bit more work to be done but we are engaging with GNI on that.</p></speech>

The other issue is around demand reduction.  I have looked at what other European countries have done.  In Germany, they have asked for LED billboards to be turned off and their usage reduced to six hours per day.  The NGO in Britain, Adfree Cities, said that LED billboards can be the equivalent of from four up to 33 households, depending on the size and colour of the advertisement.  Is that something at which CRU could be looking to address our demand reduction?  Given that we have pressure on the grid at certain times, should it be part of it that those billboards go off, say, for example, between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. just to relieve pressure on the grid?  Is that something the CRU would consider?</p> <p>  We have seen two electricity suppliers go out of the market.  Electric Ireland generally follows then as the supplier of last demand.  It is trying to plan ahead.  It has to buy gas; it has a set number of customers and is doing that forward planning.  Iberdrola left the market with no gas reserves or anything and that affected 35,000 customers.  Electric Ireland had to then pick up the slack and go out into the market to buy gas.  Panda Power now has in the region of 60,000, 70,000 or 80,000 customers.  If more of these companies are going to go to the wall, what sort of stress testing are we putting in place that will not negatively impact on Electric Ireland providing the best possible value to customers, but also for those customers of last resort?</p></speech>

We are probably more focused on the voluntary or market-based demand reductions as a regulator.  Those are the kinds of areas we have been tackling through what we are looking at through network tariffs.  ESB Networks Beat the Peak scheme, for instance, which we think could really incentivise customers around reducing peak demand.  Most what we are looking at is sort of market-based or voluntary incentivisation.</p> <p>  The energy security emergency group, ESEG, of which we are part, is looking more at what additional mandatory measures could be implemented.  Those initially, at least, focus on the public sector.  We will be participating in that ourselves.  There is a real opportunity for the public sector to demonstrate leadership as well.  As a public sector as a whole we have already demonstrated that we can reduce demand.  We should generally look at all the other measures at which other member states are looking.  I do not know if any assessment has been done around the scale of savings for things like the measures the Senator called out.  We are all going to be called on this winter and, unfortunately, possibly into next winter at least, to do the maximum possible to reduce overall demand, peak demand and demand at times of system stress.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct; it is an expensive process to acquire new customers at the moment when a company has not planned for them.  Panda Power has somewhere in the range of 40,000 domestic electricity customers and a smaller number of gas customers in the region of approximately 9,000.</p> <p>  There is a period of time for customers to switch, which we think is really important.  What we plan is an orderly exit rather than a disorderedly exit where a supplier just goes out of business overnight.  That is really not the scenario we want.</p><p>We are engaging with the suppliers.  There is no indication that another supplier will follow.  That is no guarantee.  Suppliers are being pushed at present, especially the smaller ones.  The cost of acquiring those new customers at today's prices is high.  There is no mechanism for recovery yet.  We are looking at that with the suppliers of last resort but, again, the way to do that is to either socialise it across all the other electricity customers or find another mechanism to do it.  We are looking at that and it is something that has been raised.  We are also engaging with all the suppliers to understand their outlook for the next six to 18 months and potentially to stress test around that.  There are no indications at present but that is no guarantee.</p></speech>

For example, Iberdrola is a very profitable huge company in the Iberian peninsula, Spain in particular.  Is the option to look at such companies on the table?  Iberdrola walked away and left many employees out of work, in addition to leaving Electric Ireland to pick up the slack in respect of its 30,000 customers.</p></speech>

It does not exist.  That is maybe something we will have to look at.  It does not exist now but there should be some recovery mechanism in place.</p></speech>

I will return to Ms MacEvilly's response regarding the notion that putting people on the best tariff for them will increase the price, if everybody is on the best tariff.  That is what she said earlier.  How do we then ensure that everybody is on the best tariff, if she is saying that we cannot put everybody on such a tariff because it will increase the price?  That earlier response does not stack up because the CRU's entire remit, under response 22 in the framework, is to ensure that customers are on the best tariff.  How does Ms MacEvilly address that point?  Is she saying that if everybody is on the best tariff, even if they select it themselves, we will see a price increase?</p></speech>

If everybody is switched to those packages, the money available from the supplier to support the discounts has to be spread over a larger pool of people.  In any given year, a supplier will offer discounts to attract new customers.  Those discounts are paid for by the supplier.  It those discounts are allocated across the entire set of customers, those discounts will automatically be at a lower level for the entire-----</p></speech>

That can vary according to a customer's own preferences.  The most basic offer in the past was based on whether customers preferred direct debit or pay as you go, which are prepay-type choices.  Did they like paperless bills or did they prefer to get a bill?  Those were fairly basic options that customers could choose from as the best choice for themselves.</p> <p>  We will increasingly see customers thinking about time-of-use tariffs and specific tariffs that have been developed to support EV charging off-peak.</p><p>We will see tariffs that are designed around microgen export and tariffs that are designed for different sets of circumstances.  Our approach is not to say that one size fits all and that everybody has the same needs and the same preferences but rather to give customers better information and better support, and more confidence to go out there, look around at what is available from the various suppliers and pick the option that is best for them.  That is what we mean then by the best choice for a customer.</p></speech>

There can be demographic differences between the customers whose preferences are around the lower carbon options.  I do not think it is fair to say that the cost is the only issue for customers.  Customers have a range of preferences.  Some customers like pay-as-you-go options because it avoids large bills.  We see that in our customer surveys.  However, I would not say that is the best approach for every customer.  We see some customers who want green tariffs and the ability to export microgen, but that is not the best option for all customers.  That is why our preference is to support customers in making the best choice for themselves.  That will be different across a range of households.  Every family and business is different.  The main concern we have is that, at the moment, customers may be lacking information or confidence.  We have done a lot of behavioural research on the barriers preventing customers from making the choices that will benefit them most.  We are trying to remove those barriers and to give customers the information and confidence.</p></speech>

For the most part, they just want to know what is cheapest.  Ultimately, that is what most people who contact me want to know.  I was concerned at a statement that was made earlier, which was that we are just at the start of the work in relation to smart meters.  It is due for implementation by quarter 4 of this year, and the CRU is the lead organisation on that.  Is it on target to have all of this smart metering, these apps and so on and so forth, implemented on time?

There are 1 million smart meters with a lot of information that has to be transferred over onto the hub.  Those on smart tariffs will know their usage, but the rest of that cohort will not.  It will take time.  The plan has a six-month timeline.  If we take from November into early next year, that is when the 1 million customers should be able to go onto the hub and the portal and gain access to their usage.  It will be 2024 before the full roll-out of the other piece will have happened.  The technology is also changing.  There are more sophisticated meters that are going to go to customers, which will provide better information they will be able to use.  The work is on target.  The information piece is critical.  We want people to be able to access it.  They will be able to access it from November onwards, but it will not happen in 24 hours.

Following the auction in 2019 some 500 MW of capacity that was awarded did not proceed in the end.  The report is published on the Single Electricity Market, SEM, committee website and there is a call from the SEM committee for any evidence or comments that any parties might have on that.  It is an unflinching examination of the design and operation of the CRM thus far.  That is out there.  Industry bodies were consulted on the report as it went out, as were the regulators, North and South, and the Department.  It is a substantial document with clear recommendations.  The SEM committee published its initial views on some of those recommendations and issued a call for comment which closes some time in October.  Some of the recommendations are already under way or in process.  In terms of the report itself on the auction, it is out there and comments are welcome.  The SEM committee will issue a response to any comments received.</p> <p>  I am afraid I have forgotten the second part of the question-----</p></speech>

The SEM committee has a team called the market monitoring unit which monitors the market in its own right.  It is also the entity to which any complaints are directed.  Any complaints that are received are treated in the strictest confidence, both in terms of the complainants and the entity against which the complaint is made.  We have received a number of complaints regarding aspects of the operation of the CRM over a number of years and investigations are under way but I cannot really say much in regard to those at this point.</p></speech>

There is a lot of talk about empowering and protecting consumers and customers.  It appears that there are lots of measures to help people to pay for energy but there are very few measures to reduce the cost.  A constituent of mine sent me a copy of a bill yesterday for over &euro;400.  He is in receipt of disability benefit and has already cut back as much as he possibly can.  How does the CRU hope to empower him to reduce his bills when he does not even know the CRU exists?</p> <p>  On security of supply, is the CRU liaising with the HSE with regard to vulnerable customers?  Ireland has the highest rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in the OECD.  It is really important to ensure there are no huge variations in temperature for COPD patients because such variations can cause their airways to close.  We also have the highest rate of hospitalisation of COPD patients.  I am also concerned about people who rely on hoists and dialysis machines.  Has the CRU increased its level of interaction with the HSE around identifying vulnerable customers?  As already discussed, lots of those customers do not know that they are technically in the vulnerable customer category.</p><p> On standing charges, Ms Trant mentioned that the CRU does not have the legislation and it is not under its remit.  Have the witnesses discussed this with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to try to get it under their remit and see if legislation is needed, what legislation is already in place and if we could get on with that?  People would expect the CRU to be across standing charges and that such charges would have to be negotiated with it.  That is the crux of the problem.  This is the climate committee.  The only reason it exists is because we are in a climate crisis.  Suppliers are increasing standing charges in order to offset energy reduction because the increasing price will be a reduction in the amount of energy people consume.  It is vital that the Minister addresses that.  It shows the problem we have in facing the climate crisis under our current economic model.  It is only for profit.  We should never have sold the shares we sold in ESB.  It should not be for profit anymore.  We cannot just keep consuming.  That is me making a statement after asking the witnesses a question.  What do they tell that OAP on disability?  How will they empower him?</p></speech>

This is a real challenge for this winter and, unfortunately, probably for longer, given the high prices we are seeing.  We have put in place some customer protections which, as I mentioned earlier, are one part of the jigsaw that needs to be put in place to support customers during this period.  Another part is being addressed by the European Commission in its new regulation whereby the windfall gains of some generators in the market should be taken and distributed for the benefit of customers paying higher prices.  That is an important measure.</p> <p>  We are not party to it, but we understand that the Government is looking at a cost-of-living package to support customers.  We will work with it and with industry, as we did in the distribution of the electricity credit earlier this year, on any measures appropriate to the energy sector.</p> <p>  We would reflect on the ESRI report earlier this year looking at the best ways to target customers most in need, which probably include the person the Deputy spoke to earlier, in terms of their ability to manage costs through this winter.  Some pieces of the jigsaw are not in our space but we will do whatever we can.  I acknowledge this will be really difficult.</p></speech>

Before now we had communications campaigns which were largely social media-based but we are putting much more money into above-the-line advertising on radio and national newspapers.  We are really trying to get that message out there.  The Deputy is right.  We have called out the fact that there are not enough customers registered as vulnerable customers.  They are not aware of the protections in place for them.  We want more customers to be registered.  We are asking suppliers to reach out again.  They reach out to their customer base periodically.</p></speech>

It is difficult to link up.  It is one of the challenges generally.  Suppliers see a meter point registration number which may not relate to the people living in that house or their various needs.  It requires the people to put themselves forward and say they want to be registered as a vulnerable customer.</p></speech>

As I said, in general the EU regulation under which we tend to operate has been about moving away from price regulation.  I should be clear that the commission does have a role in setting the network charges that are charged to suppliers but we do not have a role in how exactly those charges are passed on to customers, any more than the unit rate charge either.  That is set by competitive markets and we do not have a role in regulating those charges.  We have not sought to gain new powers in that area.</p></speech>

People are very nervous and particularly older people who always like to pay their bills.  They pay their way and do not like to borrow.

Senator Higgins is joining us from her office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#DD00800"><p>I have a few questions building on the questions asked by Deputy Cronin.  I have another set of questions on the energy demand piece.</p> <p>  On the standing charges and the moving away from price regulation, I believe it is pretty clear that the position in the European Union is no longer about moving away from price regulation but is about much more hands-on measures on price caps and thresholds.  This is clearly what we are seeing right now from the EU.  In that regard, the standing charges piece seems to be absolutely central.  The point was made previously by Senator O'Reilly and others about why we do not have the lowest cost of default.  The witness mentioned that some prefer lower carbon options but now we know that the renewable energy or the lowest carbon options will be the lowest cost options.  It is not just a matter of preference.  We have a collective public priority to move towards the lowest carbon option and that also happens to be the lowest cost.  Why would we not put a requirement in for the lowest cost and the lowest carbon option in that regard?  This is around the transition from gas.  I am really surprised to see the key role of gas in security of supply when we know that gas has this huge price volatility.  I am aware that there is an emergency measure for gas because many people in Ireland are on gas heating, but we should look specifically at how we are helping people to transition away from that more volatile and more expensive fuel of gas and at supporting people more actively, not to just to choose, but to be supported into moving towards lower carbon options, be that individually or collectively with district heating.</p> <p>  I note that the EU directive is not just around giving back to customers.  We do not want to end up with just another subsidy to fossil fuel companies.  It is about channelling it to those who need it most.  It may well be that those levies put on those companies, and on gas in particular with its huge profits, may be directed into supporting people proactively to make a transition to cheaper low carbon, which is something that people may not be able to do on their own.  That might need to be fully funded by the State.  I am thinking in particular of collective users.</p> <p>  On the standing charges issue, in all of this talk of smart meters and hubs it strikes me that first of all we need to be realistic that 42% of people in Ireland lack basic digital skills and will not be going online to deal with these issues.  If the standing charges are allowed to increase regardless of use it completely undercuts such measures.  It is not just bad in the context of energy shortages and the poverty impact this will have on people; it is also very impactful around the transition to low carbon.  It seems that it is counter indicated with transition to energy reduction if the standing charges go up in any way.</p><p>In that regard, Ms MacEvilly might comment on the low-usage standing charge for those who have extremely low energy usage.  The fact is that was removed, but as I understand it, from May, the standing charge for those with very low energy usage went up.  They were effectively penalised, as they are no longer getting the benefit of being a low energy user.  Could Ms MacEvilly comment on standing charges and how credible it is to talk about smart metering if it all gets undermined by a standing charge increase?  There is a need for a far more hands-on approach to address the price thresholds and the transition to lower carbon options.  I have a different set of questions, but I will group them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife MacEvilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#EE00200"><p>On the standing charges, first, where homes are connected to the network there are costs associated with providing those network services to those customers, which must be recovered.  Some of those costs exist even if the customers are using very little electricity, because it is a holiday home or because they upgraded their home to A-rated status or whatever else, or they are using solar photovoltaic, PV, during the day for their electricity but they still require additional electricity at peak times.  There is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a socialisation of costs, which ensures that everybody pays their way and that customers who can afford to invest in upgrading their home are not being subsidised by customers who cannot afford to do so.  We do think there is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a fixed cost, if one likes, associated with serving customers.  Some of the concerns Senator Higgins raises are about whether the standing charge becomes such a high portion of the bill that it perhaps disincentivises those who are trying to reduce their energy costs.  That is perhaps something we will examine when we look periodically at the component costs of a typical customer's bill.  We look at the extent to which there are fixed costs, unit charges, the PSO levy and VAT.  All of that changes over time.  It is a good point to look at that and see if after the current round of price increases over time there is a dramatic change in the proportion of fixed costs versus unit costs that would give rise to concerns about disincentivising reduced usage.  That is valid and is something that we will continue to monitor.</p></speech>

It is quite pressing.  I do not think this is a long-term piece.  We have seen standing charges jump massively at a time when profits have gone up massively.  With respect, I do not think that the standing charges costs have gone up so massively for the companies.  It seems to be something that requires market intervention rather than a wait-and-see approach.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins is aware we are currently consulting on new network charges in electricity, which include the cost of the temporary emergency generation.  Those costs are increasing also.  We have taken steps as much as we can to reduce the impact on customers.  We have taken the decision to rebalance &euro;50 million away from domestic customers to the large users.</p> <p>  We also looked at what we could do to mitigate cost inflation on gas as well.  We took a number of steps, which are outlined in the network charges paper for gas.  Unfortunately, we are seeing those gas network charges increase, but not as much as the electricity network charges are increasing.  It is the case that there are increased costs associated with networks at the moment.</p> <p>  Turning to the role of gas in security of supply, the Senator will be aware that the Department has published its review of security of supply, which covers electricity and gas, and that reinforces the important role that gas-fired generation plays, in particular as we move away from fuels like coal and oil which emit more carbon.</p><p>Gas emits less carbon.

I was concerned that the witnesses talked about gas for all customers.  How is the CRU supporting both domestic and larger customers to move away from gas and towards renewables, given the price volatility relating to gas?  I accept that many people rely on gas, but we know that the price of gas is extremely volatile.  What is the exit?  I asked about the lowest cost and the lowest carbon.  Why not make that the default?  Those who want something different, such as a higher cost and higher carbon, could request it if they need to.</p></speech>

It will take some time, as we invest significantly, to upgrade our network infrastructure to build more renewable capacity before we see the full benefits of increased low-carbon supply in the system.  Time-of-use tariffs are a good way to provide that benefit to customers.  There are lower charges overnight, because one is effectively supporting renewables that might run at night which might otherwise be curtailed because there is not enough demand.  Options such as moving consumption to off-peak times deliver lower costs for lower carbon.</p></speech>

I have two questions that I did not get to earlier.  Some information the witnesses provided relates to arrears and the electricity market with the caveat that we are going into the winter period, so it will become more difficult for people.  That seems to be fairly static, but it is not the same for domestic gas customers.  The witnesses mentioned that they have provided that.  Will they elaborate on what measures the CRU is taking for domestic gas customers to make sure that we will not see people disconnected from their heating over the winter months?</p> <p>  The witnesses referred to targeting customers who are most in need.  We know that Traveller households pay a particularly large proportion of their income towards their energy needs.  Many Travellers did not receive the energy credit because of the shared MPRN.  That was flagged with the Minister at a select committee meeting.  Is the CRU engaging with the Department and local authorities to make sure, particularly now that we know there will probably be three credits, that those who are the most in need in the Traveller community, namely, those living on halting sites, will benefit from the electricity credit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen Trant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#GG00200"><p>Those protections are in place for domestic gas customers as well.  It extends to both electricity and gas.  We will ask suppliers to offer that to gas customers.  Nobody should be worried about turning on the gas or being disconnected.  I am not sure if that answers the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#GG00300"><p>Given the trajectory, it is quite a large increase.  Do we need more bespoke measures, particularly for gas customers?  It might be something equivalent to the credit but just so there is something extra there because, as we know, it is gas that is inflating all of the prices, and people are relying on it heat and then there is the electricity as well.  Is it of concern to the regulator, given the growth in it, that it might need a set of measures particular to domestic gas households?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen Trant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022092000002#GG00400"><p>The Government has not announced anything on that.  We would certainly monitor disconnections and the arrears to see if there is a pattern there.  If something is needed for gas customers, then yes, absolutely.  We certainly do not want any disconnections or gas customers running into difficulty.  Again our message to people is to engage with their supplier and make sure their supplier is aware of their circumstances.  It should be a customer-led rather than a supplier-led approach in dealing with the customer, which has happened in the past.</p> <p>  The issue around Travellers and halting sites was something that came up during the last round of credits, and that was because some of the halting sites might be run by the local authority and therefore the local authority is actually the customer and is in control of the credit.  My understanding is that there will be a mechanism to reach out to those halting sites.  It is not something the networks can see but it is definitely something we will be able to approach.  We sit on the electricity security supply emergency groups and this is something that has come up.  We are engaging with the NGOs and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is also looking at this to ensure the credits reach the particular cohort of vulnerable customers who could be missed.</p></speech>

In some cases the halting sites got no payment but in others it was divided up among the number of mobile homes because it was a single MPRN.  They were getting &euro;200 but actually the families were getting about &euro;7 off their bill.  I am just flagging that there is a multitude of different issues but it meant they all lost out on the full benefit of the &euro;200.  Will they get retrospective payment because they lost out last year?</p></speech>

The only point I would make is that it was only just published so we have not got fully formed views on it yet.  We will be responding to the review.  We welcome that it has put forward a package of measures.  There are many sensible measures proposed there.</p><p>Some measures are individual and some are in packages.  When we talk about energy security, which I would separate from the security supply work that is going on at the moment, we are talking about whether we will have enough gas security to support the transition up to 2030 and beyond.  The review is asking the right questions, and some of the solutions it is coming forward with are sensible.  We welcome the review and will respond.</p></speech>

In some of the written pieces from the CRU on the ongoing data centre discussions, I noticed there were multiple references to EirGrid but almost no reference to the review the CRU conducted that considered the options of doing nothing and a moratorium on data centres until the demand can be safely and securely facilitated by the network, and then the subsequent connection measures.  I say this in the context that we were told, the time we met EirGrid and the CRU, that a 9% increase in electricity demand over five years was not an outlier, but I know from the information we have been given since that it is an outlier, and it seems the average in most EU countries is an overall net growth of zero percent.  There has been either flat or declining energy usage in most countries, so effectively zero percent growth in electricity demand is the norm, whereas Ireland has had a 9% increase in electricity demand for the same period.  The figures for the same five-year period show a 265% increase in the electricity demand from data centres.</p> <p>  In the current context where we are having literally to consider measures such as keeping the lights off or reducing the use of lights, has the CRU reflected on the decision not to apply the reasonable standard of having a moratorium until the demand can be safety and securely facilitated by the network and instead to go with a couple of connection measures?  On the decision the CRU made not to limit the expansion of electricity demand by data centres but to look instead at connection measures, will the delegation comment on two of them in particular?  One is the question of backup generators and the extent to which they rely on fossil fuels.  We know, for example, that two of the new data centres that have been given planning permission have diesel backup generators.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on the danger of locking in that in terms of backup generation, which is fossil fuel-based generation happening in data centres that are being built and ones that are newly proposed to be built.</p> <p>  The CRU mentioned the ability of data centres to provide flexibility in their demand by reducing consumption.  I would like to clarify what is meant by that.  Are we saying the data centres must reduce demand at peak times and they can be required to do so?  Is it, as mentioned here, something they could be requested to do or is it, and I was quite concerned by the reference to this earlier, the idea of procurement auctions around demand reduction?  Is the suggestion we would have to bid for companies to reduce their energy demand?  I was very concerned about the suggestion, which seemed to be, and I hope I got this wrong, that a hospital might bid for energy reduction bonuses or payments against other companies.  We certainly should not have a situation where for-profit companies can choose not to reduce energy where hospitals are effectively being told they should seek to reduce their energy costs and so forth by bidding for demand reduction.  Either Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy Leddin made the very sensible suggestion that surely we should just pay for battery power in our public and essential services rather than have them going into a demand reduction procurement market.  Is that where the CRU sees data centres going?</p><p>I want to be clear as to whether that reduction of demand from data centres is a hard power we can exercise.  Are our guests suggesting they may choose to participate in a demand reduction procurement market?</p></speech>

The EU is a big place and there may be other countries where demand is growing and still other countries where demand is decreasing.  However, we are on a different trajectory to the overall average.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about data centres.  In the new data centre connection policy, we looked for on-site back-up generation.  We are completely open to that being a combination of on-site renewables and battery storage, which might work in some cases.  As a part of the new approach to carbon sectoral emission limits, that is something we start to look to in order to understand their impact on future growth in this kind of space because it is-----</p></speech>

The focus of that decision was very much on security of supply.  The other options around flexible demand support security of supply but would also be a lower carbon solution.  Sometimes data centres refer to it as chasing the wind or following the sun.  Some of these large global operators have data centres at multiple sites across the globe.  Therefore, at times of low renewables or at peak times in Ireland, they could switch the processing capacity and the electricity demand or load to locations that have high renewables at that particular time.  That is attractive.  Of concern to us is that in the responses we have received to our consultation on the network charges, the indication from some of the sector is that while this is a future option, it may not necessarily be available this winter.  There is some concern in our minds about whether it will be available.  We need to understand that better.</p> <p>  On the procurement for demand-side services, we were considering an approach in our network tariff whereby people would be charged and could avoid the charge by reducing their use at specific times.  The EU regulation on emergency measures and supportive energy prices sets out a different approach whereby customers should be incentivised in the manner the Senator described.  In other words, they would compete to earn money to reduce their use.  I am simply repeating what is in the regulation.  That approach must be implemented on a non-discriminatory basis.  It would tend to argue against the approach we were looking at and argues for a different approach that still targets the same benefits.  We are pleased to see that as part of the package.  However, perhaps we need to reflect on the approach we are taking to ensure it aligns with the EU requirements.  I do not think that necessarily rules out the idea that there could be other options to support essential services to get batteries on site.  If that were a policy decision that the Government was to take, there may be other ways of incentivising them.  I am not sure that hospitals are best positioned to bid to reduce use.  What we want to do for hospitals is to ensure they have continuous supply.  That is why they are on the priority list for any of the emergency measures.  Perhaps a different approach is required for them.</p></speech>

That was the second option, which was not chosen.  As I understand it, this does not relate simply to the day-to-day.  The discussions were around what conditions would be attached to connections and to requests for connections.  It would have been within the remit of the CRU to have, for example, a conditionality around requirements for energy usage or reductions.  There is therefore no hard power that requires data centres to reduce their energy use.  The option was not chosen to make an obligation to comply with such requests a condition of having access to the grid.  Is that correct?  Has there been any reflection on that given, as the CRU has said, the disappointing information that is coming through on foot of the CRU not going with the moratorium two years ago, when that was one of the options available to it?</p></speech>

We will be reflecting on that and we will be engaging with the system operators on that.  This will include, as I think one of the Senators referenced, the gas side of the of the equation as well.  We will reflect on that and we also get updated reports on a regular basis - I think quarterly - from EirGrid and ESB networks on the implementation of the new approach.  Can Ms Trant remind me whether we signalled that there would be a review on that in any case?</p></speech>

I ask any member who is participating via Teams that they confirm they are on the grounds of Leinster House before making their comments.</p> <p>  In advance of inviting the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, and in relation to parliamentary privilege, witnesses participating from the committee room are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex should note that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to evidence delivered from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House, so if a witness is directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Whoever is delivering the opening statement has been allocated five minutes.  I ask people to adhere to that, if possible, so that there is plenty of time for questions.  We will start with Ms O'Toole who will be followed by Ms Bond, Dr. O'Brien and Ms Bair&eacute;ad</p></speech>

I have been with EPIC for seven years.  We would like to thank committee members for inviting us here today and we are pleased to be joined by our colleagues from the Irish Foster Carers Association, IFCA, the Irish Association of Social Workers and Ms Aoife Bair&eacute;ad.  EPIC is a national children's rights organisation that works with and for children in the care system, young people in after-care services and with care-experienced young people up to age of 26.  We work with children in foster care, kinship care, and residential care, including high support and special care and those sentenced or remanded by the courts in Oberstown Children&rsquo;s Detention Campus.  We are the only organisation in Ireland providing a direct, independent advocacy service to these children and young people, and their experience and perspectives inform our submission today.</p> <p>  I am joined by the CEO of EPIC, Ms Marissa Ryan, and a member of the EPIC Youth Council, Mr. Rory Brown.  Ms Ryan is happy to answer any questions on EPIC&rsquo;s policy on fostering and Mr. Brown and I will share our views based on our experience of living in foster care.  </p> <p>  At the outset, we have several key messages we urge the committee to consider and we are happy to discuss these in more detail throughout this meeting.  We particularly hope that these and other issues raised in EPIC&rsquo;s submission to budget 2023 are acted on.  Foster carers who open their home to children who cannot live with their birth families change and save lives. They need to be celebrated and supported by the Government.  The State relies on these people to look after the children in its care, but foster care is not invested in and carers do not receive the support they require.</p> <p>  Foster carers are often responsible for supporting a child that has been traumatised, while they also have to look after their birth children.  They need to manage the logistics of family life, engage with social workers, birth families and other professionals.  Politicians should regularly and vocally support fostering in their constituencies and at a national level.  The fostering community must see that they are recognised and valued and that foster parents and foster children are an important part of our society.  As we say in EPIC, "It takes a village to raise a child."</p><p>Fostering allowances have not been increased since 2009 and there is now a cost-of-living crisis, a housing crisis and other factors which mean foster care numbers are decreasing rapidly.  It is far cheaper for the State to support children in foster families than in residential care.  Research has shown that it is better for children to be placed with a family rather than in residential care, which is an institutional setting that lacks stability and a family environment.  The Government should use the annual budget to increase the fostering allowance to ensure fosterers can afford to offer homes to children who need them and to ensure that foster children have the opportunities to thrive with their foster families, including by having the means to attend extracurricular activities, to go on holidays or to simply enjoy being a child.<br/><br/>The act of being taken into care is traumatic.  Children can lash out, be angry, upset and feel incredibly isolated and vulnerable.  This can cause problems with the foster families, including with the birth children of foster parents.  Both foster carers and their birth children should be given regular training on trauma informed care, as well as access to counselling, as should the child in care who is living with them.  The Government should ensure additional funds are ring-fenced in Tusla for the provision of counselling and therapeutic interventions to children in care and foster families, and that children in care are prioritised by the HSE for timely access to mental health services.<br/><br/>Foster families often do not receive enough support from social workers, fostering link workers or aftercare workers.  They can be left responsible for managing everything in the child's life and this can become overwhelming.  For example, where a social worker or access supervisor is not available to drive a child to see their birth family, or when a social worker needs those hours for something else, this can fall on the shoulders of the foster parents, and they must deliver all the logistics and manage the emotional issues that can arise during access visits between a child in care and their birth family.  This is on top of all the other work that needs to be done in a family home.<br/><br/>Tusla has a shortage of social workers and other professionals whose role it is to support families and children.  More investment and political supports are needed to allow Tusla recruit and retain social workers and other professionals who can assist children in care and foster families, and have regular contact with them.<br/><br/>Normalising foster care is very important.  Many foster children in EPIC were brought to local events for foster families run by the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, to meet other foster children.  This helped to fight the stigma and isolation around fostering, and was often a place where young people in foster care could see their siblings who may have been placed in a different foster home in the area.  Politicians should work with local authorities, city councils, IFCA and others to run days like this on a regular basis.  They should attend them and publicise them too.  At the same time the Government should examine other ways to normalise foster families, for example, through inclusion on the census form.  I know when I filled out the recent census, in brackets beside the words foster family was the word &quot;unrelated&quot;.  I have never felt so heartbroken having to fill in a form in my life.<br/><br/>When a child is taken into care the State is acting <i>in loco parentis</i>, in the place of a parent.  At the very least a child should only be removed from their home when the State can guarantee that they will be better cared for elsewhere.  In Ireland the State has not been acting as a parent should.  There are many cracks in the care system that politicians have ignored or are simply unaware of yet.  It is this lack of investment and support that has led to the current fostering crisis, with the number of fosterers decreasing every year.  This has a huge impact on children in State care and those around them.  It is nearly ten years since the founding of Tusla and the development of our current child protection and welfare system.  Perhaps it is time for the Government to invest in reviewing the care system, as has happened in England and Scotland in recent years.<br/><br/>Children in care can often be marginalised and their voices are seldom heard.  In addition, they may lack regular access to a social worker or another professional.  Independent advocacy, which helps a child to have their voice heard, is extremely important.  Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that all the children have the right to be heard and to participate in decision-making about their lives.  At present, EPIC is the only organisation providing a direct advocacy service to care-experienced children and young people.  We believe that independent advocacy for children in care should be enshrined in legislation.  Organisations like EPIC should be fully funded to meet the needs of all care-experienced children, and young people who may require an advocate to help them have their views heard and acted on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Valerie O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#B00200"><p>I am the chairperson of the special interest group on foster care in the Irish Association of Social Workers, IASW.  I am also an associate professor at UCD and a research practitioner with substantial experience in service delivery in relation to foster care.  I am joined by my colleague, &Aacute;ine McGuirk, member of IASW and an experienced senior practitioner with significant experience in foster fare and former chair of IASW.<br/><br/>A key priority goal of the IASW is to influence a change agenda in the delivery and development of foster care services.  By way of background, the Irish Association of Social Workers was founded in 1971 and has approximately 5,000 registered social workers.  Social work is the key profession in the recruitment, assessment, review and support and supervision of families providing foster care services in Ireland, as well as the primary support for children placed in foster care.<br/><br/>As the professional representative group for social workers there are five main issues I want talk about very briefly.  The first one is the recruitment and retention of both foster carers and social workers.  The second is support services for birth parents of children in care.  The third is access to services for children and families, and we will show how it is a central dilemma for Government.  The fourth is child-centred issues, particularly adoption and placement breakdown.  The fifth is foster service delivery.<br/><br/>The first issue, which is the recruitment and retention of foster carers and which my colleague, Ms O'Toole, already referred to, poses significant difficulties.  Currently, our foster carers provide care for 90% of all children in foster care.  The central concern is that is a decreasing number.  I was 92% two years ago and 95% about seven years ago.  This is linked to changing demographies, ongoing stresses of living, the effect of significant traumas experienced by children prior to coming into care, the need to satisfy regulatory requirements and the challenge of ensuring safe care for all in the foster household.  Providing foster care placements in the child's community is a challenge, with children being placed far from home.  This impacts significantly on their relationship with their birth family and wider community and on their identify formation.  This poses significant difficulties in facilitating good access arrangements.<br/><br/>The retention of foster carers in the system is affected by the manner in which complaints about them are processed and these concerns have not been alleviated by aspects of the implementation of the child abuse substantiation policy, CASP, introduced by Tusla in 2022.  The recruitment and retention of social workers has been presented as a major challenge to various Oireachtas committees over the years.  The allocation of a sufficient number of social workers is imperative to developing a fully supportive working relationship and support system with the foster family but also, I would advocate, with the birth family.<br/><br/>On support services for birth parents of children in care, there are almost no services dedicated to the support of birth parents.  Parents who lose their children to care represent one of the most vulnerable sections of Irish society and their already immense problems are compounded by the loss of their children to the care system.  Previously, social workers working with children in care were named the child and family social worker.  However, in recent years those social workers have been framed as the children in care social worker, thus reference to the birth family is lost.<br/><br/>On access to services for children in care, interdepartmental action is required to address the complexity of ensuring that the State, acting <i>in loco parentis</i>, can fulfil its responsibility towards this cohort of children because the State is the parent for children in care while addressing its responsibilities towards all children, including those who are vulnerable and not in State care. That we see as the single biggest challenge for the Government.</p><p> While there has been some development in addressing the individual child&rsquo;s needs, therapy services specifically aimed at addressing multiple and complex relationships in the networks of relationships, including professionals, are urgently required.  The difficulties of children who require state care are well documented, and placement in a foster home is just the beginning of the process to cater for the full range of a traumatised child&rsquo;s needs.  However, services geared only to a child's needs will not address the wider relational issues.  Structures in Tusla need attention to ensure flexible service delivery and provide a consistent, knowledgeable, and holistic service for children in care and their foster carers.  A greater organisational focus on task over role would be an important first step.</p><p> On child-centred issues, there are two major issues.  The first is adoption for children in care.  The availability of adoption to those children in care, where this is the appropriate and proportionate response, is a welcome development, but caution is also required.  Statistics from the annual reports of the Adoption Authority of Ireland show that there has been little significant growth and the vast majority of children currently being adopted, because the process takes about three years, are aged close to 18 years of age.  Greater attention to this context, and greater attention to how adoption is currently being used within the care planning process, are needed.  Currently, we only have data coming from the Adoption Authority of Ireland, which captures the end of the process, not what is currently happening in the system.  We also need enhanced placement and aftercare planning for the cohort of children seeking asylum.</p><p> Placement breakdown is a particular concern for IASW.  Placements can break down, including after a child has spent a significant part of their life with the foster family.  There is an urgent need for research into placement disruption as well as into placements that do not break down, as each cohort may provide useful information for the other and for our overall understanding of the relevant issues.  In the short term, Tusla information systems need to collate this information at a national level while considering the complexity of pathways into care, and breakdown processes and outcomes.  Some children are coming into care at infancy and placements break down when they are 12 years old.  Other children come into care at 16 years of age and the placement breaks down.  The cohort of children is very different, but we do not have a national picture.</p><p> In terms of foster care service delivery, we are particularly concerned about the place of privatisation in the child welfare system.  We see that the commodification of care through privatisation is a serious policy issue that requires immediate attention.  It is not just within foster care and children's services but elsewhere.</p><p> A Government-mandated working party to take on the task of reviewing foster care policy, the legislation, resources and best practice is required.  IASW, through a publication in 2017, and further through a publication in 2018, laid out the structures for this working party in great detail with a perspective very much on the lived reality and how it needs to take account of the wider policy but also current Government structures.  The paper concludes with a range of recommendations that are intended to provide a basis for discussion between the various stakeholders.</p><p> Our view is that the following measures would enhance the service delivery.  First, there is a need for a Government-mandated working party, on which I believe our colleagues in IFCA will further expand.  This group would review foster care policy, the legislation, resources, and best practice and consider outcomes in alignment with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Leadership is key and the project should be sufficiently resourced to manage it at a level that reflects the importance of this work for the children of Ireland.</p><p> Under the leadership of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the working party would establish a shared, objective assessment of the suitability and availability of foster care for a range of different childhood care needs across Ireland.  It would engage with relevant Departments, in particular the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Education, Social Protection and Justice.  It would co-ordinate the contribution of key executive agencies, including Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the Health Service Executive, education, local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, professional and representative bodies, academia, and the private and voluntary sector.  It would collect key contributions from those with lived experience of foster care and their representatives, including EPIC, birth families, social workers and foster carers.  Finally, it would build and support a coalition of stakeholders to establish a vision for fostering in Ireland that would support, champion, and promote the delivery of shared objectives.</p><p> Foster care is the backbone of the child welfare system in Ireland.  It is one of the great successes of our child welfare system.  However, we are very concerned that with the diminishing numbers, we are beginning to see a major slippage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.470" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#C00300"><p>The Irish Foster Carers Association, IFCA, would concur with a number of the points raised by the Irish Association of Social Workers.  On behalf of IFCA, I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to address the joint committee on issues relating to foster care.  I am accompanied by the chairperson of IFCA, and a foster carer, Mr. Raymond Nolan, Dr. Helen Gogarty, expert in children's attachment, and Mr. Brendan Gillen, who is on-line, and who is an IFCA director.  I have included supplementary information on IFCA in appendix 2 in the opening statement.<br/><br/>As already said, foster care is the backbone of care for children who are in the care of the State in Ireland.  Ireland is quite unique in that the majority of the children who are in State care live with foster care families where they experience family life, which is testament to the value and importance of the family in our society and this is reflected in our legislation.  Ms O'Toole has already attested to this.  However, IFCA would view that foster care is at a critical juncture in Ireland with extreme challenges to the system at present.  The predominant challenges are the complex issues for children who are received into care and the lack of services to respond to their needs, the challenges for foster care families in supporting those needs and the absence of investment in supporting foster care.<br/><br/>When a child comes into the care of the State, it is assessed that they are at risk and required care and-or protection.  Foster care is the predominant type of care for children in the State, where foster families offer warm, caring family life to children, tending to their physical, social, emotional and other needs, which are underpinned by the stability of family life.  Foster care families support children who may be dealing with issues of neglect, abuse, or abandonment and to help them to feel supported, loved and accepted unconditionally.  This was also attested to by Ms O'Toole.<br/><br/>While the number of children being received into care has fallen from 6,044 in 2018 to 5,836 at the end of June 2022, so too has the percentage of children placed in foster care, falling from 92% in 2018 to just 90% in June 2022.  This decrease relates to higher numbers of children being placed in non-foster care placements.  This trend is worrying and one which we will be required to watch.<br/><br/>By the time a decision is made to place a child in care, they have already experienced many adverse early life events.  These may include exposure to alcohol<i>in utero</i>, which can result in children having foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, substance abuse <i>in utero</i>, insecure or disorganised attachments and trauma.  Research shows that children in care present with attachment profiles and are significantly more insecure than children in the general population who are not in care.  In a 2002 study, only 6% of children in care were classified as having secure attachments, compared to the general population.  This presents great challenges in responding to the needs of children in foster care.  For many children these adversities remain undiagnosed.<br/><br/>However, as children settle into the security of the foster care family, emergent expressed unmet needs are presented, whereby foster care families are required to support the child through ranges of emotions and behaviours.  To support these needs, foster care families require supports and responsive services for children.  Prior to the establishment of Tusla, foster care services were located within the HSE, and had access to professional services.  These included speech and language therapists and other relevant professionals to meet the needs of children.  Children in the care of the State were also prioritised for such services as stipulated in the national standards for foster care.</p><p>With the establishment of Tusla and the transferring of foster care services to that agency, this is no longer the case.  The outcome of this decision is that children in care who have experienced early life trauma do not have access to, nor priority for, the required services.</p><p> The challenges in recruiting and retaining social workers have been identified by Tusla, which in its 2021 annual report stated there is "a risk to operational service delivery in terms of social work resources available".  Tusla also identified in its annual report the risk "to the safety, welfare and wellbeing of children in foster care, due to inadequate capacity/resources/systems to ensure compliance with national standards for safeguarding".  This is a perfect storm.  Placing children with high levels of need with foster carers without adequate resources or supports places these foster care families under severe pressure.  This can result in placement endings, as attested by Dr. O'Brien, whereby insufficient services and the absence of social work resources place unrealistic demands and pressures on foster care families.</p><p> IFCA is the only independent organisation in Ireland that supports foster carers.  During 2021, IFCA supported 30 foster care families whose children&rsquo;s placements were in crisis and at risk of ending, which would result in a move for the child to another foster care placement if one were available.  Another stress for foster care parents is the risk of allegations of abuse being made against them.  The challenges faced by foster parents are great and, without support placements, flounder and can fail.  It is reported that the outcomes for children in care are poor if they have a higher number of placements.</p><p> Foster carers have expressed that they do not feel valued or recognised by the State for their contribution to the State's alternative care system.  This manifests in the lack of supports offered to them.  These include on-the-ground support as provided by IFCA, financial supports as outlined in the pre-budget submission to the Government, and recognition by the State of pension rights.  There is a shortage of foster care families to meet the demand of children coming into the care of the State, as advertised by Tusla in its most recent recruitment campaign.  Foster care is the lynchpin of the State's alternative care system.  Without foster carers, more children will be placed in residential care, which, as evidenced, does not offer outcomes that are as favourable for children.</p><p> There is an urgent need for investment in foster care services.  We need investment in the provision of psychological and other assessments for each child entering care and the provision of appropriate assessments for existing children in care.  We then need the provision of timely services as recommended by these assessments.  We need more social workers and foster care families to be recruited.  We need a review of social work administrative tasks to provide for more relational time with foster carers and children in care.  This is the essence of social work practice.  Some foster care tasks should be delegated to IFCA to reduce the workloads of social workers.  These tasks could include training new foster carers, the provision of local foster care support groups and the addition of advocacy support services as an early intervention for complex foster care placements to prevent placement breakdowns.  IFCA's national advocacy and counselling services should be extended.  There should be financial and pension recognition of foster parents.</p><p> IFCA recommends greater investment in foster care.  The contract between Tusla and foster carers must be strengthened to give due recognition to the role foster carers play on behalf of the State in the provision of the alternative care system.  We advocate the establishment of a permanent advisory panel on alternative care, comprising those with in-depth knowledge of the subject, by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This permanent advisory group's remit should review the current provision of foster care services and make recommendations for their enhancement and future developments.  The advisory group should act as a resource for Tusla in the development and maintaining of alternative care services in Ireland.</p><p> We advocate the retention of the 2003 national standards for foster care.  We recommend adequately funding IFCA, the only independent national organisation that supports foster care in Ireland, to meet the support needs of foster care families and to aid recruitment and retention of foster carers.  We recommend the provision of manageable caseloads and higher levels of support for social workers to improve recruitment and retention and the introduction of a part-time social work degree to facilitate those currently in employment who wish to train as social workers.  As an urgent measure the Government should seriously consider IFCA's pre-budget submission regarding financial supports for foster carers.</p><p> Foster care is the backbone of the care of children in the State and requires robust infrastructure to support it.  As it stands today, foster care is at a precarious juncture.  Children coming into the care system must be prioritised and receive all necessary assessments and supports.  Foster carers must also receive the supports required to enable them to care for children with very complex needs on behalf of the State.  Supports must be timely and available.  Investment is required in the foster care system and in IFCA to provide supports that foster carers require in their role.  I thank the Chairperson and committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife Bair&eacute;ad" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me today.  My role is as an independent social worker.  This is not a common role in Ireland and is different from roles such as guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  I specialise in attachment and trauma and I mainly do assessments and therapeutic work with children, their parents and their foster families.  I primarily work with children in care.  My colleagues have highlighted the immediate needs of foster carers and foster families in terms of support, payments and retention.  I support this and I am very happy to answer any questions on the necessity of these changes.<br/><br/>Given my role, I am going to focus on relationships and recovery for children in foster care.  We all have attachment behaviours and they are organised around what we know.  If our care is safe, we develop flexible emotional responses to dangers.  If we see toddlers trying to pull something down on top of themselves, we might shout at them and a minute later we will comfort them if they are hurt.  Insecure attachment means we are no longer flexible in this set of responses.  We have a smaller set of responses.  The more insecure we are, the narrower this set of responses is and the more widely we apply it.<br/><br/>Children who are abused and neglected have been hurt, frightened and left alone.  They have developed responses that keep them safe in this context.  When they are in their first foster care placement, they have an opportunity to develop an alternative worldview.  In the first few months that children are placed in care, we often see a remarkable burst of development, such as walking, talking and feeding themselves.  Emotional development can take longer and, depending on the trauma experienced by the child, this can take a serious toll on foster carers.  Sadly, because of this, some foster placements end.  Children find understanding the loss of this attachment figure much more difficult to comprehend than the more overt dangers they might have experienced at home.  When they move into the next placement, they try to predict dangers they know they do not understand and cannot recognise.  This can result in more heightened emotional and behaviour responses that become more profound over time.  After three or more moves, the ability of children to achieve attachment security becomes unlikely if not impossible.<br/><br/>The Judiciary would benefit from understanding the need to prioritise the child's relationship with the carers in their first placement over all other relationships in the first 12 months the child is in care.  This is true whether or not reunification is planned.  Children can move from one secure attachment to another with relative ease but not from one insecure attachment to another.  Judges, with the best intentions, seek to ensure children see their birth parents frequently.  This is fine if the relationship is healthy, but often these relationships are full of pain and hurt on both sides.  The children's experience can be that their carers, with whom they feel safe, frequently leave them with people or in places where they feel unsafe.  These experiences can lead to lasting issues between the children and their foster carers even when the decision is made that the child will remain in the placement permanently.  Judges should be provided with ongoing professional training to ensure they have the most up-to-date knowledge and evidence.  They should also have access to an independent panel of experts to inform their decisions in the best interests of the children.<br/><br/>The most important factor for children recovering from abuse and trauma is finding safety in an attachment relationship.  This requires that parents or carers have the right supports, resources and training so they can offer this to the children.</p><p>I strongly welcome the therapeutic support hubs being rolled out in Tusla.  Every child in care should have a therapeutic support plan that considers the impact of his or her experiences at home and implements a therapeutic plan promptly, rather than waiting for behaviours to emerge before intervening.</p><p> However, the impact of trauma on development means other services will be needed.  Over the past 17 years of working with children in care, I have repeatedly seen children&rsquo;s referrals batted between Tusla, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and disability services, each claiming the referrals are the others&rsquo; responsibility.  Children who are in care are the State's responsibility and so the responsibility of all of these services.  There should be a structure in place to scaffold these services around children in a systemic way.  This is not a critique of any professional in these services.  They all suffer from the same problem: too many referrals and too few staff and resources.  As has been acknowledged by various professional bodies, every area of health and social care needs more graduates to fill posts, and they need the structures in place to keep those workers and avoid the disastrous turnover of staff that, from my experience, seems endemic in every area of the country, particularly in Tusla.  Children, parents and foster carers have repeatedly said that, when they have a consistent social worker, their experiences with Tusla are largely positive.  They frequently highlight multiple changes of social workers as undermining their trust in and experience of the service that is designed to protect them.</p><p> Positive relationships with their birth families are linked with more positive experiences of being in care.  Difficult relationships with their birth family can undermine even the strongest of placements.  Given this, every parent of a child in care needs specific, strategic support to help them build this.  The national parent advocacy service that is being proposed needs to be in place so that the right supports can be offered to parents.  To meet this need, in addition to the various addiction, mental health and pragmatic supports many parents require, they should have their own specialised supports focused on meeting their therapeutic needs as parents and attending to the therapeutic repair of the relationship with their children.  Whether the child is staying in care or not, that remains equally important.</p><p> The needs of children in care are systemic, and while they are in care, the foster placement is the central pillar of that system.  We must begin treating children, their foster families and their birth families holistically if we want their care experience to be what it should be: a place of safety, recovery and love.</p></speech>

The question of fostering does not arise very often on the political agenda - the witnesses might say that is part of the problem - unless there is some sort of scandal, be it sexual or otherwise, in which case it is in all the newspapers then.  I found it very enlightening.  I have a few comments and questions to all the speakers.</p> <p>  Ms O'Toole made a statement that foster carers are to be celebrated and supported.  I agree with her 100% and I am sure every reasonable person would.  We all know families, indeed they are in my constituency, who are in that position and you could not speak highly enough of them.  It is only that I am thinking that perhaps there are a whole lot of problems for them that I never was aware of.  I probably took it for granted they were doing a function and, just like every other parent, they were just getting on with it.  I can see clearly now they are in a different position.  Ms O'Toole said was that politicians should regularly and vocally support fostering in their constituencies at national level.  My question for her, and perhaps she could comment briefly on it when I am finished, is how we can do that.  I would be happy to do it.  I engage with nearly all voluntary and community effort and I would certainly like to find a way I could be more forthcoming and of assistance there.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Brien's main point was the establishment of the working party, which sounds very interesting.  I will be devil's advocate, if she does not mind.  We have countless committees, acting committees and broad-based committees.  Will this just be another one of those?  That is the question the taxpayer will be asking.  Dr. O'Brien spoke of an 18-month period for a report.  I have yet to see a report brought in on time.  That is being devil's advocate, but that said, I am fully in support of it because it makes sense to me, except that it may be yet another layer of bureaucracy.</p> <p>  One or two points in Dr. O'Brien's presentation interested me.  The adoption rate is disappointing.  Who would be the target group to adopt?  I might be totally ignorant here.  Is it the foster parents who adopt finally or would it be a third party?  Ms O'Toole is nodding for the first.  That is very good.</p> <p>  Then there is the decline and that 90% of children are catered for in the fostering services.  What becomes of the other 10%?  I think it was described as non-foster placement.  I would like to know what that is.</p> <p>  Ms Bair&eacute;ad's statement was very detailed.  It is probably very micro for the likes of us.  We are laymen.  I am a former teacher so I have some idea of children's needs but I am not Jean Piaget.  I will study this a bit more closely, and if I can be of any assistance, I will.</p></speech>

I always leave it up to the groups if they want to come in.  We always have to be conscious of time.  I would ask them to indicate.  Does Ms O'Toole want to come in first?</p></speech>

From my personal experience, I do not think my foster carers especially want a pat on the back when it comes to support but more that they need to have the services available to them.  They have their own children and they are providing a service by being a foster parent, but the services need to be there to support them to do that properly.  That is the same as saying "thank you".  It is about making sure they have exactly what they need to be a foster parent and to be able to act that out fully.  We in EPIC always say "care aware".  People need to be aware that care experience people are in their schools, church and shop.  You cannot support something that you are not aware of.  It is about learning about what the care system is, its flaws and what works well in the care system, and talking directly to children in care about their lived experience.  That is the best advice anyone can get.  Those are the people of whom to ask the questions.  That in turn will help people to help foster parents and carers.  Another thing is publicising care events and so on.  EPIC has a care day in February.  All children in care need to know there is a day.  If there is a national day for pizza, why is there not a national day for children in care?</p></speech>

The fall through the cracks a lot of the time.  As the Senator said, the only thing you hear about care leavers is the stigma around them.  You never hear about the good deeds and the good things about many of them.  I am a primary school teacher.  I have finished my education.  I am lucky to have achieved that but many do not get to do that and that is what you hear about.  You do not hear about the positive stories.  We need to reinforce the positive stories and supporting children when they come out rather than just hearing about the stigma.  We should make it known there are so many positive outcomes and there are foster carers doing amazing jobs.  They do not even ask for much in return.  The biggest thing people can do is let them know they are supported.</p></speech>

While three years may seem like a long time, that in fact led to foster care being cemented as the backbone of our child welfare system.  We therefore already have very good outcomes in this country from having such a working party.  The reason we are now advocating a working party again, given the complexity and the number of stakeholders and the number of Departments involved in children and children in care, is that we do not see there are effective structures currently.  There needs to be a clear ministerial mandate.  In this paper envisioning a working party we have itemised the various tasks and the reporting relationships in respect of the project manager, so a lot of the work has been done for the Government.</p> <p>  Second, as to where the other 10% of children are, in the main the children are in residential care.  Tusla, in fact, while it may appear as a-----</p></speech>

The children in care are in one of two places: in foster care or in residential homes.  Residential homes are staffed by multiple different carers coming and going.  For some children that may be okay, but it is not an ideal place for children as a long-term alternative.  It does, however, meet the needs of some children, particularly teenagers.</p> <p>  There is one point we have not stressed enough today.  About 30% of all children in foster care are in fact with what we call relative or kinship foster families.  That is another one of the great departures that has happened since the late 1990s.  We are all family members.  We all know from our own histories that things can go right for individual family members.  It is one of the great chips in our child welfare system.  Relative foster carers or kinship foster carers - in Ireland we call them the former - are both family member and foster carer at the same time and they have different support needs and service needs.  In many ways, it is only now we are talking about them here.  Even in the IASW we did not highlight that.</p> <p>  Third, the issue of adoption is a very interesting question.  What would be the target group?  The important thing about adoption is that it is extraordinarily complex, and we know what the legacy of adoption has been in this country.  Therefore, while we are looking at adoption for children in care, we have to be careful to look at the individual child's needs and the intergenerational consequences of a child being adopted.  The law is very clear that there has to be a proportionate response to the child.  We have very little case law at present because the children currently being adopted are those being adopted by their foster carers and those who are ageing out of care.  That is why the focus here has been on care planning and what is happening in that regard.  If these children appear before the courts with a proposed adoption plan and if the birth parents contest that, it is in the case law that we will see what happens.</p> <p>  The other major limitation of adoption is that the adoption law did not incorporate a provision whereby children, even if adopted, would have a right to ongoing contact with their birth families.  That has happened since 1975 in many jurisdictions.</p></speech>

The vast majority of children who leave care go back to their own families.  Adoption is complex, but Senator O'Sullivan is asking the right question about the cohort of children involved.  I do not have an easy answer but it is within the care planning process.  If there is a small child who definitely will not have a possibility of returning home, it is best in the first instance to try to work co-operatively with the birth parents on a secure adoption plan, but ongoing contact will be the backbone of that, and then services are needed to support that.</p> <p>  Would Ms McGuirk like to add anything else?</p></speech>

It is what some foster carers would wish to do for the children in their care if that is the right thing for the child at the time.  What has happened in years gone by is that it is only at the very end because many of our foster carers are very much dependent on the foster carer allowance to give the child the kind of life the child should have.  Previously, if you adopted the child, you lost the allowance and the child became the same as any child in your family.  There is now a system within Tusla whereby you can apply to have the allowance continued.  That allowance has not been reviewed in ten years so it will not really help to pay the electricity bill.  The foster care allowance and the fact it has not been reviewed in ten years is something else that needs to be looked at.  The members of the committee are all politicians and they know what that means.  However, it has been a positive thing that Tusla will now give a fostering allowance to a family after they have adopted a child.</p> <p>  The bit that is still not 100% is whether that child will then get aftercare services, which are fantastic if they get them.  They get Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants, the child is treated as an individual for all their purposes, and no income coming into the foster family affects what the child gets in the form of further education, grants etc.  It is not clear whether the allowance could continue into what we call the aftercare period for education and so on.</p></speech>

It has been a very valuable experience for me to listen to the experiences of foster caring families and the groups that represent them.  I agree that people involved in foster care should be celebrated.  I also agree very much with Ms Bair&eacute;ad that a child's experience should be one of a place of safety and love and should be good.  That should be a basic thing for any child.  I thank Ms Bair&eacute;ad for highlighting that.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  I will direct the first to Dr. O'Brien because she brought up the issue of treating children in care as a commodity through privatisation.  Will she elaborate as to why she feels that needs immediate attention?  What does she think is the rationale for using this model of care, for want of a better word?  How common is it?  Does it cost the State more in brass tacks in the long term than it would if there were direct placement through Tusla or the State's organisations?</p> <p>  I do not want to keep talking about monetary issues, but it was mentioned that foster carers do not need pats on the back.  We do not need rounds of applause in the D&aacute;il for foster carers like we have seen.  What we need is the appropriate financial supports in place for foster carers.  A number of the witnesses mentioned there has been no increase in the foster carer allowance since 2009.  I am not asking them to say how much the foster care allowance pays, but will they elaborate on what they think the percentage increase should be for that?  What would be adequate for foster carers to be able to provide a service to the children they look after?</p> <p>  The last issue I wish to raise is another one Dr. O'Brien mentioned.  I do not want to direct all my questions at her.  The issue of kinship crosses my door, usually through tragic circumstances, whereby somebody might have lost a sister or a brother and, all of a sudden, there are kids without a parent and the families are trying to rally around and do the best they can for those children.  I know from the families' experiences after they get in contact with me that they find that the supports they get from Tusla are not adequate, not appropriate and not sufficient.  Will any of the witnesses tell me what supports should be in place and how immediately they should be put in place?</p></speech>

Look at what has been happening with care for old people and groups of people in the State.  Currently, services are provided by the State and by statutory services.  Some services are provided by not-for-profits but some are provided for profit.  It is important to say it is not that I am opposed to the private sector but what is the cost to the State?  It is a much higher cost to buy a placement from private agencies.  In return they can provide more wraparound services but then what we have seen happening in other countries is those private agencies selling themselves on as businesses.  Where is the profit going then?  The excess profits from these agencies are going into the private domain as opposed to coming back into the service.  Therefore, it is an important policy issue and the private sector is meeting the gaps, but in many instances the children who are being placed through private agencies are then being placed at distances from home.</p> <p>  The IFCA may also have something to say about the commodification of care and maybe there are other questions.</p></speech>

My two youth council members who are here came through the foster system and are here by virtue of that fact, but we work with many children and young people who, as Ms O'Toole alluded to, are in Oberstown, in private residential care or in high-support or special care.  A concern we have about the use of the private residential care provision model is around regulation and inspections.  As things stand, if there is a public home run by Tusla, it is inspected by HIQA.  Thus we have the oversight there and it is the appropriate way independently to inspect places where children live.  However, the private residential care sector is not independently inspected by HIQA.  Tusla must commission the service and must then inspect it itself, so there is a lack of independent oversight of those homes.  We know from the evidence of other jurisdictions, particularly within the UK, that where there is not independent oversight and regular inspections and so on, it is very easy for child protection breaches to happen.  That is an issue of significant concern to us in EPIC.  Alongside the increased privatisation of children's homes we also have issues with the lack of oversight and inspection of them.</p> <p>  The second issue I wish to highlight briefly is the fact that while there is a crisis in the number of foster carers, there is also an absence of appropriate numbers of residential care placements.  We are seeing that many of the children and young people we work with are increasingly without places to go and they are being moved around very regularly because there are not enough foster placements, but there also are not enough residential care placements.  That is when you see reported in the media, as I am sure members have, the number of children, even quite young ones, being accommodated in hotel, bed and breakfast and emergency accommodation.  Likewise, at the older end of the scale we are working with teenagers who are increasingly in precarious circumstances and lapsing into homelessness.  Those are two more issues to add to the committee's plate.</p></speech>

Some of those are social enterprises so they are not all necessarily for profit.  They provide wraparound services for the children.  Looking at the costs like for like, there is not a huge difference and so that narrative needs to be changed.  It is the case that, according to Tusla's numbers, there are just over 450 children in private foster care services, which are highly regulated and highly inspected by HIQA, contrary to the residential care services.  They are providing in the gap for children in care.  The rationale for their entrance into Ireland was the lack of foster care placements, and there continues to be a lack of foster care placements, so we need to take a balanced approach in this debate and this argument and get all the facts that are there.  We are seeing higher numbers of young people going into residential care.  This attests to the fact the numbers of children have gone down from 92% to 90% placed in foster care.  We are hearing of very young children being placed in residential care, which is of grave concern.  We need to tread carefully because we do not want to have children not going into foster care, whether it is through State services or private services.  We want children to be in foster care as opposed to going into residential care, where we know the outcomes for many of them are not as constructive or positive.</p> <p>  I defer to my colleague Dr. Gogarty on the placement of children in foster care and the benefits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen Gogarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#G00800"><p>Family life is very important for children.  The outcomes for children in foster care are more positive.  They are often more challenging in the teenage years, but with foster homes, whether private or Tusla-managed, I see much more positive outcomes.  That said, some children do very well in residential care, especially children who have a particular attachment profile.  If, say, they are quite avoidant and find it difficult to make close relationships, children like that can do quite well in residential care.  However, generally, family life meets the expectation of children.  It is what we are all archetypally led to expect in life and children in foster care do very well.</p> <p>  Having said that, and having worked in this field for many years, I notice children's presentations becoming much more complex.  During the 1990s, children were presenting with high levels of anxiety.  Now children are presenting with a complex array of developmental problems and often issues like foetal exposure to alcohol or drugs, which results in developmentally challenging brain development, if you like, because their brain development was affected, perhaps in the womb.  That plays out in the foster home in the form of behavioural difficulties, sleep disturbance and eating difficulties.  Children are often assessed as having ADHD, for example, when there is a much deeper developmental problem that remains undiagnosed.  I support my colleagues in saying there is a need for a comprehensive assessment service for children coming into care so these problems can be looked at at a very early stage and the services can be directed in the right way.</p></speech>

For those who have moved to private agencies, their primary reason is a perception of the support that is offered.  That is things like access to 24-7 on call, access to psychological services, access to additional training and identifying their support needs.  I am therefore cautious about a move away from that.  All foster carers should have that expectation.  It is more what Tusla in that regard needs to come up to.  Again, that is a complex issue and requires lots of resources outside Tusla alone, but it is important to note.</p> <p>  On residential and what is needed, I am struggling with the term "crisis" because it has been coming for a long time.  It was identified multiple times by multiple professionals that children's needs were becoming more complex and what they needed was going to be more wraparound services and residential services that had an understanding of that and resources available to do that.  As a crisis response, Tusla has had to move to private agencies but Tusla needs to have those services available again in-house and in all of its residentials.  Those children are not going away and new children are coming.  We know with poverty and things like the cost-of-living crisis there will be an increase in children coming into care.  We know from our experience in direct provision that, when children come from places of war, more children come into care and need more services.</p><p>That crisis, if one wants to call it that, is not going away.  It needs to be addressed, but it is a long-term piece that needs to be addressed through many years rather than being something that can be fixed overnight.  Moving away from those private services means Tusla will have to take up the banner in terms of what is being offered, which is complex therapeutic supports - when they are available - for those children.</p></speech>

It is an area I have researched for a long time.  There are three ways in which children end up with their relatives.  One is where there is a private arrangement, which is usually propelled by a crisis.  In the case of those children who do not need protection because the family can protect them, the family can be helped to apply for what was previously referred to as the orphan allowance.  The parents may still be alive but it was available where there was evidence that they were unlikely to re-emerge to take a substantial role.  Private arrangements are the first route.  In some of those private arrangements, child protection issues emerge when the birth parent wants to take the child back.  Those families need the protection of the State to stabilise the placements.</p> <p>  The second way is where children come into care but, in an emergency, it is not possible to place them with extended family.  It may be out of hours or the family may not be known.  Within a short period, however, the plan is to move the child into family care, usually through Tusla.</p> <p>  As regards the third route, approximately one third of children in kinship care have already been in the care of the State, such as in a foster placement and, when those placements break down, Tusla begins to mobilise relatives.  That cohort may be older and have different support needs.  There are two reasons relatives get involved.  We are all members of a family.  We know what would happen in the morning if there was a crisis in our family.  It goes between affection - knowing and loving the child.  As my mother always said, blood is thicker than water and we should get out there and look after one another.  That is the obligation level.  The other reason is the person knows, loves and has reared the child and is going to keep him or her.  It is complicated.  The support services families require may be different.  Relatives tend to be older and poorer than foster carers.  In Ireland, we have a significant number of grandparents and maternal aunts with a child in their care because of the profile of families.</p></speech>

Many of those issues come about due to the lack of support in residential care, especially public residential care under Tusla.  That has caused many professionals working in Tusla to be under more extreme pressure, leading to many of them leaving the services.  That means those in care, as Ms O'Toole and I were, have a constant rotation of people and many of them do not have a secure relationship with anyone.  Given the lack of services for the caregivers in these homes, they cannot provide the services.  They are working more on coping with the kids instead of actually helping them.  That becomes a problem after a number of months or years.  It takes a toll on those working in those services and they leave because of the pressures.  That, in turn, means children in these residential care places experience problems having the secure relationships that are important.  That is a deep issue in care homes and foster homes as well.  Without the right supports, care givers are leaving and many children in care have to move to a different home.  Many of the people on our council have moved care home at least twice, with many moving to a different home 14 or 15 times.  There is no way a child can form a secure attachment in those circumstances.  They do not have the supports to allow them to stay in the foster home or residential home and form those important relationships.</p></speech>

That is much appreciated.  The lads who featured on the podcast that won the award would not be strangers to many of the issues we are discussing today.  They are men who have engaged with the justice system and spent time in and out of prison but who have also experienced many of the things we are discussing today.  This session sits somewhat uncomfortably with me because I believe a big part of this conversation is missing.  There is rarely any real representation, here or anywhere else, of birth families.  It came up briefly in one of the witnesses' contributions in the context of birth families not having their own social worker.</p> <p>  I am not speaking about situations where there are child protection issues and it is necessary to remove a child due to sexual abuse, physical violence or that type of stuff.  Unfortunately, we are exposed to violence in many communities in different ways.  It is a collective thing, however.  Some families will come on the radar more than others in terms of the support they may need.  That may be because it is a woman who needs support with addiction or a father coming out of prison and seeking access to his child who is now in care as a result of issues relating to the child's mother.  There are many different issues.  The foster allowance is a particular amount of money and there has been discussion on increasing it.  Foster parents expect to receive a certain level of support and service.  Many of the families whom I support expected to receive such supports, as birth families, for their children who had additional needs or when they needed support in terms of being able to access treatment for addiction or to deal with poverty or the housing crisis.  There are women ending up in hotels.  There are so many different societal failures that have led to so many children ending up in care as a result of poverty rather than it being due to outright neglect in terms of being able to have access.  We need to be able to have a conversation not only as representatives discussing solutions in terms of the aftermath of social care but also about how we can support people with services while they are in the care of their family members.</p> <p>  I refer to the parental capacity assessments that are carried out and the scrutiny on some very willing, active and loving parents who are able to provide care but are held to a standard to which foster parents are not even remotely held.  That is an unusual bar to set for birth parents who want to care for their children, who have done the parenting course and X, Y and Z, who have never hit or abused their child but who, possibly due to having gone into prison or due to an absence or an addiction, are being held to a standard that not even I could meet.  How do we begin to address some of those issues?  In some of these cases family reunification is the best possible thing.  Sometimes we are missing that part of the conversation.</p> <p>  In some cases, traumatised children have traumatised parents.  The parents were kids at one stage and they were traumatised by the same system that is now traumatising their children, yet they are expected to know how to be something different when they become parents, even though they did not have access themselves in the first place.  How do we fix that?  They do not have representation for themselves because they consider themselves guilty or bad or believe they cannot advocate.  We need to find an advocacy body to work directly with them.  I know we prefer to extend comments in a particular direction but I would love to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on that issue.</p> <p>  I always agree with Ms Bair&eacute;ad but when she said 12 months of no access to a birth parent-----</p></speech>

I thank Ms Bair&eacute;ad for clarifying that.  My stomach flipped when I heard it.  The point made was that, in the context of returning to the parent, 12 months should be invested in the foster placement to ensure secure attachment.  What I inferred from that was that making sure the birth parent who wants to be active can be active would not be prioritised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#H01100"><p>I will get one more point in first.  The other thing I wanted to ask about is the trauma-related piece.  Sometimes the trauma is not obvious when kids go into foster care at six, seven or eight years of age.  They reach the age of 12 or 13 and start to think and see the unfairness and injustice, and then the trauma emerges.  There are foster parents with whom I have been working for years.  Sometimes a child in their care will visit his or her parent and the foster parent will say the child is upset every time he or she comes home and then, bang, the access is closed down.  Of course the child is upset.</p><p>This is part of it.  That is their birth parent.  Trauma is complex.  Rather than offering training to foster parents when kids are already in their care, how can we ensure foster parents' intentions and principles are in line with providing good care to kids who carry complex trauma?  We should not wait until the kids are in the foster parents' care for them to discover they may need the training when the care has already broken down.  We have so many foster kids who will not develop in the way the birth kids of the foster parents will because they are afraid to breathe wrong in case they lose their placement.  Therefore, they cannot be cheeky or push the boundaries and come in at 12 midnight instead of at 10 o'clock at night when they were asked to.  They cannot do those things in many cases out of fear.  That must also impact on their developmental stages through teenage years.  Obviously, there are amazing things about foster parents.  We need foster care.  I am glad that about 90% are in foster care.  That is what I want to support.  However, too many standards are being let down in many cases with which I deal.  How do we begin to address that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife Bair&eacute;ad" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#J00200"><p>The focus should be on the child in foster placement feeling safe again.  The trauma of being separated from one's birth parent is not always understood by the Judiciary, and so children go to visits where they feel hurt and their parents feel hurt.  Children in that relationship often end up refusing to go, which is not good for anybody.  I would see that with the National Advocacy Service.  It should not just be an advocacy service but one that addresses the issues outlined by the Senator, such as peoples' therapeutic need as a parent, not just in respect of their addiction or mental health and taking these pieces of them.  They are like, "If you fix that, you will be fine." but they should say, "As a parent, this has been traumatic.  As a parent, you have probably experienced trauma yourself.  As a child, you have probably experienced trauma to get here."  That has to be considered.</p> <p>  There may be cases in which children will not be able to return, but that process is still beneficial.  The parents' ability to offer the child the healthiest relationship they can, will make the child's care experience better.  The idea that children would have visits with their parents once a month, indefinitely, in a visitor or access centre with somebody watching them makes me so sad, because relationships should change and grow.  Everyone should have that opportunity, particularly in these families where the worst thing has already happened.  Having supports and therapeutic plans for families that assume this relationship will change and grow for the better, no matter what the outcome for that parent or child may be, is vital and it is such a gap in our system now.</p> <p>  One of the biggest predictors of people recovering from trauma is coming out of poverty.  That is it.  One can take every other factor into account, but the greatest predictor of them recovering from intergenerational trauma is coming out of poverty.  What we are talking about at this committee is a very narrow part of what is a huge and complete system, but they are the worst parts of our society made real for children in very vulnerable families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#J00300"><p>Senator Ruane raised a number of issues.  First and foremost, the Constitution works to promote the retention of children with their natural families.  This is enshrined in our Constitution.  When decisions are made for children not to be with their families, it is because many people are concerned about what is happening.  The next layer of support that is put in is support for families.  I know that between the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla, a high level of supports are put into family resource centres and the likes of voluntary organisations.  As well as Tusla introducing the signs of safety approach to work with and support families to keep children with them.  When it gets to the point where a decision is made for a child to come into care, it is a very onerous decision and not one that is taken lightly.  That is very important to note.</p> <p>  We expect a lot from children.  When children are removed from their families of origin, of course, them leaving is a wrench.  Despite the best intentions of the parents, blood is always thicker than water.  Children having to leave their family of origin is very traumatic, regardless of what went on during their tender years.  Foster carers take these children into their homes to look after and care for them.</p> <p>  Foster carers have an extensive assessment period that can span from 12 months to 18 months, and that includes every member in the foster care family, including their own children.  The threshold for fostering is quite high.  Foster carers are then required to go before a foster care committee where everything regarding their family, including their lifestyle, is put on the line.  They are Garda vetted.  Medical checks are done.  Their own children's school reports are considered and teachers contacted.  It is a comprehensive assessment.  To become a foster carer, the threshold is quite high because a foster carer is caring for somebody else's child.</p> <p>  As to children going on access with their birth families, it is very stressful and traumatic for children, and it is traumatic for foster carers who have to support that child when he or she comes back from access.  The thing about access is it is court directed.  Therefore, only the court can say who goes to access, how frequently it takes place, and where it takes place.  That is not within the gift of the birth family or foster carers.  That is the reality.  We also need to talk about the care team around the child, which includes everybody.  This includes the child's natural family, the social workers and the foster carers, because that is how foster care works well - when everybody is working in unison.</p> <p>  A new service is being set up to support birth parents, which was commissioned by Tusla a few months ago.  Plans are in place in recognition of the need to support birth families.  They are and should continue to be an important part of children's lives.  When the system works collaboratively and supports one another, with everybody working in the best interests of the child, that is what people are working towards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.504" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen Gogarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#J00400"><p>A few things come to mind in response to Senator Ruane.  As Ms Bond said, children are not taken into care lightly.  They usually have experienced physical abuse, trauma, neglect or sexual abuse and they carry the memory of that.  That then shapes their expectations of how their foster parents will behave towards them.  For example, if they have been exposed to a lot of alcohol, they very often expect the same thing to happen.  It takes a while for them to realise it is not the same.  It takes a long time for them to realise they are safe.  The physical reality of safety in foster care is not matched by the child's perception of it, because that is how trauma works.  Children continue to feel afraid and feel as though they are unsafe when, objectively, they are safe.  In my experience, such children behave in several different ways.  Some children are compliant.  Some are very angry and aggressive, however, and some combine both patterns.</p> <p>  Access is very important for children, but it is sometimes beyond the capacity of the child's nervous system to manage if he or she has been subjected to a lot of trauma prior to coming into care.  When children go to access, they experience sensory reminders of the trauma, and sometimes they become so overwhelmed they cannot manage, which results in sleep disturbance, problems with eating, and every indication their nervous system is overwhelmed.  In that situation it can be appropriate to stop access for a time to help children achieve a level of emotional regulation so they can resume contact with their parents.</p></speech>

Much of what they said is right but their response, in many ways, proves my point.  All the blame was put on the parental aspect and the child's trauma, and not on the fact that many foster carers do not understand complex trauma, and further compound trauma on top of the trauma that is already brought into their home.  It is important for that to be acknowledged if we are to ensure foster placements do not break down.</p></speech>

They are an important part of the jigsaw the child has to live within.  It is extremely important for everyone to have an understanding of everybody else's situation.  Over 1,200 foster carers and social workers attended training last year with IFCA and considered issues such as trauma, how trauma affects children, the emotional regulation of children and how foster carers can support children with emotional dysregulation.  There is a lot of learning taking place and many people upskilling and learning more about the subject.</p></speech>

With regard to the incident in Cherry Orchard yesterday, I watched three foster carers.  The children involved in the incident, whom we may call hooligans or low-life, are the children who will probably encounter services like those in question.  There is a huge amount of unconscious bias against working-class kids and others who end up in foster care, and that comes out in the placements.  I say that from 20 years' experience of working in the addiction sector and from having attended many care-plan meetings with foster children and their families.  I am not speaking abstractly but from lived experience.  It is important we truly acknowledge what I am saying, in addition to all the great foster care.  I am not dismissing the latter, but-----</p></speech>

Mr. Nolan, a foster carer who is present today, might speak about this.  I can attest only to my experience of those with foster children in their care, which I note regularly in IFCA.  IFCA's annual conference, which will be at the beginning of November, is an opportunity for everybody, including the foster-care families, children and birth families, to get together.  Personally, I have never heard any foster carer speak in a derogatory manner to any foster child.  That is my experience.</p></speech>

I will let her do so and then move on to our next speaker.</p></speech>

I always say you cannot build a house if you do not have foundations laid out.  We cannot try to do all the wonderful and lovely things we want to do with the foster care system and care system in general unless we have the basics right.  Addressing trauma is one of the major basic issues that needs to be got right.  I do not agree there is a specific way the trauma works.  Every single case is unique.  Even in a foster family, trauma is unique to each person in it, not just to the family itself.  I do not believe there is any way you could fully evaluate and see somebody's trauma.  I was in care from the age of two and am now 21, and it was only in recent years I realised it was traumatising.  A huge amount of work needs to be done on what constitutes trauma, the different types of trauma and how we can see it.</p> <p>  As somebody who was in care for the length of time I was in care, I can only say it feels like there is a tick-the-box exercise.  In this regard, it is said that because access did not go well, we will not go ahead next week.  There is no point in punishing a child if access does not go well; it is not the child's fault.  As we have established, the child is severely traumatised, as are the parents.  There is so much work to be done on this kind of stuff.  We need to focus on getting the basics right.  The trauma part is huge.  It is probably one of the most important pieces.</p> <p>  On the point on the care team around the child, in my experience there has never been a single care team.  I have had over ten social workers and should have had one.  Again, this feeds into the trauma aspect.  All of these points are so valid but, again, they scream my point that the basics need to be got right before we can move forward on any of them.</p></speech>

First, I thank everyone for coming to this meeting.  Their input is crucial for committee members to understand the differences between specific issues in this area.  Second, when we have these discussions it is really important to acknowledge the deeper cultural and societal problem that forces people into poverty and, because of the structure, keeps them there, as Senator Ruane acknowledged.  The number of children who go into care from the dysfunctional system has to be highlighted.  I thank the representatives for doing so.</p> <p>  With regard to speaking about foster carers and the different aspects of their role, which is very complex, it is important to highlight that we see everywhere unconscious bias towards people in poverty.  The single biggest factor determining whether one is likely to end up in poverty is whether one is in a one-parent family.  We need to acknowledge that.  Foster parents do not always get everything right.  No parent gets everything right; it is just a reality, and it is good to be able to talk about that as well.</p> <p>  On the need for more trauma-informed policy and more training, it is true of every Department.  So often, I work with women fleeing domestic violence.  When they go to the department responsible for local housing, there is not a trauma-informed response there.  This needs to be played out throughout society.  The need for the response in question is so prevalent it can very much be felt in the room today.</p> <p>  We cannot overstate the importance of foster carers.  It is crucial to note children in foster care have better outcomes than children who go into residential care.  In this regard, however, we should bear in mind what was said about particular attachment styles suiting certain children.  I was not aware of that.  For the most part, better outcomes are experienced by children in foster care by comparison with those in residential care.  We need to focus on that.  That 90% of children in care in Ireland are in foster care and 10% are in residential care is something we should be really proud of, but the fact the percentage in foster care is down from 92% is one we very much need to examine.</p> <p>  The allowance for caring for foster children under 18 years of age is &euro;352 per week.  I believe I am right in saying that.  For over-18s, the allowance is &euro;300 per week.  However, that the rising cost of living has not been addressed in so long is simply outrageous for the most part because we know there is a reduction in the number going into foster care.  We want to get the percentage back up to 92% or higher for better outcomes.  That is key.</p> <p>  I have outlined the most important aspect, but it makes absolutely zero sense from a budgetary perspective that we are seeing a decline in the number of children entering foster care.  I would like somebody to correct me if I am wrong in saying it costs &euro;6,000 per week to keep somebody in residential care.  It costs &euro;352 per week to keep somebody in foster care but &euro;6,000 per week to keep somebody in residential care.  We are seeing a decline in the number of children entering foster care, and the allowance for foster families has not been looked at in so many years.  Am I correct in stating there are roughly 60,000 children in foster care?</p></speech>

What would be the figure if all those children were in residential care?  How much are foster families saving the public purse?  This issue is separate from that of better outcomes and all the more important matters we need to be considering; however, with the budget fast approaching, it is a really good time to highlight in the first instance how much the allowance needs to be considered so as to have better outcomes and, second, how much would be saved.  It is an absolute no-brainer.  I do not know why no figures have been mentioned today.  From my understanding, one of the increases people are asking for in the budget is an increase of &euro;100 per week in respect of the allowances for both under-18s and over-18s.  Should it be more than that?  I am interested in the delegates' input in that regard.  I presume an increase would play some part in encouraging other families to foster.  Is this something in addition that we need to consider?</p> <p>  With regard to the recruitment and retention of social workers, what kind of remuneration is needed, and what specific things should the committee know that need to be done?</p><p>When talking about all of these issues, I know I refer many times to "better outcomes".  Speaking from experience, for families with foster children in them, there are better outcomes for the entire family.  I certainly felt that when I was growing up.  There was a better outcome for my entire family because of my foster sister being there.  It is important to highlight that the benefits of fostering are multifold.</p></speech>

First, however, I thank the public representatives who are here today.  I sat at a similar committee meeting where the discussion was about the recruitment and retention of social workers and there was a much smaller number in attendance.  I am delighted there are so many people here today because it shows a fantastic interest in the children of our nation, including the most vulnerable children, and, as Senator Ruane noted, an interest in the most vulnerable parents in the nation.</p> <p>  The recruitment and retention of social workers is key.  There is a shortage of staff in every sector across all of what used to be called the allied healthcare professions.  The IASW worked with the HSE and Tusla to make the case for the inclusion of social workers on the critical skills list, which we achieved.  There are just not enough people.  It is like we have a big pot of jobs and too few people running around inside it.  This shortage means children who are in care do not have a social worker who is the link between them and their family on both sides, that is, their foster family and their birth family.  They do not have that person who should be with them through the process, who knew them before they came into care, works with them while they are in care, knows the details of their life and is in possession of the big file in Tusla that has everything about them in it.  Those people do not exist.  They are what foster carers used to call "lifers" - people who went into social work and, 20 years later, were still knocking on Mrs. Foster Carer's door.  They knew the people they worked with for all that time.  That level of knowledge is not there because people are moving around the system and those types of workers do not exist any more.  People just do not stay in the jobs long enough to build that type of relationship with the children, foster carers and birth families.</p> <p>  Getting enough social workers into the system is key because it makes it less easy for people to move job when the going gets tough.  If the staffing is sufficient, people will actually stay for longer than a year or two and get to know the children and their lives.  I do not know what the answer to that shortage is, but I know it is an absolute crisis for the children, their birth families and foster families that there just are not enough people.  Social work is the profession that took foster care from what it was and developed it into what we know it as now.  Social workers assessed, reviewed and supported the foster carers and managed everything else to do with the process.  We are the profession that knows foster care better than any other.  It is crucial we get enough people into the system.  I do not know the answer as to how we achieve that but I know it is crucial we do.</p></speech>

Ms Bond talked about the care team around the child.  That team needs to be careful the child is not overly pathologised.  I absolutely concur with the need for trauma-informed practice but such practice must look not only at the individual but also at the network of relationships from which the child comes.  It also must look at the network of relationships within the professional setting.  All too often, as we know, the professional network begins to mirror the difficulties out of which the child has come.  I train and work with professionals and I recognise we are not always to the fore in looking at what we are bringing into those networks, what pushes our buttons and our responsibility around our own reflexivity.  Members of the care team need the space in which to look at their own needs.  We know what happens if we do not care for the carers.</p> <p>  Regarding recruitment and retention of foster carers, Carol Coulter has done fantastic work in her court reporting.  Her reportage has been telling us for more than 15 years that there is an overrepresentation of children from diverse backgrounds in the care system.  Internationally, we know there is an overrepresentation of minority populations within care systems and there is also an underrepresentation of those populations as foster carers.  We in Ireland are making all the same mistakes and we should not be doing so.  There are many potential foster carers in diverse communities, if they are spoken to, encouraged and supported.  The best way to recruit foster carers, as Ms Bond may talk more about, is through word of mouth.  We also need exit interviews for every foster carer who leaves Tusla to move to private provision and every foster carer who leaves fostering.  Many of them leave because there is a life cycle to fostering.  People do it for a certain number of years, a bit like rearing children.  We need to gather those data and not necessarily from the organisation with which the foster carer is really annoyed.  We could be in a very good position if many of the services could begin to collate those data.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.518" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rory Brown" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#L00400"><p>There was reference to the issue of support for foster carers and to aftercare supports.  The hardest issue for me in my foster care was that, at 18 years of age, my foster carers could not support me any more.  When people turn 18, the aftercare support goes to the person who has experienced care.  Unfortunately, my foster family was not in a financial position to keep my room open in their house and financially support me to go to college.  Once I got the aftercare support, I went off to college.  To keep my room open for me at weekends, I would have had to pay rent to my foster family, but I could not afford to pay rent in Limerick and to them.  If we are looking at improving support for care leavers, we should look at that situation whereby many of them lose their homes when they reach 18 years of age.  Many foster carers want to keep these young people in their homes but are unable to do so because of their financial position.  They are faced with a decision as to whether they take in another foster child and keep the financial support they are getting or keep the care leaver's room open and lose that money because he or she is going off to college or different things.  That caused a lot of issues for me as I was coming up to the age of 18.  It would be brilliant if we could support both care leavers and their foster families because it would keep a lot of care-experienced young people in higher level education and allow them to come out of the risk of poverty and break the barriers many of them face.  Once they reach 18, they either face homelessness or poverty-stricken issues associated with their foster family.</p> <p>  Connected to that is the importance of social workers.  In my experience, there was a constant rotation of social workers.  I easily dealt with 15 or 20 of them in my ten or 11 years in care.  It may have been more; those are just the ones I can remember.  There were many who breezed in for two or three months before leaving with a "See you later".  I might have only chatted to them once.  This means you have to tell your story again and again.  Their caseloads mean they do not know you or anything about you, so you have to keep telling your story and that causes trust issues.  If you have to keep telling your story over and over and repeating the trauma you have already faced, you start getting annoyed at the system and then you start lashing out or causing issues because you do not and cannot trust anyone.  You are thinking, "Sure, they are going to leave in six months and what is the point of telling them my story if they are going to leave me."  That is where the issues are.  We need to be able to retain social workers and have one person, or even two, dealing with a child.  I know people retire and move on, but if children in care had one or two constant people they could trust, they would have security and feel okay to open up and talk about their problems and needs.  Many of them do not have that and instead just lash out and get labelled.  That is where the stigma comes about against children in care.</p></speech>

An aspect of that which we find important is supporting parents of children in care who have care experience themselves.  When that pilot was being developed, we felt this was an issue that was not really being looked at in detail.  EPIC did interviews with care leaver parents.  We work with people up to the age of 26.  Many of those young people are now parents themselves.  Some of their children are in care.  We feel that, over the course of the next five years of this pilot, that cohort really needs to be championed and to talk about their needs.  They are a minority which is particularly vulnerable.</p> <p>  We are here today to discuss fostering issues.  There is a crisis in fostering and in residential care.  The wider issue is there is an inequality crisis, which is why we see children going into care.  There will always be devastating cases of abuse and neglect.  There will always be a need for a wonderful, thriving foster care system.  Equally, there should be significant interventions in early years to try to make sure children and their families are better supported and protected.  We have all seen in the past couple of weeks that there have been absolutely horrendous cases in the news of young people who were allegedly taken into care more than ten times whose lives have now ended.  The Senator is right that this committee is here to talk about fostering today, but a much wider discussion about the care system is needed.</p> <p>  Going back to Ms O'Toole's original point, maybe it is time for Ireland to review the care system to include the significant progress that has been made on matters such as aftercare and fostering, which is still a robust system overall, but also to address the cracks that National Youth Council of Ireland members and other people are identifying and which Tusla itself has highlighted.  We need to try to galvanise the wider political support and engagement that is necessary.  Only 6,000 children are in care, but they are underrepresented.  Public policy is rarely focused on their voices.  Their voices are seldom heard in general in society.  When we talk about building a care aware society, this is what we are talking about.  I thank everybody for listening today.</p></speech>

The role of the link worker is to support foster carers.  Foster carers, like any parent who is under pressure, do not always parent the way they should or wish.  The point made about that was right.  They have a high turnover of link workers.  It is a supervision relationship, so social workers get supervision and foster carers get supervision.  That is a necessary part of fostering because it is complex.  People can only do that with somebody they know and trust.  Children in care have to tell their stories again and again, as do foster carers.  Foster carers highlight issues repeatedly.  They become frustrated and disenchanted with the system.  They sometimes overstep in their decisions.  We come back to the retention issue.  We need more placements for social workers.  Early intervention services are needed so that social workers are not under such pressure when children come in.  Schools need to be more aware and to have supports in the community so that they are not always reliant on child protection services to intervene.  They need to get those services earlier.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, developed that recently.  More is needed so that can happen.</p> <p>  Social workers in Tusla have said repeatedly that one reason they get burned out and overwhelmed is how contentious the courts system is.  We have an adversarial courts system if children come into care.  It does not work for parents, children or social workers.  It often leads to worse outcomes for families because it is a "he says, she says" evidence-based process that is not collaborative and does not look at the needs of everybody in that system.  I know there are plans to change that, but it shows how vital that is, not just for when they are in the courts but with regard to the systems that are impacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#M00300"><p>I would like to clarify the concept of the care team for the child.  It is not the social work team, but everybody involved in the child's life, whether it is the school, the local services for the child, the GAA club, or the child's family.  As Dr. O'Brien said earlier, a village raises a child.  Everybody works in the best interests of the child.</p> <p>  I go back to Deputy Cairns' point about IFCA's budget submission.  It looked at the value attributed to foster care and the savings foster care provides on behalf of the State.  In IFCA's budget submission, we seek a &euro;100 increase in the foster care allowance.  We are also looking at other peripheral issues such as the back-to-school allowance that should be extended to children in care and issues such as mileage for foster carers, because we have foster carers who drive children many miles throughout the country for visits, including therapeutic visits and visits with their siblings.  We need to try to support this system of foster care.  That is what I was saying earlier.  We are at a juncture where great pressure is coming onto the system at every level, as everybody has attested today, with the children in care, social workers, the high level of burnout, and the fact we cannot retain social workers who are recruited.</p> <p>  We are at a great crossroads here.  It is fantastic the committee is discussing the issue; hence the recommendation by IFCA.  We called it an advisory group.  The Irish Association of Social Workers called it a working group.  It is time to stop and pause and to see what has really gone well in this system.  We do have 90% of children placed in foster care, growing up in family life.  We must remember this is about family life, children going to school every day, meeting their friends, going to the GAA and being in and growing up in communities rather than in alternative arrangements.  We need to celebrate and harness that, but we also need to pause and look at what else needs to happen.  How do we retain the good things we have?  How do we address the many challenges that are presented?  All of us working together need to address these.  That includes increasing family supports for parents so that children do not come into care and providing those supports to children, because, ultimately, nobody wants children to come into care at the end of the day.  Families are the most important place for children.</p> <p>  Our chairperson, Mr. Raymond Nolan, is a foster carer who is at the coalface every day and night.  He tells me about how his young lad in care does not sleep and he is up at 2 o'clock every morning sending me emails.  I ask him to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Raymond Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#M00400"><p>I thank the Chair, Senators and Deputies.  After listening to everybody's contributions today, one more comes to my mind, which is investment in the child in care and investment in the needs and supports for foster parents.  Other investments come to mind too.  The child is front and centre.  At the child's shoulder is a foster family in 90% of cases.  These two young people, Ms Lauren O'Toole and Mr. Rory Brown, are a testament to good foster care.  Unfortunately, the outcomes are not always that good.  They are not as good as a guy becoming a teacher.  To come through the care system and become a teacher is fantastic.  This investment needs to happen.  I think of what Senator O'Sullivan said earlier about reports in 18 months.  We do not have 18 months to save and improve the system.  We need to act immediately.  It is important to support the children and meet their needs.</p> <p>  I have two basic rules and principles in foster care.  The first one is to care for and nurture children, meet their needs, and uphold their rights.  The second rule is not to forget the first rule.  It is important to meet children's needs.  Their needs are not being met in foster care.  We are waiting too long for services.  I know of an incident in our home where a child waited for two and a half years for an assessment.  Something that was actioned by Tusla in March 2020 only concluded this summer.  We got the report in August.</p><p>Two and a half years is a long time in the life of a child aged 11 or 12.  It is too long.  These children will be adults at 18.  From studies, we know they are way behind a child turning 18 in the broader community and population.  In instances, they are a long way behind, maybe seven to ten years in the case of foetal alcohol syndrome.  It is also unfair to call a child who has been in the care system an adult at 18.  It is very unfair.  We are not looking at this in a proper manner at all.  We are just not doing our job.  We are ticking boxes.  It is grand to roll out specific services, and they are gratefully accepted, but it is no good if they are not available to the children who need them.  I always consider for comparison the question of how long I would wait to go to see a dentist if I had a toothache.  Would I wait two and a half years?  I certainly would not.  This is the measure we must look at.  These children are in care for a reason.  Sometimes the reason is neglect.  Therefore, it is very unfair when they come into State care that it neglects them as well by having them wait for two and a half years to receive a service.  Provision should be instant, and it needs to be so if we are to succeed.</p><p> Regarding supporting foster parents and the allowance in that regard, we have had one increase in 21 years, and that was in 2009.  That increase was &euro;6.  What does this say?  We have been here before talking about pensions.  We need this facet looked at immediately as well.  We cannot fight a war without soldiers.  I am referring to foster parents and social workers in this case.  It just will not happen.  Great work is done in the Department and in Tusla.  We must, though, up the ante, because I am sure there are many children who should be in care but there are no homes for them to go to.  My wife and I have 16 years' experience and I have not seen enough progress in that time.  It has just been static.  It is actually nearly going backwards.  We must really take a look at this system.  All the stakeholders must sit around the same table, including EPIC, Tusla, IFCA, the Ombudsman for Children and whoever else has a vested interest, and come to an immediate conclusion.  Work should start on this immediately.  These children have rights, and we must vindicate those rights and meet their needs.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. Brown.  I was a primary school teacher in a previous life, when I was 20 back in 1987.  I started teaching that year.  Back then, the World Bank was going to foreclose on Ireland's national debt.  We had a Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, who told us we were living beyond our means.  Basically, as a country, we did not have a pot to urinate in.  We did not, however, have children asleep in the classroom because they were living in family hubs, homeless or living in hotels.  Even though we were in such a parlous state, we were building houses.  We did not have the level of homelessness, poverty and inequality we have now.</p> <p>  I was struck listening to all the witnesses, because my journey into this building and this committee room has come through our experience as a family of having a child and now an adult with additional needs in this country.  In the past 15 years, things have deteriorated terribly.  Mr. Nolan said there has been no progress in social care in past 16 years and that, in fact, things might be going backwards.  Well, in the disability sector, the system has absolutely collapsed.  It has failed.  We had Paul Reid in here only a few weeks ago.  I asked if we could have the intellectual honesty we had with the financial crash, when it was accepted we needed to be bailed out.</p> <p>  Therefore, I feel like I am sending the witnesses a postcard from the future regarding all the issues they highlighted.  In our case, there are no physiotherapists and no physiotherapy.  There are no speech and language therapists to meet children's needs.  They are being failed.  There is no early intervention.  Childhoods are lost.  Every measure in our sector is failing.  There are suboptimal outcomes, including isolation, poverty, homelessness and suboptimal medical outcomes.  We are actually inflicting harm on tens of thousands of children.  This is the direction in which the witnesses' social care sector is heading.  It is not possible to recruit or retain social workers for the same reason we cannot keep our nurses, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.</p> <p>  Therefore, we have had a State, or rather a polity, that for the past 20 years has not valued care or caring.  It does not value these endeavours.  It places very little value on these types of activities.  I did the mathematics on my phone here.  If it does cost &euro;6,000 a week to keep one person in residential care, then that amounts to &euro;2 billion annually.  We have had 20 years of a neoliberal agenda that reifies the private sector, the commodification of care and its subcontracting.  It is an approach that has failed completely.  I never know from one day to the next whether somebody is going to come for my son.  It means we are robbed of all the normal anticipation of going to college.  That is replaced with precarity and fear etc.  I refer to the point Senator Ruane highlighted earlier in respect of reinforcing, corroborating and extending all the correlated causalities of poverty and people going into homelessness, care and crisis.  Unfortunately, this winter, and in future, we are going to see much more of this.</p> <p>  I have two questions for the witnesses and one observation.  The first question concerns the fact I certainly noticed a very rapid deterioration in the global sets of measurements for disability services with the onset of the economic crash and the subsequent austerity.  Imposing cuts on the most vulnerable in society was seen as a virtue.  Pain and suffering were imposed on the weakest and the most vulnerable people, and that has been our lived experience.  I can trace this process back to the crash and when we bailed out the banks and socialised their debts.  That was the point when things got tough for us, and they have now become impossible.  Will the witnesses similarly trace back a deterioration in the social care system to that point as well?</p> <p>  My second question concerns that fact that, despite all the virtue signalling and expressions of empathy and sympathy, I feel we do not have a Government that really wants to get to grips with this situation.  I have some ideas in this regard.  I think we need to have legislation that forces the provision of social care.  I refer to legislation that legally obliges the State to provide services and care.  My understanding as a layperson is that Ireland is an outlier in that we do not have a set of social care and well-being laws, as is the case in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany and every other country in the EU.  We do not have that.  As far as I am aware, we are the only country in the EU that provides care and services on a kind of grace and favour basis.  It is not possible to demand these services.  The HSE cannot be legally obliged to provide services or, I imagine, Tusla or any other organisation.  These are provided based on grace and favour.  Do the witnesses think it would be helpful if I were to get my colleagues to assist me in working to draft this type of legislation?  It would be based on the best templates in Germany and elsewhere.  Those are my two questions.  </p> <p>  My observation is that we need change politically in respect of what we value.  The focus for the past 30 years has been on neoliberal ideas of fixing the economy and of doing so being so important.  We need to fix our society.  We had intellectual and ethical failures in the Celtic tiger years that have not been addressed.  All I would say to Sinn F&eacute;in and Mary Lou McDonald is, "No pressure."</p><p>This is what we need.  I refer to people like Ms O'Toole and Mr. Brown.  We have heard hundreds of therapists telling the same story over and over.  Ms O'Toole and Mr. Brown have had their past and their development contaminated by this situation.  Equally, however, their future has also been affected.  I do not know if they can have the modest ambition to have a roof over their heads and to make whatever life decisions they wish to.  In that context, who can foster children in that environment?  It is a functional prerequisite of human life to have shelter and support.  These are listed in the UN charter of fundamental human rights.  We do not have them in Ireland anymore.  By definition, therefore, this makes us a dysfunctional society and the focus needs to move from the economy to society.  Can the witnesses trace a deterioration in social care and, if so, to what point do they trace it back?  I certainly can in our lived experience.  Do the witnesses believe we need a social care Act and another Act to oblige and legally require the State to provide therapies and services for our most vulnerable citizens?</p></speech>

Regarding his comments about the need to change and fix society in some way, his reference to the need for shelter and support as two basics that should be enshrined in legislation, and his comments concerning who will be able to foster if people cannot even put roofs over their own heads, and who our future foster carers are going to be in that context, one thing I know from practice is that I have met families who are kinship carers, we call them relative foster carers, and they are caring for one or two relatives, such as a niece, a nephew, etc., and doing a really good job.  Then they lose their tenancy because the landlord wants them out, for no reason.  It could be that the landlord needs the house back or whatever.  These people have no priority in our local authorities and they are providing homes.</p> <p>  I remember one case where kinship carers were providing homes for two children, who were doing really well, plus their own children, and they were being put out on the street.  I asked if the local authority could do something to get this family housed.  The answer was " No".  Being foster carers gave them no right above anybody else to have a roof over their heads.  What are we doing to those children?  We take them into care and then we let them be turfed out onto the street and maybe put into a hotel.  In the case I referred to, that did not happen because another family stepped in and gave those children somewhere to live.  They are doing fine, just to let everyone know it is all okay.  I was, however, shocked when I came across that case.  That was only one specific instance.  Quite a few people providing kinship care to children are living in rented accommodation because of the housing crisis.  They get moved around, as do the children.  </p> <p>  Neither Tusla nor the local authorities seem to be able to do anything about this situation.  There is no joined-up thinking in respect of how we deal with these children.  Social workers on their own of course cannot magic up answers to all these problems.  Regarding legislation to give people the right to care, I have also worked at the disability end of service provision and I understand exactly the Senator's anxieties from that perspective.  It is absolutely chronic that the most vulnerable are the people who are being dumped on all the time.  Every time things go down, they get dumped on.  People lose services and virtually nothing is happening in that respect.  Children in care, then, face this kind of double jeopardy, in that they might also have some kind of disability.  I have seen children waiting for assessments for autism, for example.  The least that could be done would be to rule out the possibility.  They may be traumatised, but they are left wallowing in that situation while waiting for an assessment.  </p> <p>  Children are only children for 18 years and that is not long.  Their lives move in half terms once they hit school.  Another half term is over every six weeks and then another term, another half-year and another year and children then move on into another class in school.  I had to work in a school to realise that.  When I realised it, however, I thought to myself that we need to move much faster for our children.  Therefore, any legislation that can help things to move faster for children is, to my mind, an advantage to all of us, whether we are talking about the foster carer, the child, the social worker or anyone, any other professionals, trying to work in the system.  I refer to getting some right to care and some recognition that the children who have to come into care are those who are the most vulnerable of all.  They are a small number of children and, therefore, their voice is not huge.</p></speech>

I was going to say &quot;peak&quot; and mention a political party, but I will not.  It is so completely and utterly dysfunctional that even in their shiny neoliberal dream, we cannot even get workers to come here now for the shiny tech industry because there is nowhere for them to live.  We have reached the absolute peak of this approach and we need a reset.  The policy, ideologically and philosophically, has shown itself unwilling to help us.  Therefore, there needs to be a legislative compulsion to do so, as a starting point.  It should be in the same vein as the legal requirement for cars to have passed a national car test, NCT, before being taken onto the road.</p><p>There must be an absolute legal requirement for the HSE and the State to provide these services and care.  Part of this speaks to treating social workers, nurses, doctors and teachers with little bit of respect.  We must be one of the only jurisdictions where doctors, nurses and teachers are demonised in our public discourse.  All these aspects feed into one another.  Listening to the witnesses today, I felt there was a similar experience.  It has not got there yet, but it is heading in that direction.  Therefore, we must work together.  If any of the witnesses are available after this meeting, I am attempting to get to the point where we can put together some kind of draft legislation in this area, because it is missing.  I refer to the witnesses' expertise in this area.  I am sure they are <i>au fait</i>with best practice legislation or a template for legislation in another jurisdiction that might address these issues.</p></speech>

Our Constitution now only recognises the right to education.  It does not contain the right to housing or other things.  Were we to legislate for economic, social and cultural rights, that would bring us more into line with human rights law.</p> <p>  Turning to the Senator's other question, while I think the societal conditions that result in children being brought into care, as I said earlier, have worsened and that there is an inequality crisis in Ireland, and Senator Clonan has explained succinctly why this is, I do not think it is fair to say the care system itself has deteriorated in line with those conditions.  In EPIC, while we have seen that there is so much more to be done, so much that can be done better and major requirements for investment in political will, we have also seen advances in the care system in the last decade.   Mr. Brown will speak more succinctly to this point, but we have seen much progress within Tusla, better awareness of the situation of children in care and the advent of services that are more specific.  In that context, we do have people like Ms Bair&eacute;ad who are brilliant, are advocates and are out there talking about the situation of children in care.  We also have a thriving civil society, including IFCA and others.</p> <p>  Where we would like to see a better understanding of the care system reflected is in enshrining the different rights which should exist.  I refer not just to economic, social and cultural rights more broadly, but, for example, the right of children in the care system to be heard in line with Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.  This could be done through having aspects such as independent advocacy contained in legislation, as it is in other EU member states.  In EPIC, we were recently given the most humbling donation, namely, the proceeds of the Justice for Magdalenes research group's books.</p><p>The authors of the book <i>Ireland and the Magdalene Laundries: A Campaign for Justice</i>asked the survivors who gave their testimony what they wanted done with the royalties.  They asked that they be given to EPIC because they wanted to make sure that no child in care or a care-experienced young person ever had to live without having a voice.  We feel very humbled by that.  It subsequently happened again with the second book, about redress.  We feel very strongly that independent advocacy should be enshrined in legislation.  As the members can see, all children in care and young people with care experience have a voice but that voice is seldom heard.  We are here today to further facilitate young people to speak directly to their experiences.  It should not be incumbent on an NGO like EPIC.  That is something the State should look for, believe in and want to seek out proactively.</p></speech>

I have been on EPIC's youth council for five years but it is only in the last two years that I have seen massive progress in us talking about the care system, talking about changing the system and wanting to make that change.  Ms Ryan spoke about the Magdalen laundries.  There have been so many issues in the past but they have been covered over.  It is only now that we are starting to talk about these things and talk about the care system, how we can improve it and how we need to focus on the child and giving the child a voice.  That is one of the biggest things.  Once you give a child a voice, you can start improving things.  Lately we were working with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on the national access plan.  We are lucky that care leavers are finally mentioned in the national access plan for the first time, even though this is the fourth access plan.  That is just amazing.  We are finally being noticed.  People are finally starting to realise we need to do something for these kids to ensure they can succeed.  That notice is only just starting to happen.  The more we get a voice to young people with care experience, the more we can change the system for the better and work on that.<br/><br/>When we talk about the State, it is <i>in loco parentis</i>.  It is supposed to be the caregiver of that child.  It is important that we have legislation that holds the State responsible for the needs of a child.  At the moment, those responsibilities are being landed on people like myself or teachers in the classroom.  They have to do it because children do not have the services or places to go to get that support so teachers, foster carers and social workers are doing it.  They are not trained properly to deal with that or provide the supports the child needs.  That is very important.  If we can help children get the support quicker and hold the Government responsible for that, that would be massive in ensuring they get the support they need.</p></speech>

I ask Ms Bair&eacute;ad and Ms Bond to be brief in their responses because we still have two other people who want to speak.</p></speech>

A social worker having to refer a birth family to housing so they can have their child returned, having the foster family referred to housing, which is only a letter in advocacy, just cannot work.  We do not have a system that can be designed for those services to work together around a child.  There has to be something in place.  There are many services doing their best to try to work together but there is not a system in place to make sure that is done in a systemic way.  Children are frequently failed because of that.  Whenever the committee is proposing to draft has to have that practicality in it.</p> <p>  Assessments are all well and good and I do a lot of them.  However, the assessment has to demand that intervention is provided as well.  Whatever it is, it has to be the service that actually helps.  It is no good for a family to just have an answer.  They often know there is a problem with their child and they probably guessed what the problem is.  They need the help to then do something about that and support their child to meet their potential.  The intervention has to be there as well as the assessment.</p></speech>

I alluded to that my opening statement.  When children in the care of the State were under the HSE, they had rights and were prioritised for services.  That positive discrimination for children in the care of the State was lost in translation when the Child and Family Agency was established.  If there was one thing to come from this meeting, it is that we should look to have that reinstated very quickly.</p> <p>  On the legislative infrastructure, the rights of the child are enshrined in our Constitution.  This country has ratified the UN Convention with regard to children with disabilities, children's voices and children's right to be heard.  We should focus on what we already have in place and try to work better and hold the Government to account.  Children's voices are not being heard and services are not being offered to children.  The Ombudsman for Children has highlighted the deficiencies for children with disabilities and children accessing services.  We already have pillars that we can use make them work for us better.  We are also reviewing the Child Care Act at the moment.  Foster carers spend an inordinate amount of time fighting for the rights of children and fighting for services for them when their time is best spent supporting those children.  We in IFCA spend copious amounts of time advocating for foster carers.  We have an advocacy service that supports foster carers when allegations of abuse are made against them, which is a very traumatic experience for foster carers.  Their lives and those of their families are held in suspension for weeks and months, or in some cases years, before there is an outcome from an allegation of abuse made against them.  We have a tall order of work to do but we have the infrastructure within our current legislation if we could make it work.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses.  Everyone is very passionate about this matter.  It brought me back to the issue of the mother and baby homes.  We worked with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on that.  The Minister is very committed to supporting and working with everyone.  It is important that we mention that because he is very passionate about his remit.  All of us on this committee have worked very well with him.</p> <p>  I am very lucky in the sense that I know a lot of foster families in my own area.  The children are the light of their lives.  I have worked with families and given references for some because I know how committed they are.  I have huge concerns about this area.  In 2001, the working group on foster care said there needs to be an increase in the allowance, as well as the aftercare allowance.  Mr. Brown spoke about that.  That is a huge concern for me.  We are looking at the cost of living and everybody wants the best.  It is important that no family, particularly a foster family, is in a position where they are struggling.  I do not think that should happen.  We should look at the provision of mileage, supports and allowances to foster carers, especially with regard to the back to school allowance.  Would it be more beneficial to families to have extra supports there?</p> <p>  I have been taking notes.  I feel that foster carers provide an invaluable contribution to the State because they want to bring positive change into the lives of children in need.  I know so many foster families and this is what they are about.  The supports have to be looked at.  A family that was in contact with me recently pointed out that while foster carers receive payments for fostering children, they receive no PRSI credits from the State and so are not eligible to receive a pension.  Some of these foster parents are doing this on a full-time basis and they are are not entitled to it.  I have huge issues with that.  They should be entitled to a pension.  That is something we need to look at, whether through legislation or whatever else we can do because that is important.</p><p> I was very annoyed.  A foster family I know came to me whose child had missed the school bus place because of the mix up.  While it is great to see that we had the free bus for the year for primary and post primary children, there were no exceptions made.  That is a considerable issue.  It is the same for housing.  I am working on housing for families in my area.  There has to be a priority.  There has to be some legislation under which a foster family should, under no circumstances, lose a home or be in a situation where they cannot be in a home.  If we learn one thing from today, it should be that we put in supports.  I will speak to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, about this.  I have spoken before about this to him.  We need to prioritise these issues.  On the scale of things, they should be easily done.  It is just a matter of prioritising the most vulnerable and those who need it the most.  I am absolutely committed to that.</p><p> I know supports are such an issue, whether it is occupational or speech-and-language therapy.  That needs to be addressed.  I was touched by all of the witnesses' presentations.  What do they feel is the struggle that causes families not to foster any more?  Is there an issue we could solve?  We need foster families.  We need them for children who are vulnerable.  How do we try to solve this?  If we do not look at anything else from today, maybe we could look at that.</p><p> I say well done Mr. Brown and all of the witnesses.  I have not got my glasses on and I cannot see the names.  I apologise.  I came down without my glasses.  I learned a considerable amount today.  I am working away and I know we have much to do.  However, it is important we say that the Minister is committed.  The Government will listen.  I can assure the witnesses that I will be shouting and doing what I can for them.  </p></speech>

I am sure the IFCA will also have something to say.  What we know about foster carers is that most people who come to fostering are either friends or relations of somebody who fostered or have somehow come by an experience of fostering, thought it was lovely and great and that they could do it.  They go in with their eyes open because they know what fostering is about.</p> <p>  One of the issues in Tusla, where I quite recently worked in fostering for four years, the bank of social workers on a fostering team is suddenly told by their manager that Tusla needs to have a fosterering recruitment campaign and tells the lads and lassies to go off to recruit foster carers.  The social workers have to drop everything they are doing.  They are going around with leaflets into places such as GAA clubs.  They are putting up posters in shops and asking grace and favour.  That is no way to use Tusla's social workers.  However, it is the old way.  The old way used to be to get people up to the pulpit to talk in the churches, because that is where people gathered, but there are much newer ways of doing things nowadays.  It is wrong to ask the already-very-stretched social work personnel to do this campaign.  Something more needs to be done to recruit people.</p> <p>  Think of what we know.  We know that people who are linked to fostering will come forward.  How does one get to those people?  We know that people in caring professions are more likely to come forward, as foster carers, than people in other professions who would not have that sort of nature.  That is the wrong word, but the Deputy knows what I mean.  It is amazing how many children of foster carers become social care workers or nurses.</p></speech>

We need to address that rather than ask social workers to drop all their cases because, sure enough, something nasty will happen in one of those cases and a social worker will have dropped the ball on what really was his or her job, while he or she was going around to GAA clubs to hand out leaflets.</p></speech>

Safeguarding Ireland has done a massive job - not for a massive sum of money - on getting information out about violence against and abuse of elderly people.  It uses the same ads over and over again.  It just keeps running them.  Something like that becomes almost subliminal, in the same way that we were all convinced to drink Coca-Cola.  One does not even see fostering anymore but hears it in the back of one's head somewhere.</p></speech>

They need timely supports when they ask for them.  There is no point, when foster carers say that their child is climbing up the wall and they do not know what to do, to have somebody say that there is no social worker to go out to them.  We see dual social-worker allocation in some areas.  There are particular black spots in the country where the child might have a social worker but the foster carer does not.  There are foster carers who do not have linked social workers as we speak.</p> <p>  Foster carers are tired and they do not feel respected.  I hear anecdotal stories of the social worker years ago who used to come to have a cup of tea at the table and a chat to check how things were going.  That is no longer the case.  We are talking about business processes, checklists and scrutiny.  It is more quantitative and less qualitative.  We need foster carers to feel supported and, most importantly, respected.  We are aware of a number of foster carers who have dipped into their own financial resources to take judicial reviews to get outcomes or decisions about children in their care.</p> <p>  We have an annual fostering fortnight every spring time which promotes the importance of foster care in the lives of children.  We really put out that message with regard to what fostering can do.  Our last survey said that 90% of foster carers would state that fostering has improved and contributes to their lives but, conversely, they are saying they would not recommend fostering to somebody else.  We are at that critical juncture today.</p></speech>

It is a very complex issue.  The range of topics we covered has reflected that complexity.  I do not envy the staff having to write up the Official Report of this afterwards.  We have looked at individual practice issues, broader general Tusla issues and the wider social issues that are the foundation and the basics.</p> <p>  I will pull it into that middle ground but, first, I will comment on privatisation.  I completely agree with what is written about privatisation.  Empowering People in Care, EPIC, have been very clear in advertising and advocating that it is not just about foster care, it is about residential care.  Six thousand euro is cheap for a placement.  When I was a social worker I signed off on much more than &euro;6,000.  A placement for &euro;6,000 would make my principal social worker smile.  It is very cheap.</p> <p>  It is important to differentiate between the foster carers who are with a private agency, who are just as dedicated and committed and provide the same quality of service, from the private foster care company that exists to make profit.  The marginal cost to Tusla of private foster care placements is increased to three or four times the cost.  It is a greater drain on resources, especially the most precious resource, that is, time.</p> <p>  That creates the problem Ms McGuirk was talking about wherein social workers, because they are losing time, cannot put the time into recruitment, the report, training or supervision.  One ultimately ends up with a weaker service and a greater reliance on the private agencies.</p><p>Essentially, there are private agencies that are weakening Tusla while at the same time strengthening their ability to make profit.  I am sorry but that is the behaviour of a parasite.  I have a significant issue with agencies that look at the misery of care we have reflected and see profit.</p><p> The issue of the first placement, as raised by Ms Bair&eacute;ad, is a huge one.  This is one that we are not necessarily grappling with from a Tusla perspective.  So many times, that first placement is chaos.  It is 4.55 p.m. on a Friday and it is just for the weekend but the next thing we know, the kid is there six years later without a care plan.  If they are lucky, maybe it is the first of six placements in six weeks.  When thinking about that first placement, we need to challenge Tusla practice on that.</p><p> With regard to the mental health services, I strongly believe we need in-house therapeutic supports for Tusla.  CAMHS and the likes are totally overloaded.  If we say children in care should have priority, then we need bespoke, in-house therapeutic services for them reflect the need for priority and the complex dramatic issues we have been talking about.</p><p> I have spoken with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, about the need for in-house, therapeutic services.  He is probably bored with me talking about it but I feel he understands this and is doing his best to implement it.  One of the things I would like to see from this, and from the report, which is our responsibility as members of the committee, is to give the Minister levers to pull.  I believe the Minister understands the crisis he faces, and we need to give him solutions and levers he can pull.  The working group is a very positive part of that.  I would like to dig more into that but I probably should have read the document beforehand.  I may come back to the witnesses afterwards on that.  That is a very important one.</p><p> I have some questions for the Irish Association of Social Workers and the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, on the issue of the demographics.  We have spoken about demographic change impacting on recruitment.  What does Tusla need to do differently?  What is it doing wrong?  How do we address this?  How do we, as a State, and Tusla, as the agency, respond to the shifting demographics?</p><p> The other issue is the kinship care.  Dr. O'Brien said it is about 30% here.  In Northern Ireland, it is the opposite - it is  70%.  In some in some health and social care areas, trust areas or whatever they call them in the Six Counties, they are doing significantly better.  What are we doing differently?  What are we doing wrong and how can we improve that?  Has the Signs of Safety programme impacted on that?  We can argue another day about the practice but in theory, the Signs of Safety programme is supposed to pull in everyone. Surely that Signs of Safety planning meeting can be a recruitment for the kinship care.  If that is not happening, why is that not happening?  Is it a fundamental problem with Signs of Safety that we need to talk about?  We could be here for hours on that alone.</p><p> With regard to private family placements, guardianship payments are incredibly hard to get.  Again, we could get really stuck in on the private family placements, which are effectively outsourced foster placements.  We are just not giving the supports to these.</p><p> I will stick with those two questions for the minute.  We have a Minister who gets it and who gets that there is a crisis.  He wants to do something.  It would be really positive if this committee, through its report and through the witnesses' organisations, could give the Minister very practical things  he could do next.  The committee will be writing a report and putting recommendations.  What are the things the witnesses would like to see, in black and white, that should be achievable?  There is an equality crisis, yes, but I am not sure that we can fix the equality crisis into-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.552" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Valerie O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#R00400"><p>In our presentation today, we said that it was linked to a change in demographics, the ongoing stress of living and the effects.  With demographics we need good information systems in Tusla.  It is paying people every month, so it has systems there.  It has a national system to pay every month.  Why is that data system not being used to profile who is fostering and what their ages are so we can predict?  It is not rocket science in terms of the information systems - information systems with quantitative data - to profile our foster carers.</p> <p>  One of our recommendations is that exit interviews for every foster carer, either moving to private agencies or leaving, should be conducted, of course with the co-operation of the foster carers.  I would recommend that this should be outsourced to IFCA.  It is a body that is independent of the service provider.  There should be an exit interview for anybody leaving foster care.</p> <p>  The elephant in the room, which is not being named today, is around the unintended consequences of regulatory requirements.  We have gone full-blown in terms of regulatory.  It is hard to argue against good regulation of children in care, child welfare systems and foster care systems, but some of the regulatory requirements are driving foster carers out the door.  It is a private domain of family life, which is the great thing about it, but in terms of the regulatory requirements and the inspections, there are some nebulous rules, and that is not what we are not talking about here.</p></speech>

The therapeutic support hubs and the national advocacy service for birth parents are both being established.  If they are to work well they are going to need people to staff them, which is beyond social work.  The social work placement piece is important.  Tusla has done a really good job of offering students placements.  I believe that every student who wishes to have a placement can have one in Tusla now.  There has been a really good response to that and it is something that Tusla has done very well.  Other State bodies can do the same thing.  They can ask Tusla what it did and try to replicate it.  We need those social workers and services across the board if they are going to do this.</p> <p>  It also means that we need to be focusing within Tusla and the HSE disability and mental health services.  We need to be offering training programmes within those that allow them to meet the needs, as with the Judiciary.  Everyone needs to have that training.  We need to have something established that will review what training people need.  The colleges have to do it but we also need to be able to do that in-house for all of them.  It is changing all the time.  "Trauma" is the buzz word at the moment.  A few years ago it was "attachment".  It will be something else again.  We need people who are in those services to be competent to be able to do that.  If Tusla is going to offer that within the therapeutic support hub, and Barnardos within the parent advocacy support service, they are only going to work of those people are available and trained well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.554" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022092000002#R00600"><p>The kinship care question is very important.  The more we can keep children within their wider family circle the better.  It keeps coming back to supports.  What kinds of supports do these families need?  If they have a child placement they need to have continuous contact with the link social worker.  They need those support structures and when they ask for help they need to get help in the here and now and not, as Mr. Nolan said, get an assessment for a child in two years' time.  Some of the asks for the Minister are very solution focused in that sense.</p> <p>  The Signs of Safety programme has been very positive.  It has been there for a long time now - I believe for four or five years.  I am not sure if there are plans to evaluate that but it would be useful to have an evaluation to see how many children the programme has prevented coming into the care system and the percentage of children coming into the care system as a result of doing an analysis or an assessment within families.</p> <p>  With private fostering arrangements, we really need to get beyond that anomaly.  We have numbers of people contacting IFCA.  There are grandparents caring for teenage children.  These carers are neither fish nor fowl.  They are not foster carers and they are not recognised as family.  There are no financial supports for those grandparents to look after children.  We all know the cost of raising teenagers.  It is quite expensive.</p> <p>  As Dr. O'Brien said, the exit interview is very appropriate.  The one thing we are missing is that we are not, to my knowledge, gathering data on placement endings.  IFCA advocates only has four part-time advocates.  In 2021, we supported 30 families who had placement breakdowns.  To date in 2022, we have supported 27 families where there is imminent or actual placement endings.</p><p>We are not capturing the data on the contributing factors to those placement endings.  If we used a triage system, that way, for the emergency, we might be able to put the supports in place for foster carers who are shouting from the rooftops for supports for their foster children, not for themselves.  We also need to look at the broader family support systems that are offered within Tusla and beyond through the prevention, partnership and family support, PPFS, system.  We should be linking foster carers on the ground with organisations, whether they are parent and toddler groups or afterschool clubs in the locality.  We should be thinking more broadly about alternative carer family supports.  We should be thinking across lines more.  Foster carers need to be seen as part of the team.  There needs to be a partnership with them and they need to be respected.  Their views and opinions need to count.  That is not the case at the moment.</p></speech>

We talk about supports and the supports we are looking for, putting in these supports will cost something.  However, when we look at it, and I have just done the basic maths here, it costs &euro;312,00 to support one child in residential care for one year.  That is mental when we compare it to the current rate for foster home care, which is &euro;18,300.  We can use that money we are paying for residential and private residential care to create and put in place these supports that foster carers, foster kids and everyone needs.  Now, the money is going to paying for these placements for children, which are important at the moment.  However, the quicker we can change the system to include more foster carers, even if they are private caregivers, it means that there will be more money for putting in place the supports that we are all talking about here.  When we are looking at these issues, that is the direction in which we need to move.  The quicker we do that, the quicker we can have that financial support in the correct services that are needed.</p></speech>

The reason we chose to insert that in our discussion document was that we are calling for a debate on the issue.  We did not have time to discuss it today, because of the complexity of the issue.  It is not for a moment that we are opposed to private providers of care, but it is complex at a wider level.  The Government really needs to look at the commodification of care, who needs and who provides care, at what cost, and with what consequences.</p></speech>

Every foster care review or report is available on the HIQA website.  We now need to begin to do a synthesis.  It fills many agencies with a lot of trepidation and huge fear.  There is a need for different dialogues to happen.</p></speech>

Tusla is required to produce reports on the adequacy of services, and things like that.  However, we have seen, when representatives have been in here and we have asked them about the number of social workers Tusla needs, that there is no workforce planning.  There is no demand anticipation, which would help with a target for the number of social workers and foster carers that need to be recruited.  I think that as well as the legislative requirement for independent advocacy for both children in care and for parents, some element of workforce planning and demand anticipation is required, whether that is done through the corporate planning process that happens between the Department and Tusla.  We need to ensure that those two bits are happening.  That is the research that we are all talking about needing.  I will definitely leave it there.</p></speech>

Since the last time I sat in this chair, Tusla has put a lot of measures in place that have helped.  In every area, it has assigned a principal social worker who is responsible for students.  When a student arrives in Tusla, they get a laptop, a phone and a space to sit.  That is huge, compared to what is happening in the HSE.  If the HSE was doing half of what Tusla is doing, I would be a very happy person.  The HSE is treating all of its professionals and social workers at the bottom of the pile with much more disdain, in terms of supporting their placements, etc.  Tusla has come a long way.  It has done that because it needs the people to come through its door and start working for the organisation.  That is Tusla's aim in doing it, to get the students in.  There is one office in the middle of town.  I joke that there is a tripwire from Trinity College into Lord Edward Street, and Tusla trips the students up as they come out when they graduate.  Every year, a big gang of them go to work in Lord Edward Street.  It is a nice office to work in and is in the middle of town.  It is a tough place to work, but there is a great atmosphere.  The problem is that they do not stay there for too long, because as soon as they move into the next phase of their lives, which might be settling down and having a family, that kind of work just does not fit with getting home at six o'clock in the evening.  More is needed because the pressures, when Tusla gets them in the door, are too great to retain them.  It is not work that is for everyone.  I am not sure what Tusla can do.  It is getting as many graduates out of the colleges as it can.</p></speech>

It is a kind of chicken-and-egg situation.  I am not sure how we can get more practice teachers to take more students that are put in the colleges, because if we increase the number of college places and there is nowhere for them to do their practice placements, it will not work.</p></speech>

We have been through it.  We are changing it for the people who are going to go through it and who are currently going through it, who may not have a voice and may think that their voice is not going to be heard.  It is an honour for us to be here to be able to advocate for those people, but we need to make sure that after this conversation, it does not fall flat on its face.  It needs to go somewhere.  Work needs to happen and progress needs to be made.</p></speech>

As I said previously, when I become a teacher, I am going to be coming up against many of these kids who are coming through the care system.  I have already met kids who are in the care system.  I faced the issues they are experiencing.  Gladly, I am able to tell them that I have gone through it and I can share my experiences with them.  However, many of them do not have that role model.  They need the support from others.  They need so much more.  That is what I am hoping for with the discussions.  As I said, discussions about the care system have only really started to take place in the last few years.  The more that we can get that work going, the better it will be.  We can make the changes to the care system that are needed.  I am glad that we are starting to chat and talk about it.</p></speech>

I think it was a great discussion and engagement.  I know that I allowed all speakers to go over time.  I did that on purpose so that we could have that discussion and engagement.  We are also going to have more meetings on this topic.  We certainly do not want the issue to fall on deaf ears or to go nowhere.  It is a topic that we have wanted to look at for a long time.  Coming out of Covid, we have a lot more flexibility.  The discussion has been great for us, and I thank the witnesses sincerely for that.  However, I would like to single out Ms O'Toole and Mr. Brown and thank them for their input.  It is not easy to come in and tell your story.  I totally agree that they are a fantastic voice and great advocates for all the other children.  They said it was an honour to come in.  To be honest, it is an honour for us to have them in and to hear their stories and their voices.  I wish them the very best of luck in everything they do.  I thank all the other groups represented.  There will be other meetings, and I am sure the witnesses will be tuning into them.</p><p>When we have our report done - we will give Deputy Costello the job of writing everything out - we will give everyone a copy of it as well.  I propose that we publish the opening statements to the Oireachtas website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss aligning education with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  On behalf of our committee I extend a very warm welcome to: the Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley; Martina Mannion, assistant secretary for special education and inclusion, Department of Education; as well as Brendan Doody and Martin McLoughlin from the special education section within the Department of Education.  The Minister may call on her officials to speak briefly for clarification during the meeting or specifically if a technical point arises and officials may clarify issues.  Any follow-up question should be put to the Minister as Ministers are the accountable person before the committee.</p> <p>  I am aware that a wide range of issues will be the subject of the discussion today and, if necessary, further and more detailed information on certain issues raised can be sent to the clerk to the committee to be circulated to members.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will refer to privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of identifiable persons or entities, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  Members are reminded also of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons outside of the House or officials in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in the public meetings.  In this regard, I ask all members participating through Microsoft Teams that prior to making their contribution, they confirm that they are within the grounds of the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  Without further ado I call now on the Minister, Deputy Foley, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

At the outset, I thank him and the committee for the invitation to be here today.  I am accompanied, as the Cathaoirleach has already outlined, by the following officials from my Department, namely, Martina Mannion, assistant secretary for special education and inclusion; Brendan Doody, principal officer, special education section; and Martin McLoughlin, principal officer, special education section.</p> <p>  The topic before the committee today is aligning education with the UNCRPD and in particular, a focus on progress being made on aligning special education policy with the vision for inclusive education as articulated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As Minister for Education, I am committed to making a difference for students who have additional needs as part of an inclusive education system.  I know that this commitment is also shared by the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion in the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan.</p> <p>  It is important that I outline to the committee the Government&rsquo;s ambition to develop an inclusive education system that meets the needs of all children regardless of disability or other disposition.  At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to all our school staff at every level for the work they do.  Their work and commitment ensures that children with special educational needs can attend school and participate in school life to the fullest possible extent.</p> <p>  As a Government, we fully recognise the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education system.  It is my firm belief that our education system should be adaptable and responsive to the needs of students.  Being able to access education in an inclusive way is key to living life to its fullest.  In doing so we are helping children and young people to grow and develop and to be as independent as possible.</p> <p>  As a Government, we continue to work to realise the goals of the convention and to deliver a truly inclusive education system.  Having undertaken extensive consultations and research, the National Council For Special Education, NCSE, will provide policy advice on the future of special schools and special classes, taking into account the requirements of the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  While I await the NCSE policy advice, my Department&rsquo;s policy remains very clear.  We want to ensure that all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.  This means that children with special educational needs should be included, where possible and appropriate, in mainstream settings with the necessary additional teaching and care supports in place.</p> <p>  In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.  We fully recognise that these more specialist supports and settings also have an important role to play.</p> <p>  I am happy to say that the vast majority of children with special educational needs are educated in mainstream classes.  The benefits of mainstream education are known and recognised.  We must continue to build a society with inclusion at its heart, where everyone is welcome and where full participation is the right of every person, no matter as to their background or need.  Our schools are where we nurture and develop the future of our society.  There should be no barriers to inclusion and no artificial segregation.</p> <p>  In the last few years, there has been a very significant increase in the number of children and young people being diagnosed with special educational needs, particularly in the area of autism.  We have responded to that by providing additional supports in mainstream classes and additional special class and special school places necessary to meet the emerging needs of those children and young people.</p> <p>  The Department this year will spend over &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of its total educational budget, on providing additional supports for children with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011.  This funding provides for 14,385 special education teachers in the mainstream school system in 2022, an increase of 620 on the previous year.</p> <p>  Provision has been made for an additional 1,165 special needs assistants, SNAs, in budget 2022, which will bring the number of SNAs to 19,169 by the end of 2022.</p> <p>There were 2,118 special classes in place at the start of the 2021-22 school year.  Additional provision for 383 additional special classes in 2022-23 will bring the total number of classes to 2,535 in the 2022-23 school year and will represent an increase of 339% since 2011, at which time 548 were provided.</p> <p>  Three new special schools have been opened in the last three years, two in Dublin, namely, Danu Community Special School and Our Lady of Hope School, Crumlin, and one in Cork, namely, Carrigaline Community Special School.  Additional places continue to be provided to ensure that children with the most complex educational needs receive an education in line with their needs.  Two further special schools will open in Dublin and Cork during the current school year.</p><p>We have worked hard to strengthen and streamline the planning systems between the Department and the NCSE to ensure that there are sufficient special education places available to meet needs throughout the country.  Significant investment has been made to ensure that schools have the necessary accommodation and facilities to receive children and young people with disabilities.  Professional development for teachers and school leaders is key to building capacity and confidence among teachers and their leaders and a truly inclusive culture and school environment.  It is worth noting in particular that we have invested significantly in supporting school leadership in recent years.  In fact, the extent of supports in that regard has never been greater.  For example, in last year&rsquo;s budget the Government provided administrative principal status for teaching principals in schools with two or more special classes.  </p><p> It is also worth referring to a number of recent developments, the outcomes of which are likely to influence the way in which our system develops into the future.  We are aware through policy advice from the NCSE that the current range of supports in schools, for example teaching and care on their own, do not fully meet the needs of some children with special educational needs, SEN, particularly children with complex needs in the areas of communication, speech and language, sensory impairments, self-regulation and positive behaviour skills.  Under the school inclusion model which is currently at pilot stage, we aim to broaden the range of supports provided to include speech and language, occupational and behavioural supports in order that schools are better equipped to meet the needs of these children so they can achieve better life outcomes.  The Department is working with the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the HSE to develop and strengthen more coherent structures to enable children and young people to access therapeutic assessments and supports.  This work is being supported by the Department of the Taoiseach. </p><p> As regards the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act, this legislation has been in place for almost 20 years and it is timely that we should review it now.  There has been significant change in Department policy and education provision has increased substantially in the intervening period.  There has also been legislative change that impacts on education.  This review will help ensure that our laws reflect current policy and international norms on provision and inclusion.  It is envisaged that the full review will be completed by early 2023. </p><p> Regarding Irish Sign Language, ISL, the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 provides people whose main language is ISL with certain statutory entitlements.  In recognition of this, earlier this year the Department launched a new scheme to provide ISL in-school support for students who are deaf and whose primary means of communication is ISL.  We are creating a new specialised in-school support post for individual students in order that they can fully access education and participate in school life.  We also will provide training and support for the school community, including teachers and special needs assistants to help with communication using Irish Sign Language.  This is a positive development and the latest step in ensuring that we have an inclusive education system where everyone is supported to reach their full potential.  The implementation of this Act in education will, I am confident, create a more inclusive school environment for these young people. </p><p> As regards transitions, the whole area of supporting the transition of young people with a disability right through the education system, with a particular focus on enabling young people to make informed life choices, is a priority.  We are working with colleagues across a number of Departments to ensure that this remains a focus of the third action plan under the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities, which will cover the period from 2022 to 2024.  The development of a demonstration transition programme has been agreed to address the transition needs of young people with disabilities in the two-year run up to their departure from school.  Under the proposal, the pilot will take place on 20 project sites.  There will be representation from a cross-section of schools to include students with disabilities in mainstream post-primary settings, located in special classes attached to mainstream and in special schools.  </p><p> Separately, I announced on 15 November a further planned development in the transition space.  The Department is partnering with an NGO with experience in the area of transitions to support the transition of post-primary level students with special educational needs to employment, training or further study in seven schools across the country.  Under the proposal, a careers and employment facilitator will engage with students and their parents and collaborate with teachers in complementary activities such as mini-companies, work experiences and transition planning.  This development is in the initiation phase and is planned to progress later this year. </p><p> My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, recently announced that the HSE has commenced a process to reinstate health and social care supports which had previously existed in special schools.  This involves the provision of an additional 136 whole-time equivalent, WTE, posts, which is on top of the 85 reinstated posts for special schools that were announced in 2021.  This builds on the 290 posts funded in budget 2021 and budget 2022, which the HSE will also continue to recruit to the children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  This programme of work has already commenced and will be monitored closely for the remainder of 2022 with regular communication between relevant stakeholders at local and national level to ensure progress.  Each one of the approved additional 136 WTE posts will deliver services on a 34-hour-week basis.  The allocation to special schools will be aligned with the level of service and disciplines provided prior to the establishment of children&rsquo;s disability network teams under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, PDS, programme.  </p><p> We have come a long way in ensuring that children and young people with a special educational need can access an appropriate education.  There is strong evidence to support this and I have provided some of this earlier.  However, there are times when we experience difficulties and challenges for a smaller number of young people and the Department of Education is working intensely with the NCSE to address this.  I am extremely grateful to schools for their co-operation and their leadership in this regard.  The Department is fully committed to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This will be achieved by increased investment in education provision and supports; the implementation of evidence-informed advice; the provision of continuous professional development for school staff; the strengthening of initial teacher education; and through consultation with teachers, parents, children, young people, school communities and general society.</p></speech>

That is 25% of the Department's budget.  I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on fighting for that budget and I hope we will see the same in next week's budget.  I know an awful lot of resources have been achieved through that extra money including new special education teachers, extra SNAs, extra classes, school places and indeed new schools.  I was delighted to welcome the Minister just last week to my own constituency for the opening of Stewarts special school's new building.</p> <p>  I agree with the Minister that there should be no barriers for education.  I thank her, her officials and the NCSE for all they do to break down the barriers that do unfortunately exist.  Notwithstanding the level of investment that goes into this area, as the Minister said herself in a response to a parliamentary question from me, there are still some parts of the country where an increase in population has created a shortage of school places for children with additional needs.  My constituency of Dublin Mid-West is one of those areas.  We have a rapidly growing population in Clondalkin, Lucan and our village areas but that population growth has not been met by additional capacity.  As the Minister will be aware, we have a number of primary and secondary schools awaiting new buildings.  It is essential that autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units and special educational needs classrooms are part of that capital investment.  I do a lot of work with the Clondalkin Autism Parents Support Network, which has been doing an unofficial audit of ASD places available from next September.  They cannot get that information from schools.  I would love if the Minister would use her time here to outline what plans there are to invest in growing areas like this and to explain how those decisions on the allocation of resources, capital expenditure and plans are made and what data are used.  She also may be able to give us an indication of the talent pipeline when it comes to teachers and SNAs.  Is attracting talent into special education a challenge?  Is there something more we could be doing if it is?  I would also be interested to know how the Department is monitoring the actions of schools to make sure they are not discriminating against children with disabilities.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the tremendous work of the local community and in particular the school community there.  The Deputy is quite correct that significant progress has been made.  For example, she referred to Dublin and we have been conscious in recent months that there were specific requirements in Dublin in terms of 80 places being required in special classes and 50 special school places.  Due to the great work of all of these school communities on the ground, the 50 places in the special schools were provided for.  Throughout Dublin, 300 additional places have been provided.  That is a significant achievement.  Obviously as the Deputy has outlined there will always be ongoing demand and challenge.  I acknowledge that right throughout the country we have seen significant uptake from school communities.  I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge that where we have seen best practice in one school, we have seen almost a domino effect of other schools taking up opportunities to develop in a similar vein themselves.</p><p>Therefore, I am grateful to the schools that have taken it upon themselves to set the ball rolling in communities, because this has been very positive in local communities. </p><p> Regarding planning for future supply, because this is obviously a key element of the work we must do, particularly concerning additional special classes, almost 700 projects are currently progressing or are under way as part of the school building programme.  In turn, this will deliver more than 1,300 new SEN classrooms and 200 replacement classrooms, catering for approximately 7,800 SEN pupils across primary and post-primary levels.  Almost 100 of these projects are on-site now.  Ultimately, this will deliver classroom spaces for almost 1,000 additional SEN pupils.  </p><p> As of late, we have seen, and this aspect has been referred to, that 25% of the budget of the Department of Education is now being expended on special education.  This is right and proper, and not before its time.  There have been achievements but there is also a body of work that must continue and do so apace.  Reference was also made to staff and support of staff.  We now have the highest number of special education teachers, with 15,000 of them, with the number of SNAs standing at more than 19,000.  A course is being funded by the Department for special education teachers to support that area of development.  </p><p> Equally, we are looking at our initial teacher training.  A significant component of that is inclusive education.  Within the school system itself, we are also considering progression models for our students in respect of the types of curricula they might wish to follow.  At the junior cycle level now, for example, we have level 1 and level 2.  These will now transfer over as part of the senior cycle programme as well.  Therefore, this is an ongoing body of work.  We are continuing to tackle it from the construction point of view and from a staffing perspective.  We are grateful for and appreciative of the genuine goodwill and determination of the school communities themselves.  They recognise that the best model is the inclusive one and that we have an obligation to meet the needs of all our students at all times.</p></speech>

I am curious about the school inclusion model, which is at the pilot stage.  It is intended to include many supports and to reach out to different areas, including speech and language, occupational therapy and supports in schools, to ensure they are equipped in that regard.  I understand it is to be completed by 2023.  I ask the Minister to outline how this is progressing.  It seems like it is a good way of finding out where we stand when it comes to this issue.  I also mention community healthcare organisation, CHO, 9.  I tabled a parliamentary question in May 2022 concerning waiting lists, and CHO 9, which includes my area of Dublin North-West, had one of the longest waiting lists for children to get an assessment.  I think that has now improved, and perhaps the Minister will comment on this.  I ask about this because I was worried about this situation when I spoke to the special educational needs organiser, SENO.  There seemed have been little movement then, but perhaps something more has happened since.</p> <p>  The Minister is probably familiar with Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in in Finglas.  A prefabricated building is being erected there for special education and people with disabilities.  I am, however, worried about the numbers.  The school has 294 pupils and it needs approximately 308 to get an extra teacher.  It would be a disaster if there was a need to double up classes.  Will the Minister please look at this situation?  I ask because I do not think that would be a good idea.  The class sizes would then shoot up to about 27, and that would be a disaster.</p> <p>  I also wish to ask the Minister about the effects of the pandemic.  We know it had a huge negative impact on people with disabilities.  What plans does the Minister have to address such a situation, if something like it were to happen again?  It has been an absolute disaster.  Will the Minister also comment on the use of seclusion and restraint in schools and the use of reduced timetables?  People are sometimes penalised.  I note my comrade mentioned some of the schools.  I have had experience where principals have been avoiding taking on people because they have had a disability of some description.  I do not know if this is common, but I have experience of this aspect from dealing with such situations in the past.  I wonder how we can deal with these issues.</p></speech>

It is an inclusive and good model.  The Deputy is correct that it is one we are seeking to trial.  I appreciate his personal interest in this subject.  Within this model, there are 12 therapists and four National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists working directly with staff.  I have seen on the ground how well this approach works.  There has, however, been an impact in respect of the Covid-19 pandemic and other measures.  During the time of Covid-19, therapists were withdrawn and various other things had to happen during the pandemic as well.  The model has now recommenced and we are aiming to complete the review as fast as possible.  Great learning will be derived from it.  It is a model that deserves to have its place.  It remains to be seen whether that will be in its entirety as it exists now, or whether there will be opportunities for modifications, or whatever, in future.  It is an excellent model, however, and it is one I am pleased to say we have recommenced piloting.</p> <p>  Turning to the reduced timetables, it is important that such reduced timetables for children with special educational needs are used and used appropriately, and in a way that meets their needs and benefits those pupils. </p></speech>

The Department has provided schools with guidelines concerning how to implement the reduced school days.  As part of this approach, schools are required to engage with the variety of services available.  This includes the SENOs, who are particularly relevant in this situation.  The Tusla education support service will monitor this aspect as well.  It is now obliged to report on how the timetables are being used and how beneficial they are.  Therefore, there is strong oversight of the use of these timetables.  They can be used well but it is important that everybody is happy with how they are being used and aware that there is also an oversight and monitoring structure in this context.</p> <p>  Regarding some of the points raised by the Deputy, and starting with Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in, I cannot give the Deputy a definite answer on this subject.  Where a school feels it has additional needs in respect of the staffing that has been apportioned to it based on its needs, there is an opportunity to appeal.  Such a mechanism exists. </p></speech>

I appreciate that.  There may be an opportunity for engagement through the review process.  Regarding the behaviours of concern, I am conscious, especially when I visit special schools and those that have children with particular challenges, that there are behaviours of concern.</p><p>It is an issue of real concern for many schools.  There is a considerable body of work being done on how best to manage it in the context of the school environment and school supports.  The NCSE has been developing a behaviour support framework for use across all schools.  The emphasis in this framework is on developing a very positive, holistic approach within schools, prevention measures and how they can be employed within the schools and, in particular, early intervention measures.  The quicker and earlier the intervention, the more positive the outcome.</p><p> I acknowledge the body of work being done by the former director of the NEPS, Maureen Costello, on developing specific guidelines for the schools.  It is under way at the moment.  I am conscious, especially when visiting schools, that this is a matter being raised, but there is a major body of work being done in respect of it.</p></speech>

I contacted her recently and I am aware she is trying to do her best with a system we probably need to look at more.  My own experience is that children with disabilities are not fully seen or heard and that the provision of services varies depending on a child's disability, their age, where they go to school or where they live.  I always say no matter what part of the country you live in, be it Carlow, Kilkenny or Donegal, you have the same entitlements.</p> <p>  I will give the Minister an example from a school near me, namely, Holy Angels.  I thank the Minister because she visited the school and is very much aware of it.  The school is getting its new build, so this is a good news story.  Holy Angels has discharged 14 pupils, but out of this group, seven are waiting for differential aptitude test assessments.  Without the assessment, the child will end up in a mainstream classroom without any additional supports.  Some of these children have already lost out on ASD preschool placements because they have not had their assessments to date.  There are six children who require placement in St. Laserian's Special School in Carlow, which is an excellent school, or maybe in special classes within the locality, but, again, without educational assessments, they will not get placements.  As a result, these children will also end up in mainstream education.</p> <p>  The Minister is aware of this and is working on it.  It is important.  I have been working with the parents in order that we get as many assessments done as soon as possible.  Before Covid, things totally changed but all students in a place called New Brunswick in Canada are educated together in their local school.  Every child, whether they are able or disabled, with complex needs, are talented students, thriving students or disadvantaged students, all study together.  They all learn together with their own tailored experience.  In 2019, the NCSE spoke about this idea.  To fully include all students it suggested looking at this model.  I understand that since the suggestion came in late 2019 we have had the coronavirus and we have lost a lot of ground but is this a model the Minister is looking at?  She might come back to me on that.</p> <p>  I have another question on a matter one or two parents have contacted me about.  Has the Department had any engagement with the State Examinations Commission to ensure reasonable accommodation be made at State examinations for students with epilepsy who experience a seizure during the exam.  Families have been telling me epilepsy should be included as a serious health condition so an enormous burden is not placed on a student to prove they have had a seizure.  I am aware the State Examinations Commission rules stipulate that while candidates who experience a serious medical condition are entitled to sit deferred exams, this does not apply to those who have commenced an exam.  The same issue arises for those who experience seizures.  Is the Minister looking at this?</p> <p>  I met a group of parents earlier.  They spoke about the summer experience of children attending special school.  It was about the July provision or the lack of it.  As the Minister knows, it is probably one of the best programmes for children who need routine and their parents.  It is hugely beneficial to the children and the parents.  I am wondering what the update is on that.  I must give the Minister this book.  There are many stories in it from parents who have been affected because their children's school did not do the July provision this year, so I want to ask her about that too.</p> <p>  This is my final point.  The Minister is very much for inclusion and that is part of our ethos going forward.  It is great students sitting State examinations get their papers in both Irish and English.  This is welcome, but we now have Syrian, Ukrainian and Lithuanian students here.  English is not their first language.  Would the Minister consider having papers available in those languages as well as in English and Irish in the 2023 exams?  I would appreciate it if she could come back to me with some answers on these.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the commission, which is independent, but it is my personal view, and core to my beliefs around senior cycle reform, that we maximise the potential for every student inasmuch as we possibly can in terms of taking the exams and how it will benefit them.  I am confident that, as part of this review following the running of these examinations, there will be opportunities to look at things further.  The last full review of the reasonable accommodations scheme was in 2017.  There will be a much more in-depth review to come.  It will probably be hand-in-hand with the senior cycle reform as well but it is a matter for the State Examinations Commission.  I 100% support the philosophy that we give the maximum opportunity to our students to showcase their talents and abilities on a given day.</p> <p>  On the July provision, or the summer provision as we call it now it is no longer limited, a considerable investment of over &euro;40 million was made and there was significant uptake.  It is a provision that is made available for children with additional needs but also those at risk of educational disadvantage.  It is my absolute desire and determination that more schools will find themselves in a position to make these summer provision programmes available.  This year, a considerable number of changes were put in place, in that there was much engagement with schools on what would be required to make the programme more attractive.  An example would be ensuring the burden would not automatically fall on the principal of the school or school leadership.  Finances were made available that there would be an overseer put in place.  There was also flexibility for schools as we referenced earlier, in that it would not just be July and could be whatever time during the summer period that would suit them.  There was an online programme for the payment of staff.</p><p>There is a variety of measures.  A full review will take place.  I know we need greater availability of the programme for students and families.  We are looking at models in other parts of the world to ascertain what is best practice internationally.  I am open to considering other Departments that may be in a position to support work in respect of July provision coming in.  We will revert as soon as we can with this new model.  It will be a model that looks to international best practice.  In particular, we are keen to look to the model in Malta, as well as other providers that may be able to support us in running the scheme.</p></speech>

We sought a date before the summer recess, when known issues could have been highlighted before the new school year commenced.  We are already several weeks into that term and the situation has worsened in some cases.  All present know that timing is key in helping children with special educational needs and disabilities.  It is unfortunate that the insights and points this committee has to offer were not prioritised.</p> <p>  In her opening statement, the Minister outlined the amounts being spent and the increase in support, all of which are more than welcome.  However, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Irish law are clear on this.  Every young person is entitled to an appropriate education but the reality is that many children and young people are being denied that right.  The pre-budget submission of this committee, which is based on the contributions of witnesses, families and advocates, highlights the lack of school places, inadequate transitions between primary and secondary schools and insufficient ASD classes and SNA supports.</p> <p>  Cork South-West has no special school and a severe shortage of special classes.  The classes that are in place are doing incredible work but they are oversubscribed.  Last week, I raised the case of an autistic child who has been moved between different primary schools.  The Minister's office and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are aware of this case.  His education has been disrupted to suit the needs of the Department rather than it being the other way around.  He spent the past year in a non-ASD special class, which has led to his developmental regression.  Needless to say, that is not due to any issue with the class; the class is just not suitable.  An ASD class is now opening in the town closest to the child - it is closer to him than his current school - but it is already full even though it has not yet opened, so he will not get a place there.  His mum asked me how, after eight years in primary education, the Department is not aware of the numbers coming through into second-level education.  It does not make sense.  There seems to be a complete lack of even basic planning.  That is just one example among many.  What does the Minister have to say to the parents of that child?</p> <p>  My next question relates to SNA provision.  The Minister will be aware that a national school in Ballydehob has had to fundraise to increase its SNA hours.  It is just one of many schools in my constituency that have had to take that action.  I cannot imagine how many of them there are across the country.  It is symptomatic of a significant gap between the identified needs of students and the SNA allocation and resources being assigned by the Minister and the Department.  The system of assigning SNAs relies on old information and, in some cases, assessments made many years ago.  When I raised this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, she referred me to the appeal and exceptional review process.  That process puts the onus back on overstretched principals and teachers to do the work of the Department.  In addition, more than 50% of all exceptional review applications result in the allocation of additional SNA or part-time SNA supports.  That obviously illustrates the flawed and ridiculous approach of the Department on this issue.</p> <p>  Finally, the summer programme, formerly known as July provision, is a major concern for the committee.  We have called for the Department to develop it as a standard and to ensure that all children who want access to the programme can do so.  Parents and principals have outlined their frustration with the process, the delays in announcing it and the poor communication, not to mention the underpaying of SNAs.  Ultimately, it is children who suffer as a result of this disorganisation.  What is being done to ensure that every school is available for the summer programme?  Why is the Minister not announcing the scheme now, before Christmas, to support as many schools as possible participating?  I ask the Minister to also address the low rates of remuneration for SNAs.</p></speech>

It is not enough and I would be the first to say that.  I also clearly articulated that we are looking at a variety of models of best practice internationally, and even going beyond that to see what other types of resources we can put in place to facilitate schools that might not believe they have the necessary staffing resources.  It is a voluntary programme.  Staff can volunteer to be part of the summer provision programme or they may choose, for their own reasons, not to be involved in the programme.  We have put in place a number of measures this year to ensure the maximum number of people can avail of it but we are not stopping there.  A full review of how the programme worked this year is taking place.  We are engaging with international best practice.  We are also engaging with groups and organisations that might be in a position to be part of this remodelling or re-envisioning of the summer provision programme.  It is an excellent programme.  I have visited many of them.  I have seen them operating on the ground and the extraordinary benefit to children and young people who can avail of them.  It is my ambition that there will be far more schools in a position to provide the programme.</p> <p>  As regards SNAs, there is no assessment required for SNA provision.  In terms of the provision in schools, we have more than 19,000 SNAs now in schools, the highest number we have ever had.  There is no doubt that the work of SNAs is very important.  Recognising that, there has been a significant increase in the provision of SNAs in each of the budgets that I have presided over in recent years.</p> <p>  The Deputy specifically referenced the number of classes in her area and the difficulties there.  We are coming from a base that requires that we grow.  There is no doubt about that.  As regards her area specifically, there are 41 new classes in the primary sector in her constituency and 22 new classes at post-primary level.  It is not enough but it is significant progress from where we were.  We continue to advance that body of work and yo prioritise.  Testament to the priority that we are placing on this is that 25% of our budget is now expended solely on the area of special education.  It is being given priority.  We see that priority manifest itself in things such as summer provision, which involves a &euro;40 million investment, double the investment in recent years, just to ensure that the maximum number of schools will be in a position to promote it.  A significant body of work has been completed.  There is more work to be done but we are certainly putting in the resources and ambition to ensure the maximum number of children are being supported.</p></speech>

That is the point.  It needs to be standardised.  When it is voluntary, that means there are children who are not able to access education.  The point I was trying to get across is that children are entitled to that education.  Throughout the summer, we had families taking unpaid leave for the month of July.  Do they have to do the same for August?  There has to be a standardised approach to the summer programme so that it is not the case that some children get it but others do not.  It is a necessity for some families.</p></speech>

Perhaps I said "assessment" but I meant to say "allocation".  Surely when people go to the appeal and exceptional review process they are appealing something, be it an allocation or an assessment.  As I stated, 50% of those appeals are granted.  The allocation is not working.  It is being put back on schools and overstretched principals.  Principals, particularly those in rural areas, are managing so much.  They have to manage the school and all the various paperwork and then re-appeal for all these things, with an allocation then being granted 50% of the time.</p><p>The schools that are refused an allocation do not understand why and are fundraising to employ SNAs separately.  This is at a time when there is no shortage of SNAs.  When roles are advertised, many applications are received.  In such circumstances, there is no reason not to provide the SNAs that need to be allocated.  We hear, in the context of the children's disability network teams, that there are no staff.  However, there are staff available.</p><p> I did not get a response to my question on access to ASD classes.  If somebody needs an ASD class, and there is a new school being built in the area but it is already oversubscribed, why is there a lack of planning? Children spend eight years in primary education, so the Department knows that they will need places at second level.  Why is there no planning for the number of students who need either ASD classes, special classes or special schools?</p></speech>

I made it clear that there is no assessment for SNAs.  There is an appeals system for every aspect of the education sector.  The appeals system adjudicates the needs of the school and student.  It is an independent mechanism and is afforded across a variety of different aspects of education.</p> <p>  There is very much forward planning when it comes to ASD classes.  We are better now than was the case perhaps in years gone by.  For example, it will be automatic for all new school builds.  A 1,000 pupil post-primary school will have a four-classroom SEN base.  The position will be likewise for primary schools, depending on their size.  The NCSE is charged with working hand in hand with schools, SENOs and parents, because that is the model we would like to see going forward.  This will ensure that parents have less of a burden.  As the Deputy has clearly articulated, there is less of a burden being placed on parents in terms of the provision of places.</p> <p>  On the summer provision programme, I hear the frustrations expressed by the Deputy.  I want the maximum number of schools to be in a position to offer the programme and, at the very least, make the relevant facilities available.  However, the programme is voluntary.  I have engaged with many parents who were disappointed that the programme was not being run in their schools, but they accepted the decision of the staff not to make themselves available for the programme.  It is for that reason, as I articulated earlier, that we are looking at other models abroad.  We are also looking at other groups and organisations that might well be able to come into schools and, maybe, run these programmes.  I recognise that the maximum number of students cannot avail of this programme.  We are looking at alternative means now to see how we can provide in a better way.  Notwithstanding the fact that the number this year is an increase on the number in previous years, the programme is not growing at the greater pace at which I would like it to grow.</p></speech>

I did not say that at all.  From what I have experienced in my constituency office, I know that these parents are worried, stressed and at the end of their tethers.  They know that there is a short period for intervention in order that their children can live full and independent lives.  The need in this regard is not being met.  I did not say that any burden has been taken off parents.</p></speech>

My fellow committee members have raised many other issues.</p> <p>  Recently, I dealt with a mum who contacted me because her eldest son, who has done his leaving certificate, and her youngest child, who has entered the leaving certificate years, are visually impaired.  I empathise with this mother because my child, though much younger, is in a similar position.  During Covid, a huge amount of the teaching online was very challenging for children who are visually impaired.  Much of the teaching was digital in nature and required a lot of technology.  I cannot fault the Department because, from my experience, the technology is both freely available and excellent.  During Covid, there was a working method that was very much digital and online.  We learned to rely on it, and secondary school students who are moving towards independence very much rely on it.</p> <p>  As already referred to by one of my colleagues, the use of digital technology does not exactly happen during State examinations.  The State Examinations Commission is an independent body but it does sit within the Department.  The reality is that children who have worked, studied and learned through digital means for their whole education - and my ten-year-old is doing everything on a Polaris, which is like an laptop without a screen - cannot work in the same way when sitting State examinations.  To me, that seems like a very clear breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Department's stance disadvantages children because they have learned one way and then are asked to sit State examinations in a completely different way.  A simple fix would be to allow for PDF versions of examination papers.  When it comes to a clear breach of human rights, although the State Examinations Commission is a non-departmental public body, in this case it would be appropriate for the Department to step in with the commission, whose representatives I have met, and say that action needs to be taken fast.</p> <p>  We have discussed the issue of reasonable accommodations.  I brought a copy of the detailed Irish document on reasonable accommodations to the meeting.  Let me cite the UK example as best practice.  By my word count, the document is about four times as long as the Irish document and is incredibly detailed.  In the UK, digital papers are allowed and allowance is made for a number of issues.  We know in the Irish experience that the offer of a scribe and extended time do not suit everybody.  For many children who are sitting examinations,  unless they have a scribe to explain the pictures, they are told not to use them.  That places them at a clear disadvantage.  There are a couple of simple things that we could do to remedy the situation.  The Minister stated that the Department will review reasonable accommodations in tandem with reform of the leaving certificate examination in general.  The Department could review this earlier.  I have emphasised to the State Examinations Board that a review is urgent.  The Department's stance is clearly contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p> <p>  I do not want to misrepresent the State Examinations Board, but when I met its representatives, I did not feel a sense of urgency about reviewing reasonable accommodations.  I am sorry to be bearer of bad new but we all know that we have some of the lowest levels of full-time employment for people with disabilities in this country.  Not allowing digital assistance in State examinations is part of that as it acts as a barrier to third level education.  I did not get a sense that the State Examinations Board had any immediate impetus to conduct a review.  I talked to the State Examinations Board about allowing PDF versions of examination papers and asked if it had the capacity to make PDFs digitally available during State examinations.  I was told that it would not, which puts us into the territory of seeking a tender.  As we all know, the tender process takes longer.  I am not being flippant when I say that I have staff in my office who can make a PDF document that is secure and would meet the security requirements of the commission.</p> <p>  Let me clearly outline my three suggestions for the Department.  The first is to instruct the State Examinations Commission to undertake a review of the list of reasonable accommodations.  I accept that would be a longer project.  The second would be to allow in that process some kind of a forum and consultation between parents and relevant educators.  My experience of visiting teachers has been excellent because they know exactly what they are doing.  I know that people within a Department do not always feel that they can speak up, but visiting teachers are the experts.  I strongly believe that we can learn from them.  It is they who should be asked about reasonable accommodations.</p> <p>  The third suggestion is that we should just get on with introducing the use of PDF documents.  I suggest that we provide this option to the leaving certificate students who will participate in the next round of examinations.  I cannot emphasise enough how great a difference this initiative would make to the very small number of students affected.  Their lives would be transformed by being able to access State examinations. </p></speech>

We have made enormous strides in terms of technology over a long period but particularly in the last couple of years.  We have seen the enormous benefits.  If we are to follow through and build on that, we need to take the next step.  The State Examinations Commission is charged with conducting examinations and has ultimate responsibility for them.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a very clear point.</p><p>The rates review is linked with senior cycle reform.  It is to give maximum opportunity to students to be the best they can be in any situation, most notably in examinations.  I ask the Deputy to leave it with me.  I will take this with me and see where the scope and potential lie.  I do not want to lead the Deputy astray and say it is within my gift because it is not entirely, and it is within the State Examinations Commission.  However, it is a fair point that is being raised.  Other points have been made regarding the accessibility of examination papers.  On the points that have been raised with me in that regard, the commission has a duty to protect the examinations, but there is always a way.</p></speech>

Nobody wants to have to resit an examination.  However, it would be meaningful for them to hear from the Minister that there is a concern around the human rights issues.  My views are shared by Senator Erin McGreehan, who wanted to be here tonight, and Senator Martin Conway.  We are like mini-coalition on this issue.  We are very concerned about what this means for students.</p></speech>

I appreciate that, this September, we have had record numbers of places in the schools that have come on board.  However, to give a quote, a deputy principal in one of the schools says that clear training and planning for the opening of ASD classes is needed in schools, and that it is not enough to sanction one and then leave it to the principal to project manage and upskill the staff.  It is said that the NCSE is not supporting the process as it should, and that the waiting lists are incredibly long to get education staff on the courses on managing challenging behaviour.  There are more children than ever with learning difficulties in classrooms.  SNAs are being run ragged, giving ten minutes here and ten minutes there, which does not provide effective support to the children who need it.</p> <p>  I also know of schools that were obliged to take children on board.  That is great.  I am delighted there are places for children, and I will certainly fight for that.  However, the allocation of SNAs did not go up proportionately in response to the number of children with complex needs.  We have this interplay involving the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the HSE and the Department of Education.  To take CHO 7, it is desperately under-resourced in terms of the failure of recruitment to bring in the occupational therapists and special needs specialists that are required.  We have a difficulty in that regard.  I am concerned about the transparency and accountability of how we are going to ensure the supports are put in place around children.  Those are the first two points.</p> <p>  My third point is that, post Covid, we are hearing of a lot of mental health issues and the need for mental health supports, particularly for children with disabilities, and the fact they are recovering post Covid but they can be experiencing or manifesting trauma.  I would like to know what plans are being put in place for that.</p> <p>  There is obviously the issue of school transport.  There are still residual issues on that and I would like to hear the Minister's comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.618" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092000002#G00500"><p>In terms of school transport, children with additional needs are entitled to the school transport system.  Where the system is readily available, it is made available.  Where there is a particular challenge, alternative arrangements can be put in place with regard to access to a taxi or other means to get them to school.  They are entitled to that.  More than &euro;289 million has been made available for the school transport system.  The other point is that we are very conscious that the needs of children who fall into the special educational needs bracket can come at different times of the year, so there is no time limit or timeframe in terms of their access to that school transport support.  We have more than 15,500 children availing of school transport from the special education point of view, and that will continue to grow.</p> <p>  With regard to resources in schools for special classes, the resources that are made available are one teacher and two SNAs to six pupils, and they are provided for.  I hear the point the Senator raises around the wider element of therapeutic supports in that instance.  Considerable engagement has taken place with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, with regard to putting in place those specific resources in schools.  There has been an announcement around 136 posts into special schools, with 44 of those posts to be put in place immediately and then, over three different tranches, the additional ones will be put in place throughout the autumn as they recruit.</p> <p>  On the wider question of supports within the school, a programme of professional support for schools with newly established special classes has been developed by the NCSE.  The programme has been completed by the NCSE and will be available to schools as soon as is practical.  The NCSE has worked very hard to put this together.  The programme will involve a variety of supports, including seminars for principals, a four-day intensive training course for teachers, a two-day training course for new teachers and whole-staff CPD.  There is an acknowledgement that the more a school is supported, the better it is.</p> <p>  The NCSE is heavily committed to this body of work.  There is a new person taking up the position of CEO within the NCSE.  Considerable progress has been made in terms of recognising the issues that are on the ground for either special classes or special schools.  The appropriate measures are being put in place to meet those issues that have been identified.</p></speech>

If teachers, SNAs and schools are being obliged to provide places, which is absolutely right - and every child deserves to be educated as close to their own home as possible and have their needs addressed - but if the supports are not going in for the teachers, then it is less likely they will volunteer for the July provision.  I take Deputy Cairns&rsquo; point that the July provision should be mandatory and that other resources should be used to make sure we provide that.</p> <p>  I am concerned that schools would be obliged to find that support for their staff, especially in managing challenging behaviours.  I do not want to overemphasise that because many challenging behaviours arise where children are manifesting the strangeness of their environment.  That is sometimes a vicious circle in that the staff around them are not equipped to cope with their needs and, consequently, the children are more anxious, which leads to children being sent home or having a reduced provision.  It is a nasty cycle that needs to be arrested as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

The professional development service for teachers, PDST, already engages with schools.  In terms of supports, I have said from the very beginning, in advance of any special classes being set up, that the provision is there for two SNAs and one teacher for six students, and that is automatic.</p> <p>  In terms of the other therapeutic supports, that is not within our gift.  What I will say is that we have had extensive engagement with other Departments in that regard and I think we have made good progress.  Again, notwithstanding the fact it is not within our gift, there has been an acknowledgement of the importance of returning those therapeutic supports back into the system.  Specifically in regard to the PDST and CPD for schools, that has been ongoing and it continues to be provided to schools.</p><p>There is scope for this additional new model that has been provided by the NCSE as well.</p></speech>

The emphasis was on reintegrating children into the school system, supporting schools in what they felt would meet the needs of students.  In excess of &euro;52 million was expended in that respect.  For some, it was additional to teaching hours, for others it was for creative arts or whatever the school deemed necessary.  There has been a definite acknowledgement of the need for those supports, particularly, as the Deputy said, in the framework of Covid-19.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.</p> <p>   I have a number of questions.  Some of them have already been asked, but I would like to ask the Minister if she would consider making disability and autism training a mandatory element of all teacher training courses, going forward.   Would the Minister also make it mandatory for all qualified teachers to undergo disability and autism training as continuing professional development, CPD?  Whether you are at primary, secondary, post-leaving certificate, PLC, or even university level, you are going to encounter students with additional needs, who are autistic.  If we are serious about being inclusive, it is imperative that we ensure all staff are properly trained.  It is the biggest issue we hear from the people who come in here, who have first-hand experience with disability.  They talk to us about the lack of awareness and lack of training in all sectors, but it is vitally important in education. </p> <p>  The Minister gave details about the number of special schools and classes, etc., that have opened of late.  Of course, that is absolutely welcome, but it is not enough to have the physical space.  I have been talking to parents in cases where special classes or schools have opened, but they have not been properly resourced.  They do not have the properly-trained teachers in place or enough SNAs.  They do not have a sensory room or the necessary equipment, or there is no open communication between the principal or the school in general with the parents.  There is no access to therapeutic supports.  We do not have enough NEPS psychologists, and we know that there are huge shortages of therapists within the CNDTs.  I know the support they can give to teachers in a school with students who are transitioning, especially from one school to another, about their needs.  That support is invaluable.  I remember receiving that when I was teaching; it was an invaluable support given to students coming from primary schoo but is not there at the moment.</p> <p>  A point that has been made, especially by organisations like AsIAm, is that we need to look at classrooms being inclusive, instead of students in the special or autism class being put out in the prefab on the outskirts of the school, for example.  They should be made the centre of the school as well.  Also, the use of restraint and expulsion of students with additional needs from special schools happens and it should not happen.  It is not acceptable, but is very much linked to the lack of training and resources in schools.</p> <p>  A number of people have brought up summer provision.  It was established as July provision after a High Court hearing in 1993, which recognised that children with severe needs lose skills over the long school holidays and these skills may never be recovered.  When July provision was replaced by the extended summer programme, the eligibility opened up from 15,000 to 80,000 students.  Of the 8,000 students who attend special schools, fewer than 5% actually received summer provision this summer gone.  I think only 410 students got the full four weeks.  Is there some way of safeguarding the children in our special schools going forward to ensure that they will be prioritised for summer provision?</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about looking at other options in other jurisdictions.  She mentioned Malta, and yes, it has a very good scheme and is worth looking at, but they use people from other professions.  Actually, a number of schools now, in the west of Ireland, I think, have run a very successful July provision.  They start organising in January, they go to their own staff and staff in other schools in the locality and then they approach student occupational and speech and language therapists, people who are in third-level education, to come in and work with the students.  It has been really successful.  It is a model that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  In my own area, on school transport, the remote area grant was offered to a number of parents in Cavan around 8 August.  That was too late.  It was not suitable for their needs, so they turned it down, and now they are eligible for a bus or taxi.  That then has to go to tender, which takes a number of weeks.  Then, the driver may have to be Garda vetted and the bus checked.  I know one student who has not yet attended their autism class because they have no way of getting there.  Why can that not be done months in advance?  The transport is approved maybe six months prior or longer, but was not actually enacted.</p> <p>  Irish Sign Language, ISL, was mentioned.  I have been contacted by people with a third-level qualification in ISL from Trinity College.  Even though it is an official language of the State, it is not recognised as a teaching subject.  When I contacted the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, about this, they blamed the Teaching Council, and when I contacted the Teaching Council, they blamed the NCCA.  Can this be addressed?  These people are qualified and they may have another qualification in a different subject.  They could teach Irish Sign Language to students in our schools.</p></speech>

On her first point about disability and autism training, I absolutely see where she is coming from.  I spent long enough teaching to appreciate the importance of giving confidence, and confidence will only come when people feel they have the familiarity and training in it.  Regarding the Teaching Council, inclusive education is now part of the initial teacher training qualification.  Teachers must be trained in that as part of their affiliation and accreditation with the Teaching Council.  I appreciate that CPD in this area is very important, but if we get it right starting with the new teachers coming out and it being part of their course and qualification, that is the most valid building brick we have.  We must continue to offer CPD alongside that.</p> <p>  Therapeutic supports have been raised by a number of speakers.  We have made progress in consultation with the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and those Departments.  It is an advantage, obviously, to the schools.  We need to have those resources in our schools.  We are seeing a step-by-step return now, with 136 posts coming into the special schools, 44 of which have been automatically reinstated.  The others will come in three tranches.  The Department of Education can make the provision for teaching staff with one teacher and two SNAs and the other therapeutic supports, but we are also working with the other Department to ensure that that is put in place.  Obviously, it is a holistic approach.</p> <p>  On the remote area grant and the 8 August date, I take Deputy Tully's point.  We are coming close to finalising the entire root-and-branch review of school transport and looking at mechanisms of how to refine it.  It has improved of late, and I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement of that.  There are areas where we absolutely can do better and I certainly will take that point on board about timing, etc.</p> <p>  On the July provision and the model the Deputy referenced in other schools, I have seen some of those models and they are superb, where schools and staff were thinking outside the box and they went to other organisations or groups or third-level students, etc.  To be fair, regarding third-level students, that happens quite a lot already.  They are relied upon quite a lot, but there is greater scope there.  That is why I earlier referenced that we are looking at other models - the Deputy is familiar with Malta.  We are looking specifically at approaching different groups and organisations, seeing the models that have worked and doing things differently for the model that will unfold for summer 2023.  I am absolutely committed to ensuring that we have maximum uptake, if at all possible.</p> <p>  I have a few other points on schools and the resources made available to them.</p><p>From the Department's point of view, aside from staff, both teachers and SNAs, a considerable special-class start-up grant of &euro;6,500 is also made available to the school, as well as an ICT grant of &euro;6,700 and an enhanced capitation grant which is around &euro;720 per student.  The Department of Education gives considerable resources to special education and that is right and proper.  I know I am repeating myself when I say that 25% of our entire budget is now dedicated to special education.  As I said at the start, considerable progress has been made.  We are moving in the right direction.  A body of work still needs to be done, but I will certainly take on board the positive and concrete suggestions made by the Deputy.  I appreciate that. </p></speech>

I will raise three or four points with the Minister.  In light of what happened during the Covid pandemic, is the Department now planning our education system so we can deal with whatever happens if we have another pandemic or emergency, rather than just waiting for something to happen and then making decisions that might have a negative effect on our children?  I am asking about forward planning based on the experiences of the past two years.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the needs of the child and the needs of the school.  We should only talk about the needs of the child.  It is important that we concentrate on the child and what the child needs and that we build everything else around that.  What I mean by that is, if training is required by teachers, they should not take days off from their time in the school because that is disruptive.  Forward planning involves an effort to deal with all the issues so that children who have disabilities have a calm learning experience.</p> <p>  The school transport situation was, and still continues to be, a disaster in my constituency, and I am sure in other constituencies.  It has had a negative effect on children with disabilities.  One school in my constituency has four children who still do not have a bus.  A bus was allocated and approved last May.  The school interviewed and appointed an escort for the bus.  The contract was signed and no bus has arrived.  This falls to the Department.  I raised it with the T&aacute;naiste last week.  The information was sent on to the Minister's Department and I ask that be resolved as a matter of urgency.  It is not good enough.</p> <p>  Another child who is in a wheelchair has no school transport.  Today is 20 September.  These things should not be happening.  There is no excuse.  As a member of this committee, I understand that we all try to put things in place to create an atmosphere where everything is being looked after.  Whatever is happening with school transport, and I have my own ideas about that, it has affected children with disabilities and with special educational needs and we need to rectify the problems anywhere they have arisen as a matter of urgency.  The onus should not be put on parents to try to bring a child who is in a wheelchair to school, costing them &euro;90 per week.  It is not acceptable.</p> <p>  Regarding the design of schools for people with disabilities, are there experts within the building unit who are vetting the design of all new schools to ensure they meet the requirements of universal design?</p> <p>  I also ask the Minister about the EPSEN Act 2004.  What provisions for the child will be implemented from that Act?  We need to be serious about this.  It seems to be done in a haphazard way.  Services are not being provided in a uniform way throughout the country and within schools.  I know of children who have disabilities who must go to school outside of their area or parishes because facilities are not available in their areas.  They have to leave their friends to go to other schools for education.  Their siblings want to go to the nearest school but are not with their brother or sister in the national school.  We have a lot of things to seriously correct to ensure that we are meeting our commitments.  The most annoying thing at the moment is that the school transport system is not working properly.  We have been caught napping on that.  The decision to offer free transport was well intentioned but has created unintended negative consequences for children and parents, and especially for children with disabilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.630" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092000002#J00500"><p>I will start with the last question regarding school transport.  The waiving of school transport fees was introduced as a cost-of-living measure.  This time last year over 103,000 children in mainstream education were availing of it.  Presently 124,000 tickets are available free of charge to families.  That is an increase of over 20% of children availing of the school transport system.  That is a considerable benefit to families.  I am talking in general rather than about the specific area of special education that the Deputy has raised, as he raised both.  I do not want any family to be discommoded.  That has never been the intention.  Some families find themselves outside the criteria for the provision of mainstream school transport and have availed of concessionary school transport in the past.  It is interesting to note that even concessionary school transport has seen an increase of one third.  That is notwithstanding that some families have been affected where others have become eligible and they are not.  However, in the greater scheme of things, 124,000 families are availing of free transport, notwithstanding that we are still working through some issues.</p> <p>  The Deputy is 100% right that there have been extraordinary learnings from the pandemic.  I visit many schools who say that in many instances, the pandemic pushed us on almost five to ten years as regards our learnings and things we might have expected to have taken a long time to get across the ground.  We are now in a much better position, notwithstanding the sadness and challenges that the pandemic obviously brought.  However, we have seen positive steps in the areas of technology, remote teaching and learning and in how we have managed exams in the past while, as well as how best practice and learning has been incorporated for the benefit of students.  That will obviously be a guiding principle going forward.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the needs of the child.  I could not agree with him more.  The education sector serves the student and it must take a child-centred approach and I agree 100% with the Deputy and appreciate that he made that point.  Everything else is a service around it and that is the objective.  Everything we are doing in education, whether specifically in the area of special education or in senior cycle reform, is all about putting the student at the centre.  When we talk about the child-centred approach, I wish to be clear that in general, never before has the student voice sat at the centre of all that we do.  Students are articulating on behalf of students.  Students are part of the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, for the first time ever.  We are very focused, and I am particularly focused, on ensuring that the student is at the centre, and remains at the centre, of all that we do.  </p> <p>  I should have asked the Deputy at the outset to give me details of those specific cases that he raised around school transport so that I can follow up on them.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked who is charged with ensuring that the universal design for learning is the way it should be.</p><p>There are two aspects to it in that there is the universal design from a building point of view but there is also teaching methodology.  Within the Department, obviously the principles of universal design are embedded in every aspect of the Department's work.  In terms of guidance that is given for building projects, including the large-scale ones, those where additional classroom space is being made available or the reconfiguration of space specifically to meet the needs of children with additional needs, all are guided by universal access and there is a universal design process there for all of that.</p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Autism had appear before it many different parents' support groups set up by parents themselves and they discussed how teachers should be trained properly.  As the Minister has stated that new teachers coming through will have inclusive education, can she explain what she means by inclusive education?  Is that just about special needs or does it include all forms, such as the needs of people from ethnic minority groups?</p> <p>  I was speaking to AsIAm a few weeks ago and its representatives said that while we have a lot of buildings and schools for children with special needs, we do not have the services within the schools.  It is one thing to have a building but the services are more important and meeting the children where they are at.  One of the organisations that appeared today, I think it was the Dublin 12 Campaign 4 Autism Inclusion group, said it is extremely important that we see the child, the young person, and meet them where they are at.  The parents of some children with special additional needs believe themselves that their children should be in mainstream schools.  So those services should be there.  </p> <p>  The committee met representatives of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, a few weeks ago and they spoke about the budget going forward.  They only have four requests but the one on which I want to focus is mental health supports within our schools. </p> <p>  Something that has not been touched on as we come up to the budget concerns SNAs.  Will there be an increase in SNA payments this year in budget 2023?  While I welcome that there are now 19,000 SNAs in the system, I regret to say they are not valued and their qualification is not recognised.  This is not a personal attack on the Minister.  I am myself a qualified SNA and I know what it is like to work in a classroom with children with complex needs and how we should value our SNAs.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

On the learning needs of all pupils and meeting the pupils at the place that you find them, I could not agree more.  That fits in with the point the Senator raised as regards initial teacher education and what that involves in terms of inclusive education.  That specifically involves meeting the learning needs of each individual student and meeting them at the place that you find them in.  As for budget 2023 and how we are fixed, I would love to be able to tell the Senator.  We are currently in discussions around the budget.  The Senator specifically raised the INTO request and I have met INTO representatives about a package around mental health and well-being and I wish to be truthful and say that everything is on the table at this point.  I have had a number of asks from a number of different partners in education and they are all on the table but it is all very much part of the discussion and negotiation and I mean that sincerely.  Even at this point, I know we are only a week away, but that is the nature of it.</p> <p>  Regarding SNAs, we have seen a significant increase in the number of SNAs.  There is an unprecedented level in excess of 19,000 SNAs in the system now.  I want to acknowledge the invaluable role of SNAs and I know Senator Flynn has that background.  In terms of pay, that is very much a part of the public sector pay deal.  As regards our capacity to grow the number of SNAs going forward, again like the INTO request, that is part of the greater mix at the moment.  We will know a lot more this time next Tuesday.  </p></speech>

The questions from our members today are based on information the committee has received from various witnesses who have appeared before us over the past two years.  The summer provision is one thing and I note with interest the Minister's commitment to it.  It is vitally important that it is out there strongly and that every plan is put in place for next summer.</p> <p>  On SNAs and the part that they play in the entire school community, particularly special schools and schools with special classes, the whole group puts together so much work and dedication.  As a society we cannot underestimate or undervalue the commitment that is being given at school level in terms of what they are doing.  In some instances, an allocation of SNAs is made and then the school authorities look at it and say they need more help and resources.  I know that there is a process to appeal it to the National Council for Special Education but it is something that needs to be looked at to ensure the method of appeal is not cumbersome.  I certainly have come across situations where they have had to go to the nth degree and eventually they get it.  The Department will say that a huge number of SNAs are being appointed overall but there may be something that should be looked at in that regard.  </p> <p>  On school transport, the Minister is meeting the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in the morning to discuss school transport issues specifically.  I have a question on school transport for people with additional needs.  Sometimes families or the school authorities may not have ticked the right box when the application was put in as to whether they want a transport grant or a taxi.  Sometimes the taxi does not work out.  People could go for a taxi but then have to revert because of complex needs or because of a number of issues.  There should be a bit of flexibility and some kind of cooling-off period or trial period that would give the option to either go A or B after a period of two, three or four weeks or whatever is deemed appropriate.  That has to be done.  There is no question or doubt but that a huge amount of work has been done in mainstreaming special education and in ensuring special classes.  There are very difficult, complex cases that continuously come to the committee's attention.  While the Department and everybody are trying to do the greater good, there should be accommodation when challenges are encountered.</p><p>I compliment the Minister on her recent visit to the excellent Holy Family Special School in Charleville.  She visited a number of schools but that school was the highlight of the day, as were the issues we dealt with.  I compliment her specifically on that as we talked about special education.</p><p> I ask the Minister to address the issues of the appeal mechanism for special needs assistants and the need for a little flexibility on transport for children with additional needs.  On the overall issue of transport, where there are priorities at present, people with additional needs should get concessionary tickets, if they are available or if there is a lottery for them.  There is a mechanism for that.  Again, the situation is ever evolving and new information is coming on a daily basis, from society and the Department.  Special education will have to keep evolving to meet the needs as we go forward.  The Minister has alluded to that in a number of her contributions.  I thank the Minister and ask her to address those few questions. </p></speech>

I have already outlined I am very committed to expanding summer provision to the widest of its capacity.  I appreciate the Chair has a particular interest in that.  There is significant interest and commitment at this committee regarding the expansion of summer provision.  As I said, a body of work is under way to see how we can improve and enhance it even more for next summer.  I appreciate the engagement of everybody here.</p> <p>  On the SNAs and the method of appeal, the NCSE streamlined the appeals system this year.  There is always further scope in future but it simplified the process this year.  The Chair raised an interesting point regarding school transport and an element of trial around what method best suits a child with additional needs.  I will take that with me.  A child with additional needs, however, is automatically provided for as regards school transport.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the wonderful visit to Holy Family Special School, in particular in the context of the issues we talked about.  It is an absolutely superb school community.  I appreciated the opportunity to visit there. </p></speech>

On the special units that have been built onto schools, as Deputy Canney said, it is very important that it is policy where new schools are being built, or where there is substantial refurbishing of additional schools that are not new, that children are not travelling long distances and the units are, as much as possible, available in nearly every community.</p></speech>

I apologise to Deputy Canney.  I should have referenced that myself.  It is the absolute objective that the closer we can bring transport to a child's immediate home, the better.  A body is work is there.  We are coming from a base that did not always provide for that transport, but it is the objective.  It can be seen from the way we are growing the special classes that we are getting closer and closer all the time.  That is the absolute objective.</p></speech>

We are joined by Dr. Michael Byrne of University College Dublin, UCD, Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly and Mr. Owen Duggan from Threshold, Ms Mary Conway, Ms Margaret McCormick and Mr. Brendan Allen of the Irish Property Owners Association, IPOA, and Mr. Pat Davitt, Mr. Gerry Coffey and Mr. Paul McCourtney of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV.  The opening statements have been circulated to members.  I ask witnesses to limit their contributions to five minutes as a result.</p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege.  Before we begin, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses attending the committee are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions at today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action or anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as would make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the witnesses to make their opening statements in the following order: Dr. Byrne will be followed by Ms O'Reilly, Ms Conway and Mr. Davitt if everyone is in agreement.  We will start with Dr. Byrne.</p></speech>

I will read a slightly abridged version of my written submission.  In the decade following 2010, Ireland experienced a catastrophic collapse in housing supply, as well as a rapid expansion of the private rental sector.  These two processes have interacted to exert enormous pressure on tenants.  In what follows, I will begin by assessing the impact of this change and then discuss the future of the private rental sector.</p> <p>  The major trends within the private rental sector can be addressed under three headings, namely, residential instability, private rental sector affordability and wealth inequality.  Data collected by Focus Ireland indicate that almost 70% of families presenting as homeless have come from the private rental sector and the majority of these have been evicted.  Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, data indicate that notices of termination issued by landlords have increased by 58% in the first half of this year compared with the previous six months.  More than half of these terminations are linked to sale of property.  Beyond this, we do not have robust evidence on the prevalence of residential instability, that is, evictions and involuntary moves.  Therefore, the qualitative research we have is of particular importance.  I have conducted two qualitative studies in recent years examining the experiences of tenants in the private rental sector, both of which find that insecurity is a pervasive feature of the housing experience of many tenants, which is a finding echoed by international evidence.</p> <p>  Based on the evidence from Ireland and internationally, we can conclude that the expansion of the private rental sector is associated with the growth of residential instability as a significant feature of our housing system.  In terms of affordability, rental inflation appears to have become a structural feature of our housing system.  Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research indicates that 16% of households had housing payment-to-income ratios greater than 30% in 2015-2016, but that this figure was double for private rental sector households.</p> <p>  Another piece of ESRI research published earlier this year found that the introduction of rent pressure zone, RPZ, legislation led to a moderation of annual rent increases within RPZ areas.  However, rental inflation for new tenancies continues to be very high.</p> <p>  In the context of the affordability challenge, housing assistance payment, HAP, and other rent subsidies provide a crucial support for renters with as many as one third of tenants now in receipt of HAP or another subsidy.  Nevertheless, the cost to the Exchequer has accelerated quickly and rent subsidies do little to address the issue of residential instability outlined above.</p> <p>  The decline of homeownership is also associated with a growth of wealth inequality.  Another piece of ESRI research published last year shows that the share of aggregate net wealth in the bottom 50% of households fell from 12.2% in 1987 to 6.8% in 2018.  The decline of homeownership is identified by that research as one of the main drivers of wealth inequality, echoing international research.  Taking these three issues together, the evidence suggests that the expansion of the private rental sector in the context of wider challenges in the housing system has accelerated housing inequality significantly.</p> <p>  Turning to the future of the private rental sector, rather than focusing on fixing the issues in the private rental sector, our focus should be on fixing the housing system as a whole and repositioning the role of the private rental sector within that housing system.  Building on this, I advocate three guiding principles for how we think about the future of the private rental sector, the first of which is supporting tenants.  The evidence demonstrates that a large majority of tenants do not wish to remain in the private rental sector.  Policy needs to support households to move on from a private rental sector that is often failing them.</p><p>Further research is required here but there are a number of avenues through which this might be pursued, such as stabilising house prices in general, supporting households in accessing mortgages and expanding social housing and cost rental housing.  These measures will reduce the concentration of ownership of residential property, which has the potential to create a more equitable and stable housing system, to produce better outcomes in terms of affordability and security and to reduce the extent to which housing operates as an investment asset.</p><p> Second, tenants who remain within the private rental sector must be protected.  All the Irish and international evidence show that security of tenure is the bedrock for everything else in the private rental sector.  Without security, tenants cannot advocate for themselves, cannot create a stable home and continue to be at risk of homelessness.  Moreover, even if the ongoing attempts to increase housing supply are successful, by the time they have an impact on most households many of the children currently growing up in the private rental sector will already be adults.  It is simply not possible to protect tenants in the short term via the mechanism of supply.  Finally, we need to protect the stock of private rental sector dwellings, particularly given current concerns around small-scale landlords leaving the sector.  However, policy that aims to protect the stock of private rental sector properties should not undermine the previous two objectives, namely, widening access to the other tenures and protecting tenants. </p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Owen Duggan, who is assistant manager of Threshold&rsquo;s eastern region services.  Threshold has worked with and supported tenants living in the private rental sector since 1978.  Each year we assist approximately 20,000 households that are private renters.  Threshold advocates for a better housing system, which includes increased security of tenure, affordability, improvement in standards and a sustainable private rental sector.  We are working towards a vision where housing is a right, is affordable and accessible to everyone.  I will present the current situation in the private rental sector as informed by the experience of Threshold&rsquo;s clients.  I will also set out some of the key areas in which Threshold believe changes are needed to ensure renters have secure, affordable homes of good quality.<br/><br/>Threshold is deeply concerned for the future of those who are relying on the rental sector to meet their housing need, particularly those who are reliant on it to meet their long-term housing need.  Among these we have acute concerns for those on limited incomes, those with children, older people and single people.  The private rental sector in Ireland is not a place to forge a long-term home of your own.  Despite the many protections and improvements in regulation, a landlord can still evict a tenant where there has been no wrongdoing on the tenant&rsquo;s part.  Landlords are evicting tenants in unprecedented numbers.  Threshold has supported, on average, 462 private renters a month this year, who have received a notice of termination from their landlord.  This means that every 20 minutes, a Threshold adviser is answering a call from a tenant who has been evicted from their home.  The majority of these, 58%, were issued as the landlord intends to sell the home.  This is dramatically different from the position in 2019, pre-Covid, when we assisted an average of 263 private renters a month.  The figures have almost doubled in three years.  With extremely low levels of properties advertised to rent, delivery of social housing falling short of need and the challenges of accessing homeownership, it is highly likely that an increasing number of people will be forced into homelessness.  We expect to see the homeless figures increase in coming months.  However, we are hearing that some local authorities are unable to provide emergency accommodation and so are turning people away.  This will mean an increased number of people living in hidden homelessness, that is, people who are sleeping on couches, on floors, in cars or rough sleeping.  These people will not be counted in the official homeless figures. <br/><br/>An additional plight for renters is the increased cost of living, in particular, the cost of heating the home this winter.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has identified that private renters are one of the groups hit hardest by rising inflation.  The ESRI has identified that private renters are at greater risk of poverty in comparison to owner-occupiers.  Rental homes have lower building energy ratings, BERs, than other tenures, and renters reliant on HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, are more likely to be living in homes with a rating of D or less.  It is highly likely this year that many renters will go without heating their homes.  Our colleagues in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have already reported that people are cutting back on heat, electricity and even food.<br/><br/>There has been little change regarding the other issues brought to Threshold by renters.  The problem of poor standards and outstanding repairs in the home remains constant.  Fewer people are seeking assistance with rent reviews.  While we are hopeful that this is an indication that sitting tenants are being charged the legally permitted rent, we are concerned that renters may be putting up with the rent increases in order that they can hold onto their homes.  We have concerns about the rate of rent increase outside of the rent pressure zones.  In the most extreme cases, we have seen rents increased by 60% or more and in a number of cases, they have doubled.  <br/><br/>The solutions to these problems are manifold.  We expect to see some temporary measures in budget 2023 to alleviate some of the impact of the increased cost of fuel and other essentials.  However, the issues I have highlighted today will remain once these temporary measures have been exhausted.  We are proposing the reintroduction of a tax relief for private renters.  This was ended in 2010, when rents had reached an all-time low.  Rents are now almost double what they were at the end of 2010.  We would like to see the establishment of a &euro;20 million rent arrears fund to assist renters who may fall into arrears.  This will ensure that landlords receive their rent.  On the retention of rental properties in the sector, we recommend a reduced capital gains tax for landlords who sell their home with the tenant <i>in situ</i>to the local authority or an approved housing body, AHB.  This will keep tenants in their home and provide long-term security and affordability.  It is a targeted measure aimed at those landlords who have a genuine desire to sell and exit the market.  </p></speech>

By way of introduction, the IPOA is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to protect and promote the interests of private residential property owners and to encourage the supply of good quality accommodation and professional standards of property management.  The IPOA is a national association, representing landlords from single property owners to multiple property owners throughout Ireland.  Driven by our alarm at the housing availability crisis currently engulfing Ireland, we have been motivated to collaboratively work with like-minded associations such as the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers to devise targeted solutions to stem the exodus of private landlords from the property market.  With that in mind, we jointly commissioned renowned economist, Jim Power, to compile an economic report detailing the state of the sector and on the back of this, we prepared a budget submission loaded with solutions focused on alleviating the crisis, providing a more equitable ecosystem for non-institutional landlords and avoiding the ever more scarce supply of rental accommodation.</p> <p>  At the outset, it should be noted that the pressures on landlords that were identified when the research was conducted have been further exacerbated since.  Inflation has risen substantially, thereby impacting insurance and maintenance costs and the European Central Bank has raised interest rates by 1.25%, consequently increasing mortgage costs.  Absorbing these challenging fiscal circumstances is extremely difficult for our members and is threatening their longevity in the market, which is bad for them, bad for prospective tenants and bad for housing policy.  However, the significance of the impact of the foregoing is best understood against a backdrop of the sector more generally.  Private non-institutional landlords provide 94% of rental accommodation in Ireland, and 70% of these landlords have five properties or fewer  Some 43% of these landlords made the decision to invest in rental property as a means of pension provision and for a majority, rental income represents their sole pension income apart from the State pension.  Finally, I wish to draw members' attention to the age demographics of non-institutional landlords.  Some 75% are above the age of 50 and 48% are above the age of 60.</p><p>This is important to note as taxation issues around inheritance are contributors to landlords leaving the market.  On foot of this, our organisations have prepared proposals in the area of taxation and included these in our pre-budget submission, which I will go through now.</p><p> On the introduction of a new rate of tax, the IPAV and the IPOA recommend that a new rate on residential rental income of 25%, inclusive of USC and PRSI. be introduced for residential rental profit to encourage small private landlords to remain in the market and to support new investment.  We propose that this be funded from the introduction of a tax rate of 25% for all investment funds, including real estate investment trusts, REITs, operating in the residential rental market, which would bring much-needed equilibrium to the treatment of landlords.  It is entirely inequitable that two different investors both providing identical product and service can have such disparity in tax treatment.  The private investor is taxed at a marginal rate of up to 55% while the private equity funds, the REITs, pays 0% tax on rental profit once they exit the market within a defined period.  While this practice is riddled with imparity for our members, it is the loss to the Exchequer that is astounding when one considers that some REITs continue to make rental profits totalling hundreds of millions of euro.</p><p> The Exchequer gain from subjecting funds to a 25% rate of tax should be used to encourage non-institutional landlords to stay, through a tax reduction that would allow them to remain viable and continue providing much-needed accommodation to desperate tenants who need a roof over their head.  This would ensure the equal treatment of investors and these measures would help with retention and increase supply.</p><p> We propose the introduction of roll-over relief in regard to capital gains tax on the sale of all assets where proceeds are invested in residential property within 12 months.  This would encourage existing and new investors to reinvest in the market, in short, enabling the retention of supply and incentivisation of new investment.</p><p> The IPOA and the IPAV also call for a reduction in capital acquisitions tax, CAT, on the inheritance of residential investment properties.  Many families are forced to pay large CAT bills on the inheritance of residential property, which forces the sale of the residential property to fund these taxes.  A reduction in the tax charge by reducing the taxable value by 90%, as applies to the inheritance of agricultural property and business assets, should be introduced as a priority for the inheritance of residential property.  This would encourage current property owners to pass assets to the next generation, allowing the next generation to remain in the market, and encourage other individuals to invest in the market to take advantage of the relief.  This would assist with retention and supply and would, in turn, incentivise new investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.659" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Davitt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#C00200"><p>I am delighted to be here with Oireachtas Members today.  I will first talk about rent pressure zones, which are creating a two-tier rental market.  The maintenance of quality accommodation is not economically justifiable where RPZ rules apply.  The capital value of properties subject to the RPZ rules are dropping because many properties are rented at well under market rent and when landlords sell these properties, they have to sell them at investment value and, hence, must right down the value of the properties.  Properties of non-institutional landlords who leave the market are often replaced by new properties at much higher rents that are owned by institutional landlords.  The constantly changing and very challenging regulatory environment, as well as the drastically unequal taxation treatment of such landlords by comparison with other landlords, is a real factor in the marketplace.  On the latter point, there has been such a high level of interference in the market that some landlords are now holding properties out of the market.  New legislation of June this year, which increases the notice periods for termination, will further hasten the exit of small landlords.<br/><br/>Another point I would like to make is how decisions are being made on the back of seriously incomplete data.  Every time there is a new Daft or Myhome report on the rental sector, we hear there are only a limited number of properties available to rent.  This is very concerning to us because neither portal can tell anyone how many properties are in the rental market overall on any given day of the week.  They can only measure what is on their portals, and this is nowhere near the complete picture.<br/><br/>On the subject of portals, I wish to talk about the RTB 360 portal.  Some Deputies may have received correspondence on this from their constituents.  It is another portal that is causing a major problem for landlords and their agents.  The RTB 360 portal was launched in November 2021 and it is simply not fit for purpose.  No prior discussion took place with those who use it.  It was not tested by a single agent or landlord before it went live.  On 4 April 2022, new legislation came into effect requiring landlords to register each of their tenancies with the RTB every year.  This must be completed within one month of the anniversary of when the tenancy began.  A four-month transition period was provided for tenancies which have renewal anniversaries between 4 April and 3 July 2022.  This transition period ended on 3 August 2022.  A massive portion of attempted registrations on this portal are unsuccessful.  When such systems are introduced, the norm is that the old one can be referenced when needed and relevant data retrieved.  That is not the case with this one, however.  The old system disappeared overnight.  No one can access their previous data, some of which was built up over the previous 17 years.  The cost of this to agents is huge in downtime; extra resources are needed and there are costs in staff time in attempting to deal with a system that is not functioning.  I would safely say that even someone with a technology degree could not master it.  Morale in estate agents' offices is seriously impacted and many agents are seriously considering their future in the rental market, given the excessive costs of doing business with the RTB.  Agents now face the threat of late registration fees, despite the fact that the issues are not of their making.  The failures are so widespread and extensive, which they have now endured for so long, that we believe it is time for the RTB to scrap the system and build a new one, despite its cost of &euro;7 million.  Bad technology on day one is simply bad technology, and given the failure of all attempts to fix to date, it will likely never be corrected, not to mention the cost to the State.<br/><br/>In fairness to the CEO of the RTB and his staff, they are doing a great job in attempting to turn a sow&rsquo;s ear into a silk purse.  I imagine they are overwhelmed with emails, letters, telephone calls and complaints, yet they remain helpful and pleasant.  The IPAV has tried to help.  We got the RTB to agree to a working group and RTB staff visited agents&rsquo; offices to see the problems for themselves but to no avail.  The system is still dysfunctional.  Regardless of the chaos of this system, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has insisted on the annual renewal date for all registrations.  The law must be amended immediately to change the renewal date until a functioning system is in place.  In fairness to the RTB, it has decided to refund all payments and penalties, which is a huge problem in itself and adds to its workload.  I call on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to immediately intervene and provide whatever finance or resources are necessary to fix the problem, even if it means the complete withdrawal of the system.  We are of the view that a new portal is needed, one that is properly tested by agents, landlords and other users before it goes live.<br/><br/>Over four years ago, IPAV members were reporting a new trend emerging of small private landlords leaving the market.  To get some sense of how prevalent this was, we decided to do a survey of our members who reported that what we were hearing was, indeed, accurate.  In July 2018, we published data on this worrying trend.  This publication was greeted with a fair degree of scepticism and some derisory commentary.  There was disbelief that small landlords, at a time when rents were so high, would even consider leaving the market.  I have a post from an agent in Cork that was published on LinkedIn a number of days ago.  It is the story of where we are at the moment in the marketplace.  It simply states:</p> <blockquote> 	Feeling sad today.  Given notice of termination to a lovely tenant and family.  The landlord&rsquo;s mortgage repayments are up &euro;300 per month (1.25%).  Rent can only be increased by &euro;25 as the property is in a rent pressure zone.  The rent for this home is at 60% below the open market, or the market value of property in the area.  60%.  And the tenant would gladly pay more money for this property and will be paying more in their next property, but landlords and tenants are losing out due to the rental regulations in the RPZs that are not working.  Rent pressure zones are many years in operation and are only making the rental market more dysfunctional.  When are we going to cop on and admit that this experiment is not working? </blockquote></speech>

This is a very challenging sector of which we are all acutely aware.</p><p>I have some questions about the proposals and suggestions made by Threshold, the first of which relates to renters, to giving them more support and to the reintroduction of the tax relief for them, something we have been arguing for as a party.  Is it proposed that this would be applied regardless of income?  Is it tax relief across the board and do our guests have any idea as to what the costs would be?</p><p>On the proposal to establish a &euro;20 million rent arrears fund, how would that be administered and who would administer it?  Again, would it be open to all renters or just to those in receipt of rental supports?  Ms O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned looking for changes in the arrears legislation.  What changes is Threshold proposing in that regard?  She acknowledged the increases in the HAP rates, and while the homeless HAP rates are certainly helping in some instances, it is an incredibly challenging situation.  As Mr. Davitt described, it is really difficult for people on the coalface.  By how much would it be increased and would that be in addition to, and over and above, the homeless HAP rates?</p><p>Threshold has also suggested further funding the homelessness prevention budget by 20%.  What exactly would that fund be used for?  Would it go into homeless HAP payments, into paying for more private emergency accommodation, into local authorities purchasing housing with <i>in situ</i>tenants or, potentially, into providing long-term leasing?  How do our guests foresee that approximately &euro;40 million being used?</p><p>On reducing the capital gains tax for landlords, what has been Threshold's experience in respect of the tenant <i>in situ</i>option that is available?  I also would be interested in the property representatives' views in this regard.  Where a tenant is <i>in situ</i>, the landlord is selling and the local authority has permission to purchase the property, is that not working?  Is the landlord not already getting the benefit of a certain sale at the market rate without any of the costs of sale, advertising or commissions or of having to invest in the property to present it to the market?</p><p>I apologise for the number of questions but this is an important discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.662" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#D00300"><p>We have spent some time looking at how a tax relief for renters could be introduced in a targeted fashion, but where something is proposed to be delivered via the tax system, it can be difficult to do that.  Approximately one fifth of private renters are in receipt of HAP, and while there may be challenges and difficulties with that payment, it offers some form of relief and it is likely that many people in receipt of it may not be able to avail of a tax relief, which would leave only people earning more than a certain sum.  I do not see a way in which the tax system could have a cut-off point, whereby someone earning above a certain amount would not be eligible for it.  There may be people within the Department of Finance who could figure out a way of doing that, but what we propose is a general tax relief.</p> <p>  As regards cost, it would depend on whether there is a cap on the relief.  At present, with medical expenses, for example, the relief is 20% and there is no cap on that, as far as I am aware.  I would be delighted if the same were brought in for private renters but I do not envision that being the case.  If, on average, &euro;1,000 were refunded through a tax relief to private renters, it would cost approximately &euro;220 million, assuming those HAP households were removed from the equation.</p> <p>  As for administering the rent arrears fund, we envisage that operating via the likes of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  At present, if someone in any kind of arrears approaches MABS, it will assess what money is coming in and going out.  Such assessments are done through the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, for people in mortgage arrears and then at the end, MABS will say how much the person can afford to ensure he or she will have enough left at the end of the day to meet his or her needs.  If it is the case the person cannot afford to start paying back the arrears in a fashion that is timely enough for the landlord, we propose MABS could then tell the person that he or she could avail of this rent arrears fund, get a long-term loan, perhaps at 0%, which was a possibility even six or eight months ago, or even a low-interest loan to allow the person to pay back those arrears over a longer period and stay in the home, while the landlord would not be out of pocket.</p> <p>  On increasing the HAP rates, we have referred to that in our pre-budget submission.  The ESRI has recommended the rates be increased to ensure a certain proportion of properties in a local area are available for HAP tenants, which would have to be done on a local authority basis, similarly to how the rent supplement is reviewed every year.</p> <p>  With the homelessness prevention budget, we are looking specifically at measures that would target people who are at risk, and a lot of people do not necessarily identify themselves as being at risk in some way.  These kinds of measures would come in at the very early stages to prevent people from entering homelessness but there is no reason that could not be extended, as the Senator suggested, to leasing and so on.</p></speech>

It is important we hear from all sides in this debate given the serious issues in the sector.  I acknowledge also the recent research of the IPOA and IPAV.  It is a very important contribution.  Whether or not one agrees with the individual proposals, it is valuable to have that dialogue.</p> <p>  It is important we acknowledge that the private rental sector is at a turning point and, therefore, we have to think about the longer-term consequences of whatever the Government or the Opposition argues for doing today.  There has been far too much short-term, knee-jerk reaction, both during the Celtic tiger era and more recently, and that has created the kind of instability Dr. Byrne outlined earlier.  I am increasingly of the view our private rental sector probably grew too big too quickly, and that is not a criticism of anybody who invested in it.  Government policy incentivised much of that investment during the Celtic tiger era and some of the issues we are now dealing with are the outworking of that growth.</p> <p>  It is absolutely the case that the main problem we have had relates to the lack of delivery of social and affordable housing from the 1990s to the present.  One third of all private rental tenants should be in social housing.  There are almost 100,000 people between HAP, RAS and the rent supplement.  Again, that is not the fault of landlords or landlord organisations but rather is a failure of the State to ensure an adequate supply of social housing.  Moreover, many people in the private rental sector should be in cost rental or affordable owner occupation and that has to be borne into our considerations.  I have some sympathy with the landlord organisations in regard to badly designed rent regulation creating a two-tiered market, which is causing problems not only for their members but also for many tenants, and I would make the same point about the inequities in the tax treatment.  The idea that some categories of landlords pay no tax at all on their rent or capital gains is just absurd and I do not see how anybody can justify it, so I agree on that point.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, I want to put on record two points about State support for landlords, the first of which relates to the fact that rents, even within rent pressure zones, have increased over the past five years.</p><p>Depending on when a rent review fell it was possible for some landlords to increase rents by as much as 22%, 20% or 18% over five years within the rent pressure zone legislation.  This is a matter of fact and we should not lose sight of it.  It does not mean all landlords increased their rents by these amounts but it was permissible under the rules.  It is also important to acknowledge that mortgage interest relief increased back to 100% in 2020 from 75% in 2016.  This is a significant taxpayer contribution.  I am not making these points to be critical, I just think they are part of the overall picture that we need to bear in mind.<br/><br/>My first question is for Dr. Byrne.  To take his argument to the logical conclusion it is not just about giving people an exit out of private rental and into social rental, cost rental or another scheme.  Is there an argument, as was made in a paper he recently shared from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, to look at policy instruments to redistribute properties from the private rental sector to the social rental sector and owner occupation?  Threshold has proposed a policy of capital gains relief for tenants <i>in situ</i>.  Do we need to look in a co-ordinated way at making sure that as landlords leave, we make every effort to try to keep tenants in those properties, whether they become owner occupiers, cost renters or social renters?<br/><br/>My next question is for Threshold.  As is absolutely their right, the landlord organisations have made the case that within rent pressure zones an existing landlord where there is a change of tenant can reset the rent up to the maximum allowed on the market.  What would be the consequence of this for the people Threshold represents given where those asking rents are, particularly in high-demand areas?<br/><br/>My next question is for the Irish Property Owners Association.  On the basis of the figures provided, the specific tax relief it is calling for would cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;300 million.  This is a very big sum of money.  If the Opposition is to support this measure, we would want to be sure that it would do what it says it would do, which is to keep landlords in the market.  Given the age profile Ms Conway has outlined, is it not the case that many of these landlords, as they move to and beyond pension age and particularly given where house prices are at present, have an incentive no matter what the tax take is to sell the property to get a lump sum at this point?  Many of these landlords invested for this reason.  How sure is the Irish Property Owners Association that if it got this &euro;300 million for the sector we would not still see an exit of accidental landlords and what I call pension-pot landlords from the market?</p></speech>

As part of the background to the question, which is extremely important, I will zoom out from the current issues in the private rental sector and from the Irish private rental sector in general and look at the international context.  Ireland is just one of a number of jurisdictions that have experienced a rapid rise in the private rental sector and a decline of home ownership during a very similar period.  These countries include the US, the UK, New Zealand, Australia and Spain.  What is very noticeable from the international evidence is that all of these jurisdictions have experienced similar problems, with residential instability and evictions becoming a characteristic feature of poverty in a way they were not before and with rent increases becoming more common and more difficult to control.  Various countries have responded to this in various ways.  Some, such as Ireland, Spain and parts of Germany, have introduced rent regulation.  Others have not.  Some, such as Ireland and Scotland, have strengthened security of tenure and others have not.  There have been various responses.  The issues are remarkably similar in various jurisdictions.  This evidence strongly suggests that experiencing a rapid increase in the private rental sector, which is the most insecure tenure, tends to generate general systemic problems in the housing system.  Ireland's problems are particularly acute because it happened in tandem with a catastrophic collapse in supply.</p></speech>

Our idea is to try to keep properties in the rental sector and one potential way to do that is by using capital gains tax relief.  More importantly, the Deputy mentioned the owners' age profile.  When those owners pass on the properties to their children, they will pay capital acquisitions tax at 33%.  If they were in another business there would be business relief or dwelling house relief.  These are not available.  This is one challenge we have.  Were capital acquisitions tax relief available, there would be a high probability that the property would stay within the market.</p> <p>  I want to comment on another issue.  We have to understand that landlords are not the enemy.  We are part of the solution.  REITs were brought into the market at a time when we needed them but their time has passed.  Now we have an inequitable situation whereby they do not pay tax but our members pay 55% tax.  It is grossly unfair.</p></speech>

I will preface my remarks by saying I am a renter.  There are a number of reasons cited as contributing factors as to why Threshold has dealt with more notices to quit in the past six months than it did prior to the pandemic.  We are all aware of them.  Prices have risen.  Many properties have gone out of negative equity and landlords are leaving the market because it is no longer a desirable profession.  We will tease out some of the reasons this may be the case.  The witnesses have cited issues with taxation, inefficiencies and bureaucracy of regulation and specific issues with the RTB.  I want to look at some of the additional points that often do not get spoken about but that I hear about privately as an Oireachtas Member when I deal with these matters.  Do both organisations feel that landlords have been vilified by so-called independent commentators and many Opposition politicians when speaking about the rental market, although they all know the importance of having a proper functioning rental market and the importance of having landlords?  Do they feel this has been the case in recent years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Davitt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#E01500"><p>There is no doubt this is the case.  It is the case today.  Ms O'Reilly of Threshold has spoken about a fund.  At present, when tenants stop paying their part of the rent, the housing assistance payment is also stopped and the landlord is immediately left with no rent.  This proposal would help greatly with the problem because were landlords to get the bigger part of the rent, which is the HAP part, they may well be happy to leave the tenant in the property without seeking to put them out.  The tenants may only be paying a small part of the rent, perhaps 10% or 15% of it, but the minute they stop paying, the housing assistance payment is also stopped and the landlord has no rent.  If the fund mentioned was in place, it would be helpful for the marketplace.  With regard to vilification, we have spoken about landlords evicting tenants and looking for vacant possession.</p><p>If county councils were happy to buy properties for the market rent and at the market value of those properties, why would landlords not sell them the property tenanted?  What is the problem?  There is none except that the county councils and people will not pay that value for properties because they are being rented at half their value.  That is the reason.</p></speech>

We have all heard the comments and policies being proposed in regard to a three-year rent freeze.  The left-wing Berlin government proposed a five-year rent freeze and within 12 months, not only had that been struck down by the supreme court but it had resulted in a 50% reduction in the number of rental properties available.  If the Government were to introduce a three-year rent freeze, would that result in more landlords leaving the market?</p></speech>

There is no question but that we would lose more landlords.  We need to stem the exodus of property owners from the sector.  It is a totally dysfunctional market and we need substantial and meaningful change to the tax treatment to prevent that.  This is an emergency.  For six years, the RPZs have been in place and levels of rent have been restricted depending on when the landlord went into the sector.  When the RPZs were introduced, there was one level and landlords were restricted to that level.  The indebtedness of a landlord was not taken into account in regard to the restrictions and the degree to which they are allowed to increase rents.  For a highly indebted landlord, if costs are increasing and the income is restricted, that is just not workable as a business.  The yield is too low and trades are running at about 30%, but landlords are restricted to 2% increases and the mortgage interest rate has increased.  It is just not functioning.</p></speech>

If the sale of a property could proceed only on the basis that the purchaser agrees to accept the sitting tenant and to comply with the existing rental contract, would that result in more landlords leaving the market?</p></speech>

We do not want to have a two-tier rental market where one person gets one sum and another gets another, because how can the second person survive if the first one is barely surviving on the higher amount?  I cannot see how that would work because, obviously, all tenants have different incomes.</p></speech>

As we know, all of what I outlined has been proposed by the main Opposition party.  I have many examples from auctioneers from throughout the country, not only from my only county, Waterford, that the policies being espoused by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and many others in the Opposition parties are resulting, right now, in landlords leaving the market.  Can our guests confirm that is the case?</p></speech>

As they mentioned, the overarching issue underpinning rental inflation and instability relates to the chronic shortage of housing supply, that is, a landlords' market where demand outstrips supply.  As I understand, housing delivery is picking up, including social and affordable housing, which should stabilise the housing crisis and, therefore, rents in the future.  Cost rental is the key to this, whereby the State steps in to provide rental property at affordable prices.  The model provides affordable, high-quality, warm and secure rental accommodation, freeing up more homes to the market.  In the short term, however, as mentioned by Threshold, we need targeted measures.  I welcome that group's proposals, specifically the tax rebate, which I recently pushed myself and submitted as a target budget submission.</p><p>On the issue of evictions using sale as the reason, which was cited by Dr. Byrne as being responsible for almost 70% of family homelessness.  I personally pushed to remove this as a ground to end tenancy by allowing tenants to stay <i>in situ</i>when the house is being sold but, unfortunately, this has not been accepted by the Government.  I also proposed a measure that alerts local authorities to evictions to ensure they are given enough time to assist families at risk of homelessness and of entering accommodation.  Notice periods have increased significantly.  The minimum notice period is now 90 days and can reach up to 224 days.  This gives tenants a significant period in which to find alternative accommodation if it is available, which, as I know personally from many people coming to me, it is not.</p><p>Does Ms O'Reilly know if the increased notices are working to reduce homelessness from the rental sector or are they just delaying the inevitable?</p><p>Does Ms Conway believe a new model of rental would work whereby dwellings would be designated as rental, thereby allowing stock to be sold with tenants <i>in situ</i>, akin to how it is done with commercial property?</p><p>Finally, does Mr. Davitt have annual figures for how many landlords are leaving the rental market?</p></speech>

I feel they are delaying the inevitable.  Supply cannot catch up, when it is needed in such numbers, in such a short period.  The maximum notice period is 224 days, as the Deputy noted, and that has been the case since 2015, but the fact the minimum, for a tenancy of under six months, is 90 days is helpful.  The shorter period is more applicable to a younger cohort of tenancies.  The length of tenancy does not change depending on the tenant's age, but many of those tenancies would apply to a younger cohort who tend to be more agile in being able to find alternative accommodation, and in that way it is helpful.</p> <p>  In any event, I feel it is just delaying the inevitable.  Supply is not going to catch up quickly enough to make any tangible difference.</p></speech>

The rental yield, generally, is low on a lot of the properties that are caught in this situation and the value to an investor is predicated on the property's income.  There is no comparison between the commercial sector and the residential sector.  The former comprises full repairing leases.  None of the responsibilities are on the landlord for repair and maintenance of the property's standards, so it is a completely different market.  If a landlord tries to sell with a tenant <i>in situ</i>, it will limit the options to investors, and the investor has to get an income from the property that makes financial sense, so it will substantially devalue it.  Even the fear of that is leading to people leaving the market.  We are looking at pensioners and people who rely on the income from their property as a pension.  An annual income is much better than selling and getting a lump sum, and to stay in the market they need to get that annual income.<br/><br/>The entire market is dysfunctional and the legislation on it is constantly changing.</p><p>I counted this morning.  Since 2009 there have been 88 statutory instruments on this legislation and there have been 21 changes in Acts.  There is no confidence or stability in the market.  The market is dysfunctional.  It is constantly changing.  There is nothing there to keep a member in the market.  We need to keep property owners in the market.  In a lot of cases people are saying to me that their tenants are going to move, because they know they are going to move on, and as soon as they do they will move out.  Financially, it is not worth it and legislatively it is difficult, if not impossible.  It is prescriptive and it is not outcome-focused.  It is really awkward and continually changing.  There is no mechanism to bring rents up that are substantially below market rate.  There is no fairness in it.  We can only take one month's deposit but it takes two months to serve a notice of termination for non-payment of rent.  The legislation is flawed.  It just does not work.  It is not balanced in any way.</p><p> With regard to investment, in 2006 19% of mortgage lending, or &euro;7.9 billion, was borrowed.  In 2021, 1.4% or &euro;143 million was being borrowed, down from &euro;7.9 billion.</p></speech>

The body I spoke about earlier is supposed to have the figures but it does not have them either, which is very unfortunate.  The Deputy spoke about the 90 days for tenancies of up to six months but when any tenant takes a property, they take it on the basis that there is a six-month probation period for the landlord.  Why would they want 90 days to get out at the end of that six-month period?  That is beyond me.  I cannot believe it.  If somebody takes the property, they know very well about the period of six months.  Why would they need another 30 days at the end of the six months?  They should be prepared to go into a property and the landlord has permission to put those tenants out after six months if they do not get on with them, are not happy with them or if they are not paying the rent etc.  Those are the only reasons a landlord would want to put somebody out prior to the six months and now they have to wait for 90 days.  I do not believe there is one case where somebody is looking to eject a tenant and it actually works in the timeframe the Deputy is speaking about.  It could add 90 days again and again, up to 200 days.  We are talking about years here, not days.</p></speech>

I look for the supply to rental accommodation.  Nobody is building now for rental accommodation in our area.  There is no one.  In the other sector, very few people are buying houses for rental because they see all the criteria that surround that.  I am very fortunate that in our area I know some fantastic landlords, and fantastic tenants, but there is a minority of poor landlords and poor tenants.  The good landlords and good tenants are being tarnished with the same brush as the bad landlords and bad tenants, which is causing a major problem.  We are also having problems with the units in our area because if people want to invest in them they cannot because there is not enough proper infrastructure to build there with the planning process that is in place.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of the quality of the houses people are renting.  As I said, I know some very good landlords and the tenants look after the house as if it is their own.  They have built a life there and people are happy.  I know people who are in rental accommodation for nine or ten years and they do not want to move because they are very happy with the situation.  The landlord is very happy with them and they have worked it out among themselves.  However, I have seen other situations where bad landlords have despicably bad houses and do no maintenance.  Even after the council comes in and tells them to improve the situation, they will not do it because they know they can get someone to move in tomorrow morning anyway because of the housing shortage.  That is a huge problem in certain areas.  What do the witnesses think would hold onto good landlords?  Could a system could be put in place to grade the landlord, and grade the tenants, so we can separate the good ones from the bad ones?  Then we could deal with the problems, rather than changing legislation every three or four weeks or trying to change different sections every week for a minority of people.  Good tenants will not want to move and good landlords will not want to raise rents.  They work with one another.  The goalposts are moving the whole time in the sector and these bad landlords seem to be the ones we are talking about an awful lot.</p> <p>  There are certain cases where landlords try to get double the rent from people because they have properties with massive mortgages on them.  They are trying to get back not only the interest but part of the property to see if they can get a way out.  What can we do to help the good landlords and the good tenants, while at the same time bringing the stock that is there up to standard?  That might mean getting local authorities involved or something.  What do the witnesses see as a way forward?</p></speech>

They need to be and normally are enforced.  The problem with them is that the assessment criteria is a pass or fail.  If there is one thing wrong, like a vent blocked or something missing from the kitchen, it is a fail.  We already have a system there that can be used.  Properties can be inspected and dealt with.  Looking for something more is just going to add more bureaucracy and more time, energy and cost to the running of the property.  If we have to bring in something that is done on an annual basis, we would have to pay somebody to do it and get them into the property to do it.  If the property cannot be let without that, then we will have massive issues until we can clear that.  There is a cost and bureaucracy associated with that.  The vast majority of rental accommodation was built in the past 30 years.  Such a huge proportion is new property that there should not be problems with it.  It just does not make sense to bring something else in that is going to cost more.  If there is a problem in a property, the local authority is already charged with inspecting it.  It can deal with the inspection and ensure the-----</p></speech>

I have seen those young couples come to Dublin with their future plan and they want to move back down.  There are sectors within the rental industry that are good and there are sectors that are falling between the cracks.  We need to look after the ones that are falling asunder, where there are poor properties.  There have to be statistics.</p></speech>

I know from talking to landlords in my constituency that issues around the registration with the RTB have caused a huge amount of stress and distress, and have certainly been cited to me as a reason for people exiting, as well as failures around the RTB in terms of enforcement and so forth.</p> <p>  I am constantly meeting younger people in my constituency in their 20s and 30s who are living at home with their parents and who want to be out of their parents&rsquo; home and want to be renting privately or be able to buy.  They are saying to me that they feel the only option they have because the situation is so tight and so fraught is to consider emigration.  That is potentially a huge amount of skills that we are going to lose, so we are in a very serious situation.  I agree with other speakers that the lack of building of social housing, cost rental and affordable purchase over the years is one of the factors that is putting the private rented sector under extreme pressure.</p> <p>  I have several questions for Dr. Byrne.  It is fair to say he has been a very strong advocate of making improvements in the private rented sector over the years and in terms of cost rental.  If I understand him right, he is saying that a legitimate goal of housing policy for the Government would be to slow down the growth of the private rented sector or even stop the growth in the private rented sector.  Can he expand on that?</p></speech>

Essentially, while the reform of the private rental sector, PRS, that has taken place has been in general progressive and important in the Irish context, it is also clear that the structural issues have proved intractable.  The impact of increased regulation, some increases in security of tenure and rent regulation has not achieved enough in terms of affordability and residential stability.  That is echoed in other jurisdictions.  The international evidence suggests that it is the rapid growth of the private rental sector itself that needs to be at least considered.  That is the point we are at now because a lot of the other things have been tried, essentially.  If we reduce demand for private rental sector housing by increasing the availability of social and cost rental and increasing access to home ownership, that would free up the existing PRS stock for young people living at home, as mentioned by the Deputy in his statement.</p></speech>

The IPOA listed the amount of change in the private rented sector since 2009.  For any sector to have faced such a huge amount of change in regulations means it is very difficult for people to navigate and manage that, and I do not think that is the way to do things.  It should be about whatever fundamental reforms are needed on an agreed basis and with consultation, but not changing the goalposts several times a year, which is a disastrous approach to take.</p> <p>  I have a further question for Dr. Byrne.  He mentioned in his statement that rental subsidies are very expensive and they run the risk of rent inflation, and he mentioned HAP in particular.  Are there other forms of rental subsidies that we need to consider, for example, tax relief?  Is that a form of rental subsidy and what sort of risks are there around tax relief?  What is Dr. Byrne's view on that?</p></speech>

Certainly, the affordability concerns in the sector make their own case for support of that nature for tenants.</p> <p>  With regard to HAP, one of the most important and immediate changes that needs to take place is to allow HAP tenants to apply for cost rental housing.  Currently, tenants who are in receipt of HAP cannot apply for cost rental housing, which means one of their major avenues out of the private rental sector is cut off.  This is something that can be easily addressed and should be addressed immediately.</p> <p>  Although the regulatory situation has been challenging and piecemeal, it is also true that there has been an enormous increase in investment in the private rental sector over the last three years.  Investment in the private rental sector now makes up more than 40% of all commercial real estate investment in Dublin, so it is important we do not lose sight of the extraordinarily favourable market conditions that have driven a very rapid rise, although that has been in the institutional sector.</p></speech>

On a question for Threshold, its opening statement referred to rent increases outside of rent pressure zones being as high as 60% or even double, and this is something I have come across.  Needless to say, no one can sustain those sorts of rent increases.  Does Threshold think there is an issue with the criteria around rent pressure zones and how an area becomes eligible or not in terms of the data?  Does that need to be looked at?  For the 25% of the country that is not covered by rent pressure zones, in some of those areas there are very high rent increases and they do not qualify.  What is Threshold's view on that?</p></speech>

That is problematic for people on the ground where there may be only five new tenancies registered in that local electoral area, LEA, in that year but they have all had significant rent increases.</p> <p>  Rent regulation should only ever be a temporary measure while the long-term solutions are put in place.  We are now six years into rent pressure zones.  We should be further along in delivering affordable housing, social housing, cost rental housing and so forth but, unfortunately, further consideration may need to be given to how the rent pressure zones, RPZs, are designated.</p></speech>

Even though the RTB says it has particular staff dealing with the issue to which the Deputy referred, the determination orders, we find the delays are incredible in trying to get staff to even talk to landlords about determination orders and how they can get them.  As to the disputes that arise along the way, when the dispute hearing is held, the length of time to come back to the disputers is, if not all of the time then a lot of the time, not inside the timeframe set by the RTB, which is a problem for everybody.  There is a huge problem with staffing at the moment because of the fact of the new RTB portal.  It has obviously been trying to sort it out but it has been moving a lot of staff to those areas, which is what is causing the problems.</p></speech>

Most of them did not want to be landlords and they are now selling on as property prices are reaching pre-peak levels.  However, I do not have sympathy for the lobbyists asking that they can pass on a property portfolio with a 90% CAT write-down, equating to &euro;3.5 million worth of an asset, and stating this will somehow provide a guarantee for the next generation while locking out from homeownership a generation of people who come from a less privileged background.  As lobbyists, I commend them on managing to equate themselves with institutional investors, using words like &ldquo;inequality".  However, I firmly believe they should not be expecting the private renter, paying income tax on their own income that they work for daily, to pay both their mortgage and provide them with investment income.  I am one of those people who is lucky enough to have a mortgage and secure housing.  If I was to rent out my house at market rate and was treating it as a business and as my only income, it would be a long time before I hit the top rate of tax.  What landlords collectively are complaining about is paying the same tax that most workers in this country pay.</p> <p>  We have a problem with funding housing supply and that is one of the main problems about the crisis we are having in the private rented sector because we are simply not supplying the houses that we should.</p><p>Most of us agree that rents are beyond the reach of many and the incomes that are set, all while people are dealing with an inflationary crisis.  What the landlords here are stating, however, is that if rents fall, they will leave the sector.  Renters cannot expect to have affordable rent linked to their income unless it is delivered by the State.  Rather than vilifying landlords, as Senator Cummins stated, this discourse is probably just telling some hard truths from the perspective of renters to a vested interest group that wants all the flexibility but none of the conditions that come with providing people with the fundamental right of a home and security.  It is clear that the private rental sector cannot and will not fulfil the housing needs of the population.</p><p> I do not see the argument for supporting landlords but I do see the argument for supporting renters.  In the long term, that means putting people who belong in the social housing sector back into secure tenancies and cost rental, and not relying on the private rented sector to meet that social need.  Any initiatives and incentives should be linked to the cost or to affordable rental and giving tenants security of tenure which, in my opinion, is a greater social need than people realising a full investment on their speculative asset.  Most renters want to be able to buy that investment.  It is not commissioned housing stock that investors are buying but they are competing with people and taking housing from them.  I firmly believe that renters should have security and that security should be tied to their tenancy, not to their landlord.  We need to ban evictions on the basis of landlords selling the property.  Those buying a property as an owner-occupier should be able to move into it but if the property is being sold to another landlord, the tenant should have security of tenure.  That may be a controversial opinion in this room but I do not think it is controversial among the public at large.  </p><p> Would some of the landlord lobbyists be willing to participate in a buy-to-rent scheme where people give landlords pension income but would be able to buy the capital asset at the end if that was done?  </p><p> What are the two things Threshold would do on immediately?  All present agree that meeting social housing need through the private rented sector is not working.  If there were two things Threshold could bring in, not just in the budget but generally, to stem the push of people from the private rented sector into homelessness, what would they be?</p><p> I am interested in Dr. Byrne's point in respect of home ownership.  What initiatives would he put in place to support home ownership and people going from the private rented sector into home ownership?</p></speech>

I heard the Senator speaking on this issue on a radio programme this morning.  Of course, it is possible.  The ideal scenario is for a landlord to be able to sell a tenanted property to another landlord.  So long as the rent is at the right price, the seller will get the proper market price for the property.  If the rent is not at the right level, however, the seller will not get the proper market price and no investor will pay for it.  It is unfortunate but that is the way it is.</p> <p>  I also heard the Senator speaking about long-term rents.  Landlords are quite happy with ten-year rents.  The Senator was discussing them in the context of commercial rents and residential rents.  Those are completely different.

There is absolutely no problem there because, to landlords, ten-year rents would be ideal.  It is a great covenant.  The landlord would be able to sell the property, providing that it is rented at market rent.  In that scenario, it is a different thing.  Some of my friends may wish to comment.</p></speech>

The legislation is changing constantly.  If a landlord were to invest, the risk is with the landlord in that situation.  For example, the legislation may change and the landlord would be restricted and unable to sell the property.  It is such an uncertain market that it is very difficult to consider something like that.  Some years ago, the IPOA brought in an initiative known as Home for 12.  It proposed that we would give 12 years on the basis of four-year rights but, at the end of that, we could take back properties because the legislation allowed it.  We now have indefinite tenancies and the legislation only allows us to take the property back if we are selling or need it for a family member.  Going forward, we would have the same issue.  If a person enters into an investment but the rules change midway through and the investor is in a ten-year situation and cannot sell the property, the asset is substantially devalued.  Much depends on the income of a property and the market rent can vary in different situations.  One may have a property in an apartment block that is let for an income that works well but have an identical property in an apartment block in a different area that is let at the same rent, that being market rent, but the yield on which would be insufficient for an investor to purchase it.  That would devalue the asset.  It is a significant issue.  My colleague here would probably speak to the-----</p></speech>

It has been an interesting discussion and it is certainly timely and needed.  We know that private landlords are the backbone of the rental market.  As has been noted, they provide 94% of rental properties.  My local estate agents and property rental companies have given me three reasons for landlords leaving the market.  The first is the regulatory context and it changing all the time.  The launch of the RTB portal has frustrated that situation even further, as Mr. Davitt outlined.  Second, there is the issue of taxation.  We need to listen to that feedback and act accordingly.  Third, there is the prospect of possible political change and new policies which they believe would exacerbate conditions for landlords.</p> <p>  We have heard what will not work, such as a three-year rent freeze or the removal of sale of property, family use or refurbishment as grounds for termination of lease, but we need to look at what can work.  How do we deal with the regulation headaches that have been outlined?  How do we provide a fairer tax system for landlords?  Critically, will doing so achieve what has to be the overall goal, that is, to drive down the price of renting?  If a landlord takes in less rent but pays less in tax and is happy with that, that is how we keep that landlord in the market and it is how the renter pays less.  That is what we need to get to.  We need to get to the renter paying less.  Yes, in such a situation the Exchequer would end up footing the bill for the difference but we are in a rental crisis and the Government is investing hugely in affordable and social housing and incentives to get construction up and going.  I believe we also need to invest in renters.</p> <p>  How do we get the RTB portal to work?  Mr. Davitt stated that we need to start from scratch.  There may be other suggestions in that regard.  A constituent of mine could not register his or her tenancy on the new portal because it was originally registered on paper and could not be modernised.  We cannot have a system where it is not possible to modernise things.</p> <p>  We have heard proposals in respect of reductions in income tax, capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax.  Dr. Byrne listed countries that have problems, challenging landscapes and growing rental markets that are similar to the experience in Ireland in the past ten years.  Have tax incentives been used in other countries?  Have they worked?  Has any country with a landscape similar to that in Ireland cracked this issue?  I invite Dr. Byrne to respond first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#J01600"><p>It is a complex question.  My reading of the international view is that it is almost the opposite - tax incentives risk skewing the property system in ways that are detrimental to tenants in particular.  That is not inevitably the case but they present that risk.  A good example of that is in the United Kingdom, where the level of investment from small-scale landlords has been much more sustained than it has in Ireland and the buy-to-let mortgage segment has continued to grow, unlike in Ireland where it collapsed after the crisis.  The danger is that when one does that, it is a demand subsidy.  One is subsidising investment demand.  What that does, especially in a supply constraint context such as the one Ireland is currently experiencing, is to push up asset prices - house prices - and create a situation in which landlords are in a better position to outbid would-be first-time buyers, for example.  Obviously, if a landlord is paying less tax on his or her income than a first-time buyer is paying, that creates an issue.  We need to consider how subsidies for landlords interact with other aspects of the housing system.</p><p>We need to ask the bigger question as to what proportion of our housing stock do we want to be in the private rental sector.  It is currently a quarter of houses in Dublin.  Do we want that to be a third?  Do we want it to be 50% of people renting?  I do not see a huge demand for that to happen.  That is the trade-off there.  More targeted measures, where tax incentives are used in a way that requires landlords to provide security of tenure, have not to my knowledge been implemented, at least in the countries I look at, namely, the US, the UK, Spain, Australia in New Zealand.</p></speech>

The Revenue had that in practice a number of years ago.  It was abandoned in approximately 2010, though I could be corrected on that.  It is a worthwhile initiative.  Whether it will stem the crisis we have I do not know, to be honest, because it is a crisis.  We all want solutions here.  We are not trying to work against one another; we are trying to work collectively.  A tax regime that is fair on both sides would be a great help in the market.  It is not the final solution because that is really Government policy and the Government deciding how to deal with the crisis.  All we can do is look at it from our side and give the committee our view of it.</p></speech>

If I can come in, there are two questions in what the Deputy is asking.  We can tell the committee how to keep small landlords in the marketplace.  There is no doubt that what we are saying will keep small landlords in the marketplace.  The second question is how we are going to bring down rents.  It is very difficult to bring down the rents when we still have bodies renting properties that can rent them at whatever rent they want.  They are way up high and there is no control, apparently, on what those people can charge for those properties.  How are we going to bring them down when bodies can still charge what they wish?  It is just not possible.  We need to get into a situation where properties at the top of the market can only be rented at a certain level.  That is the first thing we need to do.  If we are able to do that we can at least get into a situation where the rents will stabilise and they are not stabilised at the moment, apart from the fact the ones at the bottom are way down.  Obviously the ones at the top are in a different situation but if we stabilise the rent for starters, then maybe we will get someplace in the reductions as time goes on.</p></speech>

Usually when a tenant gets in touch with us we are able to mediate and assist to get a repayment plan in place or maybe the person is not availing of the HAP or rent supplement and we assist with that.  Where it is a problem is when people are prioritising the rent over everything else and falling into arrears elsewhere and the fear of all that.  Where a tenancy is about to be terminated, we want to ensure the tenant can pay those arrears so the landlord can get the rent and that the person can remain in their home and not have upheaval that goes with that or possibly enter homelessness.</p></speech>

In that spirit I will make a couple of comments and then I have a couple of questions for Ms O'Reilly.  We are talking about assets, investments and sale prices and that is all fine but it is important for us to remember that in every rental tenancy there is a tenant or tenants, or families.  They invest huge amounts of their time, money and often their emotional well-being in the properties they are in.  While it is legitimate for landlords' representative organisations to talk about the concern for their members, one of the problems we have at the minute is many of the decisions that are being made are resulting in real people's lives being dramatically altered through eviction and homelessness.  That is not in the first instance the fault of landlords but the fault of Government policy.  However, let us always remember there are human beings, families and in many cases children involved.  One of the consequences of the instability Dr. Byrne highlighted, which politicians from all parties deal with, is the churn of people moving from one rental to another and having to uproot their children from their schools etc.  I want to put that back on the table because we should not lose sight of it.</p> <p>  I thank my colleague Senator Cummins.  He gives me far too much credit for having influence over Government policy over a long period of time.</p></speech>

The differential treatment of landlords with respect to rent regulation and the differential treatment of landlords with respect to taxation are both policies of the good Senator's party that we have long opposed and will continue to oppose.</p> <p>  I emphasise Mr. Davitt's point around data because we do not know what the market rent is today.  He is right that we know what the asking rent is for a very small number of properties at the top end.  Two years ago, the RTB stopped giving us the equivalised actual market rent for new and existing rental properties by property type and location.  The sooner we get to that the better because this conversation will be better informed.  It is also regrettable we have no registration data for 2021 or 2022.  I am conscious the old data set was not great.  The sooner we get those two things better.  That is not a criticism of the RTB and probably more one of the Government for not resourcing it.  If we had those, this conversation would be much better.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Allen that energy-efficiency retrofit upgrades should be tax-deductible.  It is crazy they are not because there is no incentive for a landlord to upgrade the energy efficiency of our rental stock.  We all know it has some of the lowest levels of energy efficiency and tenants do not have the capacity.  It is something I support strongly and I am glad Mr. Allen raised it.</p> <p>  My question for Ms O'Reilly is twofold and she should feel free, in the time she has, to answer the other questions she did not get a chance to answer.  Landlords have, again completely legitimately from their point of view, called for existing landlords to be able reset the rent to up to the asking price, per the market in that area, where a tenant moves out.  In Ms O'Reilly's view, representing the cohort of tenants she represents, what would be the impact of that, especially in high-demand areas like Dublin and the other cities?  Ms O'Reilly wanted to respond to a couple of other members' questions and I want to give her a couple of minutes to do that and if I have some more time I will put a couple more questions to others.</p></speech>

I will answer the second question first and then hand over to Mr. Duggan on the first.<br/><br/>Senator Moynihan asked what two things we would ask for.  While my gut reaction is a moratorium and a rent freeze we know that is not necessarily the most suitable solution.  It has an array of challenges.  Two we think could start to provide immediate relief and assistance is the promotion of long-term lease agreements in the private rented sector.  The IPOA has mentioned there is a difference between residential leases and commercial leases.  We could have long-term leases in the rental sector where there are perhaps fewer obligations on the landlord regarding what is provided in the property, maintenance and so on but the tenant has a guaranteed agreement for ten, 15 or 20 years.  How the rent is set on that and reviewed would need to be considered a bit differently.  The promotion of those would be a big help.  There are plenty of people over a certain age who will never buy their own home, are well settled in their community and would probably be very happy to remain in their rented home.  We have previously suggested that could be done through reduced tax for landlords who provide those agreements.<br/><br/>On the scheme to buy properties with a tenant <i>in situ</i>, we have suggested a targeted capital gains tax for landlords who are selling but perhaps there needs to be a fully-funded national scheme for that.  The current tenant <i>in situ </i>purchase is new and on a circular basis.  We are not really seeing a huge appetite for it yet but maybe there could be something more on that.  On tax mechanisms, I mentioned the long-term lease agreements as per Deputy Higgins's question.<br/><br/>I will let Mr. Duggan answer the question on the impact of allowing rent increases at the turnover of tenancy in rent pressure zones.</p></speech>

The amendments in June 2019 brought in various different requirements in regard to renovations.  In the two or three years prior to those amendments being introduced, many tenants were being evicted for renovations that were, in my experience, on many occasions nothing more than cosmetic updates to the property.  Since those amendments in 2019, evictions for renovations have fallen off a cliff.  To have that as one of the six reasons to evict a tenant does not come into play anymore for Threshold advisers and the tenants we assist.  I do not think it is too far of a stretch to say that if landlords are allowed to reset the rent when a new tenancy begins, that incentivises them to end the old tenancy, which would be very concerning.</p></speech>

I will take my slot now.  My colleagues can ensure I do not abuse the clock.  We could talk about the entire housing market and that is what we do here on a weekly basis, and sometimes it is hard to pin it down to one area.  I agree with the assessment we have had on the under-supply of public housing for a decade.  The strong commitment to public housing on public land will help to rebalance the market, which is what the Government is committed to doing and is why we will be questioning local authorities and AHBs about their delivery in that sector.  I want to understand what is happening now, which is the departure of landlords, and I want to try to get to the bottom of the motivation for that.  Landlords do two things: they manage their asset value and they also manage a business, the day-to-day business of being a landlord.  If it is possible to have lower taxation by owning a property through a company, why do more landlords not do that?</p></speech>

The issue for them is that they are paying the 25% tax rate for companies.  In addition, there is another surcharge that is applied, which stands at 20%, so the effective tax rate comes out at over 40% if they are operating through a company.  In addition, if they are trying to take out directors&rsquo; fees, there is a limit on what they can take out as that is an allowable tax deduction, so the maximum they can take out is 10% of the gross rent.</p></speech>

There is no incentive.  A property will always - I must be careful with the words I use - contaminate the tax reliefs that would be available if they were selling a business.  If selling a business, there are special reliefs available but not if selling a property.</p></speech>

There is a 25% rate that applies to company profits and there is a further surcharge applied to those profits at 20% if they are not distributed within 18 months of the financial year-end.  There is no distinction in capital gains tax been between a company and a private individual.  We find that people will invest in a company because they see it as an attractive approach but, again, there are a lot of restrictions if they are operating through a company.  People have to file annual accounts and they obviously have to deal with the taxman, deal with accountants and all of the other things.</p></speech>

If they are going to invest in something, it is hard enough to get their head around one set of rules without having to create companies and be responsible for more things within the companies as well.

I am not a tax expert, although my friends here are.  I can say that one thing about the rental income which has been bandied around a lot is that landlords should pay the 55% tax that is paid when ordinary people earn money.  That is incorrect because it is passive income that landlords get.  If I am working, I pay 55% tax like everybody else, but if I have a rental property, I get passive income on that property.  That means I cannot even pension myself from that property.  It is not an allowance.  I can do nothing.  It is not fair to say that people earning money pay 55% the same as landlords.  That is not fair to say and is not an equal comparison.</p></speech>

It seems a bit of a technical matter, but if we make it more attractive for taxation purposes, that does not necessarily impact the overall decision as to how that person manages the property and whether to sell it or not to sell it, or when to sell it.</p> <p>  I turn to a second issue of tenancies offered by the local authorities.  There is the possibility of ten-year or 20-year leases.  Most businesses, if they were guaranteed even 80% of their turnover for ten years or 20 years, would jump at it, but that has not been attractive to landlords.  The question is whether that is because of the day-to-day activities of the landlord or because of the long-term management or speculation of that asset.</p></speech>

If they sell it, there is the capital gains tax that they pay.  It is as simple as that.

Legislation is always required and we need equality to a certain degree, but it has got to the stage that the legislation is so prescriptive and so difficult that they need to go back to the drawing board and re-examine this.</p></speech>

They go on a points system if they, for example, go through the building, put in energy saving bulbs and do small, minor things.</p><p>People who are involved in managing rentals have told me about a points system whereby they take energy saving measures.

If one increases the property rating by seven BER steps, one can go back to market rent.  That is available, but moving seven steps on the rating system involves an investment of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 at a minimum for many properties.  It is very difficult to do it in many properties.  It is almost impossible to bring pre-63 or older properties up to a certain level, for example.</p></speech>

There is a substantial cost required to bring any property up.  As my colleague stated, it is not possible to offset that cost.  In addition, the property may be in a rent pressure zone.  Unless one can bring it up to the level set down in legislation, one will not be able to change the rent.

One may have a listed building and not be able to touch it, so one cannot bring it up to standard in terms of fire regulations in order to make it available for rent.  There are many properties in towns and villages across Ireland that are caught up in the listed section and cannot be touched.  The owners of the properties could rent them out if they were brought up to standard in the context of fire regulations but conservation restrictions mean they are not allowed to do so.  I was in such a building during the week.  The owner could not carry out work on the ceiling even though there was space to create six rental properties over the shop in an area with accommodation pressure and where rental properties are needed.  It was in an ideal location.  There was transport and shops and everything else in the area but due to the planning legislation for listed buildings, the owners were not allowed to carry out work on the building even though the property underneath had already been retrofitted twice.  The planning laws would not allow them to do it.  There should be an incentive for people to do that.</p> <p>  I am interested by a point raised by the Vice Chairman in respect of limited companies.

It is treated differently.  It is treated as investment income so it comes under a totally different regime.  In fact, the deductions that are available to a landlord are very restrictive.  They are not the same as those available to a normal trading business.  It is not treated as a trading business.  For example, if a private landlord makes a loss on rental income, he or she cannot offset that loss against any other income he or she may have, whereas a trading business with PAYE income can offset such a loss.  That is not available to landlords.  It is a particular section of the tax Act that limits what landlords can claim.  It is not the same as a normal business.  That is something that could be considered.</p></speech>

What I have learned today is that in order to incentivise people to bring properties up to a good standard, the taxation system for retrofitting needs to change.  An incentive should be put in place in order that people will invest in properties that are of a poor standard and bring them up to a good standard.</p> <p>  Another problem is that many landlords in areas where houses are of a poor standard are not registered with the rental authorities and will not accept HAP.  Tenants have no other option because there are no other rental properties available in the area.  They are living in poor conditions because there are no incentives for landlords to do up a property or go on the HAP system.  If the landlord had a good property, he or she would go on the HAP system and create a new place to live.  Many properties that are in poor condition are let by people who do not take HAP.  People have no other option.</p></speech>

Cost-rental is a new sector.  It will face many challenges, especially in respect of viability because the interest rate environment and cost environment are deteriorating.  There are viability challenges but what we see internationally is that countries and especially cities that have a significant non-market segment tend to have more stable housing systems.  That is clear.  There is widespread support for cost-rental, which is great to see.</p> <p>  Assisting people to purchase can also play an important role.  The trick is to recognise that it is also a demand subsidy.  The challenge is to increase access to home ownership without inflating demand or generating risk in the financial system by burdening households with risky debt.  It is not easy but it is doable to introduce supports for home ownership which are more widespread than those that currently exist and which meet those two challenges.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Donoghue asked about a grading system for good or bad tenants and landlords.  My initial reaction is that there is a power imbalance between the landlord and the tenant.  The landlord is the one who owns the home and has the right to let it to the tenant or not.  In that instance, the tenant is at a disadvantage.  It would be dangerous territory to get into.  One would have blacklisted tenants.  One might have landlords who have been given a fail but tenants have no choice and have to take the property.  I am not sure it would assist with the issues that people are facing.</p> <p>  As regards the standards, the Deputy asked about a need to look at how that is done.  At present, properties that are inspected either pass or fail.  Consideration may need to be given to putting in a sort of traffic light system.  For example, Threshold has proposed a national car test, NCT, for housing.  The name has stuck.  When one brings a car for an NCT, there can be minor faults or major faults.  It may be that an issue is flagged and, although the owner does not have to do anything immediately, it will need to be sorted for the next time the car is tested.  There may be a need to reconsider how the issues are graded in that regard.</p><p> Another point I want to make is that, generally, we only ever see the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, report, which sets out that a specific number of properties were inspected, a particular number failed and a stated number were brought into compliance by the end of the relevant year.  We are seeing low inspection rates, high failure rates and low compliance rates.  It looks like a complete disaster.  Within that, we do not know whether half the properties fail, for example, for want of a microwave or a fire blanket.  In all such cases, where the issue is so small, one would expect those properties to be in compliance by the end of the year.  This goes back to what another member mentioned, namely, the need for data and information when designing responses.  Unfortunately, organisations like ours are working with a limited amount of information from official statistics, combined with what we are hearing and seeing on the ground.  Certainly, something needs to be done about how the standards are enforced in the private rental sector.  All anyone wants and deserves is a safe home in which to live.  People are paying good money for it and they want and need it to be safe.  I thank Deputy Duffy for his questions.</p></speech>

That could easily be done.  At the moment, in the case of HAP tenants, for instance, people come into the property and the next thing is there is an inspection and a very long list of things that have to be done.  Why are we allowing situations like to happen?  Would it not be a lot easier to require a certificate of fitness for a property before it goes on the rental market?  If that were the case, there would be no more need for inspections of any description when a property is rented out to a tenant.  That is my view on inspections of rental properties.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about landlords being able to increase rents by 18% or 20%.  We have discussed this on many occasions and he knows as well as I do why landlords did not increase rents.  At that particular time, we did not have a crystal ball to see there would be all these amendments and changes down the road.  The rent pressure zones were brought upon us and they were to be in place for three years.  A lot of landlords were saying, "If my rent is not brought up to date for three years, what about it?"  In fact, we had three years, three years more and now another three years to the end of 2024.  God only knows how many more we will have after that.  This is one of the reasons rents were not brought up to date.  If a landlord had a good tenant, he or she was quite happy to keep that tenant and keep the rent below the market rent.  Before rent pressure zones came in, landlords knew they could increase the rent to market rent at any time but, unfortunately, we are now in a situation where they cannot do that.</p></speech>

Adding any additional costs makes it more expensive and increases the cost all across the board.  That just does not make financial sense.  We need to have good-quality accommodation; there is no argument about that.  Properties need to be inspected.  Local authorities need to be able to inspect them.  We need assessment criteria that reflect the quality of the accommodation that is out there.  However, to bring in something else will just increase the cost and introduce more bureaucracy.  Somebody will have to be brought in to do it.  The timeline of that will mean the property will be off the market until such time as the process has been completed.  It just does not make a lot of sense to do it.  Many landlords rewarded good tenants by keeping their rents low.  They are the very people we want and need to keep in the market but they are the very people who are leaving it because they have been punished punitively for doing that for their tenants.  If those tenants move, they have to hold the rent for the next tenants.</p> <p>  We have a dysfunctional market.  We need emergency relief and support and we need substantial, meaningful change in the tax treatment of the sector.  If that is not done, investment will go elsewhere.  We are not even retaining our existing investors.  We are a membership organisation and retention of our members is really important, alongside getting new members.  That is key here.</p></speech>

If a landlord has students moving in at this time of year, he or she will write off September because there will always be something coming up that cannot be foreseen.  If it is a family, there might be a couple of issues while they are settling in but, for the most part, things will go smoothly.  I will give the Vice Chairman an example of what can happen when trying to do an RTB registration.  I sat down one Saturday morning when I knew I would not be disturbed by telephone and did three registrations.  I am pretty good at that at this stage, having been at it a long time.  It took me an hour to do three registrations, which was just going online and filling in everything.  On the Sunday morning, I got up to two emails from the RTB to say I had done the registrations wrong.  In one case, it was my own fault as I had put in a wrong date of birth, which did not correspond to the tenant's personal public service, PPS, number.  I put in 1993 instead of 1973 for the date of birth, so I have to hold my hands up in that instance.  However, in the case of the second registration, I was told I had not put in the local authority.  I do not know how many times I have gone right through the system since but I cannot see where I am supposed to input that information online.  I have sent four emails about it and spent another hour online trying to sort it out.  For three tenancies, I have spent at least three hours at this stage trying to sort them out, and I am somebody who knows what she is doing.  That is how complicated it is.</p></speech>

I have been at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  When it comes to landlords, I have experience of supporting a friend through the dispute resolution process to which Ms McCormick referred.  The tenant involved was wrecking the house.  The tenant had 44 fridges in the back garden, had broken the furniture and had done many other things.  It took months to deal with.  Even when we got to the RTB, because I supported my friend, and we produced photographs, it still ruled against the landlord.  I accept that, in a situation where there are errant and difficult tenants, it is not fit for purpose and does not meet the needs.  There is not compensation appropriate to compensate one-off landlords in particular.  I agree in that instance.  However, the vast majority of tenants are good tenants.</p> <p>  I have a concern about the current build-to-rent model.  I know there is significant need for it.  I completely support it, but on the other hand, I come from a constituency called Dublin South-Central, where pretty much every multi-unit development being built is build-to-rent, which has an effect on the property market, the sales and the lettings.  I welcome views, particularly from IPAV, about the experience with that and its effects on the market.</p></speech>

The index is back, which is the big thing, though not all prices are back.  The model the Senator is speaking about will not have a huge effect on the market because of the number of properties for sale.  Whether it is a buyers' market or a sellers' market will depend on the proposition one is speaking about.  It is a sellers' market at the moment and I do not think it will have any effect on the price of property at all.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for answering those questions frankly.  My colleague sitting to my left, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, had an article in the <i>Business Post</i>.  Although he might like to think I was complimenting him on his impact on Government policy, I was actually stating that some utterances that he is making, even as a member of the Opposition, are having a negative impact on supply.  I was contacted by an auctioneer in my county of Waterford.  In fairness to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, he has been saying this for quite some time.  What he stated in the <i>Business Post</i>on 10 September was not new.  While it is not new to me, the email from the auctioneer stated that since the news broke, two landlords have contacted the auctioneer with a view to selling all of their properties.  The email states that one owns ten houses and the other owns 18 houses and that the client with 18 will likely retain four or five properties and sell the remainder, while the other client, with ten properties, will give notice to sell all of them.  That is a flavour of what is happening in the rental market on foot of some people's utterances.  When we talk about anything in the property sector, I always say that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  The words that I and other people say here have an impact on what goes on outside the walls of Leinster House.  That is why we need to be careful when we are considering policy interventions.  We need to ensure that they are the correct interventions and that they will not have a perverse impact, which is the opposite to what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>That leads me on to the tax relief for retrofitting.  While I agree that it sounds good in theory and it would be good to get more rental properties up to standard, we also have the resulting impact of that, which could involve more tenants losing tenancies.</p><p>This will happen because if a deep retrofit has to occur over a period of six or nine months, that will result in those tenants being out of their properties, with the negative impact that Threshold has identified.  While I accept what our witnesses said earlier, we also have to weigh up the pros and cons.</p><p> The witnesses will accept that, in the context of market rents, the rent pressure zones were introduced in good faith in 2016.  Dr. Byrne stated that it is too early to ascertain if they have been a success.  Is that be a fair comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.860" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#P00200"><p>Is that in the context of increases in rent?</p></speech>

The reason they were introduced at that time was to try to regulate market rents.  The fear is that if one were to allow market rents to be restored overnight, tenants who would be facing very large increases in rent.  I have a complete understanding of the landlords involved in this regard.  I have spoken to some of them who are trapped.  There are good landlords who try to keep tenants <i>in situ</i>at very low rents and who have maintained that position over the past number of years.</p><p>Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue is correct to state that we have many good landlords and many good tenants.  The reality is that very few end up in dispute, particularly when we take into account the totality of rental properties in the market.</p><p>On dispute resolution, Senator Seery Kearney cited the example of a landlord who had difficulty with a tenant and who had gone through the entire process.  I have also heard of examples where judgments have been made in favour of landlords by the RTB but that it took many months to resolve the issues involved.  These have been very bad tenancies where there has been antisocial behaviour.  Can our witnesses elaborate on that issue?</p><p>My final question is for Dr. Byrne, who stated that rental subsidies risk inflating rents further.  That heavily contrasts with the position of Threshold, which calls for an increase in base HAP rates in addition to the 35% discretionary uplift.  Will Dr. Byrne indicate if the Government increase the base rates?</p></speech>

It is a necessary evil to accept the reality that homelessness prevention is the number one priority in the short term.  In the medium to long term, we must transition away from reliance on rental subsidies altogether.  The pressing human need in the immediate term has to take precedence over the longer term housing strategy.</p></speech>

He is saying that we should we still should proceed with that.</p> <p>  On the dispute mechanism issue, could IPAV or the IPOA outline what practical follow-on measures could be implemented where a positive decision is in favour of either a landlord or a tenant in order that we do not have a situation where people are out of pocket, because that is what is happening?</p></speech>

One practical thing would be that when the RTB makes a determination order at the end of the relevant period, when the landlord gets his or her hands on it, that he or she should be able to go to a court clerk and a judge should be able to stamp that order for the landlord before the matter goes to a hearing.  This order has been made by one body legally, when the entire process has been undergone.  Now we are in a position where the landlord has to go to court and to the judge.  The judge may extend the period further because he or she may well take pity on the tenant.  That is fair enough because, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin stated, we are talking about families and all that that involves.  Everybody respects that.  Ultimately, however, the determination order is made and it should be proceeded with.  We find that in some areas, when the determination is given a legal standing by the judge, that the sheriffs are not picking up the tab and taking the people out of the properties.  We also find that the sheriffs in different areas are being asked to intervene by landlords.  They are being asked to come from Dublin or elsewhere to Meath, Kildare or wherever in order that an order might be given to those them.  This is because a landlord will know that these sheriffs will execute the order on their behalf.  That is a problem, and this can be done.</p></speech>

This is because that rent is due and payable.  There are many things in the legislation which should be enforceable but which are not, and that is one of them.  The long process goes ahead.  All of the time it is just used to abuse the position when it comes to the non-payment of rent.</p> <p>  The second thing I would like to see is research being done on the results of determination orders.  Determination orders are issued, but when we talk to our members about the issue of instances where rent is to be paid, no research has been done to show when it is paid.  Our members tell us that regardless of the time it takes to go through the system, the tenant may have no means.  At the end of the process, the landlord receives no money back.  This occurs in many situations and is greatly problematic.</p> <p>  Returning to something that was mentioned earlier in respect of HAP, there is nothing in that payment to protect a landlord if a tenant stops paying.  A tenant can stop paying due to many issues.  Some of these can be mental health issues or other issues around it.  There is nowhere for the landlord to go at that stage.  Something needs to be put in place whereby a local authority can look at the situation, sort it out, help the tenant to stay in the accommodation and help the property owner because the latter has no solution.  There is no solution there other than to serve a notice through the rent arrears system, which, again, takes great amount of time.  There is no protection in there.</p></speech>

I was in the D&aacute;il and will have to return there shortly.  I listened to the comments.  I have a question for Threshold.  I have a party colleague, Councillor Eolan Ryng, on Cork City Council.  Some 92% of all HAP tenancies are failing inspections by Cork City Council.  This is phenomenal.  Anecdotally, we are seeing then that when these HAP inspections have been carried out and a landlord has been notified of the work that needs to be done, landlords are then putting the properties up for sale and are issuing notices to quit.  Is that something Threshold is seeing nationally?  What does Threshold think of those figures?</p></speech>

The CSO did research in respect of the private rental sector last year on those living in HAP and RAS tenancies.  Properties with the lowest BERs are highly likely not to be in great shape structurally.  It is a risk.  The inspection has to happen eight months into the HAP tenancy.  Eight months in, sometimes later, the inspection happens and the accommodation fails the test.  The landlord may not have the resources or the desire to carry out the work and it is then within their right to issue a notice of termination for sale and leave the sector.  This is a problem.  We have proposed an NCT in respect of housing, and IPAV has spoken in similar terms here today.  We would like to see a situation where the landlord can demonstrate, prior to letting a property, that it is up to standard.</p><p>It is only when the property is up to standard that it can be rented out.  As stated, people are paying good money and should have safe and good-quality homes.  They should not be going into homes that are neither.  That is the minimum that somebody should be able to expect.</p></speech>

We do not want landlords to exit the market.  We know that 92% of those landlords in Cork who have properties are failing.  Rather than landlords pulling out, what can the Government, Cork City Council or any other local authority do to help them to get these properties up to specification and keep them in the market?  We do not want to see landlords leave because that leads to notices to quit, which leads to homelessness, which adds to the pressure.  What can we do to be constructive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.872" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#Q00300"><p>I will comment on that.  It is something we touched on earlier on.  It will not necessarily solve the problem, but I think a tax relief should be available to people carrying out renovations.  They should have, not a capital allowance that is over eight months, a relief that is immediately available to them in order that they can partially recover some of the costs involved.  That would be an incentive.  It would not necessarily solve the problem that has been identified.  However, it is better to do something, such as a tax relief like that, than not.  In Cork city, there already is a scheme like that.  However, the property would have to have been built before 1905.  Many properties being built currently or that were built after 1905 do not qualify for that renovation relief.  If that could be extended, it would be beneficial and could contribute to a solution.</p></speech>

I met a landlord a few weeks ago who was giving out to me, not in an aggressive way but, rather, in kind of a funny way.  He had to do up his property because I raised the matter in the D&aacute;il and got the property put on the derelict sites register in Cork city.  It was an old family butcher's house that has been empty for 35 years.  Because of pressure we exerted on Cork City Council to get it on the register and have a levy imposed, he is now converting it into a three-bedroom apartment and a two-bedroom apartment.  That is only happening because we pushed to have the property placed on the register.  The point he made is that he would have moved on that property - perhaps not 35 years ago but certainly years earlier - if the supports had been there.</p> <p>  We are looking vacant properties, a housing crisis and a homelessness crisis.  According to CSO figures, there are 166,000 vacant properties.  According to GeoDirectory, there are 90,000.  The actual number is probably somewhere in between.  Landlords are sitting on properties that could be used as homes for people and could bring in income for those landlords.  There are many people who are landlords, but not by intention.  They may have been left properties by family members who passed away.  These people might not have the, let us say, the ability to do anything with those properties.  They might be vulnerable individuals.  We need to take a carrot-and-stick approach in respect of these people.  There should be the stick for people who will not engage or who just state &ldquo;This is my property and I will leave it to rot if I want&rdquo;.  I do not believe in people who do that, but I believe in the good landlords.  Senator Cummins made the point earlier that the vast majority of landlords are good.  The vast majority of tenants are also good.  It is hard to see properties in my community just boarded up for ten, 20 or 30 years.  What can we do for landlords such as those to whom I refer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.874" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Davitt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#Q00500"><p>It is disgusting to see that happening.  There is absolutely no doubt about that.  I wish to go back to the point about HAP and the list of recommendations that need to be done.  We have anecdotal evidence only that when properties that are rented through HAP, the inspectors come and the landlords gets a list of things to do.  However, if they are done prior to the tenants going into the properties, we find that there are not that many things to do.  I do not know what different inspectors in different areas do differently in these inspections that the Deputy spoke about.  In some cases, there are not that many there.</p> <p>  On vacant and derelict properties, one very important point is that 50 tonnes of carbon are put into a new property.  Vacant and derelict properties are already in place and that carbon is accounted for.  We have spoken about this many times.  Why can the Government not give landlords a grant to do up these properties?  Perhaps the Government will not get the money back, but it will at least get the properties in question into the rental sector.  It is a good idea.  We have done much work on this and come up with many ideas on it as well.  If those ideas were taken on board, we would see many of those properties on the rental market.  There are 22,000 derelict properties and more than 100,000 vacant properties throughout the country.  Many of those can come into the rental property scene.  I think it is easy enough to get them into it, being quite honest.  However, we need to get a bigger picture and think outside the box.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.875" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#Q00600"><p>I thank everybody for their detailed responses.  Like the last round, I have a few comments and then two specific questions.</p><p>First, with the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme, I talk to many landlords who are selling.  They are more than happy to sell to local authorities at the asking price for a standard sale.  Their biggest complaints are that the process of purchase by local authorities is too slow and getting even an agreement in principle from the council takes much time.  It is also the case that, while the Minister reopened that scheme this year - which is welcome, because it was closed by the previous Minister &ndash; he has not given specific instructions to local authorities.  Various local authorities are applying it differently; some are more flexible than others.  Speeding up that process and having a consistency of approach would be helpful.  Landlords have had a long-term relationship with their tenants, and those who want to sell do not often want to evict.  If they can sell for a fair price to the tenant<i>in situ</i>with the local authority, that is a good outcome.</p><p>Senator Cummins asked a question earlier and I will answer it because I have information.  There have been a number of local authorities over July and August that have not been able to provide emergency accommodation.  It is not their fault; their emergency accommodation is full.  In August, for example, in Dublin city, on ten nights, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive had to turn away single people because there was not sufficient emergency accommodation.  During that month, 63 families from Dublin were placed in emergency accommodation in Kildare and Meath because there was none available in Dublin.  That then had a knock-on effect in those places.  In one instance in Kildare, a family from who presented as homeless were offered emergency accommodation in Roscommon.  Limerick was reported in the newspapers in July and August on quite a number of occasions as not having adequate emergency accommodation or hotel accommodation.  We do not know whether the fall-off of the tourist season will ease that pressure.  I do not think any of those local authorities would mind that being in the public domain.  Their problem is just that there is not sufficient supply.  That is worth noting, because Senator Cummins asked an important question.</p><p>On the NCT, this is one that landlords should support for the reasons Mr. Davitt outlined.  If landlords and tenants advocates could at least agree on a couple of things, that would not be a bad day&rsquo;s work.  If there were an NCT - I take Ms McCormick&rsquo;s point &ndash; if it was really light and done once every fifth year, year one and then year five, etc., if there was a &euro;100 charge, which averages out at &euro;25 cost for landlord per year, which gave them their certificate, that would do away with the need for any further inspections.  The idea that inspections happen after the tenants move in has always been ludicrous.  The value of that system is that it would protect good landlords.  We have to be honest.  We talk about problem tenants and that is fine - I live in the real world and know that is an issue - however, so are problem landlords.  Therefore, if somebody is a good, decent landlord meeting the rules, having that NCT on their <i>daft.ie</i>advert when renting the property, if they submit it to the local authority with the HAP application, if the tenant sees it, the good landlord and the good tenant are protected.  It is possible to design the type of NCT-style system that Threshold has supported.  In fact, the Oireachtas voted by a large majority for such a thing in 2018 in the context of a Private Members&rsquo; motion that I tabled.  It is eminently sensible.  The sooner it is done, the better.  Ms McCormick is right that it cannot be expensive.  However, I think it can be done in a way that would be very useful.</p><p>On rent, I will not argue with Mr. Davitt, particularly as there are different landlords out there.  T be clear, however, one of the reasons the Government decided to move on rent regulation is because for two years we were looking at double-digit rent increases and we had a dramatic spike in homeless presentations.  That is just a fact.  In fairness to Deputy Alan Kelly, he tried to get rent certainty linked to inflation at the time.  If that been accepted, we would all be in a much better place, because we would not have that two-tier rent regulation that the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, introduced.  That was a reality, as it is a reality that large numbers of landlords in rent pressure zones, with stable increased their rents, some by 4%, 8% or 12%, and some have gone up to the 22% over the five years.  Mr Davitt is right that others have not.  However, the point is that many have.  We do not know the full quantification of that because we do not have the data.</p><p>That needs to be said.<br/><br/>On the RTB and mortgage rights, that cuts both ways for landlords and tenants.  In cases where a landlord has illegally evicted someone or withheld a deposit, the tenant is equally as vulnerable to the level of bureaucracy.  That is not, in the main, the RTB's fault.  That is to do with the way in which the RTB's adjudication process works, with the legislation and with the position regarding staffing.  It is an issue that landlords and tenants could agree on.  Let us have a really efficient dispute resolution system and let us have it quickly.  I would go one step further than Ms McCormick.  RTB determination should be legally enforceable.  It is insane that a tenant who is wronged by a landlord has to go to court to have that upheld and <i>vice versa</i>.  That makes no sense.  However, if the party determined by the RTB to have been in the wrong wants to challenge it in the courts, let that party have its day in court, through whatever mechanism.  At some point we have to accept that administrative justice is more efficient.  In this case, the less we deal with the courts, the better.  It would be good if there was an agreement on those issues.<br/><br/>On HAP, I would say to Mr. Davitt that, in fairness, Threshold has been strong on this, and I will defend its honour.  It is ludicrous for a local authority to stop paying HAP because tenants stop paying their contribution to that local authority.  That is insane.  It is bad for the people represented by the witnesses.  It is also bad for tenants.  Ms McCormick is absolutely right that, in some instances, tenants have significant issues going on in their lives.  They may have a bereavement, mental ill health, or something else going on.  They are then at risk of homelessness, as well as the landlord losing the money for the rent.  As long as a HAP tenant is <i>in situ</i>in a rental property, the rent should be paid.  The sooner we can get that message to the Minister and the officials to get it changed, the better it will be for everybody.  We have a situation where HAP tenants who fall into arrears with their HAP contributions are not allowed to enter into a repayment agreement with the local authority, the HAP payment to members of the witnesses' organisations is stopped, and the tenants are evicted.  That is the height of insanity.<br/><br/>I know there are issues we do not agree on.  I wanted to refer to those issues because I think they are issues on which we can agree.  With the Chair's indulgence, I have two other quick questions</p></speech>

I thank that on board.  Let us imagine a world where all landlords did the right thing.  Even in that scenario, knowing the cohort of tenants that Threshold deals with regularly, does Mr. Duggan think that tenants moving into tenancies at the upper limit would be able to afford those rents?  That was the question I was asking.  If we say to landlords that they can reset the rents between two tenants, that means that if I get a notice to quit and I move out, I will have to pay &euro;2,200 for a two-bedroom property in Dublin.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Davitt.  Nobody has talked about the tax strategy review by the Department of Finance.  Does Mr. Davitt have views in that regard?  The Department set out its recommendations.  It does not support some of the key requests of the IPOA or IPAV.  Do they want to put on record their response to the tax strategy group report?  It argues that Government should not do the things that the witnesses are asking and I am interested in giving them an opportunity to respond.</p></speech>

That is incorrect.  If I have been nice to tenants of mine for years and charging them a certain amount of rent, when they leave and John comes to take the property off me, why should I give him the same privileges I have given others who have been good tenants of mine for years?  I prefer to propose that when tenants leave properties of their own volition and when landlords go to rent the properties out again, they should rent them at a market rate.  I do not think it is too much to ask.  If the tenant cannot afford to pay that market rent to the landlord who I am speaking about, the tenant will have to go to a new landlord, possibly with a new property, where the tenant will have to pay the rent anyway.</p></speech>

Mr. Davitt outlined a limited circumstance.

Tenants are not giving up tenancies, so where do those tenants go?  If they are being offered public, social housing or housing through an approved housing body and are being removed from the private sector, or if they get a mortgage, that would be different.  I do not necessarily think that the primary issue for all tenants is affordability.  It is just a matter of finding something that they can have.  Even if it is way outside their budget, they will figure out a way to pay it and so have their disposable income diminished.  That puts upward pressure on the market rent.  Where does it end, outside of a property crash?  We are just chasing market rent on a race to the top.</p></speech>

I was trying to work out how one would determine that.  I suppose it would involve a situation where a notice to quit has not been issued.  In such a circumstance, the landlord could then apply.  Some 117 affordable purchase homes were advertised today for Waterford city by Waterford City and County Council.  They are three and four-bed homes.  Many couples and families who will move into those homes are in the private rental sector.  Taking it in the round, one would have to imagine that some of them are probably paying below market rent because the landlord was caught out by a rent pressure zone being introduced.  They have probably been in a tenancy for seven or eight years.  To be clear, the point that Mr. Davitt is making is that in a circumstance where that couple is purchasing an affordable property, that landlord should be able to go to the market rent.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If someone from the RTB was here, they would probably be crying because you would have to make sure no notice was issued by the landlord.  Would the tenant have to lodge the notice of termination with the RTB?  The landlord would have to send a document to the RTB saying he or she is increasing the rent on certain grounds to make sure it is all kosher.  There is that practical element.  How on earth do you determine market rent in a rent pressure zone?  Under legislation, three comparable properties are supposed to be used, which is difficult.  How do you do it in a rent pressure zone where supposedly those properties have only been increased by the legally permitted amounts since 2016, though we know that is probably not the case?  This comes back to the fact that rent regulation should never be a long-term mechanism.</p> <p>  There is constant speak of landlords who kept their rents low and now are missing out and not making as much money.  The rhetoric seems to be they are not making as much money as the guy who brought a property two years ago.  They are not losing money or in debt, though some may be-----</p></speech>

While they may say "They'll just leave", it is hard not to hear that as "We have the power in this.  We'll threaten to leave if you don't let us make more money."  I am not trying to be callous in saying that but it is difficult to get to a good logical, rational reason for doing so.</p></speech>

Investors move into the sector to invest.  We have so much legislation around it and rent pressure zones.  We have a 2% cap on changes, while trades have gone up by 30% and general inflation is running at around 10%.  We are restricting one set of people for the benefit of another.  That set of people is in a situation where their investment does not stack up in terms of continuing to stay in the market.</p> <p>  There is a massive value to landlords being in the market.  Private rental landlords give accommodation all over the country, every type of accommodation from houses to rural property.  If we continually lambast and continually change it so they cannot manage their properties, they will leave the sector.  I need landlords in the sector.  We need landlords in the sector, but 14% of landlords would not recommend being a landlord to a friend, while 79% of tenants said their renting experience is positive.  There is a big disconnect about the whole situation.</p></speech>

That is important to bear in mind.  There is no robust data on it.  RTB figures issued recently showed a spike in the number of notices of termination issued and linked that to sale of property.  However, that comes after two years of eviction bans so is exactly what we would expect.  Generally speaking, the data suggest there has been a slow, moderate decline in the overall number of tenancies registered with the RTB going back to 2016.  There is a danger of a knee-jerk reaction to some kind of crisis exodus at the moment.  We do not know that is the case.</p> <p>  Second, there is a capital gains tax exemption for properties purchased between 2011 and 2014 and held for seven years.  We do not know how many landlords purchased properties in those years but we know there was an additional 60,000 or so in the overall number of tenancies registered with the RTB.  That means a substantial number of properties are moving into the period where they no longer benefit from the exemption, if they do not sell now.  A previous policy was introduced which was destined to create a cohort of landlords who needed to exit the sector in order to benefit.</p> <p>  We have heard there is an informal sector with many non-professional landlords playing a huge role.  That will lead to difficulties and problematic tenancies.  It is inevitable.  Hence we need regulation but we also hear there is a cohort of landlords who cannot cope with regulation.  That is an inherent contradiction in the nature of the rental sector that we have.</p></speech>

My equilibrium buzz is happy.  I will focus on the third theme in my question about why landlords are leaving the markets or, as has been asked, are they leaving the markets?  It is interesting that nearly everything we talked about points to the fact that housing is a connected infrastructure.  We talked about giving landlords access to the Cro&iacute; Conaithe funds for derelict properties, but if we did that it would push out owner-occupiers from having purchasing ability in that sector.  Equally, when a landlord sells a property, it could often be purchased by a first-time buyer.  We need the rental sector, but we also need the supply of sale for owner-occupiers.  It shows how interconnected the whole thing is.  That is why I disagree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on HAP tenants having access to cost rental.  I argued for it at the time and have been persuaded otherwise because HAP tenants have access to the social housing building programme, while non-HAP tenants do not.  We know far more social housing houses will be built than cost rental houses; therefore, it would be unfair on people who do not have access to the social housing building programme to have more restricted access to the cost-rental programme.  In the long term, I think the Deputy is right; in the short term, it is about balance.</p> <p>  I have talked about why landlords are leaving.  The IPOA has articulately put forward the concerns their members have.  I ask Mr. Davitt about when they come to him to say "That's it.  I'm finished."  I have noticed an increase in notices to quit.  In August and September in my clinics, it has been a factor.  Is that Mr. Davitt's experience in terms of people selling?  Second, we have talked about regulations and so on.  What is the profile of the person coming to Mr. Davitt who is selling?  Why are they leaving the market?  Of course, they are articulating the reasons that have been raised, but if they were changed, would people make different decisions and not leave the market or are they at the end of a life cycle?  Help us understand if there is an exodus from the market, if it is different from normal and why people are making that decision.</p></speech>

Many of those landlords are not issuing determination orders.  Tenants are leaving their properties.  Hence we came up with this proposal.

Landlords feel they are subsidising rent for those tenants and there is no reason that, if a tenant leaves a property, they cannot charge market rent.  It is ridiculous to see we cannot find out what market rent is.  Of course we can.  Any agent in the country can say what the market rent is in a particular area.  All they have to do is check what rentals have been made.</p></speech>

There are a certain amount of landlords that are moving out because of the fact that they cannot deal with the RTB.  This new portal that the RTB has is obviously a problem.  There are many problems in the marketplace and these give rise to the reasons for which landlords will sell.  The biggest one is that when tenants leave, landlords cannot charge market rent again.  They have been good to a tenant previously and now they are going back into another scenario of six years, at a minimum, and they have to accept the same rent again.</p></speech>

If we get into the same scenario, as some commentators are proposing at present, of a ten-year lease where the tenant would have the leasehold of the property, the person who holds the leasehold has different responsibilities.  If tenants are prepared to take that, it would certainly incentivise landlords into renting on a long-term basis, but what if we are looking at a landlord giving a tenancy for ten years and paying all the charges and every time the washing machine breaks down or whatever, still being still called on to do X, Y or Z?</p></speech>

If, similar to commercial leasing, where people who go beyond the five-year period take on a different type of tenancy but it is a tenancy that people have the right to renew, which would give security of tenure, Mr. Davitt is indicating that landlords would be willing to accept that responsibility.  Would the IPOA agree?</p></speech>

We felt that would have worked.  The biggest issue now is the legislation.  There is no confidence and stability in the market.  In a situation where the property is rented, there will always be a market of people who would be happy to give the property for a period, but at some stage they need to be able to get that back.  Given the rate at which the legislation is changing and the difficulties with the legislation, it makes it less desirable.</p> <p>  The properties have to be maintained to a certain standard.  They have to be looked after.  We need to ensure all of that for the property because the risk is all on the landlord.  The landlord is the one who borrows.  The landlord is the one who takes all of the risk all of the time.  The legislation has changed continually.  We currently have indefinite tenancies unless we are selling or we need it for a member of our family.  Such tenancies have been introduced.  The IPOA is not against regulation or legislation.  What we need is workable legislation.  The legislation that is in place now is not outcome-focused.  If one goes into a hearing, one technical point on something causes chaos.  It means that the tenant can remain in the property.  The system needs to be simplified.  It needs to be workable for both the tenant and landlord, and it needs to be enforceable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-20a.937" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092000002#T01800"><p>Interestingly, when the then Government introduced the long-term leasing scheme in 2010 whereby a property owner handed over his or her property, he or she was not a landlord and he or she did not have the costs and the charges, there was an expectation on the part of the Government - I worked in Focus Ireland at the time - that there would be a big uptake for all of those reasons.  The level of uptake was tiny.  In fairness, when the Minister of State, Deputy English, worked on the enhanced leasing scheme, there was an expectation in 2018 that there would be 2,000 leases a year.  Government undershot its targets by 50%.  It could only get 1,000 a year.  When one looks at the support to live independently scheme and the enhanced leasing scheme, the evidence is that even when a person is offered a ten, 15- or 20-year lease where he or she is a property owner, not a landlord, the willingness of property owners to engage in those schemes is limited.  I know there are other issues with them.  I am not convinced that would deliver the yield.</p></speech>

Such individuals continuously want the flexibility of the asset sale, but there are also the responsibilities of being a landlord.  There is a conflict there.  I appreciate it but, particularly, the points made on the RTB were not lost on me.  I would say that each of these organisations probably have leases on offices that they rent.  Some might be by way of a licence but they will accrue tenants' rights as businesses.  The attempts were to try and introduce certainty for residential tenants that was there for many years for business tenants.  That is where we want to get to.</p></speech>

At any time, the landlord can sell that freehold of the property based on the covenant that he or she has.  Landlords can still sell the property if they want.  Whether I am the landlord, Mr. McCourtney is the landlord or Mr. Coffey is the landlord makes no difference to the tenant because the tenant holds the leasehold on the property.</p></speech>

I have been a landlord for 27 years and I have seen major changes.  Initially, I would have rented to students and they would have moved on or whatever.  The failure of the building of social housing is the basis of this.  People are renting now who should never have been renting.  They should have got social housing.  Everything has changed and the system has not changed with it.</p></speech>
