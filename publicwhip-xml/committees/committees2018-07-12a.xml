Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering, MacSharry, Aylward and Cassells.  Are the minutes of the meetings of 28 June and 5 July and the private meeting on 10 July agreed?  We will not deal with matters arising because everything we could want to talk about-----</p></speech>

I asked for a detailed breakdown of the process and the timeframes and I would like to receive that as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The response I got was two lines.  I am hoping to get a little more from the Department and Minister so I have gone back to the Ceann Comhairle to say that questions have not been answered but, in any event, I hope we do not get the same here.  Have we followed it up?  Have we asked him-----</p></speech>

On the day the HSE's representatives were here we wrote to them with 29 specific items and we wrote to the Department of Health with seven additional items.</p></speech>

I will not dwell on it but I just want to know the current position with the post-project review in the context of Galway 2020.  Serious issues have arisen with regard to Galway 2020 and the use of public funds.  The use of those funds is quite right, but there is also the monitoring and governance of that.  I am just highlighting that it is something I will return to.  I raised it on the day in terms of learning and how they were going to approach-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B01700"><p>We will chase up on it.  My understanding is that in the correspondence relating to the report we published yesterday they indicated it could be 2019 before they have all the information in for 2018.</p></speech>

I was conscious of that going to the meeting yesterday.  The project started in 2006 but it will be 2019 before we can see its total cost.  I did not specifically refer to it but I picked that up yesterday in preparing for yesterday's launch.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B02200"><p>I will outline my concern about it.  We have been through it and there is no need to go into it.  There has been an investigation by the Charities Regulator as well.  What have they learned from it and how is that being implemented now with regard to the European Capital of Culture 2020?  The same headlines and issues are recurring in Galway.  I am proud and delighted we are getting the European Capital of Culture 2020 but my worry is about the same type of thing - let us not rock the boat and let us not question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B02300"><p>Galway is the European Capital of Culture 2020.  We all remember when it came to Limerick some years ago.  There was mayhem and people were resigning.  That is not to compare them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B02400"><p>I will try to avoid those words.  I might use them elsewhere but not at the committee.  However, there are certainly issues in that regard.  Somebody has already resigned.  I will not go into the details.  It is simply that I have concerns, given that I sit on this committee and I sat on the local council.  I see the same type of mantra being repeated.  That is the issue for us.  That is what happens and we end up looking at it retrospectively.  However, I know that the push is: "Do not say too much.  This is very important so do not question too much."  There was the same mantra with regard to the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema which led to it going up to over &euro;8 million instead of just over &euro;6 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B02500"><p>We need to write specifically to the Department arising from this discussion.  In our report we did not have any reference to learning lessons in view of 2020-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B02600"><p>I did raise it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B02700"><p>Yes, but not in respect of 2020.  We did not cover that aspect in our report so we will send a specific letter to the Department.  Again, if there is a reply we will send it directly to the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B02800"><p>Thank you.</p></speech>

There are three categories of correspondence and a number of items have been carried over from the last meeting.  Members will have to bear with me because there is an amount of correspondence.  We did not deal with quite as much on the last occasion and this is the last time we have an opportunity before we invite our witnesses in.</p> <p>  No. 1478A is from Mr. Conor O'Kelly, chief executive officer, CEO, of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, providing a briefing and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#B03000"><p>Chairman, part of that briefing note was on the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, which is fair enough as obviously some member of the committee gave it to the newspaper.  We cannot stop that.  However, I was concerned about the headline.  It has to be clarified for the public.  I am not saying the headline is misleading but it can be interpreted in a number of ways.  It comes from a briefing note for the Committee of Public Accounts so we have a responsibility to clarify it.  The headline is &quot;Cut-off for cancer payouts imposed&quot; and it continues that the Committee of Public Accounts is to grill the State Claims Agency on the growing scale of the crisis.  The article goes on to discuss the 40 cases which are before the courts.  Further down it refers to the separate payment, the expenses, being given to these women.  That was set up by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and covers approximately 2,500.  The Taoiseach commented yesterday that there will be a cut-off for those payments.  It is important for people to note that the cut-off in the headline is not referring to the court proceedings or any proceedings that might arise from court proceedings or the work of the State Claims Agency.  That distinction must be made because that could be inferred from the headline.  Given that it came from a committee briefing note - which it should not have but a member of the committee gave it to the reporter - that needs to be clarified.</p></speech>

As Chairman, every Wednesday I receive a telephone call to confirm what the committee will discuss in the Thursday meeting and various journalists are able to read for me verbatim from the information circulated to committee members, some of which I have not even had an opportunity to read at that stage.  There is a serial leaker in the committee, full stop.  I do not know who it is and I am not suggesting who it is, but there is one.  There has not yet been a week that a journalist did not telephone me to read out correspondence that had not yet come before the committee.  It is remarkable.  Yesterday, another committee launched reports and I asked the various chairmen how they dealt with their reports and draft reports.  They told me they had never had an issue with leaks in the other committees so it is germane to some members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am just making that general observation.</p></speech>

The committee had raised concerns about how the terms of reference were set for this review.  We dealt with this item in private on Tuesday and I just want to formally note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Some concerns remain and it is a matter we may return to in our next periodic report.  It was not just about who set the terms of reference to deal with the protected disclosure but arising from that an investigation was established and it was who set the terms of reference for that.  We will note and publish it.  We will return to the issue in the autumn.</p></speech>

I wish to formally note and publish it.</p><p> The following three items are updates requested by the committee on sale of Bord G&aacute;is.  Correspondence 1430 B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and provides information requested.  Correspondence No. 1443 B was held over from the last meeting.  It is from Mr. Michael Goodwin, energy security division, Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  It provides information requested by the committee on how it was intended to use the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is.  Correspondence No.1445 B is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It provides and notes information.  We will note and publish these items.  All three of these items are relevant to today's meeting with the National Treasury Management Agency because NewERA has a role relating to Bord G&aacute;is.  I have gone through that myself.  All those items are relevant to today's meeting and we can discuss them during the course of the meeting.  We will note and publish them.</p><p> Correspondence No. 1433 B was held over from the last meeting.  It is from the Honourable John D. Cooke, sole member, commission of investigation, enclosing the second interim report of the Cooke commission of investigation.  Members may wish to note that the timeframe for the commission's final report has been extended to 31 December 2018.  I suggest we note and publish it but not comment on the work of the sole member lest it be interpreted as in some way trying to influence or criticise.</p></speech>

Obviously, the progress of the work depends on the material provided and the format of that material.  This may be pertinent not only to this inquiry but to other inquiries in future.  Page five of the statement refers to where NAMA has believed it has been unable to access and verify the completeness of relevant documentation.  This could be pertinent to other inquiries.  NAMA has taken the view that it has not been able to provide voluntary co-operation because of data protection and other considerations.  This is relevant for statutory declarations to produce documents issued by the commission.  This adds to the workload of the commission and it will be the same for others.  This is something we need to consider if other commissions of investigation or tribunals are set up.  There may be something to reconcile here.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach raised this exact issue yesterday on the slides for CervicalCheck and the question of why the examination had not yet commenced by the college in the UK.  The college has raised the issue of data protection and consent from each person before the reviewers look at the slides.  It may be that several thousand are gone and the reviewers have to wait for consent from thousands of people before they can complete the process.  I simply do not know how long that will take.  It has added months.  I am being pragmatic about it.  Getting consent from thousands of people is going to add months to the process.</p></speech>

Data protection is in place for good reason.  However, when it works against the common good or has the potential to work against the common good we need to consider it.  If a process is not a public inquiry but rather a commission of investigation, we should question whether something needs to be looked at.  There is a delay and potentially a value-for-money issue.  Certainly, there is a process issue.  I think we should note it and see what we can do about it.  This should include a discussion with the Data Protection Commissioner on the process.</p></speech>

We are now aware that this issue has arisen.  These issues should have been addressed in the terms of reference.  Everyone knew this was coming.  Maybe people do not want to get around the existing legislative protection, but the issue should have been dealt with comprehensively one way or the other before the terms of reference were set.  Now that the terms of reference have been set, we can see the practical problems arising on how they will work.  This is an issue.  I think we will send this to the Taoiseach, as Head of Government.  The Department of the Taoiseach is normally where terms of reference emanate.  We should ask that the matter be considered.  I am not suggesting what he should do but we need to highlight it.</p></speech>

However, since witnesses have been before the committee in public session I want to go back to something.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission examined allegations of price fixing and the issues contained in the leaked copy of the minutes of the meeting attended by the chairperson of HIQA.</p> <p>  I had put to the head of Nursing Homes Ireland that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission said in the report that nothing happened.  The report did not say issues were not discussed.  In fact, the agreement signed by both parties states that all the stuff in the leaked minutes should not happen in future.  It did not state the matters were never discussed.  It simply said they should not happen in future.  That was the point I made to Nursing Homes Ireland.</p> <p>  The commission was unable to penalise or sanction Nursing Homes Ireland for something that did not happen.  We never said it happened because the CCPC received strong legal advice at all stages to the effect that it was crossing a line and had to stop.  That was my reading of it.</p> <p>  All I am saying is that when the head of Nursing Homes Ireland was before the committee I thought he was rather evasive in answering the questions, to be frank.  He has an entitlement to be, but he was simply not answering the questions put by a number of us.  He simply stonewalled us.  That was his right but he basically kept coming back to the report which vindicated that the issue never happened and that the word "boycott" was never used and so on.  He would not answer a question about that when it was put to him.  All I am saying is that the signed agreement by both parties essentially stated that all the issues of contention and concern to the committee in the memorandum should not happen in future.  That tells me some of those issues probably were discussed at the meeting.</p></speech>

The position taken of "nothing to see here" was actually not accurate.

Mr. Casey confirms that the financial close was achieved.  The letter is about the cost overruns as a result of the delay.  For the benefit of people watching, the preferred tender of the Grangegorman project was Eriugena Group.  The second ranked tenderer initiated court proceedings challenging the authority's decision to appoint Eriugena as the preferred tenderer.  The court case went on for some time and as a result of that, the matter is concluded.  Section 4 of the reply deals with impact and costs.  According to the CEO of the agency, that delay has added &euro;45 million to the cost of the project.  Work on the project has commenced but, according to Mr. Casey, final close of the project continues to represent value for money.  We need clarification on that point.  While a value for money exercise was done initially, we want to know if was it revisited as a result of the additional &euro;45 million cost.  That is the issue for this committee.  We want to examine that process.</p></speech>

The issue is whether this could have been resolved through mediation.  I am vaguely conscious of a situation arising between tenderers for one of the major projects on the M1 who negotiated a conclusion to work together on a the project.</p></speech>

We tested it with Enterprise Ireland, which found it a useful exercise.  The danger is that an organisation will concentrate on what it is good at and not see the gaps in the structure.  The report is to provide some sort of a benchmark in that regard.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is proposing to use it in carrying out a review of a number of education and training boards and financial management capacity therein.  We are setting out the standards that we will look to see demonstrated in ETBs but it will be some time next year before that happens.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1456 is from Mr. Martin O'Brien, chief executive, Louth and Meath Education and Training Board, dated 3 July 2018 in response to concerns raised by the committee regarding invoice redirection fraud.  Mr. O'Brien informs the committee that a Garda investigation is ongoing and states that he expects to recover a significant part of the amount while its insurance should cover the remainder.  We will note and publish that and ask for a detailed report at the end of September.  We wish to be kept updated on that issue.</p><p> Correspondence No. 1463 is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, in response to a committee request for further details in relation to evictions from local authority and Approved Housing Body, AHB, dwellings, which we will note and publish.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1465 is from Ms Brenda McVeigh, secretary to the Commissioner, Tax Appeals Commission, dated 29 June 2018, providing follow up information requested by the committee at our meeting on 28 June 2018.  To get a response in 24 hours must be a record.  The information includes a supplementary briefing note for the committee that outlines the commission&rsquo;s request for resources and concerns it raised about the lack of resources in the period June 2017 to date and also an aged analysis of legacy appeals.  We will note and publish this.  It is clear from the response that the number of appeals going to the Tax Appeals Commission has gone from 174 in 2011 up to 400 in 2014 and 493 in 2015 and then 469.  There has been a very significant rate of increase.  It seems that those who provided the resources for this body did not anticipate that its very establishment would increase the number of appeals.  It looks as though that was not taken into account.</p></speech>

Different views were expressed at the meeting and we wrote to the Minister.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1466 from Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive officer, National Treatment Purchase Fund, providing follow up information requested by the committee regarding expenditure and giving a breakdown of expenditure in particular categories.  Ophthalmology was &euro;10 million, orthopaedics was &euro;8 million, general surgery was &euro;2 million, cardiac was &euro;3 million, ear, nose and throat was &euro;3 million and smaller items in relation to urology, gynaecology, dental and non-cosmetic plastic surgery was &euro;100,000, to total of almost &euro;30 million in that area.  We note and publish this.  People will be interested in the breakdown of that funding.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1467 from Mr. Ray Mitchell, Health Service Executive, provides information to a the numbers of parliamentary questions dealt with by the Department of Health and HSE, which we noted and publish.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1468 from Ms Vivienne Flood, public affairs, RT&Eacute;, enclosing a summary report requested by the committee from Eversheds Sutherland on the use of freelancers-contractors at RT&Eacute;.

I think that is the second report.  We had robust exchanges with the Accounting Officer and the director of human resources when they were before the committee but they seem to have taken the issue seriously.  We have reports and recommendations which they say they accept and hopefully that will lead to changes.</p> <p>  The National Union of Journalists, NUJ, has called for the sectoral committee, namely, the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to look at its wider implications because it is not just prevalent in RT&Eacute; but is rampant across several sectors.  That would not be an issue for the Committee of Public Accounts because it relates to private organisations.  We have looked at it and have produced our own periodic report.  Could we send that report to the committee, referencing the Eversheds report?  It will be up to the committee, but it might be an issue that it could explore.</p></speech>

Only &euro;3.4 million was outstanding at the end of 2017.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1473 is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 5 July 2018 outlining the process involved in the review of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and also providing a copy of the review.  That review is too large to get into today.  We will consider the issue of how the State is dealing with protected disclosure.  The report is there.  I have looked at it.  It is lovely in that if one reads it, one would almost think it was working well.  I felt the report was missing testimonials from people who made protected disclosures.  They seemed to have consulted with stakeholders but there is an absence of testimonials from the people who made the disclosures.</p> <p>  We will return to this issue in the autumn.  We asked for one specific issue in our correspondence, namely, a list of people who made submissions.  Chapter 5 of the review deals with the submissions.  It gives an overview, the thematic issues raised and a consideration of those points.  However, our first question was about who made submissions.  That would normally be published.  When someone makes a submission to a public body, the advertisement will say that the submission will be put on the website.  I am shocked that we have not been given the names of that.  We requested it at the previous meeting when protected disclosures arose.  We had a letter telling us that this was under way.  We were shocked to know it was under way as we did not seem to know about it.  They say that Oireachtas Members were notified on the matter by email on 25 August 2017, and that there were advertisements in the newspaper in August 2017 and that the closing date for submission was 10 October.  The submissions might be on their website.  </p> <p>  Apart from discussion on this, I propose that we invite Transparency International Ireland, which sent us a report on this, before the committee, primarily because the Department's review relies heavily on Transparency International Ireland's own report.  The Department's report includes several charts illustrating the finance of the survey which are reproduced with the permission of Transparency International Ireland.  Since its report has had a significant input into that of the Department, it is important that we hear from it.  We will have to organise the sequencing of the witnesses.  It looks as though Transparency International Ireland got closer to the bone of the issue than the Department.  Is it agreed that we include it?  It would be in the autumn work programme.</p></speech>

I see controversial planning applications being submitted on the August bank holiday weekend and other stuff tied to the recess.  It is not unfair for us to point out that the timing on these things is very important.  Where the timing will exclude rather than include, the consultation process becomes less meaningful.  That does not just relate to this thing, but timing is important for genuine consultation.</p></speech>

They say that they compiled the list of relevant stakeholders and contacted them directly by email about the review, including all Departments, prescribed bodies, local authorities and Oireachtas Members who were contacted on 25 August 2017.  They knew well when they were doing that, smack bang in the middle of August.  Somebody rushed this off before their holidays and said they would have responses when they came back.  If they are not coming back, all the better.  We have seen that in every walk of life in the public service.  Maybe it happens in the private sector too.</p><p>The next item is correspondence from Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute; dated 9 July 2018 about RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s appearance before the committee and inaccuracies concerning RT&Eacute;2+1.  I think we have made the point about the obligation on public bodies appearing before the committee to provide clear and accurate information, and speak with candour.  I will not read the entire letter.  It states:</p><blockquote>We very much welcome the supportive remarks that you made in terms of our plans on this issue on the day, and I am happy to confirm that as of 25 June 2018, consistent with the intentions set out in our 5-Year strategy, we submitted our formal application to the DCCAE for RT&Eacute;2+1 and an extension of the hours for RT&Eacute; One+1 as required under ... the Broadcasting Act.  Like you, we hope that the approval of our request will be forthcoming...</blockquote> <p>Therefore, it is done.  We all look forward to watching that by the time the next World Cup comes around because it did not have the matches on RT&Eacute;2+1 on this occasion.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1476 from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 10 July 2018, provides a note on the reasons some accounts are exempt from the general requirement to present their financial statement for audit by the end of March.  We note and publish that.  We will deal with that when we are looking at a review of submission on public accounts in the autumn, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1477 from Mr. Niall Burgess, Secretary General of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, dated 9 July 2018, provides follow-up on a number of matters raised during its appearance before the committee.  We note and publish that.</p><p>We come to correspondence in category C related to individuals and any other private organisations.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1342, 1355 (i) to (vi), and 1362 regarding wards of courts funds were held over from the last meeting.  We agreed at our meeting on 28 June to request a recently published report on this matter from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  That committee has made a number of supportive recommendations.  I propose that we write to the committee to keep us updated on the matter and for it to follow through on the recommendations.  I propose we write to the individual to say that the Committee of Public Accounts cannot take up the matter separately given that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has produced a detailed report on the matter.  Extensive documentation was supplied to that committee in preparing its very comprehensive report.  Obviously, it would not be appropriate due to Oireachtas time to duplicate the work it has already done.  We fully support that committee in its work.  As the sectoral committee, it is best placed to deal with this matter at the moment.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1350, which was held over, was received from an individual regarding a submission to the committee on the management of protected disclosures.  The committee discussed this matter in private session and has agreed to meet the individual to inform itself of matters that can be brought to the attention of the Irish Prison Service.  The secretariat will make the necessary arrangements for a meeting following the recess.  We note the correspondence for now.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1386, which was held over, is an anonymous letter requesting the committee to make inquiries with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection from an individual who has made a protected disclosure over alleged wrongdoing in St. Munchin's community centre, Kileely, County Limerick.  We discussed this in private on Tuesday and agree to write to the Department for a response.  We now formally note this.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1429, which was held over, was received from Deputy Catherine Murphy, dated 26 June 2018, regarding the examination of the spending by EirGrid on a controversial wind-hub substation in County Laois.  This matter is outside the remit of the committee.  Does the Deputy wish to speak on it?</p></speech>

Some of it may come up in the context of this morning's discussion on green bonds.  We all know we need to change over and there are costs in terms of potential fines for polluting where carbon is emitted.  At the same time we need to ensure we get value for money for the clean energy that will replace it.  I am not sure whether it should be done by this committee or the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We should not just gloss over it.  There is the potential for a large amount of money being spent and then us doing a review after the fact rather than looking at it based on where we are at the moment.</p></speech>

It is a counterargument to the general thinking that it is all efficient and is reducing our CO2 emissions.  The report contains useful information on the substation in County Laois.  The ESB and EirGrid are not audited by this committed.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General sent me a note on that which we will circulate.  They are not audited by us and so are not under our remit.  They are subject to appear before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  That committee considered this matter previously and decided not to take up the issue because it felt it was substantially a planning issue relating to the particular site.</p> <p>  However, I wrote to the Sustainability Energy Authority of Ireland asking if it had a role in it.  It replied that it had none.  That is in private correspondence to me.  I propose that we formally write to the CRU, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in Ireland, which was formerly the Commission for Energy Regulation, with that report asking for a detailed observation on the report and its views on any role or function it has regarding that electricity substation in County Laois.  As the regulator, the CRU may have a role as it approves funding for capital projects, how much of those capital costs can be passed on to the customer and the financing of it.  It has to give regulatory approval.</p><p>The regulator is our best option in this particular case, so we will do that and come back to the matter.  It is mainly to the regulator we are writing, but we will also circulate the previous note prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office regarding EirGrid and the ESB.  It will be of benefit to the committee.  We will come back to this.</p></speech>

That is going to the Commission for Energy Regulation, including the report it attached to that email to us.</p> <p>  Nos. 1440C and 1441C were held over from the previous meeting.  They relate to HSE circulars not circulated or implemented and HSE employees who did not make the criteria in the first round of the regularisation process of the Haddington Road agreement.  We noted both of these items last week.  Shall we agree to advise the correspondent accordingly and send her a copy of the transcript?  We discussed this matter in detail at our previous meeting.  We will send a transcript and if the correspondent wants to follow up the matter, she can do so.</p> <p>  No. 1442C was also over from last week and relates to the lack of emergency cardiac services at University Hospital Waterford.  We had a discussion on the matter last week and we will send a copy of the transcript to the person involved.</p> <p>  No. 1444C was held over from the previous meeting and relates to children's programming on RT&Eacute;.  This is a copy of an email sent to RT&Eacute;.  There is no specific request for the committee to deal with the matter.  Besides, it does not fall not within the remit of the committee.  I propose that we forward this to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment in order to allow it to take whatever action it proposes as part of its work programme.</p> <p>  No. 1447C was held over from the previous meeting and concerns a previous decision on a request for the committee to investigate the transfer of corporate governance responsibilities arising from the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  The matter does not fall within the remit of the committee because the changes referred to were the result of a policy decision and the implementation of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  The previous correspondent was advised accordingly.  This current correspondence also asks the question, "Where did the funds held by the Association of Municipal Authorities go when it was dissolved?"  In order to be helpful, the clerk has followed up this and it is understood that the funds mentioned, approximately &euro;875,000, were transferred to the Association of Irish Local Government in 2014.  The Association of Irish Local Government has provided a note to the clerk and I propose that we forward it to the individual.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1455C, held over from Deputy Marc MacSharry, regarding the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  We had a discussion on this in private session at our meeting last Tuesday and we decided that we will write to the Department of Finance and the State Claims Agency regarding the status of a possible discontinuance of a High Court case regarding the matter.  The issue of the High Court case prevented the committee from examining certain issues relating to IBRC when we met with its representatives last year, and we wish to ascertain whether these obstacles have been dealt with.  We note this, but I again stress that the Committee of Public Accounts is in no way involved with any party in requesting any discontinuance of any court proceeding.</p> <p>  The next item, comprising No. 1461C(i) and (ii), is from Ms Moyagh Murdock, chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and concerns issues raised regarding the business case for the public services card or any assessments that were undertaken for the project.  Shall we note and publish the item?  The RSA has requested that we not publish the business case because it contains sensitive commercial information, so we will publish the reply but not the business case.  We can revisit this.</p></speech>

The matter might not have been specific to this organisation, so we will try to get the fuller picture on it in the autumn.</p> <p>  No. 1470C is from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, acting Secretary General at the Department of Justice and Equality, and is dated 6 July 2018.  We thank her for her work.  She appeared before the committee as acting Secretary General and acting Accounting Officer.  A new Secretary General has been appointed.  We will not get into that controversial issue now.  The matter was raised in the Chamber yesterday, I think.  The correspondence concerns a report on the provision and operation of GoSafe for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will note and publish this item of correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 1475C is from the Provost of Trinity College, Patrick Prendergast, dated 9 July 2018, providing further information on a cyberfraud relating to Trinity Foundation.  I want to deal with this.  As part of the financial statements we received, there was a reference to a loss to the foundation of &euro;974,781.</p><p>I refer to the circumstances that gave rise to this incident.  There was another occurrence of cyber-fraud in the Louth-Meath area.  I think something happened in Meath County Council a few years ago.  </p></speech>

That is an issue the Committee of Public Accounts certainly needs to come back to, because this is fraud targeting public expenditure, and represents a loss to the taxpayer.  Cyberfraud and the associated public losses are another item for the work programme.</p> <p>  I refer to the circumstances that gave rise to this incident.  I will not read all of the letter, but it states that in early 2017 unauthorised access by a third party to the email account of an employee of Trinity Foundation resulted in the authorisation of fraudulent payments to individuals unconnected to the Trinity College Dublin or Trinity Foundation.  The letter goes on to say that the original amount defrauded was &euro;217,000, which has since been recovered; that the remainder is subject to ongoing investigation inside and outside the State; and that the university is also pursuing the matter with its insurance providers.  Moreover, at this stage, the loss, including the cost of investigation and other ancillary costs, amounts to &euro;974,781.</p> <p>  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  It states that Trinity College has now essentially transferred the processing of payments function from the Trinity Foundation to the university's financial services division.  We will write to Trinity College seeking an update on this matter in the autumn.  We will need an update.  This issue and the resultant loss to the public is now starting to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The loss in this instance was to the Trinity Foundation.  </p></speech>

Even before this problem arose, this was accepted by Trinity.  The university was fully consolidating the foundation in its financial statements.  Usually in a situation where a foundation is operating, it receives moneys for specific purposes.  It must deliver on those purposes because it has taken the money.  The foundation had an obligation to protect that money until such time as it could be applied for the purposes.  Therefore, the university has been obliged to find the funding from elsewhere in its resources to meet that loss.</p></speech>

Irrespective of whether the foundation is consolidated, the same risk potentially applies to other universities.  There is not much point in deriving some learning from this if we do not share it subsequently.  Does the Higher Education Authority, HEA, assume that function?  Who assumes the function of putting systems in place that are less likely to be attacked in the way this one was?  The subject of this attack was one person, according to this letter.  It was not a range of people.  It seems as though there is a control issue here.  I do not know how we should address this matter.  Perhaps it should be done by a sectoral committee or by writing to the HEA.  How do we deal with this issue?  Obviously, if one college has had an incident of this profile, others will have had the same.</p></speech>

In the case of the university, I think the first set of lessons that have to be learned are within the institution as to what specific control weaknesses could have occurred that created an opportunity for this.  There is also an important systemic learning.  For instance, supplier fraud is something that we have come across, and we have attempted to alert others.  We have written to public sector organisations telling them to be aware that this is a risk, outlining what it looks like and the things they need to do in order to mitigate any such risk.</p> <p>  One of the things that was happening was that public sector organisations were being contacted using what looked like official headed notepaper.  The message purported to be from a service provider which was changing its bank account.  It gave the details of a new bank account and payments were processed without an additional check being done.  That is how a fraud has occurred in a number of situations.</p></speech>

Very often they are outside the jurisdiction.  Moneys can be caught.  In several situations, banks have noted large transfers, perhaps transfers of round sums that look a little bit out of pattern.

That deals with the correspondence.</p> <p>  Statements and accounts received since the last meeting are being put on the screen now.  We will move through this quickly.  The first item is the National University of Ireland Maynooth audit opinion.  Deferred pensions is referred to and non-compliance with procurement.  We will come back to the non-compliance with procurement issue in the autumn.</p> <p>  We then have the accounts from the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and its administration account, and accounts in respect of  the national debt of Ireland, the Post Office Savings Banks, the State Claims Agency, Dormant Accounts Fund, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, National Pensions Reserve Fund, all of which come under the NTMA, whose representatives are before us today.</p></speech>

We want to have meetings set up for the autumn.  We are back on 20 September.  I think the D&aacute;il comes back on 18 September.  On 20 September, the first day back, we have agreed already that we will have NAMA representatives before the committee.  It is more than 20 months since they were here so they are long overdue a visit.</p> <p>  In terms of the following, we agreed last week that Ms Flannelly, the former clinical director of CervicalCheck, was not able to make the meeting last week.  She has indicated she will come in at a suitable time.  I think that because of her key role we should take up that offer and I suggest we have the meeting on that day.  We will be dealing with CervicalCheck, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the State Claims Agency, and we will probably have further information after the summer.  Essentially, that will be at the end of September but all of that is to be confirmed.</p> <p>  In terms of the following week, 4 October, we did not bring in representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, last year.  I suggest we deal with that Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report will be out at that stage so we will deal with whatever chapter is in that report dealing with DPER.  Two special reports were published yesterday.  We will deal with all the DPER issues as best we can.</p></speech>

If there is anything to finalise in the 2016 material, well and good.  We will be on the 2017 Appropriation Accounts principally and those other items.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 11 October, I suggest it is worth inviting in representatives of the Office of Public Works, which is a very interesting Department.  They have not been before the committee in quite a while.  That allows the secretariat to set up those meetings over the summer and ensures we do not come back without any meetings arranged.</p> <p>  We have many issues to go on the work programme.  We mentioned cyber crime and procurement.  Public private partnerships, PPPs, are on our work schedule for the autumn, as well as some of the education matters.</p></speech>

The chapter relates to the accounts of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  We will also deal with the NTMA's financial statements for 2017, which have been published recently.  We are joined today by Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Kelly, chief executive officer at the NTMA, Mr. Ian Black, chief financial and operating officer at the NTMA, and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director at the State Claims Agency.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions put to them by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.

As members are aware, the NTMA is a complex organisation with multiple functions that extend beyond its original and core role in managing Ireland&rsquo;s national debt.  The structure of the NTMA, following a reorganisation in 2014, is outlined in the written submission.  The sets of financial statements before the committee this morning reflect the various statutory obligations that the NTMA has in respect of its financial reporting.</p> <p>  The NTMA&rsquo;s primary function is to manage borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the national debt account.  At the end of 2017, the gross national debt stood at just under &euro;199 billion, marginally lower than the debt at the end of 2016.  Total debt servicing costs in 2017 amounted to &euro;6.2 billion.  This was 9% less than in the previous year, reflecting the impact of refinancing of debt at prevailing low interest rates.</p> <p>  Other important functions and services of the NTMA include: management of compensation claims on behalf of certain State authorities, in its capacity as the State Claims Agency; the management of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF; and the provision of procurement and financial advice in respect of certain public private partnerships and other large capital projects in its capacity as the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.</p> <p>  In mid-2017, &euro;3.45 billion was realised from the sale of almost 29% of the shares in AIB held by the ISIF.  The proceeds from the sale were transferred from the fund to the Exchequer in the year.  The value of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholding in AIB at end 2017 was estimated at &euro;10.5 billion.</p> <p>  The NTMA assigns staff and provides certain other support services, on a reimbursement basis, to two independent bodies - the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  These are governed by separate boards, and the NTMA is not accountable for their activities.  The NTMA also provides staff on secondment for the Department of Finance&rsquo;s banking unit, with the costs in that case being carried by the NTMA.  The NTMA&rsquo;s administration account shows gross expenditure on administration costs totalled &euro;116.4 million in 2017, with 80% of the expenditure in respect of staff costs.</p> <p>  The audit report on the account draws attention to expenditure of &euro;6.2 million in 2017 relating to contracts that were not publicly advertised.  The NTMA&rsquo;s statement on internal control provides explanations for the procurement approach adopted in relation to those contracts.  The audit report also draws attention to non-effective expenditure of &euro;853,000 relating to the planned development of a treasury management IT system.  The project was terminated by the NTMA in 2017 without completion of the planned system.</p> <p>  Section 12 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 requires me to report annually to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with respect to the correctness of the sums brought to account by the NTMA.  This is in addition to the audit certificates that in produce on each set of financial statements.  Chapter 23 before the committee today is the report in respect of 2016 and it highlights key developments in the year.</p><p>A similar report is being prepared for 2017 and will form part of the report on the accounts for the public services in 2017.</p></speech>

I understand.  </p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation.  With me are Mr. Ian Black, our chief operating officer and chief financial officer, and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen who the committee has got to know probably more than any of us had hoped as director of the State Claims Agency.  I was not planning on reading my opening statement.  I have supplied slides for reference.  Their purpose is to illustrate some of the themes which inform our strategy and policy on the marketplace.</p> <p>  I will touch on a number of the businesses, starting with the primary original business, as the Comptroller and Auditor General described it, of managing the national debt.  A theme at which we are looking is how late it is in the investment cycle and the changing interest rate cycle and environment.  We see this in a number of ways, although the most obvious is the announcement of the withdrawal and ending of the quantitative easing programme and what that might do.  The interest rate environment has been supportive and tranquil and had no surprises.  That is the environment in which we have been for seven or eight years.  It is supportive in that central banks have been buying bonds for quantitative easing in the European Central Bank's case; tranquil in that "lower for longer" has been the mantra for central banks with regard to interest rates; while "no surprises" means that the forward guidance central banks have given us on interest rates has been quite specific.  It is our view that all three of these pillars of policy to which we have got used in the past seven or eight years are likely to change.  As we will have the withdrawal of quantitative easing, it will not be as supportive, while rates will not be lower for longer.  The Federal Reserve System has already raised rates seven times in its changing interest rate cycle and it is likely that the ECB will start to change its approach to interest rates, even though it has issued statements stating it will continue to keep rates low well into 2019.  However, the environment is likely to change.  That means that we will have to be careful and cautious heading into the future, particularly since Ireland is still very indebted, as we regularly point out in our bulletins and discussions with investors.  Investors remain concerned about Ireland's very high levels of debt.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio has traditionally been the metric used and it has moved in a more favourable direction, but investors are less interested in that metric these days because of the obvious difficulties we have had in Ireland with GDP as to whether it is an accurate measure of our ability to repay our debts.  Investors look more at interest as a percentage of Government revenue and at total debt as a percentage of Government revenue.  Ireland does not fare quite as well on these metrics as we do on others.  We are still quite high up the league tables.  I provided a chart to demonstrate this.</p> <p>  There are concerns about the indebtedness of the country, despite the interest rate environment.  The interest rate environment has meant that our interest bill, as the Comptroller and Auditor General says in his report on our accounts, was &euro;6.2 billion in 2017, down from &euro;7.5 billion at its highest.  We think it is on its way towards &euro;5 billion, notwithstanding the fact that the interest rate environment will change.  The reason we have a high degree of confidence that the interest bill will continue to fall, despite the changing interest rate environment, is we have pre-emptively locked in interest rates by building up a significant amount of cash, repaying the International Monetary Fund and taking a number of other actions in buying back higher coupon bonds and locking in today's lower rates.  We have been able to buy insurance for taxpayers because of this pre-emptive action to lock the interest bill into today's interest rate environment before it begins to turn.  We can be confident that that will occur because between now and 2020 we will have a lot of debt maturing, much of which is high coupon debt.  The averages of the maturing coupons are between 4.5% and 5.9% which we are replacing at today's rates or the rates in the past 12 to 18 months.  That differential is being locked in.  What happened this morning is a good example.  As committee members have been sitting here, an auction has been taking place in the market in which Ireland has issued &euro;1.25 billion, a ten-year note at a yield of approximately 0.81% to 0.82%, or just below 1%, and a 30-year bond at a rate closer to 1.6%.  We are locking in that differential as these coupons mature.  That means that we will produce some savings in the near term.  That is what one would expect the National Treasury Management Agency to be doing in this environment and what quantitative easing is all about.  It allows more indebted countries to make interest rate savings.  We have been able to do this to some degree to buy some insurance, but it does not mean that the environment will not change.</p> <p>  A good example might be what recently happened with Italy, which is a reminder of how quickly things can change and spreads can move.  The Italian ten-year spread moved by 100 basis points, or 1%, over a three month period, as there began to be uncertainty about Italy's future policies and concerns about instability of the Government there.  If Ireland's credit spread was 100 basis points wider, since we have issued &euro;50 billion since the beginning of 2015, having borrowed &euro;50 billion in the marketplace-----</p></speech>

It is a fund of &euro;8.9 billion.  It has what we call a dual or double bottom line mandate.  It is charged with investing in Ireland only and its investments must produce a commercial return and a beneficial economic impact for the country.  That is what we describe as a double bottom line.  The fund has invested &euro;3.8 billion across the economy since its inception at the beginning of 2015, across all sectors and regions.</p><p>Just under 50% is invested outside of Dublin.  The returns so far on the fund have been reasonable.  The annual return to date is 2.3%.  The return last year, the year in question, was 4.3%.  If we take the 2.3% annually, that has added &euro;648 million to the size of the fund just because of the investment return.  It has been a positive environment for the fund in that regard and it has been possible to add to the size of the fund through those returns.</p><p> One of the positive surprises for us in respect of the fund was the attraction of private capital.  It was always envisaged that the ISIF would be a minority investor and would look to attract private capital to invest alongside it, or that it would invest alongside private capital.  We thought originally that maybe for every &euro;1 million the ISIF invested, it would attract &euro;1 million from the private sector; that was the metric we were using in the initial studies.  It has turned out that the multiple of investment and crowding in of private investment has been higher than that and is running at 1.7 times.  This means the &euro;3.8 billion of investment by the ISIF has resulted in &euro;10.4 billion being invested in the Irish economy when we include the attraction of private capital.  That is a very significant sum and a good bit higher than we originally envisaged.</p><p> The ISIF has a global portfolio.  The &euro;8.9 billion sits there and the bit that is not yet invested in the Irish economy is invested in the stock market and some conservative investments to wait for it to be drawn down, as it were, as the commitments come near.  That portfolio sits in a variety of market vehicles that are reasonably conservative.  It is managed actively by the team also.</p><p> In deference to Deputy Catherine Connolly, this time last year we had a discussion about responsible investing and I think it is fair to say that after that discussion we accelerated changes to our policy on responsible investing.  Legislatively, we were only excluded from purchasing munitions stocks in the original legislation.  We have expanded that policy to include the banning of tobacco stocks and have recently also included a list of the dirtier fossil fuel companies.  Almost 16 stocks are now excluded from the portfolio.  In accordance with what is really current best practice globally, we are still potentially investing in some older fuel companies provided they are making a transition to renewable and provided they have a proven decarbonisation strategy.  They still attract investment from funds like ours.  Those that are not are increasingly being excluded by the market and we have taken some steps to do that.</p></speech>

At that stage I raised the issue of investment in tobacco and issued a strong press release asking the NTMA to divest itself of its investments in that area.  I commenced working on a Private Members' Bill that autumn, which was introduced in the D&aacute;il, namely, the Ethical Public Investment (Tobacco) Bill 2017, a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit the investment of public moneys directly or indirectly in equities or debt securities issued by tobacco companies.  Around that time - maybe it was a pure coincidence although I like to think it was more than that - the Minister announced that he was going to introduce similar provisions.  I was very pleased to see that result.  It was an issue that got well aired when the NTMA was before the Committee of Public Accounts in 2016 and within six months it had divested itself of the tobacco investments.</p></speech>

It would not be for us to lead in being the ethical or moral guardians of the portfolio but there should be a mirroring.  That is appropriate and I acknowledge that we have indeed taken that path.</p></speech>

Obviously the fossil fuels Bill is going through the Houses as we speak and we have been working closely with the various committees on that.</p> <p>  To touch on the National Development Finance Agency, it is involved in direct procurement, public private partnerships, PPPs, and advising Departments in terms of financial value for money.  The PPP that people are probably most conscious of at the moment is what we call "schools bundle 5", which has been affected by the Carillion collapse.  That has been an extraordinary story for the UK with huge implications for jobs and a vast number of projects right across different sectors.  Thankfully, in Ireland Carillion was only involved in one PPP in addition to a number of other smaller projects.  The collapse did indeed cause very significant difficulties and complications for that PPP project.  Ultimately, a number of the schools are likely to be completed, three of them hopefully by this school term, which was in doubt at various stages.  Hopefully that looks likely to happen, which is a positive.  The other schools will be delayed but works will start in the next couple of quarters.</p> <p>  As to what happened, what it means and what the lessons are, I think probably there are two things to take away.  The first concerns the bundling of different projects to make a scale project suitable for a PPP.  In PPPs generally, private capital wants a scale project.  For example, we have bundled 14 primary care centres in a group, and we have also put a group of courthouses together to attract capital.  Smaller projects will not attract that kind of capital, so we have bundled some.  However, unbundling in the event of a failure of one of the counterparties proved to be very difficult.  It has been managed, maybe just in time, but I think we will have to look at contracts involving bundled projects to ensure we have a better mechanism to separate them in the event of one of the counterparties failing.</p> <p>  The second consequence is potentially higher pricing in PPPs and procurement in general.  There are still inquiries and lot of new reports coming out of the UK which we are watching closely.  However, from the surface analysis, it seems that Carillion was serially underpricing contracts and the margin was too tight, which ultimately got it into trouble.  There may be a recalibration in public procurement contracts of the price versus the strength of the counterparty and its ability to get the project done at the end of the day.  I suspect that stronger counterparties and stronger balance sheets will prevail and will have an advantage.  That may or may not be right.  Ultimately, they will charge a price for their counterparty strength, which could mean prices rising in both direct and PPPs.  That already seems to be happening in the UK.</p> <p>  The UK seems to have a specific exposure in aggregate to Carillion as a counterparty and that appears to be a big issue over there.  I am wondering if Ireland has such an aggregated counterparty list.  Should we have one?  Are there companies to which the sovereign has a total counterparty risk - companies that are doing projects here, there and everywhere?  Is there an aggregate list showing the top ten counterparties with which the sovereign currently has contracts?  Should there be a limit on the State's exposure to any one counterparty rather than another?  I think that is proven in retrospect in the UK, which would probably say it was too exposed, as a state, to one single counterparty.  That is something we might take a look at and take forward proactively.</p><p>The other business that the NTMA is in charge of is NewERA, which is a corporate finance advisory business to commercial semi-State companies, and it produces its annual report which is about governance and shareholder value and having all of the State's shareholding in one place with the same metrics, governance structures, reporting and key performance indications, KPIs.  I suppose a measure of confidence in the work that NewERA is doing is that it is getting a lot of additions to its portfolio and being asked to provide additional advice for various Departments.  Recently all of the transport assets of the State were added to NewERA's portfolio as designated bodies and An Post has also been added.  I can see NewERA developing as essentially a custodian - a single place where all of the State's assets and exposures are held in one place, analysed and subject to governance on behalf of the various Departments.  That seems to be growing.</p><p> The Committee of Public Accounts is all too familiar with the business of the SCA.  I am sure members will have questions for Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen on the update.  It is a big business now.  It manages claims for 150 different agencies, and is dealing currently with 10,000 claims, 80% of which are non-clinical.  The total contingent liability is substantial, somewhere between &euro;2.5 billion and &euro;3 billion.  It is a significant business.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are asking the agency, through the mandate it has given to us to walk that delicate line between watching out for taxpayer's money and being sensitive to the difficult and tragic circumstances that victims often find themselves in.  It is a difficult balance and the staff of the agency walk it every day.  It is a difficult mandate for somebody.</p><p> That covers my statement and I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

We had understood that the contingent liability was &euro;2.6 billion, but the figure today is &euro;2.7 billion and Mr. O'Kelly stated that it is between &euro;2.5 billion and &euro;3 billion while there have been 40 claims to date in respect of cervical screening process.

The mediation broke up on a Sunday but during that week negotiations continued.  Our aim is to ensure that all these cases, in so far as we can do them, go to mediation.

The parties contributed to the settlement and the defendant parties, that is, the State and the laboratory, have decided is that they will take to one side the issues between them as to how liability is apportioned.  The reason for that is not to involve the plaintiff in that kind of dispute between the two parties.  That is working quite well.  The laboratories have been co-operative and we have a system in place whereby we are mediating these cases and are arriving at settlements.  It is functioning well as matters stand.</p></speech>

Recently, when we were looking at a particular hospital, we discovered that there may be a problem in a particular unit with a particular practitioner.  What we did was a very in-depth analysis of our expert reports on the claims and we looked at other incidents.  What we do then is we have an active engagement with the hospital.  In the particular case, the hospital will carry out its own independent investigation when we provide it with information that would appear to indicate there is a very definite cluster associated with the particular practitioner.</p></speech>

Carillion did not engage in building work but essentially contracted out the work.  The opening statement refers to the transfer of risk, which is the purpose of public private partnerships.  According to the agency, PPPs have been very effective and the risk has been transferred to the private sector.  There have been many casualties in the case of Carillion, including the loss of 200 jobs and the impact on small suppliers and subcontractors.  The risk has been transferred but, by and large, it has been carried by domestic suppliers and contractors and the fallout has been significant.  School projects have been delayed.  I am acutely aware of a project in my constituency where other accommodation had to be hired on an interim basis.  There is a knock-on effect on the provision of subjects on the syllabus because of the lack of laboratory or other facilities.  The cost is, therefore, much greater than only the financial cost.</p> <p>  There was a red flag over Carillion to begin with.  Does the NTMA take into account such warnings when projects are being considered?  I understand the need for economies of scale but that would be of value irrespective of whether it the project was undertaken by a public private partnership.</p></speech>

In our commentary we talk about PPPs and risk transfer.  It is quite an academic point about the cost.  I appreciate that the cost is very significant.  The collapse of Carillion is a travesty and a very significant event and the knock-on effects for Sammon and others have been very difficult.  Sammon went into examinership and ultimately liquidation and there are lots of consequences of that.  The Department of Education and Skills was procuring directly with Sammon in lots of different ways so the collapse of Carillion has caused very significant damage.  I am not underestimating that in any sense.  I am just saying the financial structure of the PPP has meant that the schools were built by Carillion and Sammon.  They were paid and the equity providers into that vehicle have lost 90% of the value of the money and the State has not yet paid any monthly payments.  We do not pay until the school opens.</p></speech>

In that particular element - the schools that are built to date - here is no financial obligation on the State for the schools that are built to date, and that risk has been borne, appropriately, because that is what the PPP is supposed to have done.  Some of the questions in the past have been about risk transfer and whether a PPP really transfers risk and if the State is not on the hook anyway and how the State always has to pay for everything at the end of the day.  This demonstrates for that particular piece that that is not the case.  The risk has been borne by the PPP funders and the risk has not transferred back to the State.  It has been owned by funders.  They have lost the money and they are currently under value or under water on their equity and that is the way PPPs are set up.  That does not mean we do not have to solve these other problems about the schools opening, but one would have to do that whether the construction was direct or indirect.</p></speech>

The red flag that was connected with Carillion and the health of the company prior to the contract being awarded is a significant issue.  People rely on the State to carry out due diligence.  Smaller companies further down the food chain are not in a position to do the kind of forensic examination one would expect the State to do and it would be very unfair to expect them to do it.  Does Mr. O'Kelly accept there have been failures in way in which this project has been handled?</p></speech>

Companies go out of business and they succeed and they fail and that happens in the construction business which is a particularly volatile business.  It does not matter how one is building; nobody can predict the future and nobody has a crystal ball.  The question is whether one has a mechanism set up which, in the event of something like that happening, allows one to get around it and have enough flexibility.  When the contract was originally put out Carillion was a very robust publicly quoted company which had the confidence of shareholders and investors all over the world.  In our counterparty analysis, it looked like a fine company at that point.  By the way, it was a fine company at that point.  In designing the contract with what is a good counterparty at that point, we build into the mechanism that, in the event of one of the parties failing, which happened in the case of Carillion, the other members of PPPCo can take over the running of the PPPCo and then start to instruct and make sure the schools get built.  What we are concerned about is the schools being built.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Kelly spoke earlier about the very tight margins Carillion was working to, which probably created exposure.  These were also picked up down the food chain, if one likes, in terms of the domestic fallout.</p> <p>  I will move on to another aspect of the accounts on non-effective expenditure, which relates to the IT system.  A total of &euro;853,000 was involved.  It was for an IT system that was not delivered.  What was the nature of the project?  Could Mr. O'Kelly could give us some details on it?  Was any of it used?  Was there any retrieval on it?  Was a proper business case done before it was considered?</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Black to respond in a moment.  In the case of the NTMA, a treasury management system is a very significant and critical bit of infrastructure.  The system we have in place works extremely well and has worked well for many years.  We were looking at upgrading it and adopting a new system because of the changes in technology, for the most part, and in terms of interaction with the market.  We specced out very carefully and we appointed the company.  I am not sure if we can mention the name but we might get to that.  Our difficulty was that what it promised to deliver and what we needed it to deliver did not transpire and, ultimately, despite lots of negotiations along the way where it was promising to do so, nothing happened.  The company was a very well-known public company.</p></speech>

Our decision to terminate the project was based on a lack of confidence in the performance of the vendor and, indeed, evidence that it had four project managers on the project but was failing to perform.</p></speech>

He has asked us, officially and formally, to focus on these areas.  Both he and the Department were aware that we were already moving the strategy in that direction towards areas where capital did not flow as freely and which were part of the original strategy.</p></speech>

We engaged heavily with the company until July, at which point the project was supposed to pass through to the next stage, the design phase, but it did not do so.  It remained "red" - if we could call it that - for that period of time and a decision was taken based on a review not to proceed with that vendor.</p></speech>

The supply dynamic is skewed and we need more supply and we need it urgently.  People can build houses and apartments to sell or they can build them specifically for the rental market.  More people than has been previously been the case want to rent.  This is the demographic shift across the world, including in Ireland.  Ireland traditionally has not built residential units specifically for the rental market, which is one of the reasons rents are rising and there is tension in the market.</p></speech>

We started on the fifth floor.  Each floor is roughly 20,000 sq. ft at &euro;50 per square foot excluding service charges.  It is roughly &euro;1 million per floor.  Again all of the leases have different end dates.  We took a decision whether to stay or go.  Had we stayed, the landlord indicated that over the next period of time there was a likelihood that that building would be refurbished and as they do up one floor, the staff would be constantly moving over a two-year period.  That was not very attractive from that point of view.  We also then looked at other buildings and felt this one on both financial and non-financial grounds made sense.  It was a decision that went to the agency board and was approved by the board.</p></speech>

That rainy day fund was meant to ensure that if there was an economic downturn of if there was any economic turbulence we would have some money to invest or even to tap into to be able to pay for day-to-day spending if there was a shortfall, but certainly it was more of an investment.  That did not happen.  It did rain.  The economy crashed and the money went to recapitalise the banks.</p></speech>

It is accepted by almost all the economists, think tanks, expert groups and even the European Commission that there is a serious lack of capital investment in this State.  There are huge challenges in social infrastructure, health and housing, as well as in transport in respect of roads, rail and ports.  There are huge challenges in investment generally.  Even though the economy is recovering we are still not keeping up with capital spend even compared with European Union averages and yet we have to make up for lost time where a huge capital spend was stopped because of the crash.  Why is it wise to take &euro;1.5 billion out of what is an investment fund to put into a rainy day fund at a time when there is an absolute need to invest?  Is that essentially a Government decision and if so, what opinion if any was sought by the NTMA in respect of the wisdom of doing that?  Would the NTMA have had any input?

One of the key questions of that review process was about what amount of money would be needed to be in the fund to execute and deliver successfully on the mandate of the double bottom line for an economy like Ireland.  It was agreed that the &euro;8.9 billion which sat in the fund had an excess which would not be needed in order for the fund to still continue its mandate.  In that regard, those reserves were identified by the ISIF and the NTMA in our first submission to the Government, namely, that there would be significant excess, maybe several billions of euro, which could be used for other purposes.</p></speech>

I am not asking Mr. O'Kelly to account for what the Government does.  It can account for itself.  What message are we sending out, however, that we have money in a fund that can be used for investment in areas where it is needed?  What message are we sending out by taking that money out of that investment fund and putting it into a rainy day fund which may or may not be used in the future?  We must bear in mind we had a similar type of fund before that was used for different purposes.  Where is the wisdom in doing that when there is a need for investment now?</p></speech>

An economy like Ireland's can probably only take a certain amount of investment at any given time.  It is quite a small economy.  The commitment of &euro;3.8 billion has been matched by private capital, making a total of &euro;10.5 billion invested so far through the ISIF mechanism over the past three years.  That is a lot of money and projects for this economy.  Whether the pipeline or the capacity would be there for the entire &euro;8.9 billion is very questionable.  We identified and believed that there were excess reserves which could be used for other purposes.  I suppose it is a matter for the Government as to what those other purposes might be.</p></speech>

That does not really tally with where the majority of the experts are at.  Economists and think tanks are saying there is a dire need for increased capital investment across the economy.  The NTMA, on the other hand, is saying that while that might be the case, it cannot be done too quickly.  Essentially the NTMA is saying we are spending enough at the moment and we do not need to spend any more in some of these areas because we should not spend too much too quickly.  That does not really sit with what the experts are saying.</p></speech>

Government capital expenditure in general is a separate business.

However, Mr. O'Kelly is saying there is a surplus of money which the NTMA may not be able to spend because there are not enough projects.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of it, I am not saying the NTMA is wrong.  The factual position is that we have X amount of money to spend and we will spend as much as we can.  It is dependent, however, on having pipeline projects in place which can enable the NTMA to spend the money within a period.  As it cannot spend the overall figure, there is a surplus which will now be used for something else.  Is that what Mr. Conor O'Kelly is telling me?</p></speech>

The Deputy may recall that.  I was asked if there was a contribution by the HSE.  I said a contribution was made by the State Claims Agency, on behalf of the HSE, of &euro;25,000.  The reason we made that contribution in that particular case was that we were told by the laboratory involved that it was going to go to an additional day of court hearings if we did not make some contribution to that case.  We did not want Vicky Phelan to have to spend another day in court.  We then decided to make a contribution of &euro;25,000.</p></speech>

What about the rest of the women in question who have not been compensated yet, given we do not have class actions in this State?</p><p>Is it the case that each of these women will have no choice but to take a court case to be compensated financially for what is now an acceptance of liability?  If the HSE has accepted liability in these three cases for non-disclosure, logic dictates that it will have to accept liability in all other instances in which there was non-disclosure.  There are 40 cases, of which 35 are active before the courts.  It may be that there will be an acceptance of liability in all 35 and an associated monetary contribution and a cost to the State.  What will happen then to all of the others who have not yet taken a court case?</p></speech>

There are 35 active court cases and I imagine the principle will hold in all 35.  There may be nuances, differences and complexities associated with each because of issues such as length of time, which is fine.  That will determine the level of compensation to be paid.  However, the principle of liability and compensation has been established in three cases, while there are 35 active cases.  Is it fair to say the same principle will apply to the 35 cases and that, most likely, there will be monetary compensation associated with accepted liability on the part of the HSE?  Is that, at least, a fair assessment?</p></speech>

If one fails to disclose something, as a matter of law one has to concede liability that there was a failure.  By the way, that is a concession we make on behalf of the HSE having regard to our delegated function.  I will make one point about why women have to go to court, as opposed to being dragged into it, the phrase the media sometimes use.  There are very good reasons a lawyer acting on behalf of any of the cervical cancer women would want to commence pleadings in court.  Sometimes there are child dependents who, in some cases, may ultimately need to be made wards of court or in respect of whom the courts may have to ensure they will be looked after by way of certain orders.  There is another factor, that the lawyers must protect themselves against the Statute of Limitations.  An additional factor is that serving pleadings allows someone to set out their case in the best way possible for the defendant to meet.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding whether they take cases, there is an established and accepted failure.  Rather than wait for them to go through the courts which they are entitled to do and separate from the fact that they can take the laboratory to court, there is an established acceptance of failure on the part of the HSE and the State and it can now compensate the women concerned.</p></speech>

It would be a much better and simpler approach to take each case as it came and then to aggregate the compensation in order that a woman would receive full and final compensation.  When she has been through that process, she knows that she has dealt with all of the defendants.</p></speech>

My line of questioning was to ask if the only option available to the women concerned was to take court cases.  Everything Mr. Breen said in that regard indicated that the answer was yes, that was the only option.  The redress scheme is completely different.  My understanding of redress is that one looks at all of the other issues surrounding expenses and the provision of supports.  I am not sure whether one looks at liability for non-disclosure.  While one could and we can argue that one should, it would equally be unfair to put it out that it will be looked at.  Perhaps, Mr. Breen might answer that question because it was the logic behind my series of questions.</p></speech>

Most countries which use PPP go with the medium, or in-between.  There is not so much focus put on the lowest tender.  We have now seen the consequences of focus being put on the lowest tender.  I know it is a policy decision.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, was given a statutory mandate under the 2007 amendment.  Will Mr. O'Kelly talk us through that?  Is it down to the Department of Finance or is it through the legislation that more weight is given to the lowest tender?</p></speech>

There are seven different categories normally, and pricing tends to get approximately 40% of most tenders.</p><p>One of the factors that looks like it will come out of the UK analysis and the reports that have been done to date since Carillion is the question of whether price is given too great a weighting and whether it is possible to win a tender just by putting in the lowest price, with the other criteria being given insufficient weighting.  I am speculating that there may have to be a recalibration of weighting and that is something we will have to monitor.</p></speech>

I understand that previously, he was clear in acknowledging that there were potentially other cases.  However, from what has been highlighted here this morning, I understand there may be further deficiencies in our testing system and there may be issues with where the colposcopy tests are going.  I do not believe we were aware of this before now.</p> <p>There is drip-feeding of information.  Here we are, on another Thursday afternoon, learning of possible further difficulties for women, which further erodes confidence in the system.  I am not blaming the witnesses but we have been in this process for months.  Each time someone comes in, there is another wallop to the system and damage to the testing process and screening system will mean that people will die in the future. </p> <p>  On the standard payment for non-disclosure, it seems obvious that women who have been affected should be afforded a payment as soon as they apply.  There should be a very simple process in order that they do not have to go through the indignity of a complex process when their health is in a precarious state.  What is the view of the witnesses on this?  Would it not be easier to give a standard payment to those affected?  As someone might be wasting &euro;1 million on an IT system that does not work, surely it would not be too difficult to give &euro;25,000 to women who have been affected by this.  From the perspective of sums, would it not be easier to just write the cheque?</p></speech>

It seems obvious that might be easier for them.  It seems we have created another problem this morning with the drip feed of information.</p> <p>  I return to the opening statement.  It refers to the divestment of all global exposures and the focus on a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable economy with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  While I am all for that, are we not at risk of putting all our eggs in one basket again?  If we are divesting all into Ireland and if something extraordinary happened, are we not, yet again, exposing the people of Ireland to another crash?  It focuses on the low-carbon and green agenda - which I am all for - but it needs new technologies.  If the NTMA cannot get the IT system right, maybe it will not get this right.  It seems irresponsible to put all of the eggs in one basket so soon.  Would the witnesses agree with that or not?  Perhaps Mr. O'Kelly could answer that.</p></speech>

As someone who is not an expert, it seems obvious to me that we might be exposing the Irish people yet again if something goes wrong.</p> <p>  On investment in private companies for the delivery of housing, whether social or private, it is clear to a non-expert that there are strong yields in the rental market.  Does the NTMA's remit have any element of social conscience?  The purpose of investing is to make money.  I acknowledge that interest rates are very low and therefore putting money in bank accounts does not result in good returns.  Is it not morally wrong that State funds are put into a private company where the return is based on the acceleration of rents?  Would Mr. O'Kelly agree that this is contradictory?

One is a follow-up to that of Deputy O'Brien, whose questioning was very revealing.  Deputy O'Connell and I are on the health committee and the Committee of Public Accounts and we have gone through this intricately for months.  I have probably attended eight to ten committee meetings on the subject.  I have probably been at every committee meeting, between everything, yet it is a drip-feed.  I am seriously worried, now that the Houses of the Oireachtas are about to go into recess, that the greatest form of transparency emerging in this actually transpires in these rooms.  The Houses are to be closed for the next couple of months.</p> <p>  With regard to what Deputy O'Brien teased out, I do not want to wrong Mr. Breen; he did give figures before.  Maybe we could have gone further in the way we teased it out so I do not want to wrong Mr. Breen.  I must ask him, however, on having taken down his figures, whether he can break down the categories of claims of the 12, four and one, or 17 cases, in other words.  We know we have 221 cases and that there are 17 in the "others" category.  It would be revealing, informative and educational to know what types of cases the 17 cases are.</p><p>We know of one because in fairness, Deputy O'Brien has raised it on a number of occasions.  What are they?  I am meeting the Minister for Health later on today and I would like to know whether these 17 cases are part of the Scally review.  I doubt he even knows.  I am sure some of his people are watching this.  I would like to be able to ask.  Is there any way Mr. Breen can break that down for us today?  If not, I would be surprised because I think he should be able to do so.  </p><p> If one teases it out, this case is pre-Vicky Phelan.  If Vicky Phelan had not come out and blown the lid off all of this, what would have happened?  Are there issues here relating to non-disclosure preceding Vicky Phelan that we do not know about?  Why were we not aware of cases like this?  Are there issues relating to the laboratories that are involved in these 17 cases that are outside the 221 cases that we need to know about?  </p><p> The third question is a catchall.  Mr. Breen has been before us a number of times.  On occasion, through our own fault, we might not have probed things to the level they should have been probed.  I think we often do but perhaps we do not.  I say this with the greatest will in the world and am putting this out there because of what the Chairman said.  Is there anything Mr. Breen needs to tell us or members of the public who are watching about this issue; is there anything we need to know?  There are three parts to the first question.  I have two more questions.  </p></speech>

I have been contacted by the solicitor of a family of one of the women who, unfortunately, passed away and who was one of the group of 221 women.  I am sorry to have to read this off my phone but I did not get a chance to print it out because I came in here straightaway.  They submitted an FOI request to the NTMA, which was really to the State Claims Agency, for the immediate release of all documents of any nature held by the State Claims Agency, its servants and agents regarding the late Ms X - obviously, I will not say the name.  The request was refused.  I might remind Mr. Breen what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il regarding non-co-operation and I hope there are civil servants watching this who will relay it back to the Taoiseach wherever he is in Ireland or the world.  How in the name of God when the family of one of the women who, unfortunately, passed away because of this scandal, looks for all their information from a State agency, which is handling the claims, can that agency say it will not give over the information it has on that woman but still say it is co-operating fully with all family requests and all requests for information?</p><p>I am shocked by this.  That is why I raised concerns earlier regarding getting transparency when the D&aacute;il and the committees are closed down for the summer.  It is beyond my comprehension how the head of freedom of information in the NTMA, through the State Claims Agency, can turn down this request for documents from the family of a woman who is deceased as a result of this scandal.</p><p> Mr. Breen and his colleagues may hide behind FOI legislation, etc.  That is find but I imagine that, somewhere along the line, a person went up the line - through the NTMA and all the way to the Department - and said that the organisation had a moral duty to supply this information.  I am sure Mr. Breen will tell me he did that.  I am sure he will not tell me that he hid behind the fact that, possibly, under a technicality relating to the provisions of the FOI legislation, the agency does not have to give out the information.</p><p> That would run counter to everything the Taoiseach told Mr. Breen and everyone else involved to do.  It would also run counter to the fact that we have the State Claims Agency saying that all cases will be mediated and dealt with as quickly as possible and in the best way the organisation can manage.  I take Mr. Breen at his word on that.  To be fair, when he is before the committee, he provides good information, although sometimes we have to ask the questions.  In any event, not giving out this information runs counter to all of that.  It runs counter to the morality of the situation in the sense that these people are entitled to it.  The entire country is watching.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have said that all this information should be provided and that there will be a serious problem for anyone who does not co-operate.  Why has this family not been given this information to which it is entitled?</p></speech>

Mr. Breen can take a break because it is not a question for him.  It relates to ISIF.  I want to get this question on the record.  ISIF and what it is used for are important.  Some investments relate to various energy projects and a range of other potential investments.  When it comes to investments and working with State bodies, does the NTMA believe that such bodies actually put forward projects in which the agency could and should invest?  I understand and appreciate that the terms of reference of the agency are defined.  Indeed, I acknowledge it.  Perhaps they are a little too rigid but the agency has to work within its position.  I have no issue with that.  In any event, are projects ever put forward in respect of which the NTMA takes the view that it would be good to invest in them but where the State bodies involved effectively do not co-operate or put forward the projects in a way that would make it possible for ISIF to invest?  Have there ever been such cases?  I am not asking Mr. O'Kelly to outline the cases.  Has there ever been a situation whereby projects have been put forward by State bodies but where ISIF was not in a position to invest purely because the bodies involved have not put forward those projects in way that is accessible in the context of how ISIF invests?</p></speech>

State bodies can sometimes move slowly and perhaps not see opportunities as clearly or as commercially as may be necessary to meet our criteria.  If, however, we believe there is an opportunity or the bones of something, then we would generally work carefully with the appropriate state authority.  In Kilkenny, we are working with Kilkenny County Council.  We are working in Cork with the Port of Cork.  We are working with Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  I do not believe there is anything systemic in that regard.</p></speech>

I omitted something in the work programme.  On the first day back on 20 September, we will deal with NAMA.  That is agreed.  On 27 September, we will hear from the former clinical director of CervicalCheck, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly.  Obviously, members might be back for an update on 27 September.  Dr. Flannelly has indicated her willingness to attend.  We could not make the meeting last week so we will do it on our return.  On 4 October, we will hear from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Office of Public Works is down for the meeting on 11 October .  We gave a commitment earlier in our correspondence with regard to a protected disclosure from a person in the Irish Prison Service.  We discussed this matter in private session.  It was agreed to meet the individual who has made the protected disclosure so that the committee could inform itself of matters.  We can then deal directly with the Irish Prison Service.  The secretariat will make the necessary arrangements with the individual concerned to meet us - probably in private session if that is the wish of the individual.  I am proposing-----</p></speech>

There was a Supreme Court case in 2017.  The court ruled, with regard to the 1%, that claims for future loss should be calculated at a real rate of return of 1.5%.  This results in a higher net percentage value being placed on projected future cashflows.  There has been an increase as a consequence of that.  Is that a real cash increase?  Does it have an immediate impact?  How does it play out into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-12a.851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018071200002#KK05200"><p>There is a real increase.  I will let Mr. Breen take the question.  It is a fundamental question about the rate of return that is assumed and used with regard to lump sum payments, in particular, and to calculate what that lump sum should be, one has to have an implied future rate of return that could be earned on what is called a risk free or low risk rate.  That rate has been set higher and therefore any lump sum payment would be made higher.  Even in retrospect, as I know Mr. Breen will refer to, there were many cases which were settled with potential adjustment to any future change in the rate of return.</p></speech>

It had immediate effect.  When that case was decided, pending the case going to the Court of Appeal, we agreed with families that we would pay them the difference between the old rate of 3% and the 1% and 1.5% in the event that the Court of Appeal decided that was the appropriate rate.</p><p>In 2017, therefore, we paid out &euro;25 million in what we refer to as "catch-up payments".  That was the difference between what we settled at, 3%, and the new rate of 1% and 1.5%.</p></speech>

A reason has been given, but we had been expecting &euro;400 million of the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is to be placed in an off-balance sheet entity and applied to housing.  However, that did not happen.  We were told that it did not prove possible to devise a model which would be capable of utilising the &euro;400 million on an off-balance sheet basis.  I understand it probably had to be used in that way.  It was a very small amount, given the amount realised.  It was almost a political sweetener to indicate that some money would be used in that way.  Why was it not possible to make that off-balance sheet arrangement, given that we have tier 3 housing associations?  There are mechanisms which do not directly involve local authority housing whereby guarantor arrangements could have been made, for example.  Why did it not prove possible to do this?</p></speech>

There is a loan of &euro;450 million.  Initially, it was &euro;300 million and then &euro;150 million.  The only income Irish Water has apart from commercial water charges is from the Exchequer.

Following on from the Oireachtas committee on the future of water policy, the Government decided that the commercial loans would be refinanced through Exchequer debt.  The ISIF is one element of it and there is a further &euro;800 million in commercial loans, on which work is ongoing.  Within the coming six to nine months we are working on refinancing it through State debt for which the NTMA will provide.  Irish Water will then be borrowing from State sources, rather than from commercial lenders and the ISIF.</p></speech>

Its volumes of clinical claims and claims generally are so much higher that it is not a perfect comparator.  On the non-clinical side, the level of damages in the United Kingdom is lower than here.  The personal injuries commission is looking at this issue as a result of the work of the working group on the cost of insurance.  Non-clinical claims for whiplash are being looked at, for example, because damages in the United Kingdom are so much lower than here.</p></speech>

For example, I had a meeting yesterday with a reinsurer who told me that he had seen &pound;30 million paid out on a catastrophic injuries claim in the United Kingdon, while in another case the figure was &pound;35 million.

We have asked our actuaries, for the purposes of our strategy committee in the agency, to carry out the kind of examination for which the Deputy has just asked, to look at the cost of claims here relative to the cost in the United Kingdom in both clinical and non-clinical cases.  Certainly, the value is lower here for clinical claims than in the United Kingdom.  The rate of claims is proportionate both here and there.</p></speech>

Separately, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection just last year completed a projection of what State pension costs will be into the future.  The figures certainly are very concerning.  When it presents the Social Insurance Fund accounts for 2017, it will be referencing that and the document will be available to the committee for examination.</p></speech>

The NTMA said it would issue so-called green bonds.  I believe Poland and Belgium have done so.  How does that work?  Is it separate money and a separate process?  Does it require a policy initiative or can the NTMA itself initiate it?</p></speech>

Essentially, it is fungible with the other debt so it is segregated.  Investors will invest in so-called green bonds, provided the money is being used for sustainable investment processes.  It could be new electric trains, water upgrading systems or any environmentally friendly projects the Government has on its books, and the Government has many.  Once the projects are earmarked and it is decided the money will be spent and is ring-fenced for that purpose, a different pool of capital can be accessed, which is quite good news for us.  Whatever money we then raise is used to finance those programmes.  They get reported on every year.  Investors will look for an independent report every year to see that money is being spent on that basis so it has been very successful.  It is a growing pool of capital and, for Ireland diversifying, from a selfish NTMA point of view in terms of debt, getting access to new pools of capital is very attractive.  It also provides a dedicated pool for investment in green projects that has to be fulfilled.</p></speech>

The representatives from the Department stated it had not made any decision or proposals on the matter.  We asked then what were the EU rules in respect of this because the Government's general position is that any money recovered from financial assets goes towards the reduction of debt.  That is the general position on the sale of bank shares, for example.  Some people in the Department of Finance indicate that the surplus might be used to reduce the national debt.</p></speech>

The next question we asked is whether the use of the NAMA surplus would require EU clearance because it would have to be done within EUROSTAT rules and we were told that no discussions had taken place with Europe yet.  We asked what Europe's position was expected to be.  The Department said that there is no other NAMA or anything like it in Europe so it does not believe Europe has even addressed the issue yet.  I suppose the bottom line is that discussion has yet to take place.  I am giving the Deputy the benefit of information obtained at a previous meeting.</p></speech>

However, in order to be of assistance, in terms of the purchase of buildings, people must remember that, under EU fiscal rules, this would impact on one's expenditure benchmark so it does have a very sizeable impact if one is looking at one-off expenditure in terms of how much is available for ongoing current day-to-day expenditure.  That may have informed that policy decision in terms of purchasing.  In terms of the NTMA premises, that would be a decision for it.</p></speech>

I use the word "few" lightly.</p> <p>  I will start with the national debt.  I have the report in front of me.  I will ask Mr. McCarthy to confirm some information that is out there and we can comment on it.  I want to give the people who are watching a full and clear picture.  They get bits and pieces from different questions but I like to give the overall view.</p> <p>  The gross national debt at the end of 2017 was &euro;198.7 billion, almost &euro;200 billion.  That is on page 7 of the accounts.  I thank Mr. O'Kelly for the extra briefing information supplied.  Essentially, we have one big problem when one looks at the chart on page 12 of the accounts where it is indicated that the percentage of our debt to GNP is quite low, at 68%, which is moving towards the EU fiscal rules target of 60%.  However, everybody knows - and we have discussed it with the Department of Finance - that this is not a real measure of what happens in Ireland at all because it is totally distorted by the presence of multinationals.  It is not really income to the country.  We have moved on to gross national income, GNI, and now we have GNI*, which Mr. O'Kelly referenced.  The gross Government debt to GNI* ratio is probably a far better indication in reality.  Mr. McCarthy mentions that in the document and he shows that chart.  From that perspective, there is still a worryingly high level of debt.</p><p>Even allowing for the fact that the agency uses GNI* as a measure, although it is helpful to use both such measures, the national debt is still at a very worrying level.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

I note the cash balances the agency is holding seem to have declined in recent years.  In 2012, there was &euro;50 billion in cash balances.  All the figures are not given on that page, but I note from the chart the cash balances now held are only half of that amount.  It would probably cost the agency to hold cash reserves but it would give a little more flexibility.  Why have the agency's cash reserves declined in recent years?</p></speech>

They are two different things.  If we have a question mark over our access to the markets and are not able to fund such moneys, we would need to have very high cash buffers because we would need to be able to fund the State.  Given Ireland's improving credit rating, we are now talking about the price of the credit we can access.  There is not an issue about Ireland's capabilities of accessing the markets.  Thankfully, that is behind us.  The question now is about the price.  When we decide what cash buffers to have, we make an implied view on interest rates also and whether this is a good time to lock in those rates, and that determines it.  We have some very big maturities coming up.</p></speech>

That is the headline.  I want a breakdown of that.  The firm is doing a good job for the agency.  The witnesses appear before this committee every year and every time they do or they talk or give a press conference, they give the a good impression of the agency to most people in terms of how much it is has refinanced and that the interest it has on new loans it is taking out, that is replacing old debt, is less than 1%.  If people were to listen to the agency, they would assume it had most of this under control, but it transpires this morning that Mr. O'Kelly said that in the past three and a half years the agency has only replaced &euro;50 billion, which is 25% of the debt, a quarter of it.  If only &euro;50 billion was replaced during those years, that amounts to &euro;15 billion per annum, which is only about 7% of the agency's total debt.  The agency does a good deal of selling information on how much it is replacing the old debt, but when we examine what the agency does and break it down, that accounts for only 7% of the agency's debt in any one year, on average.  We only hear about 7% of its debt.  The witnesses never tell us about the other 93% of it.  They sell a good story.  If one were to believe the information they put out, one would think we nearly had all the financing of our debt down at 1% or 2% at this stage.  That is the only story we hear from them, but it transpires it is only 7% of the debt that benefits from such announcements.  Does Mr. O'Kelly get my point?</p></speech>

We do not sell anything.  We tell the story; we do not sell the story, with all due respect.  Also, in refinancing debt, we have to refinance it as it comes due, as it matures.  None of the debt that Ireland has is callable.</p></speech>

A figure of &euro;526 million for residential housing is referred to on page 17 of the financial statement.  The statement says that at the end of 2017 the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund had committed &euro;526 million to residential housing investments in response to the national housing crisis.  Can Mr. O'Kelly tell the committee how many houses were built by the fund at the end of 2017?  I note all the commitments and so on but how many houses were actually built with the &euro;526 million?  How many actual houses can be counted, that is, there are 50 there or 300 there?  At 31 December 2017, how many houses were built from that &euro;526 million?</p></speech>

Will Mr. O'Kelly try to get us the figure for the end of December 2017 to which that &euro;526 million relates?  We hear the big figure and for &euro;526 million, we have 1,000 houses so far, and I know there are a lot to come.  We are here to talk about delivery but has not happened in spite of the amount of money provided.  Perhaps Mr. O'Kelly could give the committee an estimate for how many houses it expects to complete this year, next year and the following year from that &euro;526 million.  This is a reasonable question.  People are now talking about delivery.</p> <p>  I will go through the annual report systematically.  In regard to the global portfolio managers, was there a change of those managers during 2017 and what criteria are there for rolling over the contracts?  What are the procurement arrangements?  Do they get the contract for a two year or three year period?  Talk to me about the general nature of the contract for companies such as Goldman Sachs Asset Management, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi Asset Management, Blackrock Investment Management, Deutsche Asset Management and so on?  What is the typical arrangement the NTMA has with these companies and how does it procure the services?</p></speech>

We have the panel system and then we tender as we need them.  We monitor their performance.  No fund manager has been removed or changed in 2017, but sometimes we may add or subtract to the number of fund managers and between different managers, depending on the performance of the manager and on the strategy that may be pursued at the time.</p></speech>

There must be some managers who are not as good as others.  What does the NTMA do about dropping those?  Why would one use the bottom third performers if one knew there were others who are consistently doing better?

Consider the market value of the investment of the six.  Perhaps the witness can take the market value figure under the management of each of those companies for 2017, which is on page eight of the financial statement, and take it back two years to the same figure for 2015, with an explanation for why there is a significant change.  We want to get a feel for this because these people are looking after the investment portfolio of taxpayers' money worth &euro;6.5 billion.

If it is valid for section 38 agencies to come into the State insurance scheme, then somebody should run the numbers to see if it would be valid for local authorities to come in on the same basis.  Maybe the claim profile of the local authorities is completely different but it would be interesting to see.  There appears to be two agencies handling insurance claims - one for local authorities and one for all the organisations under the State Claims Agency.  Can we talk with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about this? Somebody needs to look at it.  I am not suggesting there should be a change but if it has worked with others, and the State Claims Agency has come to this conclusion regarding section 38 agencies, then the same exercise could be examined for local authorities, given that it is all taxpayers' money and savings could be made.</p></speech>

The Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill passing in the Chamber is asking the NTMA's Ireland Strategic Investment Fund not to hold any shares in fossil fuel companies while the NTMA is also the principal adviser to the Minister who has shares in the ESB.  Moneypoint must be the biggest CO2 emitter in Europe perhaps but certainly in Ireland.  How do the two sides of the house sit together in the NTMA?  One arm is saying let us keep bringing in millions of tonnes of coal from Colombia on each ship that comes in every month.  The other arm then is saying that we should not be investing or holding shares in fossil fuel companies.

I am  moving on to the State Claims Agency legal costs on page 41.  I have often raised this before.  This is the "good public relations" that is done.  On legal costs, "in 2017, the SCA settled 440 bills of costs received from third parties for &euro;55.2 million - a reduction of 48% on the &euro;106.9 million claimed".  One would be forgiven for thinking that great work had been done in reducing the payments on legal fees but when we turn over the page we see that is an artificial figure being compared.  It is comparable to saying someone sent in a bill but I did not pay it and so saved money.  We will  look at the details on page 44 of what actually happened beyond that headline.</p> <p>  I am looking on page 44 where the cost of claims resolved from 2013 to 2017 are detailed on a chart.  I refer to the average cost per claim.  The clinical claims are dealt with first.  I am referring to the legal fees for the State Claims Agency and the plaintiff, to the average cost per claim set out in the second column down.  The average cost per claim for the SCA for clinical claims is stated to be &euro;23,000 and the legal fees for the plaintiff were &euro;41,000.  That means that &euro;62,000 on average was paid per claim.  Mr. Breen is reading the same chart.  The award was &euro;130,000.  In other words, legal costs in respect of awards in 2017 were 49% of the legal awards.  For every &euro;100 of settlement to the individual there was an additional 49% in legal costs.  Is that correct?  That is correct.  </p> <p>  I will go back to 2004 and I could go back to other years.  In 2004, &euro;48 million was paid out in legal fees on settlements.  A sum of &euro;48,000 was the average legal fee on the average settlement of &euro;93,000, which is 48%.  There has been no real reduction in legal fees.  The SCA's percentage of legal fees, as long as I am sitting here, is running at approximately 50% of the settlements.  If I look at the previous page of the report, it is stated that there was a 48% reduction in legal fees.  Misleading is the most generous word I would put on that.  The SCA has not reduced anything.  These are the SCA's own figures.</p> <p>  I will go down then to the general claims, the column below the previous one.  It is the same situation.  I will not read the figures out loud.  I have looked at the money for 2017.  The legal fees paid out were &euro;13.6 million which is 55% of the award of &euro;24.7 million.  That is 55% and that was the rate the previous year and in 2014.  In respect of the payments, and we have been told about the payments increasing, the percentage of the legal fees is fairly static at in or around 50% for years.  Yet the SCA is telling us, and the public would believe it if the details were not looked into, that legal costs have been reduced by 48%.  That is the SCA's big chart on page 41.  It does not gel.  Does Mr. Breen get what I am saying?  That is not a real headline, it is a public relations job.  </p></speech>

We have a legal costs unit which was established in 2013 within the State Claims Agency.  It handles tribunals' bills of costs arising from third parties appearing before those tribunals.  What we are showing on page 41, and the big figure we are indicating we are saving, are actual bills of costs sent in by third parties that we examined.  In order that the Chair will know, we go out to the solicitor firms.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might comment on this as well.  If it is one of the big firms representing a third party, we go out and we look at all of their boxed files.  We examine them and then we begin to negotiate by saying we are not allowing this, that and so on and that we are reducing them.  It can be seen that we have had really good reductions in the order of more than 40% over the years.  That is on one side and those are actual savings made on the bills of costs.</p> <p>  Then if we look at what is happening on the tables the Chair has just been through, which is the other part of our business-----</p></speech>

We do not have very many opportunities to pay down the actual amount of debt.  Our debt is four times what it was in 2007.  That is a legacy of the crisis.  There are very few opportunities to reduce that debt.  Selling any liquid assets such as bank shares is one such opportunity.</p></speech>

I do not blame the witnesses.  However, every week I sit here looking at rents for, say, Caranua at the Department of Education and Skills.  Foras na Gaeilge did a business case which pointed out it was cheaper to buy a building and have a mortgage.  There is something seriously wrong with the Government's policy in this regard.  It is actively colluding in keeping market rents at the deep end.  It is now put in language where it is adding to the new financial area in the city.  Language is being used in a way to conceal.  I do not expect the witnesses to answer this.  However, I despair of the Government's policy on this at a time Galway city has a major housing crisis.  Galway has been waiting since 2002 for a public housing programme.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell.  There is no reason other areas in the country cannot be looked at for locating headquarters.</p><p>On the investment committee-----</p></speech>

I immediately think of the map of regional economic impact on page 24 of the annual report.  Mr. O'Kelly had a reason for that.  If we look at Connacht, 4% of the jobs created by ISIF were there, 6% of ISIF capital was deployed there and 4% of gross value added was in the region.  It stands out as being very low in comparison with the other regions.  Dublin's percentages for the same values were 50%, 56% and 43%, respectively.  I look at this with my limited knowledge of finance and ask who is advising and what is going on.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is not represented on this advisory board, nor is the co-operative movement.  There is no range of people outside the same people who were there at the time of the crisis.  There is the same type of skill set and the same type of consensus mentality.  Why are the co-operative movement and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta not represented on this committee given their key roles in investment in the Gaeltacht?  Is that a question for Mr. O'Kelly?  I do not mean to put him on the spot.  Should it be a question for the Minister or for the board of the NTMA?</p></speech>

There is only a certain number of people one can have around any one table making investment decisions so one must cut one's cloth to a certain degree.  Julie Sinnamon has wide experience as CEO of Enterprise Ireland.  To categorise her in that way is not really fair to her.  Richard Leonard of Grant Thornton is from Limerick and his regional expertise has been extremely valuable.</p></speech>

We are very anxious to invest in the regions.

It has a serious role in pointing out risky areas.  That is the role on which I want to focus.  Let me say that I found Mr. Breen very open.  He gave the facts and I welcome that.  I am not interested in personalising it.  He has come forward, bona fide, and given us as much information as we have asked for.</p></speech>

She is right, the SCA has a clinical risk management role with all of the services and hospitals.  This issue was not known to us.  How could we have found out about it?  We did visit the CervicalCheck screening service at the time.  I indicated that it was in March 2017.  The problem with notifying women did not come up.  We only got to know about this for the first time after the Vicky Phelan case, as I told the committee previously.  To give the Deputy some reassurance, in the meantime we have visited all of the screening services to pick up all of these topics about disclosure and about notifying matters to us and making sure that these things are being put up on the national incident management system, NIMS.  That was one of the issues we had with CervicalCheck.  It was not putting the incidents up at the time.  I assure the Deputy that we have addressed these issues with the screening services, most recently in the last two months, and we will continue to do so.  That is one of the lessons learned.</p></speech>

I refer to page 12 of the information notes the witnesses submitted.  Representatives from the Department of Finance were before the committee a while ago.  People think the country is fine - and it is - but we forget about the debt.  It does not cross people's kitchen table, so to speak, and they do not think about it.  However, as a person from the Department of Finance stated, people in Ireland are the most heavily indebted people in the world, next to Japan, when the State debt and the personal debt are added.  That is nothing to do with the witnesses but to go back to the topic I mentioned earlier, looking at the chart on page 12, which is headed "FUNDING AND DEBT MANAGEMENT", the figure for gross Government debt to gross Government revenue, and Mr. O'Kelly signalled this at the outset, is 264.2%.  It is the fourth highest next to Greece, Portugal and Italy.  We are the fourth highest in that category, which he said is a worrying figure.  He also mentioned the figure on the right of the chart for gross Government interest to gross Government revenue and 7.6% of total revenue goes on paying interest.  That figure is only below those for Portugal, Italy and Cyprus.</p></speech>

In terms of a percentage of our total income going on interest every year, we are the fourth highest in the European Union on both of those charts.  That has to be a worrying trend.</p></speech>

It is a confidentiality imposed by the mediator.  The reason for that is he wants people to be able to freely put things through the mediation and in the event the mediation fails, people will not be faced with a situation where things can be relied on in a later trial or whatever.

If Mr. Breen does not know the answer off the top of his head, he can come back with a note.  It is an unusual question.  A number of years ago, a number of raised bogs in natural heritage areas were designated.  As a result, people could not cut turf and lost turf-cutting rights.  They asked the State to buy them out.  Some people did not get through that system.  I have a parliamentary question from 26 September 2017.  There are 14,061 ha of land now being de-designated out of that process.  The people are now being told they can cut their turf again.  There was a buy-out scheme when the designation was first made and people were not able to cut their turf during that period.  People who lost money during the period of designation are being told the designation has been lifted and they can cut turf again.  They have lost quite a bit of money.  Has the State Claims Agency had any claim from any of those concerned?</p></speech>

We have reported here regularly on the total number of PPPs and the commitments under all of them.  Some of the projects are under construction and some are well into operation.  With regard to the key companies involved, is there an overexposure to any one organisation?  Maybe nobody thought of doing the sums.  If somebody has too much on hand, maybe the State is increasing its risk.  Mr. O'Kelly flagged that issue, which I was conscious of.  In the schools sector, I can list two or three companies that seem to build every school in Ireland.  It seems to be a very limited market.  Even Sammon, which was the subcontractor for Carillion, is a major school builder in its own right and it was working on its own projects.  As a result of Carillion going bust, Sammon had to go into liquidation and not just on the sites it was working on for Carillion.  Its liquidation affected myriad other schools.  The pool is too small.  What are Mr. O'Kelly's thoughts on who will look at this?  The National Development Finance Agency should examine the issue.</p></speech>

This is Committee Stage of the Bill.  I acknowledge the work of the Department and the Minister of State.  We have worked closely together to develop these proposals since the Bill passed Second Stage, with a view to reaching broad agreement on the direction of the Bill.  For me and my party, the core objective of this legislation is to ensure that loan ownership becomes a regulated activity, and to change the position which has been in law since 2015, whereby those purchasing loans, whether commercial loans or mortgages, are required to appoint an intermediary who acts as a credit servicing agent or credit servicing firm, and under the 2015 Act, that intermediary has to be a regulated entity.  From my perspective, the loan owner should be directly regulated and accountable to the Central Bank, so that the full suite of powers available to the Central Bank relating to all other regulated entities would apply.  That is the key objective that I have in seeking to advance this legislation.  The litmus test is really whether all of the Central Bank codes apply, such as the consumer protection code, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, and lending to small and medium-sized enterprises regulations, and whether the full suite of powers set out in the 2013 supervision and enforcement legislation applies and is available to the Central Bank so that, if necessary, the Central Bank has the power to inspect, investigate and, if necessary, to take enforcement action.  Those who own the loan and ultimately make all of the important decisions about its future, such as whether a person keeps a home, or about a business or farm, should be directly regulated and accountable to the Central Bank.  The Bill is not a panacea for dealing with all non-performing loan, NPL, issues and arrears, but it is an important and necessary step.</p> <p>  Other changes which we have spoken about on many occasions are required.</p><p>These include changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That code is being reviewed and my party has proposals in that regard as well.</p><p> In recent weeks, since the passage of the Bill on Second Stage, we have worked closely with the Department to essentially rewrite the Bill and put it in a format which can hopefully come through Committee and Remaining Stages and which achieves the core objective of the Bill.</p><p> Section 1 is proposed to be deleted.  I have shared with other members our speaking notes on the legislation.</p><p> Having considered the matter in more detail and focusing on the objective of ensuring that loan owners are regulated by the Central Bank, I am bringing forward changes to the definitions.  There are advantages to using an existing authorisation regime already in use by the Central Bank rather than creating a new type of regulated entity, the credit agreement owner, as originally proposed.  Therefore, the current definition section is proposed to be deleted and a new set of definitions will be introduced.</p><p> There are advantages to using an existing regime.  It means that the Central Bank already has an authorisation process in place and has already set a fitness and probity regime.  Using the credit serving regime that was put in place in 2015 should help Irish regulated firms when the proposed EU directive on credit serving is put in place.</p><p> I appreciate the Central Bank recommended that the retail credit firm regime be used and I may wish to return to this on Report Stage.  Members will have read the submission made by the Central Bank to Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach during the scrutiny phase.  The Central Bank came down on the side of opting for the retail credit firm model.  I understand there has been much engagement between the Department and the Central Bank on that point.  The view at present is that availing of the existing framework, in terms of credit serving firm, is the optimum way to go but it is something that we may need to revisit.</p></speech>

While I acknowledge that there has been a rewriting of the Bill, it appears to still meet the intended purpose of regulating the owners.  Maybe we will deal with that in more detail as we proceed.  I introduced a similar piece of legislation in the D&aacute;il as well and I am happy to support the concept of this Bill.</p> <p>  I would like either the Department or Deputy Michael McGrath to give me their understanding of the difference between regulating the retail credit firm and regulating the credit agreement owner.  What is the difference, particularly that the Central Bank has indicated to the Department?</p></speech>

I am representing the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who is at ECOFIN today.</p> <p>  This is an important piece of legislation and we need to be careful that it does not have unintended consequences.  I acknowledge the interaction between the Department, the Central Bank and the members opposite.</p> <p>  The Government was committed to supporting the Bill on Second Stage and followed through on the commitment.  I acknowledge the support of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in developing the amendments proposed.  The 2015 legislation was complex and this legislation involved the same level of complexity.  Trying to capture what was intended without leaving loopholes which could be exploited and without going beyond what was intended is a tricky operation.</p> <p>  It is helpful that the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, will be published and available for consideration by stakeholders in the market over the summer recess.  We will return to it on Report Stage in the autumn and this will give us the opportunity to revisit some of the technical details.  Specifically, we may bring forward Report Stage amendments following engagement with the Central Bank on the appropriate regulatory regime.  That said, the amendments achieve what we and Deputy Michael McGrath have set out to achieve and I look forward to the debate.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question, the main difference between authorisation as a retail credit firm and authorisation as a credit serving firm is that retail credit firms are required to submit details of their credit risk strategy, their credit policy, their credit control policy, forbearance restructuring, etc., provisioning and bad debts policy to the Central Bank.  The bank also imposes a requirement on retail credit firms to communicate with its management body in respect of any deviations from these strategy.  A retail credit firm is also required to ensure that any significant deviations from the credit risk strategy, credit policy, credit control policy and provisioning policy should be communicated to its management body in accordance with the reporting arrangements set out in the credit policy.  The credit servicing firm authorisation requirements require credit firms to have professional indemnity and insurance, to notify the Central Bank in advance of taking on a new loan portfolio, and provide for requirements around a credit firm's relationship with the loan owner.</p> <p>  The European Commission has launched a proposal for a European directive on the authorisation of credit servicers.  The proposed directive provides that credit servicers authorised in a member state can provide their service across the EU provided they are in compliance with the directive.  Member states would be required to have an authorisation regime in place for credit servicing firms under the proposed directive.  The proposed directive would require that loan purchasers are not subject to additional requirements.  This is not compatible with the Private Members' Bill.</p> <p>  The benefits to regulating firms as credit serving firms include the following - continuing the existing credit servicing regime is of benefit to existing credit servicing firms; it would allow existing credit servicing firms to passport to other EU countries; it is more stable from a legislative viewpoint; it is more likely to be consistent with the new EU regime; and, authorising loan owners as retail credit firms would not improve the consumer protections that would be available to borrowers - there would be the same protections as available via authorisation as a credit servicing firm.</p></speech>

I am just taking it in.  I appreciate what the Minister of State said, particularly the final point that consumer protection would not be different from one or the other.  However, it appears from the speaking note the Minister of State read out that the approach being taken, which is that the credit firm as opposed to the retail credit firm will be regulated, is far less regulation.  It is more like light-touch regulation of the entity which will hold the ownership of this credit in that it will not be required to furnish to the Central Bank its credit risk strategy and all of the other matters that were indicated.  Given the amount of loans that entities would hold in this jurisdiction, is that not an issue of concern?</p></speech>

That is why it is a good opportunity for us to have Committee Stage now.  We can see how potentially they will impact upon the new rules and have a look again on Report Stage.</p> <p>  It is not light touch, but we also want to ensure that we do not deviate too far.  That is why we are doing it in this manner.</p></speech>

It would appear at present there is not and there is a difference as to the preference.  I myself have been trying to tease this out to gauge the actual difference.  The Minister of State has put some detail on the record there.</p> <p>  I am focusing on the key objective from a consumer point of view.  If, for example, we had opted for the tier of a licensed credit institution that would be underpinned by European legislation but credit servicing firms, debt management firms and retail credit firms are all subject to domestic regulatory regimes without the underpinning of EU law.</p><p>I received this information in a reply in the D&aacute;il some time ago.  In all of the above instances, the harmonised powers of the Central Bank contained in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 will be available to the bank, depending on the circumstances and the Central Bank codes apply in all cases.  I went through the codes earlier.</p><p> I am somewhat agnostic on it, but it would be better if there was an agreed position between the Central Bank and the Department.  That will not be finalised until the autumn.  Their comments in response to what is put on the record today would be helpful before we table Report Stage amendments.</p></speech>

The Central Bank favours the regulation of the retail credit firm as opposed to what is being proposed, namely, the regulation of a credit servicing firm.  I do not believe the committee will be able to deal with this issue at this point.  Notwithstanding our interaction with the Minister's officials, there is an issue with this.  The three types of regulation in place at this point are regulation of the banks, which is the gold standard; regulation of the retail credit firms, which is a lesser standard; and regulation of the credit servicing firm, which is the weakest standard.  It would not be appropriate to regulate the vulture funds with the least stringent standard.  They are not servicing firms as they hold the loans of Irish consumers.  From my point of view, we should proceed in respect of section 1, but it would be helpful to obtain a written submission from the Central Bank before we proceed to Report Stage.  I am not suggesting that we take a step backwards but that the committee find a vehicle with which to engage with the Central Bank if anything appears in its submission.</p></speech>

I have spoken on section 1.  The amendments are aimed at the definitions which will be inserted in section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997.  This section is in the Part of the 1997 Act which deals with the regulated businesses.  The amendments will expand the definition of &quot;credit servicing&quot; and &quot;credit servicing firm&quot; and also allow passive securitisation vehicles to continue to operate without regulation.  These vehicles are completely passive and do not interact with consumers and, therefore, do not give rise to any consumer protection concerns.  Their role in providing funding to the financial sector which can be used to provide credit to the real economy is widely recognised and it was never my intention that these vehicles would be regulated.</p><p>Credit servicing has been broken into three components.  The first, holding legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement, is the key element of the Bill.</p><p>The second component is the managing or administering of a number of different elements of the credit agreement.  This includes all elements which were previously in the definition of credit servicing and also includes &quot;determining the overall strategy for the strategy and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements&quot; and &quot;maintaining control over key decisions related to the portfolio&quot;.  These are the key elements and these are changes to the definition of the credit servicing firm.  It is essentially what pulls in the loan owner who is making those decisions.  The third component is communicating with the borrower on these elements.  <br/><br/>This will capture those activities whose exclusion from the definition of credit servicing meant that owners of credit agreements were not required to be authorised including the now specifically holding of legal title to credit making key decisions and determining strategy means that anyone doing these activities will need authorisation and will, therefore, be regulated by the Central Bank.<br/><br/>I refer to the amended definition of a credit servicing firm.  This means that anyone who undertakes credit servicing other than on behalf of a regulated owner and includes people who were taken to be authorised under transitional arrangements.<br/><br/>If a person is undertaking credit servicing on behalf of an owner of credit, the credit servicer does not have to be regulated because the owner of the credit is the regulated entity.  This part of the definition is similar to the definition in the 2015 Act.  The amendment will also insert a number of technical definitions to do with ownership and with securitisation.<br/><br/>There is a new subsection (2).  This makes it clear that even if there is an owner, that is the holder of legal title, and has credit servicing undertaken by a regulated credit servicing firm, the owner still has to be regulated.  New subsection (2A) specifically excludes securitisation entities from the need to be authorised.  It draws from the definitions used in the most recent securities regulation, Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017.<br/><br/>There are a number of technical definitions inserted in the Bill on foot of this exclusion, &quot;owner of credit&quot;, &quot;retain on an ongoing basis&quot;, &quot;securitisations special purpose entity&quot; and also others which are given the same meaning as in the regulation.<br/><br/>It was always the intention that securitisation vehicles which were not actively involved in dealing with consumers would not require regulation by the Central Bank.  We sought to provide for that in the original Bill.  An amendment has now been brought forward, with the assistance of the Department of Finance.  This technical amendment excludes securitisation from the definition of credit servicing.<br/><br/>New subsection (4) makes it clear that a person who is currently authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm is taken to be authorised under the 2018 legislation without having to seek further authorisation.  It is difficult to see why we would need to have additional authorisation requirements for existing firms which are already authorised and regulated.<br/><br/>If additional requirements are needed, it should be noted that section 33A of the Central Bank Act 1997 provides that the bank, in dealing with a regulated business, may among other things:</p><blockquote>( a) make the firm&rsquo;s authorisation subject to such conditions or requirements, or both, as it considers appropriate, relating to&mdash; (i) the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of retail credit firms or authorised home reversion firms, and <br /><br />(ii) the protection of their customers or potential customers; </blockquote><p>Acceptance of this amendment will involve the deletion of section 2 currently in the Bill.  </p></speech>

My view is that it should be the retail credit firm, therefore, this would also need to change.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two points on the new section 2.  I am concerned about the issue of not regulating the credit servicing firm, if the owner of the loans is regulated, because that will become the norm.  Under this legislation, we would regulate the owners with the lightest type of regulation which is the credit servicing firm regulation.  Therefore, the servicing firms that the people deal with and interact with will not be regulated.  The argument for that approach is that the owner is regulated so that they can be pursued.  I am unsure if that is the best approach.  It goes back to the original point of whether we should leave the credit services unregulated under the existing legislation and the owner should be regulated as a retail credit firm, which would resolve this issue and ensure that those who are interacting with individuals, sending out letters in some cases, not responding and so on, cannot take a gloves-off approach because they themselves are not under the scope of the Central Bank as an entity while the fund which contracted their services would be and could be held accountable for their role.  In this scenario, it would be better that both would be regulated.  The new subsection (2) makes it clear that can happen where there is a credit servicing firm that is regulated, and the owner is regulated, that both can coexist but it also allows for them not to coexist, and for one not to be regulated.  I am concerned about that and would like to revisit it on Report Stage.  I say Report Stage because the whole issue of whether it should be a retail credit firm goes to the core of how we approach this legislation.  I would like to hear the Central Bank's view on that.  </p> <p>  My second point relates to securitisation.  I am sure that this is not the case, however, where the holder of credit, that is, the vulture fund, secures a part of that debt through the process of securitisation, the vehicle that would be established would not come under the regulation of this Bill.  Is it the case that the owner of the debt would still be regulated?  If a vulture fund secured 15% of the debt through securitisation that would not exempt it from regulation under this legislation.  I refer to section 3 of the Bill.</p></speech>

Subsection (2) means that there is no confusion as to where the buck stops.  Under this legislation, the buck will stop with the owner of the debt or fund, not the administrators or the agents on behalf of the fund.</p> <p>  In the debate we are having on whether it is a retail credit firm level of regulation or the credit servicing firm level, it is important to remember if we implement the retail credit firm level we are implementing a level of regulation for a firm in relation to the provision of credit, the credit risk strategy, the credit policy, the credit control policy and, provisionally, for a firm that does not provide credit.  That is the essential point on why we are going with a credit servicing firm rather than the retail credit firms policy.</p></speech>

I will reflect on that and review it.  We do not want to allow any gap but the overall objective is that the owner would become regulated.</p></speech>

(1) Notwithstanding section 29, a person (other than a regulated financial service provider taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm by virtue of section 28(3) or a person taken to be carrying on the business of a credit servicing firm by virtue of section 28(4)) carrying on the business of a credit servicing firm immediately before the coming into operation of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 is taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm after such coming into operation until the Bank has granted or refused authorisation to the person, provided that the person applies to the Bank under section 30 for authorisation no later than 3 months after that coming into operation.<br /><br />(2) If a person is taken to be authorised to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm under subsection (1), the Bank may do either or both of the following:<blockquote>(a) impose on that person such conditions or requirements or both as the Bank considers appropriate relating to the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of credit servicing firms;<br /><br />(b) direct that person not to carry on the business of a credit servicing firm for such period (not exceeding 3 months) as is specified in the direction.</blockquote>(3) A condition or requirement imposed, or a direction given, under this section is an appealable decision for the purposes of Part VIIA of the Act of 1942.&quot;.&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>This is a new section 34FA that allows an existing owner to continue to hold legal title, provided there is an application to the Central Bank for authorisation within three months of the coming into operation of this legislation.  It also makes it clear that the Central Bank may impose conditions on such an owner.  This is similar to the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act.  The intention here is to give owners a route to continuing the ownership while going through the authorisation process.  Acceptance of this amendment involves deletion of section 3 of the Bill.  It is a transitional provision providing a route for those who currently own loans and are not regulated to become regulated and continue to own those loans.</p></speech>

Two principles are particularly relevant, namely 2.1, that an entity acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market, and 2.7, that an entity seeks to avoid conflicts of interest.</p></speech>

Section 3.11 of the consumer protection code provides that where a regulated entity intends to cease operating, merge with another entity or transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity, it must: notify the Central Bank immediately; provide at least two months notice to affected customers to enable them to make alternative arrangements; ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to the transfer, merger or cessation of operations or, alternatively in the case of a transfer or merger, inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided following the transfer or merger; and in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform the consumer that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.</p> <p>  Regulated entities, including loan owners, are obliged to follow the provisions of all Central Bank codes and regulations.  The Department has conveyed its concerns to me that the proposed section would have unintended consequences.  The Central Bank has copied letters to the committee which state that it expects that all affected customers are informed of both the term in their loan agreement which allows the loan to be sold and the identity and address of the proposed new owner at least two months in advance of the transfer and to inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided to him or her.</p></speech>

While heretofore one could take a case to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman against a credit card servicing firm, that option will no longer be available under this legislation.  The only recourse would be to the loan owner.  There is an issue here in terms of access to the ombudsman.  There will be no right to take a case against the individual or the company that is sending the letters or making the telephone calls; a case will have to be taken against the owner in the future.  That builds on the point I made earlier.  A consumer would no longer be dealing with a company which provides the normal services a credit firm would provide, but rather a company which engages with people who are in financial distress and who have restructured their mortgages.  I am concerned that the legislation would mean that those companies are not regulated, although I accept that it regulates the owner.  I am also concerned that it takes away the right to take a case to the ombudsman against that firm and provides the right to the owner.

The question is whether the intermediary, if there is one, continues to be in place, and whether that intermediary should also be regulated as a credit servicing firm.  We should ask the Central Bank for its views on that matter, because they will feed into this issue.</p></speech>

The legislation still allows for both the credit servicing firm and the owner to be regulated.  A customer might be able to do exactly as suggested by the Minister of State.  It also allows for the credit servicing firm not to be regulated in the traditional fashion.  We know the owner will become a credit servicing firm.  I am happy that the section be deleted but this is an issue I want to revisit.</p></speech>

I am deeply unhappy that these entities have total disregard for the Oireachtas in spite of the changes that might arise from the Bill.  We make the laws.  If the companies refuse to be accountable to the committee, I firmly believe regulation should make them far more formally accountable.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.  I also ask Deputy Michael McGrath to consider it in the context of the Bill.  I do not see why the companies should get away with it.  The agents and vulture funds inflict terrible pain and suffering on families all over the country but do what they like.  The purpose of the Bill and similar Bills is to provide an appropriate level of consumer protection, which is necessary because these companies will not submit to accountability and transparency before the committee.  I understand the point made by Deputy McGrath that this is getting into the nitty-gritty of regulation but it is necessary in order to protect the consumer.  I ask the Minister of State to consider what has happened in this country in recent years and the disregard shown by those companies for the Oireachtas.  If they continue to fail to appear before the committee, the Minister must ensure a level of regulation sufficient to ensure they have respect for this country and the citizens we represent.</p></speech>

The funds show disrespect to the Oireachtas by their failure to appear.  I was a member of this committee 13 or 14 months ago when it invited the funds to appear before it.  Each fund politely wrote back to say it would not appear.  I am pleased that Department of Finance officials have worked hand in glove with Deputy McGrath on the legislation, which has cross-party support, and to ensure the best and strongest regulation is put in place as quickly as possible to protect the consumers to whom the Chairman refers.</p></speech>

The Minister of State was a member of the committee but now holds a very important position in the Department of Finance.  I strongly encourage him to remember the people he represents and the damage done to many of them by vulture funds which completely disregard any form of consumer protection we put in place.  It should be made clear that the high level of regulation to be put in place is necessary because of the disrespect shown by such companies to the Oireachtas and the people of this country.</p></speech>
