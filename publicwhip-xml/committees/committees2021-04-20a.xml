Deputy Mac Lochlainn is substituting for Deputy Carthy.  Before we begin, I remind members that in the context of the current Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room and all members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The Chairman issues invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams and members may not participate from outside the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to mute their microphones when they are not making a contribution and to use the raise hand function to indicate.  Members should note that messages sent in the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I would like to state for the record decisions made by the joint committee in private at its MS Teams meeting on 9 April.  It was agreed that the committee would write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to express concern that feedback from the committee and stakeholders about the new veterinary medicine regulation is not being taken into account by the Department and to seek further briefing on the matter.  It was also agreed to invite the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation to a future meeting of the joint committee to discuss its submission to the Government's review and renewed consultation.  It was further agreed to add the new rural environment protection scheme, REPS, to the committee's work programme.</p> <p>  There are two topics on the agenda for today's meeting.  From 9.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m., we will have an engagement with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, on pre-legislative scrutiny of the sea-fisheries (amendment) Bill 2020.  From 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., there will be a discussion with representatives of Macra na Feirme on the impact on young farmers of CAP negotiations and the good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, 2.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#A00400"><p>We will now commence pre-legislative scrutiny of the sea-fisheries (amendment) Bill.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, Dr. Cecil Beamish, assistant secretary at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with responsibility for fisheries, Ms Josephine Kelly, principal officer, sea fisheries policy and management division, and Mr. John Kinsella, principal officer, legal services division.  The officials join us remotely from a witness room in Kildare House.  They are all very welcome to the meeting.</p> <p>  We have received the Minister's opening statement and briefing material, copies of which have been circulated to members.  As we are limited on time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions, the committee has agreed that the opening statement may be taken as read and the full session will be used for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  The legislative proposal we are discussing is a hugely important issue for the fisheries sector.  Before I invite questions from members, I ask the Minister to comment briefly on how he sees the situation for the sector at this time and the necessity for this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for their very prompt response to our request for pre-legislative scrutiny of the sea-fisheries (amendment) Bill.  I brought the heads of the Bill to Cabinet last week and sought approval for the scrutiny process and to proceed to general drafting.  I look forward to the engagement with the committee and to members' feedback and comprehensive teasing out of the various aspects of the Bill, both in pre-legislative scrutiny and as it moves through the various Stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</p> <p>  These proposals follow on from the penalty points system that was introduced for licence holders, which was established by statutory instrument last August.  Since 2012, there has been on obligation on us, as an EU member state and in accordance with the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, to introduce a penalty points control system for both licence holders and masters.  We are the only remaining member state that has not yet introduced both penalty points systems.  While we were able to introduce the licence holder penalty points arrangements by way of statutory instrument, as there was a legislative basis at European level to do so, we require primary legislation to put in place a system to deal with masters.  It is on this basis that I have brought forward these heads of Bill.  I look forward to the committee's full engagement with, and communication on, the provisions as we go forward.</p></speech>

Deputy Mac Lochlainn has indicated that he has questions.</p></speech>

We debated the proposal in the D&aacute;il and I have to accept that it was voted through.  I remind the Minister that when he was Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine, he had a very different view on this matter.  His colleague and former Deputy, Pat the Cope Gallagher, when he was spokesperson on the marine, introduced an annulment motion.</p> <p>  There are a number of points I want to reintroduce today in regard to the heads of this Bill.  Specifically, I want to raise again the four key and reasonable bones of contention the industry has with these proposals.  I have read the Minister's opening statement and, remarkably, what is missing in his assessment is an acknowledgment that the draft penalty points have been challenged in the courts and the Supreme Court has ruled on the matter previously.  Everybody recognises that the European Commission is demanding that Ireland introduce a scheme.  It is agreed that there needs to be a penalty points system, and oversight of that system, and that we must ensure our fisheries are operated sustainably.  Unfortunately, the schemes that have been introduced on a number of occasions have not been fair and just.  I will go through the correspondence that was issued to the Minister by the various fishing organisations in September 2020.</p> <p>  Point 9 in the draft general scheme, which is on page 10 of the document, shows that the Minister has not addressed the four main areas of concern for the industry, and I am sure that will continue through the scheme.  The four major producer organisations in the State, namely, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation and the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, have written to the Minister to raise the four key issues.  The first of these concerns the decision to be made by the determination panel on the balance of probabilities.  This is very serious stuff because we are talking about potentially taking away somebody's livelihood.</p><p>The threshold for conviction for all Irish citizens and, indeed, European citizens is beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the threshold a director of public prosecutions and a jury looks at - beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the accepted threshold yet we are going with a threshold of "on the balance of probabilities", which I think is very dangerous.  I reiterate that this type of approach has been rejected by the courts and it is the reason that it has taken so long for us to bring in legislation.  With all due respect to the senior officials in the Department, they keep getting things wrong when drafting this legislation and, unfortunately, they have been turned around in the courts, which is what has delayed this process.</p><p> Having spoken to people across the industry I want to take this opportunity to say the following.  There is an attempt to present the fishing industry as some kind of a mass illegality or an industry that does not like to follow laws, is up to skullduggery and so on.  We only have to see that the funding and number of staff for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority have multiplied tenfold since it was brought into place so one has an organisation or regulator that has been seriously resourced.  Any fisherman with whom I have spoken talked about how determined these officials are in terms of doing their job so I do not think anybody doubts the determination of the SFPA to implement the law.  If some mass illegality did take place then how come we have not had a mass number of people convicted in the courts?  It is very dangerous for the State to allow a narrative to go out that mass illegality is happening in the fishing industry.</p><p> Let us remember that the fishing industry is being squeezed out of its rightful access to the fish in our seas.  We had 12% of the seas in the European Union yet we only get 4% of the quota across the European Union.  We get one third of what should be our natural right so we should stand up for fishermen rather than allow a narrative of criminality and illegality to be placed on our fishing industry.  Of course there should be oversight, and people should fish sustainably, not over fish and where over fishing is found to happen then people should be taken to task but there must be due process and it has to be fair.  Every citizen is entitled to that fundamental pillar of our democracy and I find it astonishing that we allow legislation to again be presented to us that accepts a ban that removes any reference to "the balance of probabilities" and replaces it with "beyond a reasonable doubt".  I appeal to the Minister to do that today and I draw his attention to the language again used in section 9, page 10 of the general scheme.</p><p> As the Minister will recall from correspondence he received from the four producer organisations, POs, last September, it states: "Where points remain on a licence even in the event of an appellant being exonerated of any offence."  This provision is very objectionable.  This is where a person has the right to take his or her case to a court of law if he or she feels that he or she has done no wrong yet, even if successful in that court of law, those penalty points remain on the licence.  Can one imagine a situation where a person pulled over by the Garda for speeding is adamant there was no speeding and goes to a court of law where the case is won yet the points remain on the licence? Such a situation would not be tolerated by citizens yet we expect fishermen to find it acceptable.</p><p> The third point of contention is that fisherman are only allowed to apply to the High Court on a point of law.  Again, the fishing community finds that objectionable.</p><p> The final point of contention, and I have no doubt that it is replicated in this legislation, is "where points attached to capacity multiply in the event of that capacity being subdivided".  In other words, those points flow throughout even if one sells and subdivides one's capacity.</p><p> The Minister must agree that these are four reasonable grounds of concern for the fishing industry.  As he knows, with all legislation that is presented to the Oireachtas one would expect that he would consult the stakeholders and invite them to make submissions.  I know that he has rejected these grounds.  I cannot see how any Minister can stand over the balance of probabilities being a threshold for conviction, having to go to court yet still be unable to remove points and being only able to apply "on a point of law".           </p><p> Finally, I am pretty sure that every Deputy and Senator on this call today, and every fisherman I know that is worth their salt, understands that there needs to be a penalty points system.  We all understand that we must have oversight and laws and that we must protect the precious amenity and natural resources in our seas but there is a plethora of staff in the SFPA, and there is the Naval Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a wide range of people to enforce the law but citizens have a right to due process and to be considered.  Most important, a citizen has the right under law to be considered innocent until proven guilty.  In my opinion, one must prove one's innocence as one is presumed guilty under too many of these processes.  I put all of that to the Minister and look forward to his engagement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#B00200"><p>I have previously discussed this matter with the committee in terms of the licence penalty points statutory instrument and licence holders.  Also, I met and discussed the matter in great depth with fishermen's representatives.</p> <p>  A number of proposals or suggested amendments were put forward on the licence holder statutory instrument, which my own party put forward in opposition, that we felt should be considered.  The amendments were considered in great detail and some were incorporated such as additional time for the appeals process, etc.  For some of them, given the legal advice following a full assessment, it was found that if they were to be accepted it would mean that the statutory instrument and the licence penalty points system would not pass muster or meet the expected thresholds.  At that time they were examined in massive detail, given exceptional hearing and fully examined as to the capacity for them to be absorbed and incorporated into the statutory instrument.</p> <p>  The masters penalty points system requires legislation.  The same approach and the learnings from all of that full examination and assessment is followed through in the approach being taken now with the masters penalty points legislation.  It is very similar to and consistent with the approach taken in terms of the licence holders.</p> <p>  As I mentioned at the outset, the regulation requires each member state to have a penalty points system for licence holders and for masters has been in place since 2012.  We are very late to the table and are the last member state to put this legislation in place.  The initial licence statutory instrument was legally challenged and found not to be appropriate in some regards so a new SI was required.  There was a significant examination of the amendments put forward by my own party and a new SI was introduced last August.</p> <p>  Overall, the two penalty points systems must achieve a system that is dissuasive, proportionate and effective, which are the key thresholds.</p><p> I will touch on the three points the Deputy raised.  On the issue of the standard of proof to be used by the determination panel and the appeals officer, balance of probabilities is the approach that is being taken.  The legal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt is almost entirely confined to criminal trials and is not applicable to proceedings that are civil in nature.  For any civil proceedings that end up in court, the standard used is on the balance of probabilities.  It is a standard that is used for the licence holders points system and for the masters system we are discussing.  Our legal advice is that it is the appropriate legal standard for the penalty points system to ensure we are compliant with our responsibilities as a control authority and as a control member state.</p><p> The Deputy asked about cases where there is no guilty verdict in criminal proceedings.  Where the master or owner is found not guilty in criminal proceedings, this proposal would involve both systems being interlinked.  They would not stand alone from each other if the proposal the Deputy is making were to be adopted.  They are separate systems involving separate standards of proof between the points and a criminal prosecution.  It would lead to confusion and conflation of evidence, and render elements inadmissible.  In addition, the legal advice is clear that points under the EU regulation are intended as additional to criminal prosecution.  I will repeat that.  The legal advice is that points under EU regulation are intended as additional to criminal prosecution.  Accordingly, it could not be argued that Ireland has both criminal and points systems as required under EU regulation if we operated this system in a manner whereby criminal proceedings completely eclipsed the points system.</p><p> That is the legal advice we have on the matter.  The overarching point I would make is that it is my objective to introduce a system which is as balanced and proportionate to all of our responsibilities and, indeed, to the fishing sector as it possibly can be while meeting our legal obligations to comply with European regulation.  There is no point in any of us going through this process and introducing a system that then falls flat on it face and does not meet our legal obligations.  That adds no value.  We need to deal with the facts and deal with the issue.</p><p> We certainly should tease out the details as we are doing today and over the next period but, ultimately, what we introduce must ensure that, as a member state, we are compliant with our obligations under the 2012 EU regulation.  At the moment, Ireland is the only member state that is not compliant.  We would all be wasting our time if we fool ourselves by introducing a system that does not bring us into compliance with our European obligations as a control member state authority.  That is ultimately where we need to be at the end of this process, having introduced this legislation.</p><p> Regarding a licence holder having a full right to the rehearing of a case before the High Court, the legal advice is clear that under the Constitution the High Court has full original jurisdiction and can hear all matters of law brought before it.  The legal advice is that it would be highly anomalous, if not unprecedented, to provide such a full High Court rehearing of a matter first governed in procedures set down in the previous statutory instrument or, indeed, in this legislation.  In addition, it would delay the application of points which would run up against the timelines stipulated in the EU regulation that points apply for three years from the commencement date following detection.  To that extent then it would hinder the effective implementation of this EU law and would not meet Ireland's obligations to implement these EU provisions.</p><p> Similar challenges would have been teased out regarding the licence holder penalty points system.  They were given great examination at that time when amendments were considered and ultimately decided upon.  The same considerations apply to this masters penalty points system which is very much based on the licence holder one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for appearing before the committee.  I have a number of questions.  The Minister may not be able to answer them all in the time we have allocated, but he might come back to me in writing.</p> <p>  This is another blow for the fishermen and fisherwomen in this country.  It could not come at a worse time, regardless of when it should have been implemented.  The statutory instrument, SI 318/2020, is linked to this Bill.  It was signed into law by the Taoiseach in August 2020.  That was a grotesque and deeply damaging act by the Taoiseach, who was the then caretaker Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.  What is worse was that it occurred without any consultation with the fisheries sector.  Does the Minister believe it was handled well?</p> <p>  The Minister's first meeting with the fisheries sector via Webex was on 16 September 2020.  Representatives of the sector raised their deep concern over the introduction of SI 318/2020 at that meeting.  Why did the Minister not listen to the representatives of the sector that day, rescind the statutory instrument and go back to the drawing board, including the sectoral viewpoints, in redrafting a more appropriate statutory instrument?</p> <p>  Why did the Minister vote against the same statutory instrument in 2018 when his D&aacute;il colleague from Donegal, Pat The Cope Gallagher, brought a rescinding motion before the D&aacute;il?  What changed between the summer of 2018 and 2020?  The statutory instrument did not change.  Was it that the opportunity for power changed the Minister's mind and blinkered where his loyalties lay?  It appears to me and to many fishermen and fisherwomen, including many in his county, that he is doing one thing in opposition and another thing when in power.  Has the Minister consulted with the man who proposed having the original statutory instrument rescinded, namely, the former Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, for advice and guidance?  Surely that should have been his starting point given that he had been advocating for the industry back in 2018 on this very issue.</p> <p>    Why is the burden of proof, under SI 318/2020 and this Bill, on the balance of probabilities and not, as required in criminal cases, beyond a reasonable doubt?  Why is the Minister degrading the civil liberties of fishermen and fisherwomen in this way?  Why do the statutory instrument and the Bill not allow fishermen and fisherwomen a right to appeal a sanction arrived at on the basis of balance of probabilities?  It makes no sense and undermines the civil and human rights of the entire fishing sector.  Would the Minister not agree that this is dictatorship territory?</p> <p>  Why is the statutory instrument, introduced by the Taoiseach and then acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, forcing the fishing licence holders to retain the penalty points on their licences even if their cases are cleared in court?  Does the Minister believe this is fair and just in a liberal democracy?  It is no longer that our courts are the highest law of the land.  If a fisherman gets points under this administration scheme, they cannot be removed by any court.</p> <p>  I plead with the Minister, even at this stage, to see common sense and stop being influenced by the bureaucrats in Brussels.  He should rescind SI 318/2020, go back to the drawing board and give the fisheries sector an input into the penalty points system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#C00300"><p>Regarding consultation with the industry on the previous statutory instrument, it is clear there has been considerable engagement with the industry on this issue over the past couple of years in particular.  As I outlined to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, there was significant engagement with industry on proposed amendments and these were then fully assessed and examined.  Those that could be incorporated, while ensuring that we introduced a system that meets our obligation, were incorporated.  Those that could not be without meaning that we were bringing in a system which did not meet our obligation were not incorporated.  Great examination and consideration were given to that.</p> <p>  After I was appointed as Minister, I met representatives of the industry and engaged with them even further.  We examined and discussed all the issues we are discussing here today.  I explained that some of the proposed amendments have been incorporated - those that could be incorporated without undermining the capacity to introduce a system that met our obligations.  Those that did not allow for that were not incorporated and overall it had tremendous examination.  The two statutory instruments - the one that was rejected by the D&aacute;il and the one that was introduced in August - were different in that they incorporated those amendments that were considered to be able to be incorporated without making the statutory instrument one which would mean we still would remain non-compliant with EU obligations for which we have had responsibility since 2012.</p><p>I have listened a lot.  We might not agree with the outcome and I am open to engaging in detail with the Deputy on the backdrop and the tactical and legal considerations around that and getting into the nitty-gritty of that.  It is important we do that.  We can talk in headlines or overarching rhetoric, but it is the nitty-gritty and bringing into place a system that brings us into compliance which will count.  There is no point going through this process if, at the end of the day, we are no further forward and still have not met our obligations.</p><p> The other backdrop to this is that, given we are the only member state without a penalty points system in place, the EU Commission has moved in the past year or so to introduce a reasoned opinion against Ireland for failure to have, previously, a licence holder penalty points system and, now, a masters penalty points system in place.  They have applied the pressure and moved through the compliance tools available to them to force us to get into line and bring in this system.  The other thing they have done is suspended funding to us.  There is &euro;24 million in funding, which the EU has not released to the taxpayer because we have not met our obligations in this regard.  That could go up to &euro;37 million.  That would be a loss to the taxpayer were we not to ensure we meet our obligations.  It is important that we meet our obligations but, were we not to, the taxpayer would be out to the tune of &euro;37 million.  There is an obligation on us to tease this out in detail and bring in the most balanced and appropriate system we can, one that is as fair as possible to fisherman and at the same time ensures we are applying the law of the Common Fisheries Policy, as is our obligation and responsibility as a member state.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the burden of proof.  I have dealt with that and refer him to the response I gave to Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  I have also dealt with the question on not allowing a full appeal to the High Court in my previous response.  There is an appeals system within the legislation.  One can appeal to the determinations panel.  The statutory instrument, SI, that was introduced brought in some amendments around the appeal system, compared to what was in the previous SI.  The Deputy asked why the penalty points still stand if a criminal prosecution does not lead to a conviction.  As I mentioned to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, it is because there is a requirement on us to have civil and criminal strands to this.  The burden of proof in a criminal case is beyond reasonable doubt; the burden of proof in a civil case is on the balance of probabilities.  That applies to other laws in our land as well.  Some are civil laws and some are criminal laws.  If one was to make a civil law and the application of a civil approach subject to the outcome of a criminal strand, it would nullify the civil strand.  I thank that answers all the questions the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

On the balance of probabilities, I do not think the Minister will find anybody who disagrees that everybody is entitled to due process and to have themselves tried beyond reasonable doubt.  That has been a major concern for years when it comes to this Bill.  I do not know if the Minister has tried to do anything about it.  Is there anywhere in the audit to which he can point to show us he has taken on board the suggestions and concerns of the fishing sector?</p><p>The licence holder gets ten days to appeal and 20 days from the date of notification.  Why is there such a short timeframe for making submissions or appeals?  We all know how slow that process is and to have boats or fishermen tied down to such a short timescale is unreasonable, in my view.  </p><p>There is an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>this morning about the derogation being withdrawn, which states that there are factories which are not fit for purpose for the weighing system.

I have taken on board and engaged in great detail with the industry, following my appointment, on the statutory instrument, and previous to that on their proposals and concerns around the SI that had been annulled by the D&aacute;il.  There were amendments that were given great consideration coming out of that as to whether they could be incorporated while ensuring that the SI being introduced met our obligations.  They were teased out and examined in detail, taking on board legal advice.  Coming out of that, some amendments were incorporated.  The majority were not but that is not to say there was not tremendous examination given to that.  Likewise, I have looked in detail at the appropriate approach here and taken significant legal advice because I want to ensure the system we introduce is not only fair to everyone, balanced and proportionate but that it works as well and meets our obligations as a member state, which we have to take seriously and which other member states have adopted.  The EU Commission, because we do not have both systems in place - one is and the other is not - has imposed fines on us.  It is important to ensure we have these systems in place.  There has been strong consideration given to all aspects of this and that informs the approach being taken in this Bill.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his comments so far on the Bill.  I will not rehash answers he has given.  He outlined that we are the last member state to implement these conditions and rules in respect of this aspect of the penalty points system.  How many member states have both the penalty points system and the system alongside?  Has the Minister looked at that and compared us to other member states?  Are we the same?  The Department is very quick to point out we are dealing with EU waters rather than Irish waters.  How are we in compliance with EU regulations across that or are we an outlier?</p></speech>

This is a serious issue and it has been a very interesting debate so far.  I ask the Minister about the criminal versus civil law issue.  It is my understanding that even where a criminal prosecution fails, a person could still end up with penalty points.  That is an issue.  Where else in the Department does that approach apply?  I have not come across it before in legislation.  Does this happen in agriculture appeals or in other parts of the system?  Will the Minister give examples of where it happens in the Department?</p></speech>

Those schemes are administered within the Department.  It is not a criminal system and it is not directly comparable to this.  This approach is unique in that it is an EU regulation and we have a legal obligation to have a civil penalty points system in place operating alongside a separate criminal system.  It is not necessarily that both systems would always conclude but certainly the penalty points would be a stand-alone system.</p></speech>

We are required to put in place a system which is effective, dissuasive and proportionate.  The whole approach and the terms and conditions around it are structured to ensure we meet those thresholds and that what emerges from this process brings us into compliance.  We are the only member that is not in compliance.  This legislation is designed to achieve that and it is the minimum required to ensure we do that.</p></speech>

If there are any valid or reasonable points in the report or any other report that the Deputy wishes to have considered, the option is available to him to put them on the table.  There has been a great deal of legal examination and consideration given to this penalty points system and the previous one.  The previous system received close examination, as we have just discussed, through engagement with the committee and the many amendments that were proposed and considered in detail and great depth.  This approach, with the masters penalty points system, follows on from that.  It is framed in this way because it is what is required to ensure we introduce a system that is compliant.  The option is available to Deputy Mac Lochlainn to bring any specific suggestions he wishes into the mix and have them examined.  Much consideration has been given in advance of this Bill to ensuring that it introduces a system that brings us into compliance.</p></speech>

We would expect, therefore, that senior Department officials would find out what is the acceptable European Union norm for this type of scheme.  There is an important question to be asked.  I appreciate that the Minister has a wide range of responsibilities with a brief covering agriculture, food and the marine and that he cannot be expected to read every single report from the European Union.  I am not going to be unreasonable.  It is, however, the responsibility of his senior officials to have read the report, Implementation of the current EU fisheries control system by Member States (2014-19).  From the Minister's response, it is not clear if his officials have read the report.  It is absolutely critical that they do so.  Have they read this report?  Is the legislation they have drafted for the Minister based on normal practice in the European Union?  This is to meet the responsibilities under the EU directive.</p><p>There is a range of examples within the European Union with regard to the implementation of a penalty points system.  This proposition has been rejected a number of times.  One would imagine they would now want to find a system that is acceptable, that is the same as that in place in other member states and that seeks to do what is right.  If the Minister does not have an answer to that question, I would appreciate it if the senior officials of his Department who correspond with the committee would follow up with the committee after this meeting confirming that they have read the report and also setting out how this legislation is in line with that report and with other European member state examples.</p></speech>

The threshold that is being used is the appropriate threshold based on the legal advice we have received.  If there are specific points the Deputy would like to raise today in regard to the report, he should by all means do so.  The Deputy referenced the report, not specific points from it.  If there are any points he would like bring into the mix today, he should do so.  I can assure him that the matter has been examined in great detail.  The thresholds set out in the Bill are the appropriate thresholds based on the legal advice to Government.</p></speech>

I still do not understand the situation with regard to the fishing licence holder.  Under this legislation, the fishing licence holder is being forced to retain the penalty points on his or her licence even if the case is cleared in court.  No fair or liberal democracy would allow this.  How are we going to vote this into place?  Do the control agencies have the power to command the captain, skipper or master of the vessel to act against his or her better judgment aboard a vessel he or she commands?  If so, who then has the right to instruct the commander of a fishing vessel, a certified, competent, highly skilled learned person, to act against his or her knowledge, only then to be sanctioned by this system for obstruction?</p></speech>

I refer to the point I made earlier about the requirement for the criminal and civil penalty points systems to be separate.  There was a very indepth examination in regard to the licence holder statutory instrument.  If we are to have a penalty points system which is implementable and effective then it has to stand separate to any criminal proceedings that might arise.  Otherwise, we would not have a system that meets our obligations under the European regulation.</p> <p>  I acknowledge Deputy Mac Lochlainn's earlier comments as well.  In Ireland's case, we also have a reasoned opinion taken against us by the European Commission in regard to our non-application of this regulation.  That reasoned opinion from the Commission sets out the requirements we must fulfill to become compliant.  It is not a consultancy report but the reasoned opinion that threatens enforcement actions against us to force us to comply.  It sets the terms with which we must comply if we are to meet the terms of the regulation.  It is also the key guidance in regard to the legislation before us as well.  </p></speech>

It states that the points system should not result in disproportionate and severe sanctions or the permanent suspension of fishing licences.  In particular, it is seen by some in the industry as an extreme measure and a double sanctioning on top of the national sanctioning system and due consideration should be given to the effectiveness of the sanctioning system.  That is just one of the recommendations.  The Minister can read all of them on pages 185 and 186 of the report.  I totally accept that we are under pressure and that the process of complying with the regulation has taken far too long in Ireland.  The reason for that, in part, is the very strange relationship between the fishing industry and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to these and other matters.  We are the outlier in failing to bring in a system that is proportionate and fair.  This has been done across all member states of the European Union.  The fact that it has not been done here is a reflection of the strange relationship between the industry and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which we have to work on together.</p></speech>

I do not believe anyone can argue that this issue has not been examined in great detail.  I also do not believe that anyone can argue, by virtue of the fact that we do not have a masters penalty points system in place alongside the licensing penalty points system, that we are not putting ourselves in a very challenging position with the European Commission or in terms of protecting our own taxpayer funds owing to the &euro;24 million not paid thus far.  We are at significant risk of losing that if we do not live up to our obligations in terms of compliance with the regulation.  As Minister, I am in contact with the sector at all times and I will continue to be.  I have no doubt that members will agree with me that it is important that we introduce this system and masters legislation; ultimately, the system we introduce has to pass muster in terms of meeting our legal obligations.</p><p>There has been exceptional thought and assessment around the introduction of legislation that will address that issue.  As the Bill moves through the Oireachtas and the committee examines it and continues its deliberations, that is the objective we wish to achieve in the best timeframe possible.

I welcome the representatives of Macra na Feirme: Mr. Tom Duffy, national president; Mr. John Keane, president-elect; Mr. Derrie Dillon, head of policy; Ms Gillian Richardson, policy officer; and Mr. Shane Fitzgerald, chairman of the agricultural affairs committee.  Mr. Duffy is coming to the end of his term as president of Macra na Feirme.  It has been two years well served representing the organisation and the young farmers of Ireland.  I wish Mr. Keane the best of luck in his incoming two years as president.  He is following in a good family tradition of lobbying and fighting for the cause of farmers.  I wish Mr. Duffy and Mr. Keane the best of luck in their future endeavours.</p> <p>  We have received Mr. Duffy's opening statement, which has been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions and the committee has agreed that the opening statement is to be taken as read so that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  I have an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, their participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I invite members to ask questions of the Macra na Feirme delegation.  As I stated, our guests are most welcome.</p></speech>

I commend Mr. Duffy on his role and period as president of Macra na Feirme.  I wish Mr. Keane all the best.

Through our deliberations, all members of the committee agree that if we do not create the conditions to allow young people to enter farming and be sustainable and profitable in that endeavour, the Irish family farm as we know it will not be in place in a generation.  The work of Macra na Feirme is crucial.  The outworkings of the current Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations are pivotal in ensuring that young farmers have a viable avenue into farming.  In that regard, the opening statement provided by Macra na Feirme and its ongoing work are crucial.</p> <p>  I have a few broad questions regarding the current negotiations on CAP.  Does the delegation believe the proposals as they stand and the general thrust of the discussions are fit for purpose in terms of their objectives and priorities?  Do they believe there is scope within the current CAP template to address issues such as the forgotten farmers, for example, and other cohorts that did not receive the supports that were required in the previous CAP?  Will there be a provision within the next round of CAP that will allow the Government to address their particular concerns?  I refer to the issue of the GAEC proposals.  I do not know whether our guests were listening to the committee's deliberations on this issue with other farm organisations last week.  Are the GAEC proposals fit for the challenges that have been outlined?</p> <p>  There is always a balance to be struck between encouraging older farmers to retire and providing the supports that are in place, and encouraging young people to come in and fill that gap.  Do the delegates believe we have the balance right in terms of the policies and financial packages that are in place?  If not, what needs to be done to address that?  What should the committee be proposing to the Department and the European institutions with regard to the next round of CAP that would address the clear deficiencies in terms of the age profile of farmers?</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman, a man from my end of the world, for his kind words.  In a broad way, the negotiations and trialogues are still ongoing, which means there are, essentially, three positions that we have to consider, that is, those of the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament.  From our analysis, the position of the Parliament is the closest to one with which we would agree on two key aspects for young farmers.  First, the Parliament has supported having a minimum of 4% of direct payments for young farmers.  We believe this is essential.  The current allocation of direct payments in Ireland was up to a maximum of 2%.  We commend the Department on having that in place.  However, now is the time to increase the amount of funding that is made available for young farmers under direct payments and Pillar 2 payments.  We may return to that issue shortly.</p> <p>  On the question of the forgotten farmers, but also, more broadly, the many young farmers under the age of 40 who are currently going to be excluded from supports going forward - we have already seen them being excluded from supports - the key area is the so-called five year rule under which supports are primarily focused towards young farmers entering the industry.  We are incredibly supportive of supports for entry into the industry but the issue now, particularly in Ireland where we have seen a change in the entire model of farm succession and planning, is that this directly discourages young farmers who are taking on the role at an earlier stage.  Both I and Mr. Fitzgerald, the chairman of our agricultural affairs committee, are in such a position.  In spite of the fact that we are under the age of 30, we are no longer considered young farmers, going by the Department definition, because we have been farming either as part of a partnership or a joint herd number for more than five years.  The position of the European Parliament is that this should be moved to a minimum of seven years.  That is at least some positive movement to address the situation.</p> <p>  Outside of that, in terms of potential in the current negotiations to address the issue of forgotten farmers who have been farming for more than ten years, unfortunately the only area in which it appears this could be addressed is that of the allocation of the national reserve.</p><p>Again, that ties back into the total allocation of funds under direct payments.  The allocation of direct funds or payments can either go to young farmer top-up, which would only be available under the current proposals for either five or seven years from establishment, or it can be allocated to the national reserve, which would allow sufficient for young farmers and new entrants and potentially for those farmers who are farming longer than that in a so-called third category.  This third category has only been used a single time.  The legislative position is very clear that all demands from young farmers and new entrants have to be satisfied before there can be a third category.</p><p> On GAEC 2, I will try to be brief and run through some of the elements because there is overlap.  Our concerns with GAEC 2 are under two elements.  First, we have seen the definition of what exactly this will change and appropriate management versus protection of wetlands.  This is a significant issue for Ireland because the country has some of the highest organic matter soils.  Second, there is the question about the definition of peatland soils and exactly what that will mean, because there is a variation in Ireland which is not seen in other countries.  We have some drained farmable lands and others with high organic matter.  Then we have the very extreme element, appropriate management of uplands and full peatland or bog-type soils.  This is the essential element.  The question here becomes the appropriate management.  We strongly feel that high nature value farming, which is normally practised on the uplands in these areas, is the most appropriate management to protect these from a biodiversity and carbon protection point of view.  Unfortunately, and this is an element that has been raised, under the biodiversity strategy there is a question about strictly protected definitions of designation.  The strictly protected definitions essentially would block all farming activity.  It would be a very extreme form of designation.  We believe it would be detrimental not only to the rural economy in these areas but also very significantly to the protection of farmland birds and other forms of farmland biodiversity.</p><p> On the balance of support in terms of financial packages, there appears to be a willingness to continue, and we strongly support that.  The young farmer top-up payments have been excellent and a major support.  We would like to see them extended to seven years rather than five.  However, the legislation that is currently under consideration in the negotiations allows for an installation aid type of package.  We have encouraged the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and it has agreed, to assess the potential for that in the CAP strategic plan.  This would be under Pillar 2 funding.  We believe this is significant.</p><p> On the other question that is often raised about older farmers, getting the balance right and encouraging land access, there are no proposals on that at present.  The reason for that and the complexity is that countries vary.  Countries such as Finland and Germany have a designated older farmer pension scheme which has been in place for many years and which provides increased financial support.  When we discussed the appetite for an older farmer retirement scheme or something similar with our members, their major concern has been, and will continue to be, the financial viability of some of those farmers.  We prefer, and we have been a major force for, moving the question away from a succession model into a partnership model, which we find is a far more suitable method for encouraging access to land and with regard to the inheritance of land.</p><p> Thank you, Chairman, for your kind words in welcoming us here today.</p></speech>

It is due to expire on 31 December 2021.  You gave different figures on the stamp duty relief which are interesting.  Is there an issue with the ceiling that exists at present in respect of the availability of stamp duty relief?  Is the ceiling high enough that it is not causing an issue?  Obviously, I will be lobbying for the stamp duty relief to be rolled over again for another three years because it is a very important incentive for young farmers to get land transferred into their names.  In representing young farmers, what do you believe is the position with stamp duty relief and are there any innovations or improvements you would like to see in the relief?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#H00300"><p>There are two elements.  One is that it is absolutely essential to retain stamp duty relief.  That is being considered by the Department of Finance.  That support is vital and the opening statement gives the exact details of how much has been taken up.  However, we have suggested some minor changes to it to encourage what we have called a steeped approach, addressing a set of separate taxation measures which would encourage and support young farmers entering into the system from the beginning.  We feel the extension needs to include succession partnerships - there is currently a cut-off there - and extension up to the age of 40 years, but only where there are additional measures such as taxation relief on the leasing of land to young farmers up to the age of 30 years and limited to five years.  Our logic on this is very clear.  We are seeing a particular issue in the handover of land.  It is a major lifestyle and financial change for many farmers.  Many farmers are asking, essentially, how they can test the water here.  What we have proposed is a measure whereby a farmer might encourage a young person to get on board in a limited way, which would not affect the person's application for both stamp duty relief and the young farmer top-up payment in the future.</p> <p>  In terms of the limit, there are concerns about the limits to state aids.  We engaged with the Department of Finance when this was announced as to whether it would impact on the total lifetime aid which a young farmer could draw down.  There are a small number of farmers who might be affected, who would be inheriting extremely large holdings and also drawing down 100% of grant aid under schemes such as the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, and so forth.  However, we are satisfied at present that, broadly, the stamp duty supports and the other taxation supports should be in line for the European Commission not to raise any objections to them.</p></speech>

It is always a pleasure to work with him.  I also wish Mr. Keane the best in his forthcoming term of office.</p> <p>  I wish to elaborate a little on a couple of matters.  We will all lobby for, and hopefully we will be successful in, getting the extension to the current stamp duty laws.  While they are vital, they are not cash in hand.  They are a net saving.  I refer to where Macra na Feirme would like to see more capital expenditure funding coming on stream.  We are very much aware of building costs.  There is the percentage of funding that is available in TAMS, the capping of expenditure that is allowable to receive TAMS funding and a combination of the percentages that are available to young and older farmers.  Will Mr. Duffy elaborate on that with regard to investment?</p> <p>  Moving on to the partnership company model, while it is a great model and works well in certain areas of the country, there is an element of partnership which will most likely require the enterprise to be in a position to support two families.  This is not feasible everywhere.  I am a Westmeath man and the further north one goes, the smaller are the holdings and enterprises.  While it might work on a large dairy set-up in the south or elsewhere, where there is a steady cash flow, it is not a runner in the majority of cases further north and west in the country.  What is the alternative to that?  What consideration has Macra na Feirme given to, what lobbying has it done for or how would it look on something similar to the old retirement scheme?  If the current farming generation was prepared to step aside to avoid the situation I mentioned where two incomes would be required from the holding, would Macra na Feirme welcome, or what is its opinion on, something similar to the old retirement scheme?</p> <p>  I will conclude on the land mobility scheme that Macra na Feirme piloted or introduced.</p><p>I know Macra is lobbying to get this included under the CAP and to get European support.  How is it going down in Europe?  How is the model being accepted there?  What feedback has the organisation had from Europe on the scheme?  Is it something that could be included in the European model?</p></speech>

I would like to put on record the incredible work of Austin Finn, who is the lead facilitator in that role, and highlight the support we received from sponsors and co-ops to establish the service, including seed funding from FBD early on.  There are two elements to this.  One is the consideration for the entire EU to look at this as a system.  We engaged with groups such as UK Young Farmers, prior to Brexit, which was trying to roll-out a similar model while facing challenges which were unique to themselves.  It will have to be adapted and changed to each country.  Specifically for Ireland we have a clear ask, namely, that there be continued funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - which has been supportive of the service from the very beginning - and to move away from annual support to the entire term of the new CAP, directly supporting the land mobility service under the CAP strategic plan.  We have seen this grow very significantly over time.  I will ask Mr. Dillon or Mr. Duggan to cover some of the key figures around the number of partnerships and arrangements that have been put in place.</p> <p>  On smaller farm holdings and the challenge in that regard, we mentioned this in our opening statement but, unfortunately, the amount of detailed evidence on which we are working is very limited in the context of what interventions have been successful.  The EU's recommendations are still based on 2016, as are its assessments when we know that there have been very significant changes since then such as the young farmers top-ups and the taxation supports we have had in Ireland.  Our best figures for the challenges of young farmers entering the different enterprises come from the national farm sustainability report, which is compiled by Teagasc.  That report shows a very clear delineation.  Sheep and beef farms are significantly higher as a percentage of those who are more than 60 years in the enterprise.  Currently, there are no strict proposals which state that a retirement scheme would be introduced under the CAP.  There are rules in member states such as Finland where you cannot receive single farm payment and a pension at the same time.  There is very little appetite in Ireland and among young farmers, with whom we have discussed this, for such as scheme to be introduced.  The best supporting mechanism may be through the tax code.  That is something that we are working on with the Department, trying to identify potential taxation reliefs that would facilitate farmers who are willing and interested.  The likes of land-leasing taxation reliefs have been significant in allowing farmers to take a step back.  That is the only aspect that we can at the moment.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned geographical spread.  Looking across the country, there is a very clear geographic issue with land fragmentation and farm viability.  It is not simply that many farms do not have the total land needed to become viable without external economic input in the form of a part-time job, it is also that a large number are simply too fragmented to become viable.  That is something that we, through the Land Mobility Service, have been working on and have had very significant success in trying to assist farmers.  The taxation measures which would allow the sale of land without the tax implication to allow farm consolidation is quite significant.</p></speech>

We have facilitated 700 partnerships since the foundation of the service - totalling 55,000 acres of land - where an older farmer may have wished to step back or somewhat retire yet remain involved and they have maintained a stake.  They are not selling the land, it is about shared farming arrangements.  They are all non-familial arrangements.  We tend to stay away from family farm partnerships although we do receive queries on them and we provide information where necessary.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the appetite for the scheme at European level.  To put it in context, we have made a number of presentations to the European Network for Rural Development, which is part of the European Commission.  We have also been part of several Erasmus and European Commission-funded projects, such as the Polish Farm Advisory Service, the University of Bedfordshire in the UK and other European partners which are looking for similar types of solutions, including the National Farmers Union in Northern Ireland and the Ulster Young Farmers, who are working in collaboration on a similar land mobility service.  We have given those two organisations a lot of support in setting up the service in Northern Ireland.  There is an appetite.  It does need a little tweaking from jurisdiction to jurisdiction because of the various different local issues which arise but it is recognised at European level as being a critical tool in the tool box to support generational renewal.  A key tenet of our lobbying, through the European Young Farmer network in the Conseil Europ&eacute;en des Jeunes Agriculteurs, CEJA, and to the Commission, has been to have a mechanism included in the next CAP to support at member state level a land mobility service from member state to member state.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge Macra na Feirme's great input in the social and economic aspects of agriculture in Ireland.  They have had a great input over the past 40-plus years which we should acknowledge.</p> <p>  There are probably three or four questions around how we can ensure that the next CAP will benefit the agriculture industry and hopefully the young farming community.  I spoke to Mr. Dillon some weeks ago about the old young farmer dynamic that has been somewhat forgotten.  It is one of the issues in the CAP that we have to return to talk about how we will ensure that there is a fair, level playing field for the cohort of young farmers who have been missed, for lack of a better word.  That is something that we need to look at in particular in the new CAP in 2023.  How do Mr. Dillon or Mr. Duffy think we could try to work to accommodate this cohort of farmers which unfortunately has been forgotten about?  They are moving into their 40s but still receive relatively low payments, through no fault of their own, merely because circumstances meant they fell between two stools.</p> <p>  I welcome the president's comments about how we can work with our farming community to move land from older to younger generations, particularly the retirement scheme in other countries.  That is a very positive statement.</p><p>The opportunity for the older generation to work off-farm or move away at a certain age is something that such people would welcome.  We need to work with the Department to see what we can do to resume the retirement scheme of 20 years ago that, although successful, was taken off the books for some bizarre reason.  It was a positive scheme that promoted the renewal of the farming community and got young farmers involved at an earlier stage in life.  At that age, they have the potential to make major differences on their holdings whereas someone who takes over a family farm at 35 years of age probably has other commitments and concerns and his or her potential or ability to drive the significant changes required on some holdings is limited.  Progressing a farm retirement scheme is a major issue for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.78" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#K00200"><p>I might invite Mr. Dillon to speak about investment supports in a moment.  We have asked the Department how many of what we would class as young farmers, namely, those under the age of 40 years, have missed out on drawing down as a direct result of the five-year rule.  I do not believe I touched on the question of investment support that Senator Paul Daly raised.  We view it as a significant issue.  Land is not only a capital-intensive business, but also an investment-intensive one.  Many younger farmers who have inherited, purchased or leased land must make a substantial financial investment.  We commend the Department in recognising this under TAMS.  It has been successful and met its limits.  Under the next CAP, however, there must be recognition of the need for all young farmers under the age of 40 years to be able to access some level of funding.  Currently, only those qualifying under the five-year rule can apply for 60%.  The limit of &euro;80,000 on qualifying spend is increased in partnerships, but this touches on the question of gender and the break-up of farms between siblings, which is generally a tragic event.  Currently, if two young farmers enter into a partnership, the limit remains unchanged.  We would like to see it expanded so that as many as possible young farmers who are entering into a partnership can embrace the opportunity.  We would also like to see a third category being made available from 2023 under the legislation, one that lies between 60% and 40% investment support.</p> <p>  The numbers are substantial.  Young farmers are often recognised for their considerable commitment to social sustainability.  In terms of economic sustainability, they have invested &euro;186 million as a direct result of the support they have received under TAMS alone.  That investment was mostly loaded towards the past two years.  We can clearly see that young farmers are the ones making investments on farms and generating economic activity in the wider farm economy.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to Mr. Dillon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derrie Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#K00300"><p>Senator Lombard asked a specific question about old young farmers.  When we were before an Oireachtas committee in June 2015, we outlined specific proposals on a solution to the issue of old young farmers.  Mr. Duffy mentioned the national reserve in the next CAP.  That is the primary mechanism for delivering for old young farmers.  There are two mandatory categories and the potential to introduce an additional category.  However, this is all contingent on us getting a minimum of 4% delivered to young farmers in the next CAP.  If we do not have that level of funding available, the national reserve will, as Mr. Duffy outlined, have to provide for young farmers and new entrants, who comprise the first two categories, before it can provide for other categories.  We had other proposals in the past, but we believe that the best mechanism for delivering for old young farmers is the national reserve in the next CAP.</p> <p>  I wish to make a comment on a point that was made about our proposal in respect of stamp duty relief.  Mr. Duffy outlined the aspects of the proposal.  We propose that the 35-year age limit in respect of stamp duty on general transfers of farms remain but that it increase to 40 years where succession partnerships and the purchase of land by young farmers are concerned.  We would like to see the 35-year age limit for general transfers remain as is because most transfers happen where 34-year-olds are approaching their 35th birthdays and we fear that it would only move five years on to when they were approaching their 40th birthdays were it to change.  There is a cliff edge at 40 years of age when the rate of stamp duty increases to 7.5%.  Perhaps there should be tiering after 40 years of age so that people who just miss that date do not incur the full 7.5%.</p></speech>

Therefore, they have an acute sense of what will be needed.  The witnesses stated that the limitations placed on young farmers' supports directly discriminated against early entry into partnerships.  Will they outline the implications of GAEC 2 and similar measures to do with protected lands?  They referred to how the number of farmers under 35 years of age on uplands and peat soils was significantly lower than the national percentage.  Are decisions being made that would put land use and inheritance or acquisition out of the reach of future generations?</p> <p>  I have spoken to Macra na Feirme about my next point previously and wish to raise it again.  What do our young farmers see when they look at the technology that is currently available in terms of their ability to access and use it?  What are their views on how they are being supported in accessing such technology?</p> <p>  I should have started by welcoming the guests and wishing them all the best.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021042000002#K00500"><p>Regarding peat soils, the average age is substantially higher, particularly in the west and depending on the enterprises involved.  There is no denying that.  Unfortunately, this issue is often not considered in the overall encouragement.  There are investment supports, but many of those are not oriented towards the extensive and high nature value farming that we tend to find on uplands and peat soils.  The young farmers in question are able to benefit from the young farmers top-up payment and so on, but an element that we have consistently raised with the Department in the design of new environmental schemes is that there should be prioritisation and increased ceiling levels for young farmers.  We say this because these schemes have higher uptake rates in so-called disadvantaged areas and areas that are considered marginal.  We have many members in some of those areas who are farming on commonage.  They are progressive and driven young farmers who want to make a living and continue contributing to their local economies and societies.  They are being undervalued and unconsidered.  We have submitted proposals on the successor to GLAS, whatever that may be.</p><p>There should be consideration of higher ceilings for farms or farm partnerships that include someone under the age of 40.  The reason for this is simply that we know these young farmers are more driven and have more desire to do it but often they hit the limits of &euro;10,000 under GLAS and &euro;7,500 under the GLAS plus scheme.  These are the key elements.</p><p> As we have said, the question about the final language in the agreed text will be with regard to protection and appropriate use.  We all agree that appropriate use will look very different on peat soils than on mineral soils.  Nonetheless, the idea of essentially abandoning our hills will not deliver for rural communities.  More importantly, from the perspective of many of the people who are, unfortunately, pushing this idea, it will lead directly to land abandonment, which we know has a major negative impact on the biodiversity of these areas.  If we want to keep the good environmental conditions we have and improve them, we need not only to keep farmers on the land but to get more young farmers onto the hills and peatlands.</p></speech>

It is an honour to be here.  If I could bilocate I would probably sit on this panel every week.  It is great to hear the witnesses, some of whom I have met previously.  They are an inspiration and well done to them on all their work.  I do not know some of the other witnesses as well.</p> <p>  It is probably way outside my league to have a clue about what is being said about older farmers, the grant systems and the payments.  I will not even pretend.  I have a fair idea from my neighbours.  It is something on which the witnesses will be dealing directly with the Minister, I hope.  I will not even pretend to be involved in it in any way.</p> <p>  From my reading of the witnesses, from having met some of them previously and from listening to what they have been saying, I have a couple of questions.  Does Macra regularly meet the IFA at local or national level? Is there much engagement between the two organisations?  How do younger farmers feel about horticulture as a viable option?  I am into diversifying.  My happiest farming neighbours are those doing things slightly differently in some ways.  My sister has a goat farm and several of my neighbours are making a good living out of growing food and employing people on a much smaller holding than many big dairy or beef farmers.  Another friend is creating a glamping site as well as having a bit of dairy on the side.  We have increased funding for horticulture and the number of organic farmers has doubled.  Do the witnesses see this as an important part of where Macra and younger farmers are coming from as well as continuing traditional methods?  I believe in the beef and dairy industries.  We have to give people many choices based on the types of land they have.  We want to keep people on the land as much as possible and make it as viable as possible.</p> <p>  I have seen at first hand many farmers turn to horticulture, creating far more viable incomes for themselves and creating jobs.  A couple of my friends grow food on 30 acres and employ 15 people full-time.  My sister is on 50 acres and has ten staff.  The job creation side of it is huge and the farmers do not seem to have to borrow as much money as big dairy or big beef farmers.  I am interested in this side of things.  I am from Clare where we do not have hugely intensive farming so I am biased that way.  I am putting myself in a little box.  I would like to work with the witnesses more on this and engage with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, more on it also.  She is a midlands farmer with good land.  I am more concerned about subsistence farmers, small farmers and uphill farmers.  I look forward to hearing from the witnesses again on this.  It might not be appropriate for them to answer all of these questions today but we can take it out of the meeting, which is probably why I am here.  I thank the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

We engage with all of the other farm organisations fairly regularly and we are in communication with most of them and discuss various proposals.  We have independence within our organisation, as do the other farm organisations, and we try to work together for common goals.  Certainly when it comes to young farmers we do not shy away from demanding what needs to be demanded in CAP and under other supports.</p> <p>  Horticulture is a very complicated industry, not primarily because of the production method but because of market access, which is a major obstacle for many people.  We do have young farmers who are involved in the horticulture sector but it is a very regional approach, primarily based on some of the best land in Meath and Louth with diversification.</p> <p>  On the question of diversification, the key area from where we would see support coming is under Pillar 2 of the LEADER funding for diversification and processing of on-farm product to try to capture more of the value in the supply chain.  Areas with which the Senator is more familiar, which are outside prime farmland but have high levels of tourist flow, would see major benefits.  An example is the Tipperary food project, with which the Chair is familiar.  It has added value and it has been very successful.</p> <p>  Our major concerns around some of the language focused on horticulture is that in reality it needs to be farmer driven.  Farmers know their land better than anyone else.  For instance, I know my land is simply not suitable for cultivation over the longer term.  It would lead to degradation of the soil.  Senator Daly and Deputy Carthy are familiar with similar soils.  Ultimately, they cannot be continuously cultivated.  There is potential here and we support any measure that could return greater benefit to the farm.  On this topic, I would like to hand over to the president-elect, Mr. John Keane, on the aspect of the food regulator.  It is something on which he has had a keen focus.</p></speech>

To pick up on the issue touched on by the Senator regarding horticulture and adding value, how the food regulator plays a role in terms of returning value to the farmer in the food chain is key.  If we look at the issues and challenges our young farmers have brought to us, in particular with regard to what the Senator has raised regarding the horticulture industry, access to the market and the small nature of the retailers in the breakdown of the market have been highlighted as issues many times.  It is something on which the food regulator must play a role.  As Mr. Duffy has said, it must be farmer driven and farmer oriented.</p> <p>  With regard to other industries that play a role, I would not necessarily agree with the Senator that bigger dairy or beef enterprises do not necessarily have a role to play in employment or value.</p></speech>

Our priority is ensuring that there is a strong definition of "active farmer".  We have engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on matters such as minimum stocking densities and minimum cropping densities which would be appropriate in that regard and which would allow for such a definition.</p> <p>  There are certainly concerns that while we move to a more productive and environmentally-focused area that this situation could encourage an abandonment of land and, indeed, increase the number of farmers not actively involved in appropriate land management.  As we have said, it is going to be a different form of land management depending on whether people are in Cavan, Laois or Tipperary.  That is our key priority regarding that aspect.</p> <p>  Turning to the subject of capping, I will hand over to Mr. Dillon and he will run through some of the key aspects in that regard.  I apologise, I omitted Senator Paul Daly's query on the agrifood strategy.  Yes, we certainly find it a very challenging document concerning some of the elements it has proposed.  We engaged throughout the process and, indeed, we gained key commitments regarding the role of young farmers, particularly concerning increasing the percentage of young farmers and moving towards a continuous professional development model, which we trialled through our Skillsnet programme, and developing a network for young farmers for recognition of their education, which is a key element.  </p> <p>  The main aspect getting a great deal of focus is the 10% biogenic methane reduction target.  We will not mince words.  It is an incredibly challenging target for the industry to try to meet by 2030.  If it is to be achieved, we will need to see major supports for the industry to adopt practice change and in that respect we are looking at the likes of the management of the national beef and dairy herds.  In dairy, we know that extending lactations is a very successful way of reducing the number of replacements.  Turning to the beef herd, changes in that area would include reducing the age at slaughter.  Unfortunately, we have seen the age of slaughter increase as we have seen the increase in the percentage of dairy calves entering the beef sector.  </p> <p>  We have welcomed the support for initiatives such as the sexed semen lab, which will allow higher quality beef semen to be used on the dairy herd and that will have a direct impact.  As I said, it is still a very challenging situation.  Regarding enteric methane, we simply do not have the silver bullet that other industries have available to us, such as moving to electric or renewable energies.  We are some way from having market-viable feed additives.  What we need to do in reality, therefore, is to look at what we have.  Macra na Feirme has a position on the Ag Climatise document.  We feel it is the appropriate roadmap, but we would like to see greater ambition in some targets, such as 100% of the herd being milk recorded and 100% of the national beef and dairy herds genotyped.  Those are ambitious targets to set, but they are a way in which we can achieve this ambition.  </p> <p>  We remain opposed to any limits on the national herds and certainly any mandatory calling.  That is our position on the simple basis that any attempt at mandatory culling or herd limits will be fundamentally unjust.  How could anybody figure out which herds are to be cut and what should be the percentages?  Ultimately, such an approach would lead directly to lower farm viability and have a massive negative backlash.  We are concerned about such a potential backlash from the farming sector and rural communities more generally against the climate action to which we are committed.  I will hand over to Mr. Dillon now to comment on our position on convergence and capping.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Dillon to send the information to us, with an explanatory footnote, so that we will have the thoughts of the members of Macra na Feirme.  We will then circulate that information to the members of the committee.  This is going to become a contentious issue in the weeks and months ahead.  We have a policy meeting this evening which Senator Daly and I will be attending, and I would appreciate it if Mr. Dillon could send us that document before then so we can have a read of it.</p></speech>

I thank the representatives from Macra na Feirme for giving us their perspective on this important issue.  The organisation's chief executive contacted me some days ago and it worked out better that the witnesses had a slot of one hour to themselves this morning.  While Macra na Feirme co-operates fully with the other farming organisations, it obviously has a different focus on policy because it represents young farmers in particular.  It was most useful therefore to have had this separate session with the witnesses this morning.  I reiterate that I wish Mr. Duffy the best after his two years as president of Macra na Feirme, and I am sure he will not be gone entirely from representing farmers.  I also wish Mr. Keane the best in his two years as the incoming president of the organisation.  I thank everyone for their engagement and we look forward to working together in future.</p></speech>

I remind them that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  Today we are considering the loan guarantee schemes agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Bill 2021.  Recently, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, wrote to the Business Committee seeking an exemption of the normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements, given the urgency to have the Bill enacted by mid-May 2021.  The general scheme of the Bill has been drafted to comply with advice received from the Office of the Attorney General on 19 March 2021 that legislation is required to provide the necessary powers for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into an agreement with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to implement loan guarantee schemes for SMEs and small mid-caps, including many primary producers.  The legislation must be enacted by mid-May if the scheme is to go ahead in time to provide support to businesses that face the twin disruptions of Brexit and Covid-19.  The request of the Minister to the Business Committee for a waiver of pre-legislative consideration has been passed on to this committee to give our opinion on the request.  Following this meeting, we are required to communicate this opinion to the Business Committee to allow it to decide on the waiver application.</p> <p>  To brief the committee on the Bill and the case for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, I am pleased to welcome from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Declan Hughes, assistant secretary, Ms Fiona Kilcullen, principal officer, and Dr. Elizabeth Harvey, assistant principal.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and to the practice of the Houses as regards reference that may be made to others when witnesses are giving evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  Today's witnesses, however, are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If, therefore, witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Mr. Hughes's opening statement has been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite him to make his opening remarks on behalf of the Department.</p></speech>

In order to meet the pressing need for finance by Brexit-impacted SMEs, small mid-caps and primary producers, this new scheme will need to be fully operational by the end of quarter 2 of this year, as the Chairman mentioned.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Fiona Kilcullen, principal officer and head of the Department&rsquo;s finance for growth unit, and Dr. Elizabeth Harvey, assistant principal in the unit.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been working with Brexit-impacted businesses since 2016 to ensure we have the right range of supports in place at the right time to help businesses adjust to Brexit eventualities.  Before commenting on the specifics of the Bill, I will provide a general outline of the plans for a new Brexit-focused loan scheme.  Loan guarantee schemes continue to be a key instrument for providing help to vulnerable but viable businesses impacted by the effect of Covid-19, Brexit or both.  Since the start of the pandemic, close to &euro;931 million in lending has been sanctioned to more than 8,000 businesses through State-backed loan guarantee schemes operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The results from the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s bank lending survey from January 2021 indicated that 2021 will see increased demand for business lending for both guaranteed and unguaranteed loans, with the increase in demand for guaranteed loans expected to be larger, as businesses navigate the uncertain and difficult times and as the parameters governing the schemes evolve.</p> <p>  Introducing the Brexit impact loan scheme, BILS, which provides for easier access to a wider range of financing needs for Brexit-impacted SMEs and small mid-caps, including primary producers, which were not included in the previous scheme, will ensure that appropriate access to finance options will remain available for SMEs over 2021 and 2022 at least, beyond the lifetime of the credit guarantee scheme, which is allowed by the European Commission only until the end of this year.  It is intended to help viable but vulnerable businesses respond to the liquidity challenges presented by both the Brexit and Covid disruptions, ultimately helping them to sustain their operations and employment. </p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment is being asked to provide a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny for the general scheme of the Bill, which is intended to provide a statutory basis for the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to engage with the SBCI on the new scheme and on future loan guarantee schemes to be delivered by the SBCI, and to enable us to benefit from the European guarantee fund.  It is a short, technical Bill with a narrow scope, relating to a technical agreement that the Ministers will need to sign with the SBCI, rather than with the European Investment Fund, EIF, by the end of May 2021 in order for the BILS to be delivered by the end of quarter 2.  The new Brexit scheme will leverage a counter-guarantee by the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s pan-European guarantee fund, to which Ireland is a contributing member and which will be of benefit from the funding to which we are contributing.  Based on financial modelling, the effect of this guarantee for the BILS will be to make up to &euro;330 million in lending available by the end of 2022 at an Exchequer cost of &euro;29 million, and this relates to a multiplier effect of greater than a factor of ten for the Exchequer in terms of the money flowing.</p><p>This means that we will be able to leverage and much of the guarantee is coming from European sources.<br/><br/>In considering the legal basis for a new scheme and how the Minister might progress such a scheme, advice was sought from the Attorney General.  The Department is satisfied that it is appropriate to provide for the specific <i>vires</i>in legislation and to provide a statutory basis for relevant Ministers to fund and enter into future agreements with SBCI for the purpose of facilitating access to finance for qualifying enterprises.<br/><br/>The intention is to be fully operational by the end of the second quarter.  We mentioned at the beginning why there is some pressure on this.  There are several processes we have to work through to have it launched in time.  The first is to have an open call and assessment of the applications by lenders.  We would go out to a range of banks and financial institutions to participate in the scheme.  Legal agreements have to be developed between the European Investment Fund and SBCI, between SBCI and lenders to the scheme and between SBCI and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Bill would enable this.  Information technology systems need to be put in place as well.<br/><br/>The Brexit impact loan scheme, as proposed, provided for lending to enable diversification of businesses in response to, and to mitigate, the impacts of Brexit and Covid-19.  SMEs and small mid-capitalisation companies, including primary producers, will now be included and can utilise lending through the scheme for activities aimed at addressing climate change challenges and other opportunities.  Funding through the Brexit loan scheme can also be utilised for purposes which yield environmental benefit but which are, under normal lending conditions, less attractive to lenders due to longer return-on-investment periods.<br/><br/>The proposed legislation will also enable Ministers to separately or jointly enter into future agreements with the SBCI and provide the necessary financial support thereunder, with the purpose of providing policy responses to identified market failures in access to finance for SMEs, including primary producers and small mid-caps.<br/><br/>Today, we are focusing on Brexit but we have headroom to enter into further agreements in other areas.  In particular this will allow Ministers the opportunity to act quickly to enter into agreements with the SBCI to leverage further European funding that is, or that becomes, available to Ireland through European-funded guarantee facilities.<br/><br/>The legislation must be enacted by mid-2021 if the scheme is to go ahead in time to provide support to Brexit and Covid-19 impacted SMEs, including primary producers and small mid-caps that are grappling with the twin disruptions of Brexit and Covid-19.  On behalf of the Department, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present and I look forward to engaging in the discussion.</p></speech>

I do not like the practice of waiving pre-legislative scrutiny as a general rule.  I fully appreciate, however, that it is necessary from time to time.  I hope this is not a practice that develops because, unfortunately, in the context of one of the committees I was on in the previous D&aacute;il, it became an unfortunate practice and led to some friction.</p> <p>  Some of the schemes that the Government is administering with regard to this legislation have a far higher take-up rate than others.  There is a sense from SMEs and family-run businesses that if there is engagement with them before the schemes are launched, then the schemes can be fit for purpose before they go out.</p> <p>  Is the Department confident that this is the right scheme at the right time?  Does this legislation give the Minister the freedom to be able to tweak the schemes and adapt them as they go on?  I fully appreciate the need to have them ready.  I fully appreciate the need for us to assist with getting this done quickly.  Has there been engagement with the people who those of us sitting here in Dublin 2 believe will benefit or potentially benefit from this?  Does the legislation give the Minister the scope to be able to adapt the schemes as time goes on and the ability to tweak them in the interests of ensuring that the people who need them actually benefit from them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#B00400"><p>My thanks to Deputy O'Reilly.  We have probably discussed this on previous occasions at the committee.  Certainly, there are some dimensions I am keen to highlight.  My colleagues might want to come in as well.</p> <p>  The first point relates to the demand side.  We know that with regard to Brexit we are in a strange situation where many of the impacts are still working their way through.  Businesses are working out what to do in terms of dealing with the additional cost of trade with Great Britain and the additional logistics costs relating to direct supply into Europe, etc.  There are also investment costs relating to the need to change or diversify to new markets and address climate change challenges as well.</p> <p>  On the demand side, we have indications from the Central Bank and from our engagement with the State bodies group that meets across all the suppliers in respect of SBCI, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and Enterprise Ireland.  We are confident that this scheme is at a level that will be needed in the coming months.</p> <p>  The second part relates to businesses.  One of the key issues is that businesses are reluctant to borrow at the moment in view of the level of uncertainty in Great Britain and in the domestic economy.  We have been hearing in respect of the Brexit loan scheme that, because the funding was guaranteed by the European Investment Fund's InnovFin facility, there was an innovation criterion.  At one level it related to anything that businesses were going to invest.  The point was that investment would have to go into diversifying or being innovative.  That was a test and an issue that kept coming up with businesses and representative bodies.  We have an SME and state bodies group where this point was specifically raised.  Essentially, we will not have that criterion in future.  We are dropping it because it comes from the European Guarantee Fund.  The only criteria are in respect of the business having an exposure directly or indirectly.  The business may not be trading directly with GB but some customers may be and they may be exposed.  This may apply to businesses in the tourism sector or primary producers supplying a dairy company that is ultimately supplying the GB market.  It may apply to a business importing as well.  We have covered off maximum flexibility with the fund.  They are the criteria.</p> <p>  There is a second element we have heard.  Brexit has been happening since 2016 and we have been trying to get businesses prepared.  Some are working through what were three-year schemes.  We have now managed to extend this from three years to six years.  One key requirement for businesses is that they work through the next year and the uncertainty.  Moratoriums relating to this can be negotiated with the banks.  A six-year period will allow businesses to work through the implications.</p> <p>  We will also have provision for refinancing.  If there are already some loans that are on two or three years and are coming near the end, they can be refinanced.  Again, that is something businesses have looked for in light of the uncertainty.  Covid-19 has compounded the uncertainty relating to Brexit.  We have also included another feature that was not included in the previous Brexit schemes relating to primary producers.  Some of our other schemes that relate to horticulture businesses and others that are labour-intensive and are exposed were not included in the schemes so we have included those in this scheme.  Another point is that flexibility on loan rates can be offered.  We hope that, on the basis of what we have done with the credit guarantee scheme whereby we have brought in several other finance providers, including the credit unions, we would be able to increase the number of participants.  This would broaden the range of financial providers available to impacted businesses.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question, I would say we have been listening and we have certainly tried to maximise the flexibility of this scheme.  Moreover, I believe we have sufficient headroom over the coming two years.  This goes beyond the EU temporary aid framework that expires at the end of this year.  We would then have this facility into next year.</p> <p>  The final question was whether we have sufficient headroom with this Bill.  We are asking, with the committee's agreement, that we provide for &euro;50 million to negotiate deals with the European Investment Fund and the European Guarantee Fund.  The point is to get the &euro;330 million fund up and running and we would use &euro;29 million in this regard.  We will have further headroom to introduce further schemes as either Minister or both together may see fit.</p><p>If we need to expand it in future, we would have the room to do that.</p></speech>

The essential role the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland plays is clear.  It has provided &euro;1 billion in bank loan guarantee schemes to 8,000 businesses since the start of the pandemic.  I note from the information provided that, despite last year's high figures, there is expected to be an increase in demand for the scheme this year.  How much of that increased demand is Covid-related and how much is Brexit-related?  The recent expansion of lending beyond retail banks is welcome and relevant.  I note it involves 19 credit unions, spread between three groups and non-bank lenders.  In light of developments in recent weeks, this is particularly welcome.  What is the Department's view on further expansion in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#C00300"><p>The &euro;330 million we envisage for Brexit will be essential this year for dealing with its impact.  As the Senator said, the lending and borrowing requirements are likely to be significantly higher.  When the credit guarantee scheme was introduced in the autumn of last year, it was initially for &euro;2 billion.  To date, just under &euro;300 million has been drawn down.  There are applications for significantly more than that.  There probably still is capacity for between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1.7 billion over the coming months.  We think there certainly would be a high demand for that in the context of reopening.  Many businesses that will need additional working capital, investment and so forth will be looking for five-year to six-year money which will be available from the credit guarantee scheme.  Between the two schemes, we have close to &euro;2 billion available this year.  As the economy reopens, that is what we envisage is needed.</p> <p>  On the demand side, there are different groups of companies which will need alternative sources of funding.  From a Covid perspective, we would see high demand from retail and wholesale businesses, as well as tourism, hospitality and personal services, as they begin to reopen.  They will need access to medium-term money such as five-year to six-year terms at low cost.  Many providers are at or below the 3% rate which is very competitive from a Covid perspective.  This gives these businesses time then to work through their new business sustainment plans and reopening.</p> <p>  On the Brexit side, we are also dealing with some of those businesses which would be dependent, for example, on foreign earnings.  This would involve tourists coming in but also engineering businesses trading with the UK, food processors and companies, along with education and fintech services.  We are picking off the broad base of enterprise between the Covid and Brexit schemes.  They are not exclusive either.  For example, in Enterprise Ireland's base of companies, 1,500 businesses are Brexit exposed but between 200 and 300 are both Brexit and Covid exposed.  They will have joint exposure to the domestic market, as well as to Brexit.  We do not want them applying twice.  We want them to be able to come in with a business plan and access either the Covid credit guarantee scheme or the new Brexit impact loan scheme.</p> <p>  We will be in a position to expand the scheme further.  That is why we have the headroom initially for up to &euro;50 million.  We are running with the &euro;330 million and then we will see what other mechanisms and schemes might be needed over time.  Other Departments may well be looking at the legislation to see how it might be utilised.  For example, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, it might be used to deal with climate action or other measures which might be useful.</p></speech>

We work closely with and it is a mandate we have given to SBCI to ensure it is working with the broadest range of providers.  Significant work has gone in over the past year with the credit unions in terms of assessment of their loan books, capability, capacity assessment, etc.  We are pleased we have an increasing number of credit unions participating in the Covid credit guarantee scheme and lending out to businesses.  That is a route on which we will continue.</p> <p>  SBCI has a key role in helping to develop the capacity of the credit unions to work with SMEs.  We obviously do so as well.  Many of the credit unions would have a good reputation around the country in working with small businesses and microbusinesses.  The issue is how can we support and scale that.  These guarantee schemes are an important mechanism for doing that.</p> <p>  Microfinance Ireland works alongside the credit unions across the country.  This would be for those businesses which cannot get access to credit from the other financial institutions.  We are trying to develop the broadest mix of finance providers to ensure microbusinesses and SMEs have access to the finance they need.</p></speech>

People are taking on the climate change challenge, looking to diversify their markets and introduce new technologies.  There may be a role for combining lending with some developmental advice or access to programmes.  Is the assessment of need entirely left to the bankers or is there any attempt by the Department to look at the context of viable and feasible development strategies?</p> <p>  Are there any loss expectations with this loan book or in the context of the guarantee?  Is our exposure limited in all cases to the figure quoted of &euro;29 million?  We are entering a period of uncertainty.  What happens if losses are worse?</p> <p>  Is the Department still doing the SME survey of attitudes to borrowing and lending, as well as the experience with lending institutions?</p><p>It used to be available and gave an insight into the needs and attitudes of borrowers as well as the needs and attitudes of lenders.  It was useful for policy purposes.  I have not seen one for some time, but I have been out of the swim of that activity.  I am interested in knowing whether it is still available.</p></speech>

For example, we initially limited the pillar banks to nearly one third of the first tranche of the credit guarantee scheme.  We then tried to get other finance providers, including the credit unions, to participate.  We did that to ensure that not all of the funding was cornered or taken by the pillar banks and to increase competition.  We have taken a similar approach to lender allocation in the future growth loan scheme.  We have the flexibility to reallocate if finance is not being used or drawn down or if any sort of market playing is happening.  Our intention is to help make the market increase participation, drive lending and drive down costs.  The future growth loan scheme was the first product that brought in ten-year money at below 4%, which is what indigenous enterprises needed in terms of low margins.  We are taking a similar approach to the new Brexit impact loan scheme.  The next step is to go out and determine the level of interest from lenders in the market, how best to allocate and what quota might be applied.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about development advice.  One of the key lessons from the past year has been the importance of providing help to businesses in terms of business continuity and business sustainment planning and providing mentoring for them in advance of making applications for finance.  Advice came to us strongly from the Credit Review Office about ensuring that the business plans answered the right questions and were sustainable before they were submitted to the bank.  Enterprise Ireland provides a &euro;5,000 financial planning grant, which has been helpful to businesses in mapping out their medium to long-term development.  It has helped with the drawing down or preparation of applications to the sustaining enterprise fund, under which a current provision of &euro;200 million is being administered.  Similarly, more than 10,000 business continuity vouchers were issued by local enterprise offices, LEOs, by the end of last year.  In the first couple of months, they were drawn down to help businesses prepare business sustainment plans so that they could access funding.  Microfinance Ireland provides a reduction of 1% in the interest rate for businesses that come through LEOs.  There is a standard rate of, I believe, just over 5%.  It is reduced by 1% to 4% or 4.5% for a business that comes through an LEO.  The business gets access to a mentor, professional advice and so on, which helps it to ensure it has a plan that is sustainable in the longer term.</p> <p>  Digital and climate are complex areas.  With Enterprise Ireland and LEOs, the T&aacute;naiste just launched a new &euro;10 million green enterprise fund.  It will help to provide advice and strategic planning capacity to micro and small businesses to prepare climate adjustment plans that include their investment needs and assessments of technology.  Major uncertainties for businesses revolve around what the best technologies are, what is appropriate for their business, what markets are they going to and how they can finance that.  Financial planning supports are available and we hope to support approximately 850 businesses with them this year.  We are open to suggestions about how we might proceed with that.</p> <p>  Regarding loss expectations, it is capped.  We are utilising the European Guarantee Fund, EGF, for 56%.  Another 24% is the State's, but it is capped at &euro;29 million.  As with previous guarantees, there is a fair distribution between what the EGF and the State are providing, but also what the banks are providing, given that they will have skin in the game as well and will hence be judicious in their assessments.</p> <p>  Regarding attitudes towards borrowing, the key issue before Covid was that businesses were in deleveraging mode.  We had seen a decrease in the refusal rates, but there was still a reluctance to borrow.  During the early part of the crisis, there was a significant increase in facilities being opened or requested by businesses but not subsequently drawn down.  For six months of last year - essentially from April or May to October or November - nearly 30,000 businesses had loan breaks with their banks.  Most of those breaks have now been worked through and businesses are coming back.  We are seeing more modest levels of borrowing in the credit guarantee scheme.  These are more essential levels of borrowing.  The average loan is approximately &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000.  Our initial budgeting expectation was that it would be similar to the future growth loan scheme at approximately &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000, but the feedback we are getting is that businesses are taking out just enough to see them through until they get certainty about reopening.  The facility will be available to them to come back to those lenders as they look to reopen.  That is the research and feedback we are getting from the Central Bank.  As the economy reopens, there will be a need for increased liquidity for working capital and investment finance to meet the expected increase in demand in the recovery.  Perhaps Dr. Harvey or Ms Kilcullen wish to comment on the issue of demand.</p></speech>

There is also the Department of Finance's credit demand survey.  They point in the same direction in that due to uncertainty over Covid-19 and Brexit, businesses are not borrowing.  Indeed, some have been approved for loans but are waiting to reopen before they draw them down.</p> <p>  Surveys are taking place.  The credit demand survey was recently carried out by the Department and published in November.  The Central Bank of Ireland has published its recent report as well.  It shows an expectation of a large increase in demand from SMEs for borrowing in the second half of this year.</p></speech>

In one sense, however, this is pre-legislative scrutiny, given that we are discussing the Bill.</p> <p>  I will ask one or two brief questions.  Mr. Hughes told us that since the start of the pandemic, &euro;931 million had been sanctioned.  How much of that has been drawn down?  He stated that amount was across 8,000 businesses.  That would be &euro;116,000 on average if my math is correct.  Of the overall 230,000 SMEs, 8,000 seems a small number.  That might be a good thing and mean that SMEs are not under any pressure, but as Mr. Hughes noted, many businesses are reluctant to take out extra borrowings and pressure in that regard.</p> <p>  For the purpose of this Bill, how does the Department define SMEs?  It is probably the usual definition, but the witnesses might put it on the record.</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton touched on the repayment situation.  I note that loans are repayable after three years, six years and so on.  Will the witnesses say more about when businesses will be expected to repay?  If they are still under pressure in future, might there be rollovers or what other kinds of relief could they get?</p> <p>  It was stated that 137,000 farmers had a combined output of &euro;8 billion in 2019.  I believe the horticultural sector in particular was mentioned.</p><p>Can Mr. Hughes give us an indication of the demand for loans such as these from the agricultural and horticultural communities?  What kinds of pressures are they are under?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#E00200"><p>My colleagues can clarify the figures with regard to the drawdown book.  We have seen very significant drawdown from both the future growth loan scheme and from the credit guarantee scheme.  As I said, more than &euro;250 million was drawn down from the latter scheme and almost &euro;600 million was drawn down from the former scheme.  I will ask my colleagues to comment on that.</p> <p>  I might just deal with the other issues regarding SMEs and mid-caps.  Our definition of SMEs includes micro, which employ fewer than ten people, and SMEs, which employ fewer than 250 people.  For the record, we have also included mid-caps, which are businesses with fewer than 499 employees.  Using European definitions, we have very good coverage in terms of the SME base.</p> <p>   One of the key objectives of the payment schedules was to try to lengthen the time of the loans.  For example, lending under the credit guarantee scheme is for up to six years.  Similarly, we wanted to extend the Brexit impact loan scheme as far as we could beyond three years.  We can go out to six years now, which will be welcomed by many businesses.  There will also be options for the usual moratoriums on repayments, repayment schedules, etc.  We have seen that flexibility in many of the schemes.  It is being negotiated by the banks with their borrowers and they are obviously kept under continuous review.  The only point the banks always make to us is that it is key that the borrowers maintain contact with their lender in order that they can continue to ensure they are agreeing schedules of repayment and there are no surprises.</p> <p>  On the horticultural and agricultural side, we have been working for a number of years now on this joint initiative with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  All our initiatives on the guarantee side are generally jointly negotiated with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and jointly funded by the two Departments.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine generally has specific quotas for primary producers, which can be up to 20% or 30% marginal value, MV, for the food sector and maybe up to 40%.  They can mix in terms of their contribution between the processors and the primary producers.  We know the processors and consumer food companies have spent a number of years preparing.  The Deputy may be aware, for example, of Carbery Group Limited in west Cork, which took the significant strategic decision two years ago to invest in mozzarella production.  We spent a lot of time getting the EU approval for that &euro;78 million investment.  The company commenced production of mozzarella for the Asian market before Christmas.  Obviously, that helps to sustain farm families right across west Cork.  Similarly, after Christmas we launched a new &euro;100 million competitiveness and market diversification fund for the meat and dairy sectors to help improve their competitiveness but also to respond on the climate action side.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise Ireland, together with Bord Bia, are also working with the horticultural sector to help with diversifying its markets.  Whether it is fruit and vegetable producers or mushroom and other producers, the sector is probably better prepared for Brexit than it was for some of the previous crises it had to deal with in terms of companies changing their supply chains, improving their competitiveness and looking at alternative markets and how they can adjust to them.  These companies have been hit twice in the past year, by Covid-19 and Brexit.  This scheme will help the sector with short-term working capital needs and also investment plans as companies seek to increase value added and the innovation of their products so they can continue to compete in Britain and also find alternative markets.  I ask Ms Harvey or Ms Kilcullen to comment on the data side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Kilcullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#E00300"><p>I will mention a few points on repayments for SMEs and moratoriums.  Looking at the figures, and Ms Harvey can follow on from this, loans to the value of &euro;900 million have been drawn so far.  This includes agriculture primary producers.  Many of the schemes contain features that allow for moratoriums.  Under the credit guarantee scheme, for example, payment breaks of up to a year, including interest repayments and principal, can be given to people who have loans if they find themselves in difficulties.  Further forbearance is allowed after that within the scheme.  We are hearing so far that very few borrowers have availed of that.  It is welcome that this capacity is available if needed.</p> <p>  On farmers and fishers, there has been a good level of uptake of the credit guarantee scheme in the primary agriculture sector, particularly for dairy.  There are 407 loans in dairy, 189 in other farming and fisheries has also seen a good level of activity.  For those we are here to discuss today, bringing the primary producers and farmers into that scheme would be extremely beneficial for those who are Brexit impacted because the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is particularly for Covid.  The Brexit impact loan scheme would, therefore, be extremely beneficial to primary producers and farmers as they cannot avail of the current scheme for Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#E00500"><p>I thank our guests.  I have a couple questions for Mr. Hughes.  He said loan terms under the Brexit impact loan scheme are a minimum of three years extending to six years and that loans can be refinanced.  What happens when borrowers reach the end of the six-year period?  Do they have any guarantees with respect to the rate of interest at which they might refinance?  Is it a market rate or will it be a supported rate?</p> <p>  How will companies that have availed of this year's warehousing of debt be treated under the extensions to the Covid-19 support and Brexit impact schemes in terms of accessing additional funding?  Are companies that are already approved under the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the Covid-19 business aid scheme, CBAS, treated differently or is this looked at as separate financing under these applications?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#E00600"><p>What I was referring to regarding the refinancing is that businesses with current loan facilities and borrowing can refinance those with this scheme.  It would be too early to say what would happen at the end of the six-year period.  I think most of the loans would be on a schedule for repayment of capital interest, depending on the schedule, after six years.  Prior to the future growth loan scheme, the banks already had arrangements in place where they were providing five-year loans and had agreements on how the loans might be rolled over.  Some of those would, therefore, be commercial arrangements.  Our intention, working with the lenders, is that in cases involving three-year money coming to the end of the term this year that needs to be refinanced for a longer period, borrowers will get access to this guarantee at competitive rates and on better terms.  I hope that is helpful to the Deputy.</p> <p>  On the warehousing of debt and the CRSS and CBAS, those payments are essentially contributions to the fixed costs of any business in receipt of them.  The Government has indicated that those payments will be available until the end of June.  There will not be a cliff edge.  Obviously, it is too early to say what will happen there.  The business plans that would be developed by any business will obviously take account of what they have benefited from to date and then project forward.</p><p>Last year, businesses were submitting applications to the banks with a number of scenarios.  That would be the normal sensitivity testing which would be done by the banks, in terms of saying remain open and demand recovers this year or next year, but assessing what might happen if there was a further shock.  The track record has been that the Government has stepped in to provide the necessary supports for employees through the wage subsidy scheme as well as to cover fixed costs with the CRSS and the SBASC.  I expect any warehousing of debt and repayments would be part of the scheduling and the financial planning which would be built in.  The Revenue Commissioners have issued guidance as to when some of those liabilities will fall due.  They are open to engagement and that would feature as part of the financial planning.</p><p> As Deputy Bruton mentioned, there is financial advice available to businesses.  We encourage businesses, and certainly microbusinesses, that are trying to work through those financial plans at this stage and are looking forward 12 and 18 months and looking at the financial projections to engage with their local enterprise office, and if they had a mentor last year or they had somebody to engage with through the business continuity scheme to engage with them again.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has similar support, as well as Enterprise Ireland.  Certainly, they should get good advice, as many businesses have done.  That has helped to sustain businesses over the last year, in that they put good business financially sustainable plans in place with their financial projections.  If the Deputy seeks further detail on that, I am happy to refer back to him.</p></speech>

Mr. Hughes spoke about primary producers.  He is probably aware of the issues in milk production at present with regard to Glanbia.  The latter had entered an agreement to build a cheese factory which was going to have a sizable uptake in milk capacity.  It is held up now by a judicial review being progressed by An Taisce.  The result is that Glanbia farmers, primary producers, are now being written to saying, in effect, that quotas are back.  This is putting many farmers who have been scaling up in the last four years into extreme financial difficulty because their projections have been completely upended.  Many of them are being put in a reference milk supply dating back to three years ago.  Is there any facility whereby Glanbia, for example, could make an application to this scheme in terms of supporting farmers who are caught in these difficulties?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#F00300"><p>I know that Glanbia worked with SBCI previously and with their suppliers on their financing needs.  I am aware that it is working with them on trying to set out production schedules, quota and so forth as well.  It is all about contingency planning.  Certainly, if there are ideas there for this or for other mechanisms, the inclusion of primary producers would mean that the farm enterprises the Deputy refers to could certainly benefit from it.  It is quite complex in terms of producing at lower prices and so forth.  It is an unfortunate situation, but the facilities are available.</p></speech>

Does Deputy Stanton wish to contribute again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#F00500"><p>I agree with what Deputy Shanahan said in respect of the Glanbia situation.  It is impacting businesses in my area too.  Even though it has gone through all the planning issues along the way it is still being held up.  That brings us to the issue of planning laws in Ireland and the fact that enterprise can be delayed <i>ad nauseam</i>.  That can have an impact on foreign direct investment here as well, which is something we should take into account.</p><p>I have a question for Mr. Hughes and his colleagues.  The small enterprises that have been affected more than any others are small retailers.  There has been talk about click and collect starting shortly and so forth, but many of these small businesses have been closed for quite some time.  With retailers in particular, some of their stock is season-dependent.  They have summer stock and then they must get rid of that in the sales in the winter.  Then they bring in the winter stock and they get rid of that in the sales in the spring.  They have not been able to do that, so their cash flow has been impacted.  On top of that, in recent days we have heard reports that some of the large multiples have been selling stock such as shoes, clothes and so forth, which they are not supposed to do.  That could have an impact on the small and medium sized retailers in towns and cities across the country.  It is deplorable they are doing that and shocking that they are not being pulled up on it.  It appears that it requires a complaint to be made to the Garda and the Garda must then investigate, which seems to be very convoluted.</p><p>I appeal to the larger multiples to stop selling this stock because they are impacting in a negative way.  If people get into the habit of going to the larger multiples, they will stop going to the smaller shops.  What is the situation with regard to small retailers in towns?  We hear a great deal about town centres and so forth.  Many of our town centres are being hollowed out because these small retailers have been closed for so long and nobody is going into the towns.  I am not sure whether the behaviour of the multiples will have an impact on the small retailers.  Does Mr. Hughes have a view on that?  Second, what is his information or knowledge of the impact on small retailers across the country?  Will many of them not reopen?  Are many of them engaging with the various agencies such as the Department, the LEOs and so forth with respect to the various loans we are discussing today?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021042000002#F00600"><p>We have been working with the retail sector in the context of both Covid and Brexit since 2016 or 2017.  We have really good contacts with the sector across the representative bodies, including the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, CSNA, and the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association, RGDATA.  They are members of a retail forum which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for retail, Deputy English.  We have also had, for the last year in particular, a retail and supply chain round table which during last year was meeting probably once a month or every two weeks, and over Christmas and at the back end of last year it was probably meeting weekly, to deal with both the Covid and Brexit impacts.  It was to ensure that we have continuity of supply, and retailers and wholesalers put in extraordinary work to ensure we had continuity of supply, and to deal with all the issues that existed in terms of new customs and other procedures.</p> <p>  The retail sector proved relatively resilient last year because it had click and collect.  It diversified quite quickly in using the online vouchers from the local enterprise offices.  Indeed, many found new markets and alternatives.  In some of the grocery retail, we know that off-licences and other parts of it have done quite well, in some cases up 15%, 17% or 20%.  However, it is the broader base of retailers that populate our high streets and main streets that have been particularly impacted since Christmas, especially in not being able to avail of click and collect.  That is a huge sacrifice.  People stayed at home, did not congregate and so forth and that was based on public health advice.  We had a meeting of the retail forum with the Minister of State, Deputy English, last week which looked at the reopening roadmap and the prospect, which the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach have mentioned, of reopening click and collect, hopefully in May if the numbers continue to go the right way, and then the remainder of non-essential retail thereafter.  Indeed, our advice now to all retailers is to put preparatory actions in place by ensuring they have work safely protocols, ventilation and queuing systems.  We are engaging with shopping centres and others in regard to that reopening.</p> <p>  At the same time, we have also had the compliance issues, which the Deputy mentioned.  There are clear regulations which specify the outlets and activities that are to be open and not open, in terms of essential or non-essential.  The regulations are also very clear for mixed retailers.  Where there may be, for example, fashion, clothing and home ware, they are to be sectioned off.  It is not permitted to allow the public into those areas except on compassionate grounds.</p><p>We all know of many examples where people need clothing for job interviews or funerals, for example, and the compassionate grounds provision exists in those circumstances.  The Government has also introduced new regulations to allow for the fitting and purchase of children's shoes from last week by appointment.</p><p> Therefore, the regulations are clear.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been working very closely with us and members of the force met with the retail forum last week to outline the measures being taken.  Those measures focus on engaging, encouraging and informing.  Where that is not the case, however, and the Garda is not getting co-operation, enforcement will be proceeded with.  I think just under 200 cases have been referred by the Garda for consideration to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and I believe several cases are pending in that regard.  It is a very credible regime and we have continuously sought the co-operation of all retailers.  I reiterate that the majority of retailers are bearing the brunt of this situation.  In the remaining time, it behoves everybody to fall into line with the regulations to ensure we have a safe reopening for everybody.</p><p> The full range of supports are available.  The CRSS is specifically for retail outlets that have had to close on public health grounds and have not been able to allow the public access.  That support is available and is being accessed by the retailers.  Hopefully, it will sustain those retailers on the main street and ensure that they are in a position to reopen.  Many of those retailers have stock from last spring and summer and perhaps now autumn stock as well which has not cleared.  That is a significant issue for them, but we will provide encouragement regarding there being good value available in such areas when we get back out and reopen.  Hopefully, the public will be back out supporting those retailers.</p><p> The small business assistance scheme, SBASC, has also been beneficial in this regard.  Approximately 22% of the applicants so far have been from the wholesale and retail trade.  Many wholesalers and suppliers to the retail sector that do not benefit from the CRSS because they do not have customers coming in have been benefiting from SBASC.  There has also been very high take-up under the credit guarantee scheme, and they will also be able to benefit from the scheme under consideration.  </p><p> We must now work towards a safe reopening, get consumers back out spending and get cash flow back in the retail sector.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have been working with the local authorities to ensure that the public realm is attractive and safe for local shopping.  Significant initiatives were taken in this area before Christmas.  The Deputy will be aware that there is a new &euro;200,000 grant scheme for local authorities to undertake further improvements in respect of streetscapes to ensure that our town and city centres are attractive for people to come into, mingle and enjoy recreation, shows and other entertainment as well.  Regarding co-operation, many chambers of commerce around the country are working at local level with the local authorities, retailers and the hospitality sector to ensure the provision of attractive public realms in which people will feel it is safe to come back into and spend some of their savings.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Hughes' comments.  The large retailers are up 20%, and there will not be an SME or small business left if we leave it much longer.  I take it that there is going to be a direction from the Department that click and collect will recommence in the first week of May.  That would be very welcome, if Mr. Hughes can confirm that will be the case.</p> <p>  What percentage of retailers are receiving the CRSS?  To reiterate points I made before concerning restart grants and other supports, and I do not know if there was a communication issue or some other problem, a high percentage of retailers on the high streets in Galway city were certainly not getting them.  There may be reasons that was the case and Mr. Hughes might let us know.  I re-emphasise that I understand fully the difficult situation faced by the Garda in a large city such as Galway.  There have been a minuscule 200 prosecutions.  With the greatest of respect, there has been no let-up in the large multiples in areas such as shoes, sweatshirts, jumpers and boots, for example.  It is a very frustrating issue for Deputies and Senators on the ground.  </p> <p>  My two brief questions, then, concern whether Mr. Hughes can confirm that click and collect will be reinstated in the first week of May and the percentage of retailers receiving the CRSS.</p></speech>

I wish we were in a position to set the regulations and the timeline.  Those decisions are made from a public health perspective, but certainly the roadmap as published by the Government, depending on the numbers, has firmly indicated that, all going well, click and collect will be back in May.  That would be step one.  We would be supportive of that development, but it is dependent on public health advice and those regulations are obviously made by the Department of Health, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach.  We will, however, input into that process.  What we and the Minister of State, Deputy English, have been saying to the retail sector is to prepare on that basis.  Things change and who knows what variants or other developments might happen, but I concur with that view.</p> <p>  I do not have the details regarding the CRSS as it is a Revenue scheme, but we can provide that to the Senator.  Looking at the temporary wage subsidy scheme, however, it is possible to see that a high proportion of businesses, more than 70% of those in motor retail and repair, availed of the scheme.  There were similarly high numbers in the wholesale area.  Figures for the TWSS indicate that 30% to 40% of retail businesses availed of the scheme, which would tally.  We hope that all retail outlets impacted by the current level 5 restrictions are benefiting from CRSS on the basis that they have a relationship with Revenue, they are on the system and they should be able to avail of the scheme.  If they are not, they should then be able to come in and get the SBASC.  An example would be if a retail outlet is not closed on public health ground but perhaps for other reasons or revenue is down 75% because the trade just is not there.  </p> <p>  As I mentioned, approximately 22% of applicants for the SBASC, which is a scheme we know about, are from the wholesale and retail sector.  We are certainly happy to follow up for the Senator on the CRSS data.</p></speech>

I was specifically referring to people in the fairground, amusement, leisure, circus and catering areas.  Mr. Hughes said that other ways of trying to provide support to these sectors were being explored.  Have there been developments concerning that?</p> <p>  My second point concerns previous comments made by him regarding examining involvement of the credit union network in some of the microfinance elements.  Has the Department been considering activities that might promote more of a public banking role for the credit union network, given the exit of Ulster Bank and now KCB?  Is the Department giving any views to the Department of Finance regarding such a role or any support on how we might consider implementing a wider banking role for the credit union sector?</p></speech>

We have received a range of queries that are going back out to the local authorities, which hopefully have been helpful.  However, once a business is on a rated premises, even if it is not the business paying the rates - and of course some elements of the rates charge are contained in their bill or payment - then that business will be eligible.  Regarding the business referred to by the Deputy, clarification was provided that it would be eligible because it is a business in its own right providing a service on the premises of someone else.  That service provision has ceased, but the business concerned has a fixed point of operation.  It has a fixed premises in that park, and that is an important point.  We have really tried to get the message out in that regard.</p><p>It is also addressed in the frequently asked questions for the local authorities, which is helpful.</p><p> For others, such as circus businesses, it is a small amount but they would certainly be eligible.  Most of them have a lock-up or storage as well.  What we are trying to do with the SBASC is to cover their fixed costs.  It is not necessarily about covering their loss of income or, in many of these cases, the ongoing maintenance and re-equipment, which, as the committee will know from many examples, may well be significant.  It is trying to ensure they will at least have funding that will sustain them from a fixed-costs perspective.  I hope it has been helpful and we will seek to examine further initiatives for other sectors.  While we rolled out the small business assistance scheme, our colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media launched the music and entertainment scheme, which is again trying to cater for some of those businesses that were not covered by CRSS or other schemes.  We need to ensure we have the right mix of supports.  There are probably still a small number of home workers and so on whom we need to ensure can get back up and running quickly.</p><p> As for credit unions, I mentioned in the context of the credit guarantee scheme that extensive work has been done with the Department of Finance and the SBCI to ensure that credit unions could participate.  There have thus far been two tranches of credit unions that have put in the required systems, the capacity and the risk assessment.  Some credit unions have got those systems in place in their own right and will be well versed in lending and risk assessment for credit unions.  We are very keen to see them step up and continue to participate in that market.  Ms Kilcullen might like to comment on that.</p></speech>

The due diligence process, governance and other systems are assessed to do that.  The credit unions that have been successful in joining the Covid credit guarantee scheme are now in a position to join other schemes quite easily, and with the open-call system we welcome applications from credit unions.   Also, Microfinance Ireland is providing loans in a similar sector, with good links to the local enterprise offices to provide support and mentoring to small businesses throughout Ireland.  The reach for small business and microbusiness throughout the country, through credit unions, Microfinance Ireland and the local enterprise office network, is something we are definitely pursuing.</p></speech>

They spend a large proportion of the year travelling to different towns, so many of them are not tied to a rateable premises.  I think some of them have written to the Department under the Showmen's Guild.  Could the Department examine a specific initiative to support those businesses?  They have had no income for nigh on ten months.</p></speech>

Specifically, can we schedule a meeting with content moderators and representatives from the social media platforms as soon as possible?  This is a fairly pressing issue.

We have received apologies from Senator O'Loughlin.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the progress of the national disability inclusion strategy.  To that end, I welcome our witnesses.  We are almost six months behind schedule with Covid and everything else.  This meeting was due to take place earlier.  I extend a very warm welcome on my behalf and on behalf of the committee to Ms Lorraine Dempsey, interim CEO of Inclusion Ireland, and Ms Jacqui Browne, chairperson of the Disabled Persons Organisations Coalition, who is here on behalf of Inclusion Ireland.  I also welcome Mr. John Dolan, chief executive officer, and Dr. Joanne McCarthy, head of policy, advocacy and engagement with the Disability Federation Ireland.</p> <p>  I must remind members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, if members are joining remotely, I ask them to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex prior to making a contribution to the meeting.  I ask anyone watching the meeting online and witnesses accessing the meeting remotely, due to the unprecedented circumstances, to bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Before we commence the formal proceedings, I will begin with some formalities.  First is the note on privilege.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given as to whether or not or to what extent their evidence is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should be mindful of their domestic statutory regimes.  If they are directed by the Chairman of the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  I will go straight into the business of the committee.  I call Ms Dempsey, interim CEO of Inclusion Ireland, to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#A00300"><p>Inclusion Ireland welcomes the opportunity to be here.  Since the beginning of the Covid-19 period, in March 2020, we have seen many health and social care services, including disability day services, closed to people with intellectual disabilities.  Thankfully, day supports have remained open during the second and third lockdowns, albeit on a limited basis for many and a little or not at all for a few.  Inclusion Ireland has previously addressed Oireachtas committees on the multiple suspensions of children's disability services and the lack of educational supports during school closures, which parents report has affected the development of their children, many of whom were regressing.  This cessation and then reopening of these services has had a significant negative impact on people, affecting their well-being and independence and the mental health of people with disabilities and their families.  Prior to Covid, many people with an intellectual disability told us they felt invisible and poorly treated by mental health services and that they were struggling to access them.  Now, given the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of people with an intellectual disability, there is expected to be an increased need for mental health services as a result of Covid-19.  It is vital that the mental health intellectual disability programme is rolled out, funded and established in communities across the country.</p> <p>  More than three years on from the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2018, Ireland is at an important juncture at which the Government must show leadership in its implementation.  The new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth must show leadership and actively promote the implementation of the convention across all Departments.  One crucial element of the convention's implementation is the ratification at the earliest opportunity of the optional protocol.  Another important aspect of ratifying the convention is the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The Act was enacted several years ago but is yet to be fully commenced.  We need to see action on swift commencement of the decision support service and to ensure that the issue of those being made wards of court as a result of the Act not being fully commenced is redressed as soon as possible.  Full commencement of the Act is essential to ensuring that individuals with disabilities have the support to exercise decision-making and choice in their own lives.  It also plays a key role in the State's compliance with the UN convention.</p> <p>  The Government's Time to Move On from Congregated Settings policy was clear in recommending that all congregated settings be closed by 2018.  This simply has not happened.  In total, 8,300 people currently live in residential services, with an additional 1,500 people with a disability under the age of 65 living in nursing homes.  According to HIQA, these figures include approximately 2,900 people living in congregated settings.  We know the consequences and risks of this arising from Covid-19 over the past year.  The convention is clear in its opposition to institutionalised living and on the right of people with disabilities to live a life in the community.  It is, therefore, imperative that the Irish State ceases the continued use of institutions that are in clear breach of domestic and international rights and increases funding to accelerate the deinstitutionalisation process.</p> <p>  One of the biggest barriers facing people with an intellectual disability in accessing social housing is the clear lack of available support services that are required for them to live in their own homes.  People who need supports in their homes have no clear pathway to apply for these supports.  Through our advocacy work we have found that many people report being placed high on social housing waiting lists due to their disability but then not being able to access social housing through their local authorities due to the support services not being readily available at the right time.  This must be addressed.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to Ms Browne, my colleague, who will speak on the work of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to have an input at this sitting of the committee.  I am chairperson of the Disabled Persons Organisations Coalition, or DPO Coalition.  We are one of the member organisations of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network, and I present this statement on behalf of the entire DPCN.  This is a very young group and I will tell the committee a little more about it.  We see the development of the DPCN as a very important milestone for the disability community and we welcome the Government's commitment towards its establishment.  The overall purpose of the DPCN is to ensure that disabled people and their representative organisations will be heard directly by the Government in making decisions on disability policy and law.  There are four grant-funded members of the DPCN: AsIAm; the coalition of the six national organisations of disabled people, of which I am chair, and which is known as the DPO Coalition; the Disability Federation of Ireland; and Mental Health Reform.  As the committee can see, the membership is a very broad church.  The membership of the DPCN is also and very importantly includes more than 100 non-funded members, individuals and disability organisations.  Representatives from the four grant-funded members, along with Inclusion Ireland, as the network organiser, are involved in establishing the network.</p> <p>  Our immediate task has been the network's response to the State's draft report under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  That consultation process closed very recently, on 9 April.  The DCPN organised six consultations, which included anyone and everyone from around the country.  In these Covid times everything was online and more than 190 people participated across all six of those consultation sessions.  This presented a very good opportunity for the DCPN to connect with the wider membership.  Following the consultations, a response to the State's draft report was formally submitted on 9 April.</p> <p>  It has been a very challenging start for the network.  It is new; it was established in December 2020.  In reality we only began meeting in January, with the timeline of 9 April to be met for submission.  The five organisations have been working together for the first time, consulting at the same time with more than 100 members on the State's report.  All this has happened within a very short timeframe.  Our next priority is to explore how we can formally establish the network and to focus on governance, organisational structures and planning.  However, given the substantial increase in the network's membership, with many members being volunteer-led, additional resources are essential to ensure that our participation is genuine, active and meaningful and that the direct voice of disabled people is prioritised at all times.</p></speech>

We welcome our colleagues, Ms Lorraine Dempsey and Ms Jacqui Browne, who have introduced themselves.</p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Disability Matters requires a complementary mechanism through the Department of An Taoiseach, namely, the operation of a project management function to ensure effective and efficient implementation across the Civil Service and public service area.  This is urgently needed.</p> <p>  There are over 640,000 people with disabilities in Ireland and they have a shared reality of poverty and exclusion from many things that others rightly take for granted.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, requires nothing less than the will and preference of people with disabilities to be front and centre and, equally, that all organisations, be they State, voluntary, community or private, work together.  They all have an obligation to work together to make this great project work.</p> <p>  The DFI has been involved in the implementation of a number of national disability strategies.  This is our learning from that.  If Ireland uses the same approach for implementing the UNCRPD it will not succeed.  The programme for Government commitments to the implementation of the UNCRPD came after the arrival of the Covid pandemic.  We now need, and expect to have, to have a strong implementation programme for the remainder of this D&aacute;il.  We look forward to what the budget might bring us in a number of months' time as a start to that.</p> <p>  I will now discuss progress on implementing the UNCRPD, the optional protocol and the State's response.  In our opening remarks I laid out a number of important foundations to progress implementation, namely, the new Department and a full Cabinet Minister with disability as part of the remit, along with equality and other related organisations.</p> <p>  Ms Dempsey and Ms Browne mentioned December, when the State published its first initial draft report on the UN convention.  This was a very positive move.  DFI, as one of the funded members of the DPCN, consulted within our own disability family, people with disabilities and organisations.  I want to make some points that came out of that consultation.</p> <p>  Ireland is rich in policy and relevant legislation.  We are constantly and consistently weak on implementation.  There are notable parts of Education for Persons with Special Needs, EPSEN, Act , the Disability Act 2005, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the more recent Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  They are all pillars of disability inclusion legislation, with significant elements of them not having been implemented.  That is not a bad place to start catching up.  </p> <p>  Ireland continues to have the highest rate of poverty among people with disabilities in the EU.  We still have a big problem in terms of having reliable and relevant data on people with disabilities to better target our initiatives and work.  </p> <p>  Ireland still has to ratify the UN optional protocol.  When the convention was ratified in March 2018 there was a sting of disappointment that the protocol was not ratified at the same time.  For God's sake, let the Oireachtas get on with it now and encourage it to happen.  There is no substantive reason that cannot be done now.  </p> <p>  To conclude before I hand over to Dr. Joanne McCarthy, I wish to state that the DFI position on how well we are doing in compliance can be best characterised as being policy-strong but lacking overall project management.  We are not getting on with doing the job effectively.  That is the key point.</p></speech>

I want to welcome my colleagues from the DPCN, Ms Dempsey and Ms Browne.  One of the points the committee asked us to cover was amply addressed by Ms Browne, in terms of the role of the establishment of the DPCN.  I want to reiterate a number of points the committee has heard from Ms Browne, but they are important and we hope the committee takes some time to consider them.</p> <p>  If we are to truly ensure that our consultation processes hear from the voices and experiences of people with disabilities, our consultation process has to be genuine.  Unfortunately, once we were appointed as the four funded members of the DPCN there was a very quick turnaround to gather the input from people with disabilities for the State's draft report.  There are over 640,000 people with disabilities in Ireland.  They are not all the same and there are many different spaces and locations.  If we really want to hear from those most marginalised or those most distant from the political process, we need to be genuine in how we carry out that level of engagement.  There is learning from the first round of engagement that we hope to build back into the network.</p> <p>  The methodology employed to identify members of the DPCN has to be commended.  One unanticipated outcome was the identification of over 1,000 additional members who were eager to be involved in this process.  Again, because of the quick turnaround required of us for our response to the State's report, that level of engagement has yet to be fully realised.  We encourage the committee to provide the necessary resources and timelines to enable us to hear from and exercise the expertise in that broader network.</p> <p>  As Ms Browne said, we comprise five organisations, four funded and one co-ordinating member.  Some of us have a history of working together on measures such as the Oireachtas disability group.  Others do not have that experience, therefore there is a period of time where we have to figure out how to work together in terms of achieving the best possible outcomes for the people with disability we represent.  I reiterate the point that there is definitely a need to examine investing appropriately to make sure that the best possible outcomes can be achieved from across the membership.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the impact of Covid.  In some ways, it is a bit like Groundhog Day.  DFI and others have been before the committee a number of times over the lifetime of this pandemic to talk about the issues.  We are all acutely aware of the impact Covid has had on individuals and families, and that has not changed.  I want to take this opportunity to commend individuals, families and organisations on their innovation and commitment, which has ensured that people have been protected from the impact of Covid, especially those in residential and day services.</p> <p>  We are, however, concerned that we do not have reliable data to understand how prevalent Covid was among people with disabilities who are not availing of those services.  Unlike other countries, we did not gather data on the presentation of people with disabilities to acute and hospital services.  That is alarming because international evidence suggests that there would have been a high prevalence of those cases, outside of day and residential services, who may have been affected.</p> <p>  I also want to take this opportunity to remind the committee that the organisations that have played such a critical role in providing, as best they can, some sort of shield to individuals and families during the lifetime of the pandemic are the same organisations that in 2019 came before the Oireachtas to explain the crippling deficits they were carrying.  Between them they are carrying a deficit of more than &euro;40 million.  Despite the challenges they have faced they have turned into the pandemic, and that is something that should be commended.  </p> <p>  There are a number of learnings from the experience of Covid within disability services, something that committee members need to reflect on.</p><p>The first is that Covid exacerbated what we already knew were some of the big challenges in disability services and, outside of those, within services to disability generally.  We know the 3,000 people in congregated settings and the 1,400 plus people under the age of 65 who are in day services are inappropriately placed and were in the eye of the pandemic storm due to the unacceptable nature of their current locations.  When the pandemic hit and we had to look at how we safely deliver services, in particular day services, we also began to identify how we are not yet in the position to provide appropriate individualised services and supports.  It has been a difficult period both for the 27,000 people who use day services and for their families.  We now know from the last tally that there has been a return to day services of between 40% and 50%, and we acknowledge the extra investment in those to try to help them to reopen.  There is still a service gap for people with disabilities, and without planning and the resources to deliver much more person-centred services in future, we will always have this challenge in adverse situations.</p><p> We must acknowledge the significant investment in budget 2021.  For the second time successively for a long time we have seen investment in personal assistants and home supports.  What this pandemic has also shown us is that these are the critical services that enable the best responses to be developed to people's individual needs and family needs.  It is incumbent on all of us to consider how best we can resource and invest in these models of service as we go forward.  They are, after all, in keeping with Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  They are the baseline for Article 19.</p><p> We often lose sight of the fact there are 640,000 people with disabilities in Ireland.  A very small number of that population access day and residential and other core national disability services.  Most people are users of general health services and these have been crippled during the pandemic.  The impact of the pandemic will be carried by these services for a very long time and will inadvertently impact on people with disabilities as they work to have good quality health and well-being.  We know from the recent tally there are almost 27,000 people waiting for neurological outpatient services, more than half of whom have been waiting longer than 12 months.  We have to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  We welcome the acknowledgement in the recent HSE operational plan of the need to invest in disability services.  One of the main things from today we are looking for the committee to think about is how best it can support the HSE and others to ensure investment best suits the necessary outcomes for people with disabilities.</p><p> I do not know whether I have a minute to talk about the vaccination roll-out.  I am sure it is high on all of the members' agendas and they are probably getting many queries in their constituencies around it.  It is merely to acknowledge the fact we will pass a milestone at the end of this week or next week whereby all people in day and residential services within disability services will have been vaccinated.  Our colleagues within the HSE and within the services must be commended on this heroic effort.  I would encourage Oireachtas Members, however, to ensure they complete this programme to people within disability services.  There are many people who receive personal assistant, PA, supports and home supports who have yet to receive vaccines.  Many of these are vulnerable because of the comorbidities they have to the impact of Covid and we would encourage members to ensure the Oireachtas pushes through and finalises the vaccination of all those within disability services.  Equally, we are conscious of the role GPs will play in vaccinating most people with disabilities, and we would encourage members to ensure GPs are receiving the most up-to-date information they can to help in prioritisation.</p><p> We are lending weight to our colleagues from Inclusion Ireland, the Carers Association and the Care Alliance on the need to vaccinate carers as a matter of urgency.  The symbiotic relationship between individuals and carers is well appreciated.  If people with disabilities are vaccinated but their carers are still exposed to the impact of Covid, should they contract it, it puts extra pressure both on families and on the services that provide the added support.  Do not forget that carers are the unfunded service providers, and once the State has put the hand out to support those who are funded to deliver day and residential services, we are now asking Oireachtas Members to do the same for the families who provide most of the care within these settings.</p><p> I will hand back over to Mr. Dolan for some final comments and I thank the committee for taking the time to listen to our concerns today.</p></speech>

The Department of the Taoiseach needs to be leading and drawing in all the other Departments and public bodies with a master plan to do this.  The programme for Government, as I said, after we knew we were in Covid and long before we had any hope of a vaccine, made specific commitments to deliver on the strategy.  The budget is now the next obvious place we can see and people with disabilities can see, in their pockets - or not in their pockets - and in their services, what is happening and where we can move on those pieces of legislation and whatever.</p> <p>  People with disabilities must be front and centre, and every other entity and organisation in the State has to come in around that to do the problem solving and to work with people.  I cannot emphasise enough that poverty and exclusion are the twin parts of life for everyone with a disability.</p> <p>  Over the past year, thousands of new people entered the world of disability during Covid.  Covid will wane but living with a disability will not.  That is the challenge.  I wish the committee the best of luck.  It is brilliant to have this committee in place to draw on a whole range of things.  I was excited to see the work the committee did on International Women's Day when it had women with disabilities giving witness to their lived experience.</p></speech>

I also thank them for recognising what is positive as well as articulating extremely well what the challenges are.  They have my ongoing commitment, as a member of this committee and as a Government party Senator, to advocate, push, lobby and ensure the programme for Government commitments are adhered to.</p> <p>  I come from a privacy background as a privacy lawyer and it is ingrained in me to have privacy by design.  One of the things that came out of the meeting on International Women's Day of this Committee on Disability Matters was the idea of ability by design, that everything across Government needs to have that.  One of the main outcomes of that for me was to pursue the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and to speak about that, and the following Friday I had a Commencement matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to discuss that very matter.  In my previous life, I dealt with how that Act, coupled with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, could empower people with disabilities, when it came to decision-making, in having access to all of their information, so I came to it with a little bit of background in how to deal with that.  While I have no doubt the rest of the committee will deal with all of the other serious matters the witnesses discussed, I want to devote my time to the assisted decision-making aspect, if that is all right.</p> <p>  In the Commencement matter, when the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was replying, she stated the Act is expected to be commenced in full by June of next year but that there are two impediments or delays, the first of which is the setting up of the decision support service, although recruitment on that is under way, and the second of which is amendments to the Act are now needed before it is commenced.</p><p>Could the witnesses elaborate, for the benefit of the general public and everybody else, on the difference that having the Act in place will make?  What amendments would they encourage us to support and advocate in advance of the Minister publishing amendments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#D00200"><p>The public at large do not realise how considerable the legislation is and the impact it will have on lives because they do not understand what the ward of court system means, particularly for an adult with a disability.  Imagine not being able to travel outside Ireland without asking permission of the courts.  Imagine not being able to make medical decisions about yourself and your own bodily autonomy without going through the ward of court system.  Imagine someone with an intellectual disability wanting to enter a sexual relationship and get married but not being able to do so unless he or she goes through the ward of court system.  These are decisions that, as a community, we take for granted, but certain people, particularly those with intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties who are made wards of court, are stripped of any power over their bodily autonomy and decision-making.  We view wards with intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties as being incapacitated and they must prove their right to understand anything big in their lives on which they wish to make a decision.  The fundamental change under the legislation and through the setting up of the decision support service will be that we will assume they have the capacity to make decisions, and it will be up to the State to prove otherwise.  In that, they will be supported with co-decision-making practices.  For those who do not wish their families to be part of their decision-making, if issues arise in that regard, there will be an independent support service to help them make decisions that are right for them without the interference from the courts.</p></speech>

The whole thing is to move away from the idea of best interests to a place where there is a reverse onus.  Once the legislation is commenced, the onus will be on the State and not on the individual to prove his or her capacity.  In fact, the presumption will be that there is capacity.  This is really powerful and good.  It is really important that we get this in place as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  If there were a blank slate and the delegates could make amendments at this stage to add to what is already in the legislation, what amendments would they make?</p></speech>

There needs to be a revoking of the lunacy Act and a few other Acts, but issues also arise over detention in the mental health service.  It is quite intricate.  It is too intricate to be discussed today at a meeting of the committee.  On the decision support service, Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn is very much on top of the matter.  Let me outline one of the main things that it would be great to see the committee pushing for in order for the decision-making support service to truly work for us, disabled people, especially those who are very marginalised and excluded and often in coercive or controlled settings or relationships that are unhealthy.  The decision support service really and truly must be properly resourced with sufficient staff, expertise and everything else to hit the ground running; otherwise we are going to fail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#D00500"><p>Good morning to all our guests.  It is great to hear from all of them.  Since the time is limited, I have some questions I would like to ask.  Every member of this committee is very anxious to do what he or she can to implement the UNCRPD but I do not want to see this committee consigned to history as being full of good intentions while having no teeth to get things done.  In this regard, reference was made to many reviews, reports and strategies that were prepared but whose recommendations were not, or not fully, implemented.  Could Mr. Dolan expand on his proposal to have the Department of the Taoiseach operate a project management function?  How can this committee make that happen, and what should we be doing to make something of that nature happen to ensure we achieve what we set out to do?  We have had a number of meetings with Ministers and have raised issues with them.  I acknowledge that our work has been hampered by the Covid restrictions and that we should have a lot more done than we have but it is difficult when trying to  talk to Ministers on a media platform rather than face to face.  I find we do not get the answers we want to many of the questions we ask.  The lack of independent supported living, which I see as a cornerstone of the UNCRPD, is raised with me constantly.  What we are seeing is a lack of co-ordination between local authorities and the HSE.  How can we do something about that and move it on?</p> <p>  What are the delegates' thoughts on how we could address and perhaps reverse the regression the closure of schools has resulted in for many students with additional educational needs?  Is there something that could be put in place, such as enhanced July provision and other supports, in schools?  The waiting lists for intervention and therapy seem to grow longer all the time.  The withdrawing of therapists to do contact tracing has had a negative impact in this regard.  We keep getting assured that the therapists are back in place but that is not what I am hearing from many parents.  The waiting lists seem to be getting longer.  Children who get an assessment of need often have to wait years for any sort of intervention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#D00600"><p>I will pick up on the first question and let colleagues pick up on the issue of school closures etc.  It is as simple as this: one of the roles of the Taoiseach's Department is co-ordination.  It is the Department that supports the Taoiseach of the country.  It is our absolute experience that the efforts to achieve implementation to date have fallen down because there was not what I would call a ward boss, or somebody with authority who can ring up any Department and say, "Come on, lads, you need to think this through a bit more and work with other Departments."  All the problems people with disabilities have are exacerbated because they have to go back out the door of one Department, go down the street and queue up to go into another Department, local authority or other organisation to actually get things moving.  The Oireachtas disability group and the voluntary members, the Disability Federation of Ireland, National Disability Services Association, Inclusion Ireland and Independent Living Movement Ireland &mdash; I believe I have mentioned them all but I may be corrected if I have not &mdash; looked for two critical infrastructural things in the run-up to the last general election.  One was a committee, this committee.  We did not come up with the phrase "disability matters"; some other genius came up with that lovely name.  It is all about the disability matters in people's lives.  We also looked for a Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach who would have responsibility for disability matters and who could, in effect, pick up the phone, pull Departments together and go back to the Taoiseach and say we need more in a certain area.  It is that leverage that is needed at the centre.  We did not solve the unemployment problem of ten, 11 or 12 years ago without a whole-of-government approach to it.  It was the job of every Minister and Department every day of the week.  The response to Covid has been at a whole-of-government level.  It is not just been regarded as a health issue for the Department of Health to solve.  If disability and implementing the UNCRPD involve a lived commitment, the Taoiseach's Department has to find a way to put in what I describe as a project management system to help and support and to test that things are happening efficiently and effectively.  Public service reform is supposed to be about efficiency and effectiveness in carrying out the commitments the State has already made.</p></speech>

We are trying to stick rigidly to the timetable so I ask just one of the witnesses to answer on the important points the Deputy raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.172" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#E00100"><p>To respond to the point on therapists being directed towards testing and contact tracing, as far as I am aware this is no longer the case but what we are left with are services that are being delivered predominantly remotely.  Instead of being diverted towards testing and contact tracing, therapists are being directed towards assessments of needs and reducing the State's breaching of the statutory obligations to complete assessments within the statutory timeframe.  This means any children on intervention waiting lists, or in intervention but not receiving intervention, have to wait because of the State's obligation to meet the assessment of needs deadline.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has invested more than &euro;7 million towards reducing the assessment of needs waiting lists but while children are in a constant loop of assessments they do not get what they really need, which are the actual interventions to make a difference.</p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland came before several Oireachtas committees to speak about the impact of Covid on children in schools through school closures and remote education not working.  What we would like to see is a massively expanded summer programme, even larger than last year.  This means incentives for more schools to engage in school-based summer programmes because for the most part this is what children really need.  What we do not need are parents having to struggle to find tutors or special needs assistants themselves with no centralised database operated by the Department of Education.  I understand the spokesperson for education in Deputy Tully's party has raised this issue with the Department.  Inclusion Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland, AsIAm and Family Carers Ireland requested, and received approval from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, that the Department should set up a regular consultation forum for our organisations in order that we can input collaboratively to the development of measures such as the summer programme.  Instead of something that will not be effective being announced, we can be part of designing something that will be effective from the outset.  We have written to the Department to establish this group.</p> <p>  With regard to services, Covid has only exacerbated waiting lists.  It did not create the waiting lists.  What we need is investment.  When we do have investment the HSE has a problem with recruitment.  I understand it is looking at how we get over this.  I cannot see any difference being made in the coming years if we do not produce the required therapists in third level and entice them into children's disability services.  Otherwise, we will always have unfilled yet funded posts.  This is the direction we are going in.  We are at risk of not being able to deliver for children's needs because we simply cannot fill posts when funds are available.</p> <p>  Every other day we hear parents on the radio, in the media and on "Prime Time" expressing how distressing it is to see their children not developing and not meeting their potential because the parents are not been given the right resources to support them.  This also goes for schools.  We know that allocation of special educational teachers and special needs assistants are based on whole school profiles.  Re-examining these school profiles has been stalled.  We understand the reasons for this, given the pandemic, but schools will be trying to provide an additional teaching allocation for children with special educational needs based on the same numbers they had four years ago.  This is particularly the case for developing schools, such as those with Educate Together as a patron body.  We need to see an increase in supports for special education teacher allocations and special needs assistant allocations to wrap around schools, as well as additional therapy supports to ensure children are delivered therapy in the right place at the right time for what they need.  If it is school-based so be it.  If it is home-based or community based, depending on what the goals are for that child, we need to develop the systems and resources to deliver them effectively for children.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses.  Their presentations were excellent.  Ms Dempsey spoke about people with intellectual disabilities being prioritised on housing lists.  They should be prioritised, and it is something on which we need to work because we need a lot more support and help in this regard.  There are issues with support services.  Does Ms Dempsey know of a local authority that she feels is doing it right?  Is there a model version?  Do we need to look at other jurisdictions?  This is very important.  I am conscious that the closing date for the first round of the consultation for the new national housing strategy for people with disabilities closes on 23 April.  Have many submissions been made?  Is Ms Dempsey happy that it is to close on 23 April?</p> <p>  I thank Ms Browne for her presentation.  She spoke about the challenging start for the network, with five organisations within a very short timeframe consulting more than 100 members on the State's report.  We need to look at the timeframe.  We also need to look at supports.  During Covid we have virtual meetings.  Does Ms Browne believe that if the timeframe was extended, the network would be able to meet when everyone is vaccinated?  I understand we have to get the vaccinations right.  Does Ms Browne think this would be the long-term goal?  Is the network looking at setting up various teams, such as for transport or social welfare?  We see people with disabilities and intellectual disabilities in poverty.  Is the network looking at adults or children?  Is there a bigger plan for this on which Ms Browne could give us information?</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Dolan for his presentation.  It is important that responsibility for disability is being moved from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I understand it is progressing very slowly.  Perhaps this is something we need to address.  I have had several meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and it is important that the transition happens very quickly.  From working with the Minister of State, and from this meeting where we have spoken about primary care and occupational therapy, I know there are many issues we need to address very quickly.  Funding is another issue.  We need to make sure there is proper funding.</p> <p>  I also want to speak about the summer programme.  We need to get the summer programme right.  Various organisations need to be able to input to it, to make sure we deliver a proper summer programme.  The closure of schools and home education has been very hard on families and children.  This is important.</p> <p>  I agree with Dr. McCarthy that the database is important.  It worries me that we do not have a database and it is something we should also look at.  To go back to Mr. Dolan, we have to implement our policies.  This is something we in the Oireachtas must focus on.  It is something we need to make sure that we do.</p> <p>  I thank all of the witnesses.  There is so much information that we need to work on and we can play a part.</p></speech>

Deputy Tully asked how we would know we were successful at the end of this term.  The most important thing to remember is that we do not have the baseline data to understand how we will know.  We have it on some things within the disabilities services programme but there is no knowledge of the number of people who require a personal assistant or home support.  We do not have these data.  One of the key successes that would give a foundation in the world of UNCRPD is having the right data and understanding them.</p> <p>  This is also linked to the question on housing.  Often people may get a house but have difficulty accessing the personal supports to enable them to live independently in the house.  How do we marry data from various Departments to ensure the most comprehensive person-centred responses can be delivered?  We need to tease out some of the challenges on what data we have and what data we need.  The census has been very important but it has gaps.  We use data from the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, but sometimes it is very difficult to disaggregate it.  We really need to think about what are the data we need.  If we look at what is in the draft State's report on the UNCRPD we will see this.  Without baseline data it will be very hard to track success or otherwise over the coming years.  I encourage the committee to think about the data deficit because it is very important.</p> <p>  The housing issue is critical.  Consultation has been quite good.  Housing advisory groups have been established in most local authorities.  Sometimes they work very well and sometimes they do not.</p><p> In terms of very good models, it is almost like a systemic change within local authorities.  There are different models.  We in the Disability Federation of Ireland are supporting a model in Wicklow, which is powerful.  We would welcome the opportunity to come back and talk to the members about that.  It is where we work with local authorities to consider how we plan in an inclusive and mainstream way for the inclusion of the needs of people with disabilities within that county in the services we plan.  There is a definite need to consider the role that local authorities play because when we think about health we are almost pulled by the nose in terms of the &euro;2.2 billion that is in disability services.  However, while that is a lot of money it funds 9,000 places within residential services, allows 27,000 people to access day services,as well as providing a small amount of respite and a few other services.  Most people with disabilities never get near that.  The role and the importance of local authority planning for their population, which might include 13.5% of people with a disability, is critical.  We need to think that through and bring that over to other Oireachtas committees to ensure they also ask those questions in a mainstream way.</p></speech>

We need to give the topic that much time but, unfortunately, we are restricted in that regard.  I call Deputy Hourigan.  I will call Ms Jacqui Browne immediately after Deputy Hourigan's contribution.  Ms Lorraine Dempsey and Mr. John Dolan want to come in also so I will do that as best I can.</p></speech>

I have a couple of short questions.  I am very mindful that Mr. Dolan said we have a great deal of policy but not enough implementation.  The contributors might unpack that a little for me because I believe we fall down in many sectors in Ireland around the issue of implementation.  We talked briefly about data gathering and setting benchmarks to allow us know how we are doing.  We may need to address issues around data gathering in light of developments like the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.  That has had an impact on the disability community in the past month or two.</p> <p>  Is the issue about training?  Is it about restructuring particular Departments or the way we operate?  I want to understand the witnesses' vision for effective implementation across every Department.</p> <p>  In terms of 2021 and being right in the middle of the Covid pandemic, lockdown and so on, hopefully the position will be slightly different in the months ahead.  What we experienced during the highest point of the pandemic will be different from what we will experience in the next 18 months in terms of the road back.  If the witnesses have thoughts on that I would like to hear those also.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  Does Ms Browne want to respond to those questions?</p></speech>

I will try to be brief.  There is so much I could say and offer, in addition to the other members and colleagues from Inclusion Ireland and the DFI.  I want to remind people of something that has been forgotten about, especially in today's discussions where we talked a good deal about the service provision.  We are losing sight of disabled people as individuals and their direct participation in life but also in the implementation of policies and strategies.  For too long in this country we have operated in silos.  That is one of our core barriers generally.  We saw some very good examples of how we broke down silos when it came to resolving many issues around homelessness during the Covid pandemic.  For example, very few people who were homeless died because of Covid.  That was as a result of partnership in terms of breaking down silos.  I urge the members of this Joint Committee on Disability Matters to not forget to take the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, as their mapping and overarching policy tool.  There are only 50 articles in the convention.  I urge the members to lead and not impede.  In particular, I urge them to look at Article 1, the opening article, which speaks about how disabled people are at the heart of the convention.  We should be doing nothing without the direct involvement and representative voice of disabled people and not have others speaking on their behalf.  That is very important.</p> <p>  Equally, Article 4 talks not only about the participation of disabled people but also the prioritisation of the voice and the lived experience of disabled people in decision-making and in planning, implementation and strategy.  Those are two critical points for the committee to take on board when it is discussing the future and championing the rights of disabled people under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I hope that helps.</p></speech>

I will be brief also.  Mr. Dolan highlighted the disappointment in respect of the ratification of the optional protocol.  That would mean the State would be held to account for not allowing people to exercise their own rights under the UNCRPD, for example.</p> <p>  Mr. Dolan also spoke about the lack of housing and supports for independent supportive living.  I have two brief questions.  First, does he fear that the reason the optional protocol has not been ratified is because there is not the required political will across all Departments, for example, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to implement the UN convention?  Second, if he has time to answer, what do we need to do to accelerate supportive living and to move away from congregated settings?  Is the policy articulated in the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings strategy document a good approach if resourced and implemented properly, or would Mr. Dolan be looking at different models also?</p></speech>

Members might remind me if I miss out on something.  I will start with Deputy Cairns' questions because they are most easily remembered.  On the optional protocol, there was a commitment to implement the CRPD in the 2011 programme for Government.  It was not done in that one and it was re-ignited for the next programme for Government.  There seemed to be a sense that the line that was always being put out was that Ireland is not ready to do this until we have all this other legislation lined up.  I thought that was ridiculous in the sense that it is progressive implementation.  It is about implementing the convention bit by bit, year by year and module by module.  It starts on the basis that many things in one's state are not the way they should be in terms of legislation, funding, services, participation and so on.  Am I being cynical in saying that they held that piece back?  I cannot see any reason it cannot be done, particularly when a state says it is up for it.  We were the last country in the EU to ratify the convention.  We then moved very quickly and did something that was ground-breaking, namely, the establishment of this committee.  Why do we spoil that by not signing up to the protocol and saying that we will do our damnedest to make sure that people have their day in court, if they need it?  All other mechanisms have to be dealt with also in terms of that process.</p> <p>  On the Time to Move On from Congregated Settings report, as Ms Dempsey said at the start, it should be history by now; it should have been done.  We are talking about approximately 2,900 people.  The undertakers of Ireland will solve that problem if it is not taken by the scruff of the neck.</p> <p>  Ms Dempsey referred to 1,400 people.  Those are people under the age of 65.  While it was right to focus on people in congregated settings and the delivery of that policy, at the same time the State was putting young disabled people into nursing homes across the State, and that number has been increasing every year.  There is a small commitment in this programme for Government to start moving people out of those nursing homes.  It is down to political will and the confidence of the State to get on and do what needs to be done.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Hourigan's questions, I totally agree with Ms Browne's points.  People with disabilities are the front and centre, as I have said already.  Anyone and everyone else comes in to support that, not to speak on behalf of that.</p><p>Otherwise, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is a joke.  </p><p> On Deputy Hourigan's point, I mentioned four items of legislation in my opening remarks.  There might be others, but those I mentioned are key.  It would be great to get the relevant Oireachtas committees to consider them and to actually start pushing them.  I will mention one more, namely, the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  It gave the National Transport Authority, NTA, the right to require private operators providing public transport, for example, buses, to make the vehicles more accessible.  It has never chosen to do that, even though it is in the legislation.  Therefore, there are many issues across the system, including cultural issues, lethargy and all sorts of other things.</p><p> Deputy Murnane O'Connor asked some questions in respect of responsibilities transferring from the Department of Health to the new Department.  Let us be clear about it.  It concerns the transfer of the disability services programme.  There is a whole range of services and supports that fall under the remit of the Department of Health and which should rightly remain under the remit of that Department.  People may be in congregated settings, day programmes or residential supported living.  They equally and strongly need access to a whole range of other health services, whether they are dental, neurological or whatever.  I warn against thinking that responsibility has been transferred elsewhere.  It is one of the responsibilities that will have to remain.  I do not have a view.  It is important that focus is placed on getting the move done right rather than just getting it done.  However, it does need to happen sooner rather than later.</p><p>  Going back to a point made by Deputy Murnane O'Connor on whether there is a model local authority in respect of housing, generally, Wicklow County Council was the first local authority in the State to set up a committee that is almost akin to this joint committee.  That county council is the first local authority to start to look at disability in the round.  That is something worth looking at.  I hope I have not detained members for too long.</p></speech>

It has been a most important discussion and it has been great to get a sense of where the witnesses are coming from.</p> <p>  The points Mr. Dolan just made in respect of Wicklow County Council are most interesting because if there is best practice, it is important that we learn from it on a national scale and build to roll it out nationally where it is appropriate to do so.</p> <p>  Another point he made, and indeed other contributors have touched on it already, concerns the Department of the Taoiseach taking a more proactive lead in effectively project managing not just the work of this committee but the implementation of the UNCRPD across different Departments.  It is something we have discussed previously at this committee.  We have spoken about the potential benefits of setting up a steering group that would have on it a representative from each Department that would set out its own objectives in terms of delivering on the UNCRPD commitments and objectives and report to us on a quarterly basis.  If we had something like that, that was cross-departmental in nature, with the backing of the Taoiseach, and most importantly, with goals and targets and a structure whereby it did not necessarily set deadlines but reported on a quarterly basis, as everybody would want to deliver a good update.  If we had that, we could create more impetus around ensuring that each of the different Departments is bringing this to its top table and is always considering whether policies are inclusive and how they will work from a disability perspective.  We should be encouraging them to always ask those questions and to strive to achieve their objectives under the UNCRPD.  </p> <p>  Ms Dempsey spoke well about congregated settings and where we are - or indeed, where we are not - when it comes to progress in that area.  I was interested to hear her remarks about the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I know that my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney has touched upon that issue and on what amendments to the legislation might be required.  It is something on which all of us here from the different parties must work on a cross-party basis to ensure that when the laws come in, they are as strong and practical as possible and can be implemented.</p> <p>  The discussion has been most welcome.  Ms Browne and Dr. McCarthy have made really interesting points.  It has been hugely welcome to have this level of discussion around the issues.  I know that from Ms Browne's perspective, the network that she is hoping will make a significant difference to the sector requires resourcing and will require funding.  That message was heard by me loud and clear - that is for sure.  I thank her for all of her work.  I would like to hear some more about what is happening in Wicklow County Council to enable us to encourage our local authorities to take a leaf out of its book. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#G00500"><p>I can come back to the Deputy's point and tie in with remarks made by some of the other members.</p> <p>  As Mr. Dolan said, our undertakers are partially responsible for sorting out the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings strategy.  They always have been.  In the period since 2012, when the strategy was launched, over 1,000 people have passed on rather than moving out to live within the community.  The issues with this are as follows.  We are both under-resourcing and under-prioritising this as a policy.  According to the HSE's service plan for 2021 - and consistently in its service plan every year - the number of people set to move out into community-based settings is under 200.  That does not mean those people are moving out to live on their own, isolated from supports; it involves moving the supports out with them.</p> <p>  In relation to housing, one issue is that in cases where people choose to move from a residential setting under the care of a service provider out into social housing, quite often they find it impossible to decouple their funding from the disability service provider, which gets substantial funding for each person that is in a residential setting.  While those people might be able to acquire the social housing, they simply cannot avail of it because of that.  Under the national housing strategy for people with disabilities, there is an obligation to develop national protocols and frameworks for interagency co-operation, right down to local authority level.  The best practices that exist need to be shared, but it must be consistent across the country.</p> <p>  In response to the Chairman, Deputy Moynihan's point, when the Covid restrictions are lifted, I would love to invite the whole committee to visit Inclusion Ireland's offices.  In our boardroom, there hangs a picture that was painted by Ms Frieda Finlay, a former chair of the organisation, called Gathering Dust.  I have repeatedly mentioned this.  It is a painting of probably 300 different documents, papers, legislation, steering group and departmental reports related to disability on the shelves that have never been implemented or have been partially implemented.  Mr. Dolan has mentioned four key items of legislation.  There is a significant deficit in funding implementation.  We provide the legislation and the framework, but we do not actually provide the funds  For example, in respect of the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings strategy, which is part of the HSE transforming lives programme, without exception, it was requested that most of those streams be implemented on a cost-neutral basis for the HSE.  That was impossible from the get-go.  Project management came in late in the process, three or four years into some of those programmes.  </p> <p>  There are good examples of cases within Departments where either legislation or a policy has been agreed in the programme for Government, and from the start a budget has been allocated to implement it, a strong project management team put in place, along with interdepartmental communication, co-operation and, more so, accountability.  These are the types of model that we need to see in other areas of disability.  A good example is the access and inclusion model under the remit of the former Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is one of the few policies under the programme for Government and the national disability inclusion strategy that has actually been fully implemented and year on year, it is about improving it and developing its capacity.  Therefore, there are good examples of where this works.  However, we do suffer from what some refer to as "implementitis".  It is significant across Departments.  When the new national disability and inclusion strategy is launched and cross-departmental strategies and steering groups are established, we will face the same challenge again.</p><p>The implementation is poor because they are not funded to be rolled out in any significant or meaningful way.</p><p> Deputy Hourigan also mentioned the effects of Covid over 2021 and 2022.  Aside from the roll-out of the vaccine programme, we really do not know what is ahead of us in terms of variants and everything else, but what we know is that there has been a significant impact on people with disabilities both in services but more so in the community.  These are people who are not connected to services.  They are people who are living independently, albeit with support.  We keep talking about services in the context of the HSE, but there are people who can no longer go into their employment because of the risk to their personal health and people are isolated within their communities.  I hope that when the restrictions reduce and we look at developing inclusive communities in 2022 and 2023 that we build back better.  When we identify people who are isolated by Covid, we must identify those who were isolated long before Covid and ensure we do not leave them behind in the country's recovery.</p><p> Deputy Cairns mentioned the optional protocol.  Again, it comes down to accountability at an international level for the State.  All too often we shy away from accountability, whether it is at a Civil Service level or a political level.  We have to wait until we get to the ballot box.  This was going to make the State accountable at an international level, where we as individuals have the right to call our country into question.  We have the draft report on the UNCRPD.  For some, reading that report does not reflect their lived experience.  It is a description of the State's systems, with a shine on some of them, but certainly for individuals looking at them, they will say that this is not about them and their lived experience.</p><p> Part of the network is being able to capture that.</p><p> Regarding intellectual disabilities specifically, Inclusion Ireland works very hard to try to create a platform for individuals to be able to have their say, but that takes time.  If there are consultations and submissions to be made, it takes time to work with people with intellectual disabilities to develop their capacity to speak for themselves.  Following this meeting, Inclusion Ireland is before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science where we have a person with intellectual disabilities speaking on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act and their experience of special education in mainstream education.  It takes time to enable people to be able to speak for themselves.  In any Government process, whether it is consultation, input into committees, accommodation or time, it requires us to put in the time and to create a space for people who have the quietest voices in all of this.  Whether it is a voice, an augmentative and alternative communication, AAC, device or other means of communication, we need to create that space for them.</p><p> Regarding housing submissions, I am not sure of the numbers, but Inclusion Ireland created an easy-to-read survey for people with intellectual disabilities to be able to submit their thoughts into the national housing strategy for people with disabilities.  Departments are more open to that, as part of the new standard to involve people with all types of disabilities to be able to communicate their thoughts on the formulation of Government policy, but we need to do more and better.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their contributions so far and the information they provided prior to the meeting.  A wealth of areas could be mentioned, but I specifically want to touch on the optional protocol.  I know it was discussed earlier, but I had a recent communication with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, where she committed to the ratification of the optional protocol once the UN has responded to the State report on the UNCRPD.  What is the response of the witnesses to that?  We are aware that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, recommended its ratification on the same day as the UNCRPD was ratified.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.</p> <p>  I also note that the DFI has discussed its involvement with the vulnerable people subgroup of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the need for the group to continue.  Along with other committee members, I called for the reinstatement of the group.  I want to raise the matter at today's meeting to get a response in that regard.</p> <p>  Much of the information that has been discussed so far shows the frustration on the part of people with disabilities given the lack of implementation, in addition to the stark figures on the rate of poverty and social exclusion for people with disabilities, which is one of the highest in the EU at 38.1%.  Inclusion Ireland mentioned in its submission that targeted interventions are needed in households where there is a disabled person, as highlighted by the ESRI.  Could Ms Dempsey touch on that and indicate what interventions are needed to change this trend?</p> <p>  I wish to move on to housing before I finish.  It would be great if we saw Wicklow County Council's idea of setting up the committee replicated across all local authorities.  That is something the committee could seek to progress in the near future.  In the interim, how do we ensure collaboration between local authorities and the HSE?  Could we, as public representatives, facilitate that in any way?</p> <p>  Could the committee do anything to address the lack of data or could we work with the witnesses on an ongoing basis to identify where we could fill the gaps and how we could apply pressure in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joanne McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#H00300"><p>I will respond to a few questions.  I was the person who sat on NPHET representing disability.  We were hugely disappointed when NPHET's vulnerable subgroup was stood down, because there are so many issues that are so specific to disability and the nuancing that is required.  I will give an example.  By just vaccinating those in residential and day-care facilities and not extending the programme to include those who receive other disability services such as key home supports, many of those have very complex disabilities and it makes them very susceptible to Covid.  It is difficult not having a space to escalate this or to be able to find a space to have it discussed appropriately.  I think we are still suffering the ill effects of that.  We did and would appreciate that ongoing push because we are not through it yet.  We are all talking in a positive way as we are rolling out the vaccine, but we are not out the other side yet.  I think it was my colleague, Ms Dempsey, who said we do not know what Covid will look like this time next year, so it is really important that we plan to make sure that we have the best wraparound response to all people with disabilities.</p> <p>  DFI would really welcome the opportunity to come back and to talk about the pilot project in operation in Wicklow and to demonstrate the impact that has had in terms of decision-making and hearing the voice of and the experience of people with disabilities and their families in how they plan their services.</p> <p>  I do not want to take up too much time but if I can, I will make some other quick points on which I did not get a chance to respond.  Somebody talked about bringing in each Department once every quarter and that Departments would be answerable to the committee.  That is really interesting.  We did that under the national disability inclusion strategy so I think there is learning there.  If the committee is doing that, the most important thing is to look at what it is asking them to measure against.  Everybody in the disability sector is very busy, but are we busy tracking the impact that this busyness is having on the lives of people with disabilities.  If the committee is bringing people together and asking them to come in, the types of information they are asked to talk about or give evidence against is really important.  We must examine what is being achieved through all this busyness, and how that is impacting on people with disabilities</p> <p>  We must be commended as a country.  We have been on a long journey for disability since the commencement of the Disability Act.  We have a lot of history and a lot of knowledge around that.  One of the key things on which we are consistently challenged is interdepartmental work.  Things fall down when two Departments are asked to work together.  Someone talked about housing.  That has been one of the biggest challenges.  Most people with disabilities are not in disability services, they acquire them at working age.  If their housing needs adapting and the housing adaptation grant is not sufficient, all of a sudden they are on the social housing list.  Their needs can change or escalate, for example, in the case of a neurological condition.  They need a home support package in order to sustain their ability to live independently.  They need access to a limited number of personal assistant, PA, hours.  Less than 0.3% of the disability budget goes into PA hours.</p><p>Someone else asked what is needed going forward.  We do not need more of the same.  We are asking members to think about how we invest in day services and decongregation.  That is just sorting out where we are currently.  We do not need more of that.  People want to live ordinary lives in ordinary places so do that one needs one's own home and front door, and access and to be secure in the knowledge that one will get personal assistant and home support hours, which will follow one into one's employment so that one can have a job.  </p><p> Earlier, people talked about poverty.  Almost 15 years later, Indecon is doing another round of research on the extra cost.  As we know there is an extra cost associated with having a disability, we do not have to wait for the report to tell us that.  We also know that the 120,000 people in receipt of the disability allowance are bearing the brunt of poverty or risk of poverty.  We urge the committee to start with them and it does not need Indecon to provide more information.</p><p> We have learning, so if the committee brings in representatives of Departments then I urge it to pay particular attention to the measures and find what works, as well as what interim measures does it want reported on.  It must assess how Departments work together and should make that a valued measure in its own right.  When two Departments need to work on something to deliver a service, the committee must find ways to track that.  The committee must remember that it is not about doing the same.  It is about how we track things such as the investment in new models, personalised budgets, personal assistance hours and the number of people who own their own homes or live in social housing.  They are the most important things to think about.   </p></speech>

The debate has been an incredible experience.  Every time we have public meetings I am left completely frustrated because there is a relentless need to do so much.  A few things have been raised today, including funding and resources, a consistent implementation and an attitude.  Wicklow County Council has shown a great attitude towards its disability pilot programme.  When I was a councillor, I tried to get disability awareness training to all staff who worked in Louth County Council, and a few of my county councillor colleagues around the country passed that motion as well.  Yet, the staff still have not received the training over a year later but it is compulsory for council staff to receive training on climate change.  That shows there is an attitude.  Disabilities are considered to be separate and something to be tackled at some stage, which is wrong because these people are our brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers and friends.  Disability is relentlessly boxed off.  While climate change training has been made compulsory, we do not have compulsory disability awareness or access and auditing training for technical staff in county councils.  It is all down to personalities and not looking from the ground up, and looking and listening adequately.</p> <p>  The last contribution made by Dr. McCarthy touched on inclusion and some of what I wanted to ask her about.  Inclusion and participation in society is down to poverty and exclusion.  Obviously poverty comes from services and supports but not being able to work.  Dr. McCarthy mentioned exactly what I was going to ask about the cost of disability.  I have seen at first hand that the extra cost of a disability is huge.</p> <p>  Today, many other issues were well covered but I have a few problems with the wage subsidy schemes.  There is so much more that we can do to assist people in waiting for wage subsidy schemes, and to encourage and help people.  I recognise that yesterday it was announced that &euro;5 million would be available for employment schemes for people with disabilities.  Dr. McCarthy has long experience.  Can she recommend ways that we can implement a more positive change in trying to get more people actively engaged in working and fulfilling their lives to the best of their abilities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jacqui Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#J00300"><p>Senator McGreehan has made some very interesting points.  I will outline one thing that can be very helpful to the committee to be aware of and which can be of assistance to Members of the D&aacute;il and of the county councils.  They have available to them the backbone and support of the public sector duty, which is a position in law under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.  That legislation is available in order that members can encourage and have mandated all of the issues around awareness and training and regarding the implementation of the delivery of accessible public sector services.  It would be hugely beneficial for the committee to find out more about the legislation and participate in some of the training or at least increase members' background knowledge on it.  We should not forget that option is available.  Some county councils around the country and in urban areas are implementing the training very well.</p> <p>  On some of the other points, one thing struck me today, and I mean this with the best will in the world.  There is a lot of frustration, we all feel frustrated and sometimes we see a solution in calling for another committee to be established.  To be perfectly frank, in my opinion and that of an awful lot of disabled people to whom I talk and with whom I work all of the time, we have too many committees.  The problem is we will have too many committees and then there will be no time left to do the work to implement what we want implemented.  Sometimes one needs to say stop, step back and undertake a scoping or mapping exercise on how many and what type of disability-related committees exist, on whether there an overlap and whether we are duplicating efforts and thus wasting resources.  One will often see the same players and actors sitting on several committees.  They are getting no work done other than spending their lives attending committee meetings and saying the same thing in different places.  Sometimes we need to take a step back in order that we can come back with a simple, realistic and implementable strategy right across Irish society.  We must consider it as spanning the time from the cradle to the grave.  We must consider the lived experience of the person and, indeed, the family and parents of children with disability.  When we talk about people with disabilities, we talk about them in an inclusive way in terms of parents and partners as well.  We do not want four more committees and groups but we need to take a step back.  We must analyse everything and refine things.  Sometimes we are loath to let go of things for fear of losing something that we think is valuable.</p></speech>

The debate has been really interesting and instructive for all of us to listen to their comments and hear about their experiences and views.  I appreciate that along with all of my colleagues.  It is very nice to see Mr. John Dolan back here, as he is a former Seanad colleague.</p> <p>  I am conscious that a great deal of issues have been covered already and all of us are conscious of the immense impact that Covid has and is having on persons with disabilities.  My first question is on the closure of congregated settings.  The issue has been covered extensively and I hear the chilling point that was made about the number of people who died in congregated settings.  I am conscious that there is still quite a number of people in congregated settings despite the commitment to close them by 2018.  Was that not the original commitment? </p> <p>  I take the point about the difficulty with decoupling funding from service providers where people move out of congregated settings into supported living arrangements.  A charity closed a residential service that operated in St. Mary's Centre Telford, which is located in my own area.  The closure had an immensely hard and difficult impact on the lives of the people, mostly women, who had been resident for so long and it was their only home.</p><p>There was no clear alternative in place.  I do not know if there is anything we can do, as legislators, so that there are proper step-down and other supports in place where congregated settings are closed, especially for people who have been resident in them for many years and who may be very vulnerable and really open to terrible trauma through closure.</p><p> My second point is a very different one, which is to pick up on the creation and establishment of the new coalition, the disability, participation and consultation network.  I very much welcome that.  At an earlier meeting of this committee I asked the Minster of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, about her experience on coming into this sector and about the very many groups that currently represent so many different people and interests within the broad community of persons with disabilities.  The Minister of State said that there is a huge number of such groups.  Any co-ordination is very welcome and it is good to see.  It will only strengthen the advocacy.  How can we as legislators support the new network?  What is the best way for us to engage with the network to ensure that the voices of those with a disability are heard at policy-making level?</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Dolan will take those points and address any of the issues that other members raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#KK00300"><p>Senators McGreehan and Bacik and Deputies Wynne and Higgins have raised a number of points and we are short on time.  Deputy Higgins spoke of meetings with different Departments and steering groups.  I ask the Deputy to think of this committee as pulling together the Oireachtas voice and the Oireachtas questioning about moving on the disability strategy.  If the committee has what I would describe as the "project management" function, working from the Taoiseach's office down, one also has the executive side of what the committee wants to do.  The committee is on the legislative side and there is also the executive side.  Flowing from that would be some kind of consistency of reporting and development of the strategy.  Ms Browne, interestingly, referred to the public sector duty.  Every Department must do a statement of strategy.  I do not believe there is any statement of strategy in this Government that should not be referencing the public sector duty, and no strategy should not reference the commitment to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  On the optional protocol, it was interesting to hear the point made about the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  That sounds to me a bit like the old speak: "We were waiting for somebody else to do it."  I absolutely do not see any reason it cannot be ratified now.</p> <p>  Senator McGreehan spoke about the frustration around needing to do so much more consistent implementation.  I go back to the point that we need the two pillars.  We have one pillar.  As I said earlier, in the run up to the general election the Oireachtas disability group looked for two infrastructural pieces, one of which was there would be a committee such as this, which is brilliant to have.  The committee is handicapped and frustrated by the circumstances that we are currently in.  I know that members are mad to get out and get at it, and to be able to have more people with disabilities, and organisations and groups in to the committee.  To be really effective, are the committee members going to be able to go around and quiz every Department?  Not really.  This is why the committee needs the Taoiseach's office to put that project management in place.  It must be remembered that there is a National Disability Authority that is funded by the State, which could do a lot of the workshops element and the backroom work on that.</p> <p>  Senator Bacik referred to the huge numbers of groups, the congregated settings and decoupling funding.  These are big issues.  I would also add the other issue of people.  Youngsters, people our age and much younger than us, are being given an absolute life sentence of going into a nursing home.  The first thing we must do is ask if we can stop one person going in this month and another next month.  This needs community-based funding for personal assistants, home help and other supports to wrap around people, and for us to sit down to listen to those people and what they want from their lives exactly.  The rest of us come into it in trying to make that happen.</p> <p>  With regard to the huge number of groups, there are two things going on.  There is the fundamental right in the Constitution to form associations and unions.  The point about there being too many groups keeps coming up.  Are there too many political parties?  Are there too many independent schools around?  There are 1,500 or 1,700 schools that are all independent.  Yet, they can work in a unified way.  This can also happen with the organisations and groups.  Everyone now has to face into being an implementer, a minder and an owner of the convention.  We have the script, we have the road that everyone must go down, we have the Charities Act, we have HIQA, and we have a lot of State-funded regulatory authorities to put smacht on organisations and groups.  I believe we can move through these but the critical point for the committee members is to get that pillar sponsored by the Taoiseach's office, which is the project management piece.  It will make it manageable and it will be the executive part of what the committee is trying to do with the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#KK00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for the great presentations.  Many issues were raised.  I will put aside the congregated settings.  I was very interested to hear what Ms Dempsey had to say around digital empowerment, the web accessibility directive and assistive technology.  I would be very interested if Ms Dempsey had something in writing on that, as my time is limited.</p> <p>  I want to talk about the big picture.  We have talked about the pieces that need to be done and about the legislation already in play.  I will address two other pieces that I feel we need if we are to take leaps forward: the statutory entitlement to home care and the regulation of home care.  How quickly and how massively can we scale that up?  Has it in fact now moved to the point where we have delayed in delivering these, and the level of ambition has to actually increase to look not just at a statutory entitlement to regulated home care but a statutory entitlement to personal assistance so a person could have that political, cultural and full participation in life?  Should we raise the ambition of that as well as delivering it?  That is from the individual perspective.</p> <p>  From a societal perspective, reference was made to the public sector duty.  I know Mr. Dolan.  I co-sponsored legislation with him around how we could put community participation into effect.  In this context, I turn to the national development plan and local development plans.  The national development plan is a huge amount of capital expenditure.  I want both plans trained in on climate change and the UN convention, both of which demand new thinking from local authorities in a really big way.  What would a huge leap forward look like on the national development plan and in local development plans?</p> <p>  The Community Participation (Disability) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been hanging around forever and has never moved forward.  If the witnesses were to pick one unexpected or other element, something that is missing from the Bill, what would they add to it?  I am looking to what is coming through.</p><p>I thank Mr. Dolan, and again, I thank Deputy Canney, who has facilitated me jumping his place in the conversation.</p></speech>

Will Ms Dempsey respond to Senator Higgins and perhaps to other points that have been raised in the conversation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#L00300"><p>Yes; if I cannot cover all of them some of my colleagues might jump in.  Regarding digital empowerment, Inclusion Ireland ran a right to connect conference last December on International Day of People with Disabilities, which looked at people's access, particularly because of Covid-19, to both the web and the infrastructure, for instance, smartphones and iPads.  We take for granted that everybody hits their teenage years and gets access to a smartphone once they go to post-primary school.  Some adults with intellectual disabilities, however, do not have any connectivity and have been extremely isolated both when living at home with ageing parents or in services.  What we would like to see installed is that people have a right to connect and again, looking a couple of years ahead and at potential future restrictions, that people are supported with the infrastructure, which incorporates things like the national broadband plan, as well as in terms of financing.</p> <p> The interrelationship between poverty and employment stretches back to education.  What education path does a person therefore take?  If one looks at a special education pathway from the point of a three-year-old, we know that by the time that person is 18 or 19, he or she will probably still be in a special educational setting.  We have to look at the outcomes of that, which is quite often young people going into day services that are more special all the time.  That leads us into poverty.</p> <p>  There are two reports the committee should be seeking.  One is the cost of disability report that is sitting in the Department of Social Protection.  As Dr. McCarthy said, we know the cost of disability and the level of poverty right across the strata of people with disabilities and family carers.  We need the Government's report to be able to evidence that in figures that the Government itself will accept, however.  The other is the capacity review of disability services.  It is extremely hard to plan ahead if we do not have sight of what the unmet need is going to be over the next 20 or 30 years.  We know it is significant because the report was there and available to the previous Minister for Health, who passed it on to the current Minister for Health and said it was a decision for the new Government to publish that plan.  Again, I ask the committee to chase up the capacity review and have it published formally in order that we actually know what we are dealing with as regards disability services and the unmet needs of people with disabilities in the community.</p> <p>  Regarding the right to home care and the statutory scheme, a person does not have the right to stay in his or her own home and be provided with State support to do so.  A person can, however, have the right to go into a nursing home and have the care he or she requires.  That is not even suitable for many elderly people, let alone those under 65.  Parents must therefore make decisions with their young persons with disabilities.  I am a parent and I have aspirations for all my children.  For some of my children, however, my choices are extremely limited if I cannot get the funding in order that they can live independently.  And again, living independently does not mean living alone without supports.  It means being given the supports so that one can live independently of one's family members.</p> <p>  If we look to ageing parents, Senator Bacik referenced St. Mary's Centre Telford.  In the HSE's service plan for 2021, outside of emergency residential placements there is only provision for double-digit figures for planned transitional residential placements.  That means significantly fewer than 100 people will be able to plan where they are going to live in the community with the required supports and everybody else will be pushed into emergency placements.  At this stage, emergency placements are what we are talking about when parents die.  That is a traumatic time for anybody with a disability but to be removed from one's family home and put into an emergency placement, quite often respite, which then means those who would normally have respite in that centre cannot have it there, especially during the time of Covid-19, is no way for future planning for anybody.  That is what we are resorting to, however.  For the first time in the HSE service plan, therefore, there is provision for planned transitions, that is, incorporating the voice of the person with disability into what they want, for example, who they want to live with, where they would like to live and what life they want to lead.  It is led by them.  Out of a country of 5.5 million people, however, we have provision for a double-digit number of people to engage in that process.  That is scandalous.  And when one adds in the 2,900 in congregated settings, I am talking about individuals who are currently living at home.  There is very little focus on that cohort.  We really need to readdress this in terms of actual transition planning with the voices.  That is part of what would be required for the State to meet its obligation in terms of the right to statutory home care</p> <p>  I mentioned broadband with regard to the national development plan.  Senator McGreehan mentioned disability awareness training versus having awareness training around environmental issues.  If we had both, the Senator would realise that, for example, straws were developed for people with disabilities.  They were not developed to put into a cocktail along with an umbrella.  The removal of things that contain plastic, such as straws, removes something that is fundamental to some people's ability to drink independently.  If, therefore, we have awareness training, which like everything else is siloed, we will miss the impact on certain cohorts within our communities.</p></speech>

I thank the guests for their input.  I have written down a few key words but one thing that is becoming abundantly clear and is most important is the fact that we need an implementation programme for everything we talk about.  I will go back to what Mr. Dolan said about the role of the Taoiseach's office in all this.  We have enough reviews, committees, working groups and all these types of gatherings.  A huge amount of people have brought forward parts of the problem within this area of disabilities.  I have come across some of it myself.  I do not know where to jump when I want to find out something because there are so many places one can go.  Usually, one goes to five places before finding the place one needs to get the structure right.</p> <p>  Mr. Dolan alluded to the fact that when we had a jobs crisis, it was a cross-departmental issue.  It was also targeted, however, by which I mean a plan was set out for five years with a target every year.  There was a review every three months, however.  The Minister in charge of it and probably one or two people in his Department, therefore, monitored what was happening on a quarterly basis.  If something was not happening, they asked why it was not happening.  It was flagged up with colours where red meant something had not moved and green meant it had moved and been achieved.</p> <p>  As my background is in project management, I like the term "project management approach".  We need to set out a five-year implementation plan, not a strategy; we have enough strategies.  There have been remonstrations.  People said they spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about the optional protocol.  That can be done when something else is done.  The question is who is doing that other thing to make sure the protocols are put in place.</p> <p>  From listening to the debate, the expression I would use is we have a fragmented approach at the moment.  Too many organs within the State are doing bits and pieces.  Somebody mentioned that a &euro;5 million fund was announced this week for employment for people with disabilities.  I did not know about it until I heard it today.  Things are happening that we do not know about.  We also need a co-ordinated approach to this in order that we know what to expect and when it will happen.  Then, we as a committee can challenge why something is not happening if it does not happen on time.  It goes back to that.</p> <p>  We have seen today, no more than any other time we meet witnesses, that we are learning more and more.  I am, however, more drawn to the conclusion that we need to do what Mr. Dolan said and put pressure on the Taoiseach to put in place an implementation team with somebody at its head who will call the shots and ask why this and that is not being done.  We need to bring together all the departmental officials to say this is our plan, this is how and when we will do it and then put the funding in place in order that it is achieved.  The legislation that is required to change things should be put in place in a proper timeframe rather than waiting for somebody else to do something.</p><p> It has been very interesting to hear what the witnesses had to say.  I can sense the frustration in everybody around these issues.  We need to be able to say when we will be getting on the train and starting to move towards getting things achieved and ticking the boxes that have not been ticked.  I said at the first meeting of this committee that my aim is to work to remove some of the things that I personally, as a politician, am not very proud of when it comes to disability services.  There are issues we need to address very quickly.  I thank the witnesses for their input and look forward to working with them to achieve what we are all trying to achieve, namely, putting the plan in place, with somebody at the head of it who will call the shots and get it done.  The funding must be provided by Government and looking to the Taoiseach's office is the way to do that.  When the Taoiseach says at or before a Cabinet meeting that he wants a report on something, he will get that report.  We need to have a person at the top who will make sure this is a national issue rather than being segregated off and spread all over the place, with nothing being achieved other than frustration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.206" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joanne McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021042000002#M00200"><p>I thank Deputy Canney and Senator Higgins.  There is a kind of commonality in the issues they raised.  I am delighted to see the integrity with which members have listened to us today.  I can really hear it in the questions they have asked and that is very welcome.  One of the key points to make is that there is a great deal of detail to consider because the area of disability is dense.  We know that because we work in the field.  Several times, members asked me questions and something popped into the back of my head but I still cannot give a simple answer.  The whole subject is really dense.</p> <p>  One of the key points we are taking from this meeting is that we all would really welcome a role for the Taoiseach in the implementation plan.  Looking to see where that stitch can be made is very important.  Another point is that we need a plan that is not just around telling us how much is going on and the activity that is happening.  It would be hugely welcome to have it built into the plan that there would be a consideration of the impact of that activity.  We know there is a plethora of policy and legislation that is hanging around and has not been delivered.  That needs to be front and centre of the plan in order that we can begin to tick through it systematically.  The policy and legislation are there and they have to be implemented.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins spoke about the big things that need to be done.  We too often think about disability services in terms of little boxes.  We talk about the people who get day services, for example, and the people who get personal assistance hours.  In fact, the convention asks us to think about what we have to do to ensure people can have ordinary but good-quality lives in ordinary places.  Article 19, one of the core articles in the convention, deals with the right to live independently.  We need to ask whether people have the right to personal assistance hours and whether the State is planning for the appropriate hours.  We talk about a statutory right to home care services.  That right will be a noose around the neck of many people with disabilities because, although it will give them the right to have someone come into their home to get them out of bed in the morning, they will then be trapped like a prisoner in their own home because they will not have the personal assistance supports to enable them to attend further education, go to work, do the shopping or meet friends.  No single Department can answer the right of people to have a good-quality life that is worth living in the community.</p> <p>  When we think about the implementation plan, we must go through the Acts and policies that are yet to be delivered.  Then we have to think about the fact that doing more of the same is not going to give us what we need.  We need to think about our expectation and what is put into the system to invest in delivery.  We have talked about the digital poverty experience of people with disabilities, an issue that the Disability Federation of Ireland and others have been talking about for some time.  We highlighted that issue at an Oireachtas committee meeting we attended in 2017.  It took a pandemic, when everything went online, for us to see the real lived evidence of that.  People could not access any services because they did not have access to computers, were not trained to access them or were living in places with broadband blackouts.  There is a reality we have to think about in terms of what is required for people and the fact the answer will not always be day services, residential care or nursing homes.  We need to think about the other models we want to put in place.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins spoke about ambition and aiming high.  In the context of an implementation plan, we should look at each convention article and name the multiple Departments that will have a responsibility to deliver on that article.  There is also a need to name any challenges that arise between two Departments or agencies working together that are hampering the delivery of an article.  An expectation should then be put in place, over two years, four years and six years, around where they need to get to in achieving that delivery, and that is what people will be brought before the committee to discuss.</p></speech>

I thank members for attending the briefing this morning and tuning into the meeting.  It is hugely important that we continue this engagement.  The frustration of members is clear.  The restrictions over the past six months mean we are finding it more difficult to do our work and continue the work that is in place.</p> <p>  A number of points came across this morning.  One is the importance of a whole-of-government approach or a direction from the centre of government in terms of how we are going to implement change and ensure disability is kept to the forefront.  I thank the witnesses for the invitation they issued to us.  We would dearly love to meet with them in their places of work and see what is being done.  We commit to doing that the very minute restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>  Another point that came across is that there is much work to be done to knit everything together.  There is a sense in some arms of the State that there should be a centralised model or approach.  Likewise, we get the sense from the various section 39 organisations with which we have engaged that the approach should be streamlined.  I am not sure that is the right way to do it, because differences can be useful.  For instance, the point that was made about the different types of schools shows that things can all work under the one umbrella provided the policy is right.</p> <p>  In my view, the fundamental issue underpinning all of this is the question of resources.  We have seen how the limited change there has been since the budget in reversing cuts and putting in further funding has somewhat eased the situation.  Several members spoke about how the provision of therapies and assessments of need is in an absolutely shambolic state right now.  We need to advocate on behalf of the people who need those services.  The witnesses' evidence has shown us that there is a lot of work to do.  The new word for my vocabulary is "implementitis".  It is a concept we need to take away from this meeting.  We have had enough talk about what we need to do.  Certain Parts of the Disability Act that was passed almost a generation ago have still not been enacted.  These are issues we need to tackle as a committee.  We must have a whole-of-government approach.  Our hope is that we will have representatives from every Department before us to discuss how they are implementing the UNCRPD and making changes in how they deal with disability issues.  That is our hope and ambition for the service.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  We look forward to further engagement with them as we try to advance the lived experience of people with disabilities.  We need to keep that at the forefront.  On the point about the title of the committee, that was decided on by the committee itself.  We will continue our work on disability matters and I thank witnesses sincerely for their help in this regard.  I wish them well in their continued good work and look forward to further discussions with them.  I would appreciate if members could remain online for a brief private discussion.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Deputies Harkin and Calleary.</p> <p>  This is a very important session on EU industrial policy priorities, including vaccine production and digital transformation.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Thierry Breton, Commissioner for the Internal Market, European Commission.  We are looking forward to this engagement.  I thank the Commissioner for the important detail of keeping his presentation brief, which will allow for more engagement.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Commissioner must be at another meeting by 10.40 a.m.  He has obliged us by providing a short opening statement and I will try to get all members into the session.  I call the Commissioner to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

This is a timely exchange; it is important to do it ahead of the industrial strategy update, which the Commission will present next week.  This will support the triple transition to make our industry more green, digital and resilient.</p><p> I will not go into detail now, although I will address one area that clearly illustrates the importance of resilience, which the Chairman mentioned, namely, our vaccine production strategy.  Today we face an historical challenge, that of vaccinating Europe and the world in record time.  We overcame the scientific challenge by developing vaccines.  That was done mainly thanks to European research, as four of the vaccines we are using or will use have been developed in Europe.  The challenge is now an industrial one, namely, to produce them.  No country can do this alone.  Therefore, I am convinced that European solidarity is the only way to avoid vaccine nationalism.  The industrial ramp-up is today a reality.  Since January, Europe's vaccine production capacity has doubled every other month.  By the second quarter, we expect 410 million doses to be delivered to member states.  This included the 50 million additional doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which we agreed to front-load from quarter 4 to quarter 2.  For Ireland, for example, this means an additional 400,000 doses that were not planned.  Ireland will receive between 4.5 million and 5 million doses in quarter 2.  This is of course a tremendous jump over what it was in the first quarter; indeed it is three times more.  This is also, by the way, the case for all of the EU.  In addition, our factories are producing for the world.  We are the only continent to do this.  We can be proud of that but it is in our interest.  We are of course producing for the UK; 70% of its vaccines are coming from Europe.  Men and women are working day and night, seven days a week, to produce enough vaccines for the British, for our partners, but also for Covax.  The reason for this is clear: it is, as I said, in our collective interest to avoid the development of variants elsewhere.  This task is today on the shoulders of the EU.  However, we are doing this without any naivete thanks to our export transparency scheme.  This also helps me to better monitor our production.</p><p> The challenge now for member states is to scale up vaccination campaigns and to fight vaccine hesitancy.  To conclude on this point, I am confident that by mid-July we will have produced enough doses to fully vaccinate 70% of the adult population, which is something extremely important.  By the end of the year we will have an annual production capacity of more than 3 billion doses.  Again, this is extremely important and we will need these to be prepared for the variants and new evolutions of the pandemic, if necessary.  The work does not stop here.  From this perspective, we need to prepare ourselves.  This is why we have put in place the so-called &ldquo;Hera Incubator&rdquo;.  The Commission is negotiating with Pfizer-BioNTech for 1.8 billion supplementary doses until 2023 as these may be needed for variants.  Negotiations with other manufacturers may come on top of that.</p><p> I would like to end my introduction with a few words on digital matters, which are of particular relevance to Ireland.  The Commission recently presented the Digital Decade, which will serve as a compass to guide us in four key areas: skills, infrastructure, business and public services.  We are acting on two dimensions, namely, the modernisation of our regulatory framework, and the support to digital sovereignty.</p><p> On the regulatory framework, the Commission has proposed several major Bills on data and platforms.  I will just mention the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act.  While the Digital Services Act provides modernised routes to combat the distribution and sale of illegal content and goods online, the Digital Markets Act targets gatekeepers to prevent them creating unfair conditions and competitions within the ecosystem in which they operate.  The objective is very clear.  The platforms must adapt to EU rules and not the reverse.  Europe is, and will remain, open to anyone who is willing to play by the rules.  We are creating a digital space that ensures equal and better protection for consumers across the Union while allowing individual companies to scale up and grow in the Single Market.  For this we also need strong co-operation between national regulators to avoid the current fragmentation.</p><p> The second dimension is about reducing Europe&rsquo;s strategic dependencies in key infrastructure and technologies.  We are working on four fronts: connectivity with 5G and 6G but also a space-based connectivity project to allow all of Europe to have access to broadband Internet; microelectronics, where we want to be able to design and produce the most powerful and resource-efficient processors in the EU; cloud technology, where we must develop European alternatives to hyper-scalers to store and process the most sensitive data; and finally high-performance computers, where our ambition is to acquire for Europe three supercomputers that are in the top 5 globally.  This is about preparing Europe for the industrial data wave ahead of us.</p><p> I do not want to be too long.  Whether it is on vaccine production or on digital transformation, we must aim to make Europe stronger.  Through the European recovery plan, the ground-breaking and largest stimulus package ever, we now have the means for this ambition, but member states must take this opportunity.  I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

I have two questions on different issues.  On vaccines, we as Europeans are all extraordinarily proud of the speed of development of vaccines.  It was a scientific achievement probably unparalleled in medicine and one to which Europe had significant input.  However, Europe did allow the US, the UK and Israel to steal a march ahead of us where the pre-purchase and acquisition of vaccines is concerned.  Have we learned from that experience for the next phase or indeed the next pandemic?  Can the Commissioner tell us succinctly how we will not make that mistake again?</p> <p>  My other questions concern the separate issue of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act.  I do not know whether the Commissioner has had an opportunity to look at the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2020 we recently enacted.  It is intended to protect the public space for citizens so that the Internet is as protected as any public park or street against harassment and abuse.  Does the Commissioner think that would require a pan-European law?  Control of digital platforms was a real difficulty for us in that legislation; a single country cannot do that.  If one looks, for example, at Facebook and Twitter banning Mr. Donald Trump for his extremist utterances, surely it cannot be for corporate bodies and platforms to make the determination of what is and is not acceptable.  Surely that should be a matter for democratic accountability.  Will that be regulated in the European sphere?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thierry Breton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042000002#B00600"><p>On the first question, as the committee will know, I was tasked with being the head of the European vaccine task force on 5 February.</p><p>To tell the committee the truth, I looked very carefully at the situation.  When I started this new mission, it is true that I had the same feeling as Deputy Howlin.  I will tell him very honestly, I do not share his view.  I respect his position because I know that his view is probably widely spread, even though I would like to share with the Parliament that it is not exactly my view.</p><p> The US, the UK and Israel were mentioned.  As member states, we can be proud that this is again a tremendous success for European science.  Four of the five vaccines that will be approved have been developed in Europe.  It is fair to say that if science has been developed here in Europe, we have been able to benefit from the US agency, which was put in place in 2006 after the events of 9/11 in order to cope with biological war or similar attacks.  This agency has the ability to put in a lot of money to accelerate development in cases of necessity and this is what happened.  In other words, we developed science on this side of the Atlantic and we were able to partner with our US friends to benefit from the money they have been able to put in, including in European companies, to speed up the way we deliver vaccines which are working.  At the same time, as Deputy Howlin rightly said, we had to ramp up our industrial base extremely quickly, as never in history, to be able to produce enough vaccines for everyone.</p><p> I do not want to criticise the US because, in my position, I respect everyone.  However, the US made an executive order stating that it will not export one single drop of vaccine until it has reached immunity.  We are the only ones to decide that 60% of our production will be dedicated to member states and 40% for export to our friends and partners, including, by the way, NATO members.  We are the only one to do this in Europe.  We have been able to ramp up 53 factories very quickly.  It was my task to make sure that everything was working on time.  It is my pleasure to report to the joint committee today that we have developed this at exactly the same speed as the US.  In other words, at the end of quarter 1 both the US and Europe have been able to produce roughly 12 million doses and now we are accelerating.  I believe that at the end of the year we will be producing more vaccines than the US.</p><p> The point about Israel is very interesting.  I would not encourage the monitoring or control of what is happening in another country.  Israel is an important country and has 9 million inhabitants.  There was an agreement between Pfizer and Israel to get the required doses to vaccinate 50% of the population in exchange for a health study in an anonymised way.  That is what has been done.  We produced the vaccines for Israel in our factories in Europe.  It is important for Pfizer to monitor the process.  It would have been impossible, first, if we had not produced enough doses.  In Europe, like in the US, we produced and delivered 14 million does in January.  In February, we produced 28 million doses, in March, 60 million, and in April, 120 million doses.  We could not do the same thing with our 446 million inhabitants.</p><p> We signed an agreement with AstraZeneca in August one day before the UK did so.  We were the first to sign.  We are still in the process of investigating the reasons.  We ordered 120 million doses from AstraZeneca in quarter 1 and 180 million doses in quarter 2 but, unfortunately, the company delivered only 30 million doses.  In other words, it delivered only 25% of its commitment to us in Europe in quarter 1, while we understand that it delivered everything which was planned for British citizens.  It is not my intention to make any comments, except that if AstraZeneca, which has its headquarters in London, had delivered on its commitment on the other side of the Channel, we would today be the first ones to be vaccinated.  The good news is that we are accelerating dramatically and we will be able to deliver probably enough vaccines so that by mid-July Ireland will receive enough doses to be able to vaccinate at least 70% of the adult population, which is extremely important, while the UK said its target was one dose by the end of July for each British citizen.  By the way, I would like to tell the committee-----</p></speech>

They are important.  He referred to 70% but there was a bit of interference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thierry Breton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042000002#C00300"><p>In quarter 1, we delivered 1.3 million doses to Ireland.  In quarter 2, it will be 4.25 million doses and then by mid-July it will probably be between 5.5 million and 6 million doses.  The number of adults in Ireland is 3.7 million.  This includes also some doses coming from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, which offers a one-shot vaccine.  This is why we are confident that we be able to deliver enough doses.  It is up to member states to organise themselves.  It will require a very rapid acceleration to be ready for that.  I understand that 12 member states on the list have said that they are fully comfortable with 70%.  This number is increasing on a daily basis.  As I said in my introductory remarks, it will depend on the ability of the countries to organise mass vaccinations in order to be able to reach 70% of the adult population by mid-July and to make sure that one's fellow citizens will accept to be vaccinated.</p> <p>  If the Chairman wishes, I could say a few words on the task force.  The lesson has been learned.  We need to organise.  We have a task force now.  Before signing a new contract now, I asked all the negotiators to make sure that before signing the definitive agreement my task force will investigate and ensure that the pharmaceutical companies with whom we sign up will be able to deliver what they commit to do.  The lesson has been learned.  We need to have this task force, which is organised now.  It will be a good tool to make sure that we can select good partners, like we have done with Pfizer, which did not just deliver, it over-delivered, and also to follow on a daily basis their production capacity in order to give the right, accurate information to allow member states to organise their own campaign.</p></speech>

The Commissioner mentioned the stark failure of AstraZeneca to meet its commitments to the European Union.  I welcome his comments during the week that future orders should look to the companies that have been successful and that have stood by their contracts.  Much credit must go to Pfizer BioNTech which has done so much heavy lifting for all across the EU and particularly Ireland.  What ramifications will there be post pandemic for companies which have failed, through questionable means, to meet their contractual obligations to the citizens of the EU in vaccine delivery, which is so vital in returning life and society to normal as well as, crucially, saving lives?</p><p> The Commissioner said that 12 member states are comfortable they will be able to achieve 70% roll-out and I have no doubt Ireland will be one of those.  What tools will the EU deploy to ensure solidarity across the EU and, indeed, the wider world?  Until all are vaccinated, the virus will remain a massive threat to the whole world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thierry Breton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042000002#D00200"><p>As I said, we have not decided how we will continue to work in the future but it is important we learn which companies are able to fulfil their commitments.</p> <p>  On the legal part of the question, of course we have a contract.  I am the one who is the first to trigger, to say there is something wrong happening that we do not understand.  My goal was to ensure we got the vaccines as soon as possible and I tried to do everything I can to help with companies, including AstraZeneca.  We have contracts and we sent a legal letter to AstraZeneca, which it has 20 days to answer.  That is now in the hands of the legal department.</p> <p>  I acknowledge it is extremely difficult to ramp up such a production so quickly.  We will probably be the first continent in vaccine production using technology that never existed before at this scale.  We should remember there was never a factory that could produce this many doses of a new vaccine.  The good news is we have such a large portfolio that now we will be able to fulfil our commitment.  The legal department will do what it has to.</p> <p>  Member states are part of the vaccination campaign.  I said there are already 12 member states which have said they see this and can organise it themselves.  I have no doubt the 27 member states, in the coming days and weeks, will agree the target as they become comfortable they will receive the necessary doses to reach the target.  The target is important.  Some have spoken of it being the beginning of global unity - I am not an epidemiologist myself, I am just repeating what I hear in expert debates - but it is also important to give some light at the end of the tunnel for our citizens, including before the holiday season.  That is very important after everything we have gone through collectively and individually.  That is also why we decided to put the green certificate in place to start to reopen our borders for travel.</p> <p>  The vaccine strategy in the EU is based on solidarity and it has worked.  I know it was challenging at the beginning, I accept that, but at the end of the day it has worked.  No one single country could have done this.  We have been able to do this all together.  There was a challenge at the beginning but it is important to avoid vaccine nationalism.  We also bear on our shoulders the vaccination of the world today.  We are the only group to export vaccines massively outside Europe.  We are doing this for our allies, partners and for our NATO allies, and it is our responsibility to do this in the future with COVAX and for Africa.  It is also in our interest.  The Deputy mentioned what will happen if we do not do this.  Look at what happened in the UK.  It started its campaign, then there was the British variant, and now there is the Brazil variant.  It is in our interest to ensure we can help everyone with the industrial facility we have now in Europe.</p></speech>

I also raise global solidarity and the procurement of vaccines for developing countries.  The entire EU pledge to COVAX is now &euro;2.2 billion.  Is the EU doing enough to ensure global vaccination?  Is there a timescale for the world to be vaccinated?  As everyone has said, no one is safe until all of us are safe.  The EU is only part of the global situation, but what is the timeline for mass global vaccination?</p> <p>  Following on from the previous speaker's remarks on AstraZeneca and its failure to produce and deliver enough vaccines, what is the EU's current position with that company?  It has let us all down.  Are those problems resolved?  Where are we in discussions and negotiations with AstraZeneca?</p> <p>  Finally, is there a timescale for finalising the digital green certificate?  It has to go before the European Parliament.  Will it cover travel only or might it be used in other circumstances?  If so, are there issues around civil liberty, such as the right to privacy and the right to bodily integrity?  Will the Commissioner confirm that the certificate will only relate to foreign travel within the EU and some adjacent states?</p></speech>

We can be proud of that, but in a more selfish way it is also in our interest.  It is not enough but we are the only one using our own production to donate significantly to COVAX.  Of course, there are other donors but we are already exporting vaccines to more than 150 countries either through the COVAX instrument or directly.  We do our fair share without putting the EU vaccination strategy in danger.  It is in the ramping-up phase.</p> <p>  I have had a lot of discussions with my counterpart in the US.  The EU is doing this alone and we will be very pleased when the US rejoins.  It is to be hoped that will be soon because it is a big task but we have to do it.</p> <p>  We ordered 200 million doses which we hope to have in the second quarter.  We expect to deliver between 800 million to 1 billion doses in the second half of the year.</p><p>Of course, we may not need all of that supply.  We may need part of it for the variants.  Companies are already working on a specific booster, if it is needed.  We will also have other doses and, as I mentioned, member states will be part owners of those doses.  Those member states will have the ability to do what they want with those doses, and that includes donating them.  This is an important topic and we will have to discuss it further in the second half of the year, but I am totally with the Deputy.  This is a joint fight.  We hope that before the end of the summer, the US and Europe will have vaccinated their adult populations.  Europe represents only 10% of the population of the planet.  That is why it is extremely important.</p><p> On the question on AstraZeneca, I cannot comment because we are in a legal proceeding.  I can tell the Deputy AstraZeneca has committed to deliver 70 million doses in quarter 2.  A big part of that total is coming from European factories.  AstraZeneca also wants to use the worldwide supply chain.  I have no doubt that AstraZeneca is making its best efforts to achieve delivery of 70 million vaccines.  As I said at the beginning, thanks to the additional 50 million doses coming from Pfizer that we did not expect, we can have a level of comfort.  I worked in industry before I became a Commissioner and can tell the committee that, of course, nothing is certain, especially in the vaccine industry.  However, we can have a level of comfort about the fact that we will be able to deliver the number of doses needed to achieve the mid-July target.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about the digital green certificate.  It is important to note the certificate is not a passport.  It is to simplify schedules.  Its use will be limited to the time of the pandemic.  It will have simple information and will be totally protected because the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is mandatory and there is absolutely no reason the data will be used for other reasons.  It will, of course, be in the hands of member states.  We want to have exactly the same procedures and format across EU member states.  If citizens of member states are asked for the certificate should they want to go to another country and if someone is travelling by aeroplane, it is easier to have the certificate and it will facilitate boarding.  The certificate will not be mandatory so if an EU citizen does not have a certificate, an airline company may require a PCR test, as they do today.  This tool could be used or it could be on paper.  If a passenger does not have a PCR test, an airline company may ask him or her to undergo a rapid test, or whatever.  It will definitely be a tool, although it will not be mandatory.  The certificate regime will be in the hands of the member states to decide what they want to do with it.  We know that it will be an extremely important tool to allow our fellow citizens to travel more safely and freely.  There is &euro;30 million in my portfolio to help member states to develop this certificate, if necessary.  We also have a technical team and if it is necessary, we can put the team at the disposal of some member states when required because our target is to be ready by the end of June.  There will be no exchange of personal data.  There will be a certified and secure QR code.</p></speech>

We welcome the idea of a block buy across Europe and the element of solidarity that will ensure that everybody gets the vaccine.  I accept that the European Union, in allowing exports, also allows for other places to be vaccinated.  I would like to home in on Mr. Breton's work as a vaccine hunter, which is a nickname I commend him on as it is one I would not mind having.  We talk about the huge number of vaccines that had been exported.  At the end of March, that figure was around 77 million doses.  We had a stash, for want of a better term, of AstraZeneca and that was said to be down to the work of Mr. Breton and I commend him on that.  I add my voice to those of everyone else in saying that AstraZeneca did seem to engage in fly-boy capitalism.  Perhaps the piece of work that Mr. Breton was doing should have kicked into action quicker.  Could he give the detail of how that worked?  What were his successes?</p> <p>  There is a wider conversation about finding out the absolute capacity that exists within the pharmaceutical industry from the point of view of producing as many vaccines as possible for Europe and the entire world.  As has already been said, none of us is safe until all of us are safe.  I accept its involvement with COVAX, but has the Commission looked into the likes of the coronavirus treatment acceleration programme, CTAP, and the idea of pharmaceutical companies forgoing, for a fair price, intellectual property and so on, to ensure that we get maximum roll-out?  We have been told that roll-out in some parts of the world will not happen until 2023 or 2024.  We know the difficulties around strains of the virus.  That could have a considerable cost in terms of lives and health but could cost trillions in world trade.  We cannot afford not to vaccinate everyone.  Will Mr. Breton give me any information he has on that matter?</p> <p>  Will Mr. Breton give me his view on his dealings with the British Government as regards the Irish protocol and where it stands at the moment?  I know that nobody is ever certain of where they stand when they are negotiating with a British Government.  </p> <p>  I would also like to know the Commission's view on mandatory hotel quarantine, if Mr. Breton has time to reply.  He might have to come back to me on that in writing.  It seems the Commission may have a difficulty with hotel quarantine.  We are, obviously, very worried about different strains of the virus, particularly the B1617 variant from India.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thierry Breton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042000002#E01500"><p>The Deputy has asked many questions.  I will try to summarise.  I was tasked with this mission on 5 February.  Some people have said that we should have started a little earlier.  I remind the committee that the world was positively surprised when it realised at the beginning of December that some vaccines were working and required to be approved by our authorities and agencies.  That was true of Pfizer at the beginning of December, Moderna at the end of December and AstraZeneca at the end of January.  I was tasked in early February.  I immediately went to sites to try to see how the ramp-up was going.</p><p>As I mentioned, there are 53 sites across Europe.  Of course, I did not visit all of them but, together with the team I created for this specific task, I visited many of them.  One of my biggest concerns related to the ramp-up having to be done in less than ten months, with some aspects having to be done in six months, which is a significant increase for this industry where it would usually take years to ramp-up in this way.  That is why what has been done is very impressive.  It was part of the criteria for selecting companies.  All the scientific part of the vaccines were developed by biotech or academic teams such as those at BioNTech CureVac, Janssen or Oxford University.  They were developed by very small teams which, it is important to remember, were funded by EU money.  However, those teams did not have expertise of developing vaccines, which is why we favoured their entering into a partnership with a big pharmaceutical company which could be the one to produce vaccines.  It was not easy because some of the companies did not know how to work together.</p><p> The second part we had to get right was the supply chain, which was extremely important.  Of course, when you ramp up supply chains across a continent so quickly, with so many factories involved, there were instances of tension.  The vaccines have between 300 and 500 components, so my biggest fear was whether we would be able to meet the requirements for some of the produce.  That is why I immediately contacted Mr. Jeff Zients, my counterpart in the US.  I wanted to make sure that we could exchange produce.  Even if the United States had an executive order in place relating to the vaccines, I wanted to ensure we could have free co-operation in terms of the supply chain at least to avoid problems in this phase.  There were some problems and I had to discuss many issues with the US authorities, but finally it worked more smoothly.  We learned how to work together and it worked more smoothly than it did at the beginning.  I did not know that some people refer to me as a vaccine hunter.  I do not know how to take that.</p><p> It is important to state that I am very proud of what I have seen on the ground, with many entrepreneurs, some of whom are competitors, working together to try to find solutions.  We ran a very important matchmaking event which we invited all the relevant companies, including those from Ireland, to join.  We had two days together.  Companies outlined what they could offer or needed.  I hate to use this comparison but it is quite like we are at war.  Even the companies that were competitors now work together on this common joint objective.</p><p> Intellectual property is a very important issue.  We need to have this debate but my recommendation is that it should not be opened now because the key for us now is to produce a massive amount of vaccines.  This is what we are doing.  We should not destabilise the process.  We must also make sure that we will be able to deliver enough doses for our partners outside Europe, including in Africa.  That is extremely important.  If we made the patent available free of charge and linked up with factories in Asia, for example, such as in India or elsewhere, it would take many months or possibly years to adapt the factory lines to produce the vaccines, especially the mRNA vaccines, but also the adenovirus vaccines which are quite complex.  That would not solve the current issue.  It is something we need to put on the agenda and discuss for the future but, as the person responsible for the vaccine task force and making sure the ramp-up of factories delivers what is needed for us and for the world, I think we are still at war and will prefer to focus on this issue.  We will need to discuss the issue of intellectual property in the near future, it is hoped when this pandemic is behind us.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I detect the collective solidarity of the EU.  All present know Mr. Breton is not the Commissioner on behalf of France or Ireland but, rather, the Commissioner on behalf of the EU.  We thank him for his valiant efforts to date.</p> <p>  I am appealing to Mr. Breton to be a Commissioner for countries beyond the EU.  Will he assure us he is aware the world is divided into haves and have-nots, them and us, and those living in Third World countries feel like fifth-class citizens and like they are at the back of the queue?  Will the Commissioner be a leading voice and use his pivotal and influential role to do his utmost in the name of global solidarity?  It is necessary to extend the approach from EU solidarity to world solidarity.  Is he aware of the divisive fears of many that they will be left behind?  Is he acutely aware of that?  Does he have a separate task force or division set up to tackle that issue?  I know he is working very hard in his influential position to help the less well-off, the poor, the disadvantaged and those who have no voice.  Ireland has a voice.  The Commissioner has given the committee a very informative presentation on how we are doing in Ireland but our small nation has a brilliant reputation for standing up for the less well-off.  Through the years, we have displayed generosity that far exceeds our population size.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the digital age.  I know Deputy Howlin and others have touched on this issue.  The Commissioner is aware of the vile abuse of ethnic minorities and the disgusting tirade of homophobic abuse on social media.  It is so important that connectivity is not abused.  What is the greatest facility of this generation has also proven to be one of the most divisive, unsupervised and cowardly ways faceless people can abuse others, sometimes to such an extent that the victims take their own lives.  I am convinced this issue will someday be resolved, but I have seen no progress whatsoever in tackling the wanton abuse and aggression on social media, mostly targeted at vulnerable people.  When will there be a tangible breakthrough rather than just tinkering at the edges?  Will that happen during Mr. Breton's term as Commissioner?  I know it is a global issue and it is a big ask, but it is a very important thing to ask.  Will he play his role in putting manners on those on social media, for once and for all, as well as the profit-making people who are allowed to do what they want?  We cannot trust them and the attempts to tackle them have, to date, clearly failed. When will the EU come together with its partners throughout the world to state that enough is enough?  When can we expect the cowardly and faceless persons who propagate this disgusting and vile abuse to be stopped?</p> <p>  My third point-----</p></speech>

I know the time of the Commissioner is precious and that my fellow Oireachtas Members are waiting to come in.  I had one other question but I know the Commissioner will come back before the committee in the future.  These exercises are so important in the democratic process and feeling part of the EU.  I have another question but I will put it off for another day.</p></speech>

There were two big items on the agenda for this meeting, namely, the digital transformation and vaccine production, but the issue of vaccination has dominated the discussion, so the Commissioner may wish to appear again before the committee at his convenience to deal with the digital side of things.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thierry Breton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042000002#F00800"><p>I would be delighted to be invited to appear again before the committee.  Senator Martin raised two very important topics.  The first touched me personally because I am extremely involved in Africa.</p><p>It is an important area in respect of the production of vaccines.  We are not only working to produce the doses for our African partners and others, but I remind members that we have the capacity to produce over 3 billion doses by the end of the year.  Hopefully, we will have a huge stock of vaccines in the second half of year.  That is important.  </p><p> However, it is not enough.  We also need to help these countries to develop their own capacity to produce vaccines and to enable them to meet the needs of their citizens.  From that perspective, last week I had a long conversation with the President of Senegal, Mr. Macky Sall, who will be President of the African Union next year.  We decided to start looking into the development of a large vaccine factory, hopefully in Senegal.  Senegal has a long history of developing vaccines at the Pasteur Institute of Dakar.  We are working to find the right tools to do this very quickly.  Of course, we all understand that it is our mission to help everyone during this pandemic and also to prepare for the next one.  Unfortunately, with between 8 billion and 10 billion inhabitants on our planet, there may be, and probably will be, another pandemic.  That is why we are doing this work.</p><p> The Irish Government has a very strong relationship with the US President, particularly at the moment.  I understand that he likes Ireland.  Perhaps it would be a good idea for the Irish Government to use its influence, which is considerable.  Having lived in the US for many years, I know that the influence of the Irish Government is significant there, particularly at present.  The Government could use its influence in the US to gain access to vaccine stocks.  It would help us and help me in my task.</p><p> On the digital transformation, I am acutely aware of what is happening on social media.  It allows me to reply to the first question asked.  First, I agree that we must work together and do something with our partners around the world.  Second, our December proposal highlighted that what is not accepted offline should not be allowed online either.  That is extremely important.  Third, social media platforms must step up their efforts.  The proposed EU rules will place new obligations on these platforms.  We will supervise and sanction violations.  Fourth, only a European instrument will be effective in addressing the issues that have been raised.</p><p> As I stated after the events on Capitol Hill in January 2021, it should not be for private companies to take arbitrary decisions.  Incidentally, the proposal that has been put on the table would have made such events impossible.  I asserted as much in an op-ed.  There must be a democratically validated framework which should be respected by all parties.  That is what the Digital Services Act is precisely about.  We have been the first to move on this issue.  Obviously, I would like to be able to tell the committee that we will discuss it with our friends in the US and that discussions are already under way, but the reality is that we are ahead of the curve and leading the process.  Before presenting the proposal and placing it in the hands of the co-legislators, we undertook a significant consultation exercise.  It is my style of working.  Some 3,000 contributions were received, with many coming from the US and other countries.  It was a year after the consultation that we presented the proposal.  Does that mean that we are one year ahead of the US in that respect?  Probably, yes.  However, we share the same values and issues.  Therefore, it is a good opportunity for further co-operation.</p></speech>

First, I wish to make a comment, and it is not a throw-away one from my perspective, which is that nobody is safe until everyone has access to safe and effective treatments and vaccines.  In other words, no one is safe until everyone is safe.  We must absolutely mean that.</p> <p>  I welcome the Commissioner's commitment that there will be enough vaccines to vaccinate 70% of our population by mid-July.  However, I note his previous comment that he was trusting less in companies in honouring their commitments. I would like to ask him specifically whether those comments solely relate to AstraZeneca or if there are more general concerns around the commitments from the large pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>  I also wish to ask about alternative vaccines and the work that is being done in terms of vaccines being produced in China and the Sputnik V vaccine, and where work is at in terms of looking at those alternative vaccines.  Certainly, they seem to be very effective.  I note that some European countries are accessing them.  I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on that.</p> <p>  I also want to make reference to a call from a number of former presidents, prime ministers and Nobel laureates in respect of the TRIPS waiver, which waives certain intellectual property rights.  A number of members have already touched upon the issue.  I believe it was yesterday that the EU foreign policy chief, High Representative Josep Borrell, tweeted his support for waiving some intellectual property rights.  He quickly deleted his tweet, which was quite surprising.  However, I have a copy with me.  He stated: "at one point, scaling up vaccination efforts by waiving intellectual property rights will be needed to globally combat [the] Covid-19 pandemic."</p> <p>  We are all genuinely concerned about new variants in Ireland.  Yesterday, three cases of the "Indian", or B1617, variant were detected in Ireland.  Until people are vaccinated globally, there remains a serious concern about the emergence of new variants.  </p> <p>  I note that in a recent article written by the Commissioner, he stated: "I would remind you that the companies have invested a lot and very quickly, which has enabled us to have vaccines in a few months when it usually takes several years."  While that may be the case, public funding has also gone into these large pharmaceutical companies.  I note that in respect of the one company about which the Commissioner has expressed concerns, namely, AstraZeneca, around &euro;336 million in public money was pumped into that pharmaceutical company to develop and help with the production of the vaccine.  How much public money from Europe has gone into the pharmaceutical companies in the development of the vaccines?</p> <p>  I also wish to ask the Commissioner about the waiving of intellectual property rights.  I sit on another Oireachtas Committee, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  We have seen evidence, and it is widely acknowledged, that the cost of accessing vaccines in developing countries, for example, in Africa, is double that which EU member states are being charged.</p><p>I question whether the Union is concerned about dealing with this pandemic globally or is more interested in serving the needs of the large pharmaceutical companies and the profits they are making.  I fundamentally believe that there should be no profit from the pandemic.  Looking at this when the pandemic is over too late.  This needs to be done now.  I ask the Commissioner, the EU and the Government to sign up to initiatives such as CTAP and deal with intellectual property rights.</p></speech>

There are five questions remaining.  We do not have time for individual questions.  I will get specific questions from Deputy Duffy and Senator Keogan.  Perhaps Senator Chambers wants to come in.  I will then revert to the Commissioner, and he can have the final say and decide when he has to leave.</p></speech>

I refer to the vision for Europe's digital transformation.  Could the Commissioner touch on the priority around secure, resilient and sustainable digital infrastructure, in particular secure infrastructure?  It will be a major concern for every member state to ensure those services are protected and they want to know how Europe intends to do that across every member state.</p></speech>

I have a specific question.  Many major pharmaceutical companies are based here and have a significant presence in Ireland.  Is anything we in Ireland can do to support the European and global vaccine effort?  The Commissioner can try to answer those nine questions as best he can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-20a.266" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thierry Breton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021042000002#H00700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I have three minutes and will try to do my best.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's question, we know and appreciate the industrial landscape in Ireland is extremely important and pharmaceutical companies were present at our networking event.  If there is any need, I am in personal contact with the Prime Minister.  Sometimes it helps if we can have more information.  I have a lot of support from the Government.  The key is to say to the industry that we appreciate what it does.  We will of course offer many companies the opportunity to be part of our strategy.  We need to continue working on that.</p> <p>  On the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, we await the EMA assessment of the efficacy of the vaccine, which I have no doubt will arrive.  I am not in charge of health and have no information from the EMA.  Without Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, we will have fewer vaccines in quarter 2 than hoped.  I am confident that enough vaccines can be produced to reach our target of vaccinating 70% of the adult population by July.  As the committee understands, we have some room for manoeuvre.  </p> <p>  On the first question, I am confident that AstraZeneca will be able to deliver a reduced amount.  I remind the committee that the figure went from 180 million in its first commitment to 170 million.  These vaccines are of course included in our forecast.  I am working on it every day.  We have a very large and broad portfolio of vaccines, which makes me confident that we will be able to reach our 70% target.</p> <p>  I will say a word on the other vaccines.  Soon five vaccines will have been accepted.  I mentioned CureVac which, it is to be hoped, will be agreed on by the end of May or June.  It takes a lot of time to be accepted because we are extremely strict with our health regulations.  We do not have anything against anybody.  We are professionals and it is because of that that we do not try to play politics with vaccines.  It is always a bad idea to do that.</p> <p>  Sputnik is another vaccine and I have a lot of respect for Russian scientists, especially in the Gamaleya Research Institute, which is very well known.  Like every other vaccine, they need to apply to the EMA, which was done a few weeks ago.  The process usually takes a few months because it is very serious and advocates for everyone.  It will take a few months for the vaccine to be analysed and approved by the EMA.  It could then take another few months - sometimes it takes between ten and 12 months - to be able to have the facility to manufacture it.  We know that all our facilities have been transformed over the past ten to 12 months to be able to follow the needs of our fellow citizens.  If the Sputnik vaccine is approved by the EMA, it will enter into an industrial process phase, which will take another ten months.  When the facility is up and running to manufacture a vaccine, it takes between 70 and 100 days to do so.  Every preorder for Sputnik or any other vaccine cannot be delivered before the end of this year.  There is another story for all of us.  We said, of course, that we welcome everyone but we know our priorities.  Sinovac is the Chinese vaccine.  There were some difficulties with it in Chile, for example.</p> <p>  I discussed IT.  There is absolutely no issue.  It is something we need to discuss, but it is a matter of priorities.  We believe, along with my colleague, High Representative/Vice-President Josep Borrell Fontelles, that there will come a time when we will need to appeal the decision.  As we said in life, and especially in such a fight, it is a case of everything at a time.  I thank the Chairman and the members.</p></speech>
