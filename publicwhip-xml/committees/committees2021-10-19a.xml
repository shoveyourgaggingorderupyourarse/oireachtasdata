We had a very good debate on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  My strong impression at the time was that, in general, Deputies are very supportive of the legislation and want to see it enacted as soon as possible.</p> <p>  This is a landmark first step to strengthen and transform the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement into a statutory and independent agency.  The Bill puts a strong framework in place for the new corporate enforcement authority and places it on a firm footing so that it can hit the ground running.</p> <p>  There is also a serious Government commitment that the new authority will have all the necessary human resources required, both Civil Service and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to pursue breaches of company law.  The views of the director were sought, and arising from his assessment, the necessary steps have been taken to ensure the new authority will have effectively a 50% increase in headcount.  There will be more steps to take in future to continue to enhance the powers of the authority such as through the actions arising from the Hamilton implementation plan.  We will keep resourcing under constant review.</p> <p>  I hope we will have the continued support of Deputies and Senators as we proceed through the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would very much like to get this legislation enacted as soon as possible as it is my objective to establish the new authority in January 2022.</p></speech>

We have discussed this previously.  The amendment I proposed has been ruled out of order, but I ask that the Minister of State would give some consideration to the evidence provided in a written submission by Professor Deirdre Ahern.  She maintains it is not good practice for a one-person authority to exist and that we should be moving towards what she suggests, which is a minimum of two and an upper limit of five.  My amendment was ruled out of order because there is a charge on the Exchequer, but it is open to the Minister to bring forward an amendment himself to address this.  I am still a bit lost as to the reason for proceeding as outlined in the Bill.  I do not think any of us would believe that one person alone is sufficient.  A minimum of two and an upper limit of five is very reasonable.</p> <p>  I wish to make one point on audits in co-operatives and how they relate to the Bill.  We know audits can be very expensive.  They range in cost between &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000.  They take up huge resources and can take a considerable amount of time.  They will cause a problem for co-operatives in particular.  It is my intention to bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage to deal with that.  I want to flag that to the committee.</p> <p>  I appreciate my amendment was ruled out of order, but I still think there is merit in it.  I would welcome the views of the Minister of State on the idea that an authority with one person is enough.  We should consider having a minimum of two persons with an upper limit of five, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#A01100"><p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly for tabling her amendment.</p><p>My officials and I gave careful consideration to the report of the joint committee on this Bill, which arose from pre-legislative scrutiny, as well as the view that there should be more members on the new authority.  Specifically, there should be a minimum of two, up to a maximum of five or six, as in Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment.  As it stands, the section provides for up to three full-time members.  It is designed to give the scope to structure the authority to meet the different demands of its remit, which includes investigation, prosecution, supervision and advocacy along clear lines of responsibility.  The idea is to give flexibility.  If a number of big cases arise at the same time, the new authority would be able to have an additional one or two members to work with the chairperson.  The number of members of the authority has been assessed and has been deemed proportionate and appropriate in the medium term.  However, the scope is there to raise the number up to three.  That is comparable in scale of operations with other agencies, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  </p><p> The Minister sought the views of director and his assessment, in summary, was that a maximum of three persons is proportionate to the scale of the organisation in terms of assignment of responsibility to members and ratio of members to staff.  We are satisfied, therefore, that under the legislation there is the opportunity to increase the number of members.  While it is being established now solely with one chairperson, it is our feeling that that number will increase over time.  However, according to the director&rsquo;s assessment, the number is proportionate.  There is the option to raise the number up to three into the future, if the workload increases and it is deemed necessary.  If that is the case, we would not have any hesitation in raising it at that stage. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#B00200"><p>My difficulty is not so much with the upper limit of three; it is with the floor, rather with the ceiling.  One member is provided for but it would be better to start with a higher number there.  I appreciate that this can be revisited, which is welcome.  I just wonder about the circumstances that will cause it to be revisited.  We will have an opportunity to increase the number at later date, post the enactment of the legislation.  Is it the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention that there will be a formal monitoring to make sure that the numbers are accurate?  How would that be triggered in the event that the increase would be needed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#B00300"><p>As I said, the flexibility is provided for to increase the number to three.  We have sought the views of the director.  He is, to be fair, best placed to know the current workload, as well as what is currently being processed by the authority at the moment.  I  imagine that if his assessment was to change, and that there was a requirement to increase it, the scope under the legislation is there to do so.  At that stage we would be in a position to increase.  However, that is why we have left the flexibility there to increase the number to up to three members in the future.  It is there and it will be used if necessary.  At the moment, the clear assessment and views of the director is that the maximum of three is proportionate.  That is why we are going down the route we are.</p></speech>

The Chair might have missed him.  The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the duration that a person can act up from six months to eight weeks.  It is reasonable that somebody should act up.  Acting up happens all the time.  People find themselves indisposed, or whatever, and there is a need to have someone acting up.  However, it is bad practice to have someone acting up for six months.  Eight weeks is a much more reasonable timeframe.  Acting up should, by any definition, not be long term.  In my opinion, six months is fairly long term.  Eight weeks is sufficient time to allow any period of acting up, given that it is supposed to be a temporary situation.  It is not supposed to be long term.  Acting up puts the staff member in an unenviable position.  They are effectively in the position without all of the authority, when the person who is acting up is not the person in the role.  </p><p>There is also confusion over how they are going to operate while they are acting up.  Does all of the authority vest in them?  Are they acting up for the purposes?  Will they receive an acting up allowance for the full duration?  Will there have to be an extension?  Does it have to be an extended period in order for them to get it?  I am concerned primarily with the idea that we would put on a legal footing the six-month period as an accepted definition of short-term acting up.  Short-term acting up is up to eight weeks.  Anything beyond that is longer-term and falls out of the scope of acting up.  </p><p>I am aware that within the civil and public service for all sorts of reasons, primarily the recruitment ban that was implemented a number of years ago, acting up went out of control.  That is probably the best description.  Everybody was acting up at one point.  There were large numbers acting up, certainly within the public service, because of the ban on promotions.  It was generally agreed at the time that it is not a good idea for acting up to go on for a long time.  Acting up should be short term.  It should be only for emergencies.  Eight weeks is enough time for contingencies to be made.  </p></speech>

Can the Minister of State respond to Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#B01300"><p>I largely agree with much of what the Deputy said.  I am supportive of the principle underpinning the amendment, which is to minimise the periods in which members would act up.  However, unforeseen circumstances can arise, which suddenly cause a vacancy.  The vacancies must be temporarily filled.  Ideally, we would all love a situation where adequate notice and a lead-in time are given to carry out a recruitment campaign.  However, sicknesses, even sudden death, or other unforeseen circumstances can occur.  The six-month maximum period is a standard provision for authorising an acting member and it is a realistic timeframe for the appointment process for such a senior post.</p> <p>  Deputies will be aware that section 944F sets out the rules for the appointment of members to the authority.  Recruitment selection is by way of open competition run by the Public Appointment Service, PAS.  Members are subsequently appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on foot of the recommendation made by the PAS.  The six-month period takes into account the practical matters of advertising the vacant position, giving applicants time to submit their application, shortlisting and interviews, and any notice period that the successful candidate will have to serve.  It is not unusual in such a senior position that a preferred candidate may have to give up to three months&rsquo; notice to transfer from his or her current employer.  Given that notice period, along with the period to run a successful competition through the PAS, which takes time, we felt at six months was a fair timeframe to put in place. </p> <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my objective is that any temporary authorisations are of the shortest  timeframe, pending an open competition.  However, we cannot accept the amendment to reduce the timeframe to eight weeks, purely on practical grounds.  Running a successful competition through the PAS in itself would take probably more than eight weeks.  The successful candidate, having been offered the position, may have to give up to three months&rsquo; notice to his or her current employer.</p><p>Perhaps the initial candidate might not even accept the position and it will be necessary to offer it to somebody else.  We believe that six months is the outer limit.  That is not what we want to achieve.  We do not want somebody to be acting up for six months.  We want to provide a realistic timeframe for how long it might take.  Obviously, the intention would be to keep the acting up requirement as short as possible.</p><p> The Deputy asked a specific question about the powers that would be associated with an acting up position.  He or she would retain the full powers.  The person would be acting up and would have the powers that would be there for somebody who is appointed on a permanent basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#C00200"><p>I accept that.  The Minister of State's clarification is welcome.  It is good to know that he will be keeping a close eye on this.  With regard to the powers the person has, it is tough for someone who is acting up to have all the authority because he or she is only in the position on an acting basis, if the Minister of State knows what I mean.  There is nothing specific in the legislation about this, but I would welcome the Minister of State's thoughts on backfilling positions.  Very often, when a person acts up, he or she does not act up 100% in the role and still retains some of his or her previous duties.  I am conscious that these are very important jobs for which a focus would be required and I wonder if there might be something the Minister of State could do about insisting on a backfill for a person who is acting up.  I accept what he is saying about the length of time, but the fear would be that while the six months is put in as the upper limit, it could end up as a target rather than the outlier.  That is my main concern about that.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State will keep an eye on it.</p> <p>  Can the Minister of State comment on backfilling a position so that the person involved can actually act up 100%?  I know of many cases where a person has been asked to act up but where he or she was not fully able to give up his or her previous duties, so he or she ended up trying to do both jobs and did neither successfully.  These are important roles at a very senior level.  The Minister of State has almost made my point for me in saying that it could take up to three months because of the level of responsibility these people will have.  The level they are at could require three months to fill the vacancy on the basis that they may have to give notice and so forth.  I accept that, but, equally, there must be some support in respect of backfilling those posts for the persons concerned.  I am not sure that it is appropriate for legislation, but I would welcome the Minister of State's views.  Perhaps he would put on the record what the intention would be with regard to funding backfill and so forth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#C00300"><p>First, the acting up is to take account of unforeseen circumstances.  The ideal situation is that the person would give the required notice and that the notice period would facilitate a seamless transition, but one can never guarantee that in life.  We have to take account of unforeseen circumstances and that is why we are keeping it at six months.  The six months is an outer limit.  It is not a minimum period but very much the outer limit, and we hope it will never come to that.</p> <p>  The backfill is something that will have to be assessed at the time it arises; it is not something that we can legislate for today.  However, I can make one point.  Thankfully, due to the additional resources that have been allocated to the new corporate enforcement authority, with an increase of 50% in the head count, at least now we have a much better resourced and equipped body in terms of both financial resources and key personnel.  It is going to be much stronger and it will have the ability to take account of unforeseen circumstances.  As I said at the outset, our intention is that this would not be the way a recruitment process would be fulfilled; it is to accommodate unforeseen circumstances.</p></speech>

I do not understand why the Central Bank is not included on the list of organisations that should disclose relevant information to the authority, specifically with regard to breaches of company law codes.  When I read the Bill first, I thought it was an oversight.  We have discussed this previously.  Why does the Minister of State not believe that the Central Bank can provide information that will materially assist the authority?  Why has it been left off the list?  Including it would make sense, and I do not see the sense in not including it.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could enlighten us on that.</p></speech>

It re-enacts section 957 of the Companies Act 2014 with the addition of the registrar and the Registry of Friendly Societies.  The Deputy proposes adding the Central Bank to the list of bodies.</p> <p>  I understand that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and the Central Bank have a memorandum of understanding already which allows each body to refer information to the other where they are satisfied that such information is relevant to their counterpart&rsquo;s remit.  The grounding legislation in this case is the Central Bank&rsquo;s legislation.  However, on foot of the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Reilly, I plan to consult with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank further on this proposal.  If it is deemed that it could enhance the authority and the Central Bank&rsquo;s ability to exchange information, I would accept it.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment, with a view to resubmitting it on Report Stage, in order to give me more time to consult with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  If they tell me that it is necessary and would enhance the ability to exchange information, I would have no difficulty accepting it.</p></speech>

This is a matter I raised on Second Stage and in the pre-legislative scrutiny, and I feel very strongly about it.  I do not know why we are going to anonymise the details of offenders.  I do not know what the benefit is.  I am sorry, that is not quite true as I can see that there might be a benefit to the person who is being anonymised, but I do not know what the broader benefit is.  The idea is that a person cannot be named because it might jeopardise the stability of financial markets or where it would cause disproportionate damage to the relevant director.  This is not afforded to people.  We are talking about individuals who have committed offences, which could be very serious in some instances.  For the life of me I cannot understand what benefit there will be to the State and to holding companies to account and so forth.  If the Bill goes through without amendment, I do not think we will see many names in the public domain.</p><p>The Minister of State will say that it is a provision which, hopefully, will not be invoked much, but I believe it will be.  It will be used to assist people to hide.  Anonymity is obviously very beneficial to the person who is availing of it.  I do not understand why directors should be given a free pass on this.  I do not want to take the route of saying that if somebody committed a petty crime by going into Dunnes Stores and taking a packet of biscuits the person's name would end up in the newspaper, because we all know that.  I want to be proportionate and do like-for-like comparisons, but I cannot think of any scenario whereby a person would be allowed to have his or her details anonymised, much as the person might not wish to have his or her name in the public domain.  There is a benefit.  If the sanction involves publication of the person's name, it acts as a serious deterrent.</p><p>I do not think we should be so deferential to something that may or may not jeopardise the stability of financial markets.  That is a guessing game as to whether it would jeopardise financial markets or otherwise.</p><p> The important things are that we have the determinant, which is the publication of the name, and that it is done to the greatest extent possible.  We should not stitch into legislation the opportunity for people to avoid having their name in the public domain.  If these people transgressed to the point of sanction then their names should be made public.  We have debated this mater.  It is not something that I am inclined to let go because it is important.  There is no mechanism for other people to say that publication would have a disproportionate impact on them and I do not know why we should give these directors the benefit of anonymity.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on this matter.  </p></speech>

This is important and I agree that such limitations should be minimal.</p> <p>  There are a number of reasons for their inclusion in this Bill.  First, from a technical perspective arising from the repeal of chapter 3 of Part 15, section 10 of this Bill will insert a new chapter 3A and chapter 3B into Part 15 of the Companies Act 2014.  Chapter 3B, sections 944Z, and 944AA to AH,  re-enact sections 957AA, 957B to 957I, when section 3 repeals all of chapter 3 of the Companies Act 2014.  The sections and paragraphs proposed for deletion are not new law.  They arise as a consequence of the repeal of chapter 3 and they are just being renumbered to the sections in the Companies Act 2014.  It is nothing new but a renumbering and a technical requirement in terms of this legislation.</p> <p>  Second, this is law as a consequence of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations as an EU member state to take account of EU law from 2014 on statutory audit, first in 2016 by way of a statutory instrument and, subsequently, in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018.</p> <p>  The sections themselves transpose the requirements of the EU Audit Directive of 2014 to introduce administrative sanctions, including financial sanctions on directors of public-interest entities who are found, following investigation, to have contributed to a breach of statutory audit rules by a statutory auditor.  Public-interest entities are banks, insurance undertakings and listed entities.  The sanctions include directions to directors to cease conduct or prohibit them from carrying out certain functions as well as financial sanctions.</p> <p>  The audit directive sets out in detail the rules and requirements for the imposition of sanctions on directors in keeping with the principle of proportionality inherent in EU law.  As a rule, details of sanctions on directors should be published as soon as practicable.  However, the audit directive, which we have transposed word for word, requires that member states shall ensure that sanctions on directors are published anonymously, in certain circumstances.  The circumstances are limited to where the authority is of the opinion that it would be disproportionate or would cause disproportionate damage to the director or would jeopardise the stability of financial markets or an ongoing criminal investigation.  I wish to point out that it would be the director of the new corporate enforcement authority to determine that, and not the person in question, to seek anonymity.  These circumstances, that were originally in section 957F(3), are re-enacted in sections 944AE(3) in the Bill, which the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would delete.  Failure to re-enact these provisions would mean that Ireland would be in breach of its EU obligations.  It is for this reason that I oppose the amendment and I hope that I have clarified the purpose of the sections.</p></speech>

In addition, I am aware that the legislation simply renumbers and transposes EU legislation.  Is he saying that the director cannot seek anonymity or, should they seek it, that is to be disregarded?  Can a director seek anonymity but ultimately the decision to grant it or otherwise is only given by the director?  Obviously the director can decide to grant anonymity where deemed appropriate.  Is he saying that the director is precluded from asking?  What I heard is that only the director of the authority can decide anonymity and there is no capacity for the company directors to seek anonymity.  Perhaps I have misunderstood him.</p></speech>

I cannot say with certainty today but will undertake to review the matter and get back to the Deputy on whether somebody has the option to seek anonymity.  That is not my understanding but I will clarify the matter for the Deputy and get back to her.</p></speech>

I do not think it is a good idea that anonymity could be sought because people will fight for it.  Is it the sole responsibility of the director of the authority?  I have expressed my views on the capacity for directors to keep their names out of the papers and the disparity between some poor young fella walking around who has been done for the possession of a joint or something, and people will say that those things are there.  Notwithstanding all of that, if there was a capacity in legislation to request anonymity, or seek it in some way, then one is in the territory whereby the argument before we start will be a fight for the anonymity clause to be invoked.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is going to come back to me on that.  The legislation will be stronger for an understanding that that is how this is going to happen.</p></speech>

It states that the authority may not impose on a director a monetary sanction that would make him or her bankrupt.  It provides that only one monetary sanction may be imposed where more than two breaches of the same conduct have occurred.  </p><p>Companies are already protected by limited guarantee.  This provision offers directors protections above and beyond what would normally be expected where a person commits a transgression.  As was said in the D&aacute;il, if someone breaks any one of the State's bylaws on parking or road tolls then he or she must pay a fine for each instance.  I am being facetious in saying I would love to be able to say I had a parking ticket ten years ago and have paid it.  It seems a little incongruous that this provision is in the same section on the how the anonymity of a person's reputation would be damaged.  The threat of bankruptcy could be abused as a mechanism for refusing financial penalties for serious breaches and I hope that the Minister of State will be in a position to give me some comfort on this.</p><p>I really do not believe it is fair that directors can benefit from a protection that is not available to the ordinary Joe Soap and that would confer an advantage on them if they have committed a transgression.</p></speech>

Anyway, here goes.  The amendment is similar to the Deputy's previous one.  Section 944AF, which is proposed for deletion, is not new law.  It is in keeping with the principle of proportionality.  The EU audit directive requires the level of administrative sanctions imposed to take into account circumstances such as the financial strength of the director, the gravity and duration of the breach by the director and the degree of responsibility.  These circumstances were originally in section 957D(2) and re-enacted in section 944AC(2).</p> <p>  In addition, legal advice at the time of drafting the original provisions in 2016 was that other proportionality considerations should be introduced in respect of financial sanctions, and specifically that the sanction should not cause a director to become bankrupt.  This is set out in section 944AF(1) re-enacting section 957G(1).  The concern was that, in the absence of this safeguard, financial sanctions imposed under these sections could be vulnerable to challenge in the courts.</p> <p> Ireland is required to maintain section 944AC(2) to comply with its EU obligations.  If section 944AF is proposed to be amended, the views of the Attorney General would have to be sought on the impact on the principle of proportionality.  We all want to ensure that directors who break the law are brought to account but we need to ensure that the law is robust and not at risk of challenge.  The section gets the balance right, and for this reason I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

There is concern.  I appreciate that the Minister of State set out to address my concerns but he did not manage to do so.  I do not mean that disrespectfully.  I am concerned that the measure could act as a deterrent.  A company director could say that if there were sanctions, he or she would end up bankrupt, and that they should not be imposed as a consequence.  That is serious.</p> <p>  I understand that the legislation involves the transposition of pre-existing legislation to a large extent but I would be grateful to hear from the Minister of State about how many times the clause in question has been used to ensure financial sanctions would not be imposed.  How many company directors have benefited from it?  Does the Minister of State believe the enactment of this legislation will ensure a continuation in the same vein?  Will there be more seeking to use the clause to ensure they will not have financial sanctions imposed on them because there might be an issue over potential bankruptcy?  It is quite hard to prove.  Maybe that is a question for another day.</p> <p>  I hope the Minister of State shares my concern over how the measure is going to work and how it could confer a disproportionate advantage on company directors, thereby going against the principle of proportionality, to which he referred.  I am interested in hearing how the arrangement works at present.  How many have used it?  If it is the case that it is not used, it might give me some comfort.  I suspect it is used.  I would be interested in hearing from the Minister of State the number of times the clause was invoked and how it works.</p></speech>

I welcome the clarification that it has not been used to date.

To use a simple and old saying, you cannot take blood from a turnip.  There is no point in sanctioning somebody who is unable to pay but, at the same time, the legislation gives the capacity to take on board the severity of the offence, the duration for which it was being committed and the impact it has had.  Taking these into consideration, a sanction would be imposed that the individual could afford, but without necessitating his or her being put into bankruptcy.  It boils down to the principle of proportionality.</p></speech>

I am concerned and remain so.  The favourable treatment of company directors over others, or the perception thereof, is the matter in question.  I appreciate that there are administrative sanctions.  I realise we are not talking about the courts but about administrative sanctions.  Regardless of who imposes them, there is the possibility of someone saying they would push him or her into bankruptcy.   It would be quite hard to determine that in the first instance, but maybe not.  The facility is not available to those who are not company directors.  Maybe we are proposing to overly protect company directors.</p> <p>  I am going to do some more research on this.  I propose to withdraw my amendment and take a longer look at it.  I may resubmit it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The courts take account of personal circumstances when issuing fines for other offences so it is not fair to say this is not the case in the judicial system.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#F00100"><p>Regarding this section, why has the proposed authority not been asked to advise the Minister or the Government on policy developments in this area?  It would be a normal sort of thing to put into the functions, although there is a possibility for the Minister to ask for such advice.</p> <p>  Returning to the comment made by Deputy O'Reilly earlier, there are different types of authority.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, is a one-person authority for enforcement, while the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CPCC, is a three-person authority to undertake enforcement.  I understand that the CPCC ensures that expertise in different areas is brought to bear.  There is merit therefore in having a group consisting of three people with different areas of expertise but nonetheless undertaking collective decision-making.  Is the model envisaged here a one-person authority, like the DPP, or is the Minister of State considering, in the more medium term, the use of the flexibility which exists to have three members on this authority and to go for an arrangement like that which exists in the CPCC?   Like Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly, I see some merit in multiple members rather than just one and it would be interesting to hear from the Minister of State on the thinking behind the sort of model envisaged in this regard.  There are different models and I do not know when some are more satisfactory or operate better than others.</p> <p>  This proposed legislation is welcome.  We have missed a beat in not having an authority which is strong enough and appropriately resourced.  This Bill will be an important element in addressing that issue.  I am glad to see that the Bill recognises that the proposed authority will be accountable to this committee.  It will be important that we keep tabs on what is happening in this area because it represents oversight of the ethics by which business is conducted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021101900002#F00200"><p>I thank Deputy Bruton for giving me the opportunity to clarify the membership of the new body.  The new authority structure is similar to a commission, with a chairperson assisted by other members who have delegated responsibilities for other specific functions.  Section 944F stipulating the membership of the authority provides for up to three full-time members and it is designed to give scope to structure the authority to meet the differing demands of its remit.  These include: investigation; prosecution; supervision; and advocacy along specific lines of responsibility.  The idea is to give flexibility.</p> <p>  If several big cases arise at the same time, then the new authority would be able to have an additional one or two members to work with the chairperson.  The members will be full-time and appointed for a period of up to five years, with the possibility of being reappointed for a further term of up to five years.  Recruitment will be run by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  One of the members shall be appointed as the chairperson to ensure continuity between the ODCE and the new authority.  Section 944F provides that the person who is the director of that body immediately before the establishment day shall be a member of the authority unless he or she resigns, is removed, dies or otherwise vacates that office.</p> <p>  Regarding the appointment of additional members, my primary concern is to establish the new authority.  I also want to ensure that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has sufficient resources, financial and in respect of office space, in place to fulfil its statutory mandate.  We are satisfied that it has the requisite people in place.  As I said to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, however, we have an open mind regarding the appointment of additional members when the authority is established.  A reasonable expectation therefore is that the membership will grow over time.  The primary objective now, though, is to get the new authority up and running by 1 January 2022, or certainly in January of next year, and to ensure the additional staff approved have been recruited and that the authority will be fit for purpose in future.  To answer Deputy Bruton's query, then, scope exists to increase the membership of the new authority to three, similar to the composition of the CPCC, as the Deputy referred to in his contribution.</p></speech>

I am happy with it.  Turning to the matter of a function to advise Ministers, that would seem to be a fairly normal thing.  It could be useful because this is a technical area and we might miss an opportunity if Ministers are not getting up-to-date appraisals of how legislation is moving in other countries.</p></speech>

We have sought the views of the director and his office in respect of policy and on this legislation, including on its implementation and operation.  That will certainly continue.  Based on Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s own experience of serving as a Minister, has this aspect previously been enshrined in legislation to make it a more formalised arrangement?</p></speech>

It is the case in respect of several bodies.  I imagine it is there in the case of the CPCC, and it might also be useful in this context.  The Minister can obviously ask for such advice of his or her own accord, but having a statutory basis for advising the Minister does seem to be sensible.</p></speech>

It is important legislation.  White-collar crime is a menace to society and has major consequences for the economy, nationally and internationally.  This Bill is a defining moment in Ireland&rsquo;s approach to addressing economic and white-collar crime.  I am delighted to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment that we will have this legislation on the Statute Book in January 2022.  I thank my colleagues on the committee, and particularly Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly, for submitting their amendments to the legislation.  We can possibly look again at some of them on Report Stage.

I am glad to see that the committee continues to support the need to get this legislation enacted so that the new Corporate Enforcement Authority can be established.</p> <p>  As I said on the floor of the D&aacute;il last month, the delivery of this new authority is a key priority for me.  I strongly believe in this project and want to get the necessary legislative underpinning in place to allow for the necessary transformation.  As well as the legislation, I have been very clear that I see resources as key.  This includes relevant experts and garda&iacute;.  Since coming to office I am pleased that the Department has sanctioned the necessary Civil Service posts and that the recruitment process is under way.  Separately, I am pleased that the Garda Commissioner has agreed to a significant increase in Garda resources for the new authority.  This will support the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s vision for the new authority.  I will continue to prioritise this work and plan to see the new agency established.  With the help of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, I hope to have the necessary legislation in place over the coming weeks.  This will allow for the establishment of the authority in January 2022.  I give an undertaking that I will come back to Deputies O'Reilly and Bruton on the issues they raised.</p> <p>  As I have already said, this is a landmark step to strengthen and transform the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement into a statutory and independent Corporate Enforcement Agency.  I will ensure that it is equipped not just to hit the ground running, but to continue to deliver on its important objective in the enforcement of, and compliance with, the Companies Act 2014.  I thank the Chair for facilitating the debate today.</p></speech>

We have not received any apologies.   Before we begin, I need to go through a few housekeeping matters.  If any member or witness participating remotely experiences any sound or technical issue, will he or she let us know?  Otherwise, we will proceed.</p> <p>  I advise everybody that as this is a public meeting the chat function on MS Teams should be used only to advise participants of any technical issue or urgent matter and should not be used to make general comments or statements.  I remind members participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak, and when they are speaking I ask that, where possible, they have their cameras switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.</p> <p>  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside the precincts will be refused.</p> <p>  Members participating in the meeting from the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except, obviously, when people are speaking.  I ask for co-operation in this matter.  It would be appreciated if committee members who are participating remotely put their location into the chat function so I know who is in Leinster House for the questions and answers.</p> <p>  Our first session is with representatives from the Collaborative Forum and Adoption Loss-the Natural Parents Network of Ireland.  I offer a very sincere welcome to Ms Terri Harrison and Ms Alice Coughlan who are members of the Collaborative Forum and to Ms Muriel Thornton and Ms Rhoda McManus who are members of Adoption Loss-the Natural Parents Network of Ireland.  The purpose of our meeting today is to engage with them on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the birth information and tracing Bill.  I want to say to all of the witnesses appearing before the committee that their assistance to us as a committee in scrutinising the general scheme of the Bill is invaluable and very much appreciated.  We all recognise that it is not an easy task to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss such sensitive issues.  For this we are very grateful.  We genuinely mean this and we are delighted the witnesses are able to join us today.</p> <p>  I need to go through parliamentary privilege before the witnesses make their opening statements.  As all of the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if the witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence about a particular matter, it is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Following the delivery of the opening statements we will have questions and answers with the members.  The speaking rota has been circulated to all members in advance of the meeting.  Each member is allocated five minutes, which includes the time for answers.  I now invite Ms Harrison to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I will go straight to early care information.  I would like an amendment made to the Bill regarding the early care of our children.  We were locked away in institutions.  Even though our babies were in the same institutions, they were locked away in nurseries.  The very early care of a child reflects its entirety of care.  People were given permission to access the locked nurseries in between feeding times, which was the only time we were allowed to care for our newborn babies.  It is essential that the early care information is accurate and that it reflects the truth of what really happened in these institutions.  The mother should have the right to know to what extent people had access to her newborn baby.  Many things transpired and we had no authority.  We were not seen as the child's mother and, therefore, we did not give the entire early care.</p> <p>  With regard to access to records, I want to know by whom these scribbled notes were recorded and how they reflect the truth and transparency of what really happened in these places.  It is imperative that the mother of the child is allowed to proofread such records.  Who is deemed qualified to describe us, our well-being, mental well-being and emotional state?  To give an example, the records I have witnessed from the so-called qualified authority state every pregnancy was healthy and normal and every delivery was healthy and normal.  We now have proven facts that this is untrue.  These facts are being withheld.  For all the girls who were imprisoned, the only real test on record is that they had to be seen if they had syphilis.  This was an essential test when entering these places.  Nobody ever came in to inspect the well-being of the expectant mother.  In the terminology of the Government for the past 70 years we are never described as expectant mothers or new mothers.  The early care information has to reflect on the unborn child.  It affects them also.  It has been scientifically proven that the well-being of the mother as the child lives inside of her is essential to the future of that unborn child.</p> <p>  I would like to see an amendment on access to counselling.  It is crucial the councillors are accredited.  The Bill states Tusla social workers will provide vital support to those who wish to avail of it.  I would definitely like to see a qualified medical practitioner put in place such as a psychologist.  We have a living bereavement brought on by an unnatural separation of mother and child.  It affects both equally for different reasons.  This is why it is vital that it is a qualified practitioner who is involved.</p> <p>  The contact register and the family of origin are entirely separate issues.  Every person has the birthright to know from whom they came, their culture, their heritage and their gene pool.  We have only one birth certificate and everybody is entitled to it.</p> <p>  I will end on a human note.  The Bill will have a profound effect on thousands in the years to come.  It is all down to legalised human trafficking and false imprisonment of mothers and their children.</p><p>For the sake of Irish society, I implore the committee to consider this Bill from a very deep and considered human perspective.</p></speech>

This Bill has been a long time coming, and we have made submissions on previous information and tracing Bills over the past 20 years, none of which was enacted.</p> <p>  Our first observation is that the very Title of the Bill betrays its presumptions upfront.  The suggestion is that it is primarily adopted people who are the seekers.  The heads of the Bill, when closely examined, show that it is of very little relevance to the many thousands of mothers, fathers and other relatives who have phoned our helpline throughout the past decades or attended our support meetings seeking our advice and assistance in contacting their adult children.</p> <p>  We are familiar with the complexities involved, having sat on the advisory committee appointed by the then Minister of State, Brian Lenihan, which led to the setting up of the National Information and Tracing Service by the Adoption Board in 2007.  The information leaflet about this service, containing our helpline number, was sent to every address in the State.  The calls over the following years have uncovered the harsh treatment, illegal practices and social pressures which led to the separation of mothers from their children.  We have provided the committee with one of our previous submissions which illustrates this well.</p> <p>  Specific to the proposed Bill, we ask the committee to consider the following.  A referendum should be held on the primacy of information rights over privacy where adoption, fostering or residential care settings have separated mothers, fathers and other relatives from their children.  The Bill should be renamed as the "Family Information and Tracing Bill".  Many people were not legally adopted but still require a tracing and information service.  This is about families after all - not about birth.</p> <p>  The legislation should grant equality to mothers and fathers in the service.  Adoption certificates should be provided to the mothers and the birth certificates to their adult children.  We understand that the names and address of the adopting parents would be redacted.  A comprehensive information leaflet should be provided to all regarding the laws on adoption and what papers may be contained within the file.  The present Tusla leaflet is a lesson in obfuscation.</p> <p>  As most of the social workers will have retired, the only true witness to the circumstances surrounding the separation of the child from the mother is the mother.  She should be facilitated to read her file in the presence of a social worker, who should explain the significance of particular documents.  The mother should be helped to write a statement to correct or add to the information before it is given to her adult child.  She would not be allowed to remove anything from the file.</p> <p>  Provision should be made for counselling assistance to the mother if the adopted person refuses to provide information to her.</p> <p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland should immediately trace and write to all people registered as adopted to inform them of the fact of their adoption.  At present, the laws on privacy are interpreted in such a way that apparently prevents this.</p> <p>  My colleague, Rhoda McManus, would be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I ask Ms Coughlan to clarify why she believes the term "accredited counsellor" should be replaced with "psychologist".  If the committee were to propose an amendment, should we try to capture several different professions?  As some people might prefer a psychologist, rather than replacing "accredited counsellors" perhaps we should include psychologists and accredited counsellors for those who might want access to a different type of counsellor.</p></speech>

I would trust no one.  I would let no one control me ever again.  I would block everything that had happened from my mind.  If I ended up being the opposite of the nuns who dealt with me, I would be a good person.  I blocked everything out for 40 years.  I never married.  I worked hard.  I bought my own house.  I had one more daughter and I educated her.  I worked very hard.</p> <p>  About six years ago I decided I was done.  I started getting these flashbacks.  I had another operation.  I got shingles.  For the first time in about 40 years I was locked in a house on my own where I had to face my life.  I went to counselling, which I paid for.  To be totally honest, it was fine.  It helped me.  It opened up the start of what happened to me.  I went to the commission and asked for counselling from the commission.  A year to the day after I appeared before the commission, I was offered counselling, but only if I gave up my own counsellor.  I said, "No, I'm not going to have this."  </p> <p>  Then it got to the stage where counselling was not doing anything for me.  I was getting flashbacks and other things.  After appearing before the commission, for three months I would remember something that happened to me in the convent and I would say, "Oh God, I should have said that at the meeting."</p> <p>  Then I turned around and I went to my doctor and I went to the community mental health centre where I saw a psychologist.  This was a totally different experience for me.  First, this lady was not saying to me, "Yes, Alice.  No, Alice.  Right, Alice."  I do not mean this in a wrong way; I am just saying this is what I was getting from counselling.  The psychologist was kind of hearing me or guiding me through certain things and pulling me back when I went all over the place.</p> <p>  To put it bluntly, for the two years I went to counselling there was not one week when I did not cry through the counselling session.  It was like a release for me if I am honest.  It is not that it did me that much good but it did give me a release.  That is the only way I can describe it.</p> <p>  If I was asked now what I think people need, I can honestly say they need trauma counselling with somebody who actually knows what they have gone through - a loss, this feeling that somebody has taken their soul and just thrown it into the dust, and that they are of no importance to anybody or anything.  They need somebody who is able to look at them.  They need to feel they can actually talk to someone who understands what they are saying.  That person should be able to turn around and guide them.</p> <p>  I believe this of every person who has gone through an institution or any form of trauma as a result of this, be it adoptees or especially survivors of mother and baby homes and other institutions.  A woman bringing children into this world afterwards is destroyed because of this and obviously it will greatly affect her children or her partner. </p> <p>  The other thing is that it actually helped me realise that I did not have a choice.</p><p>Well, I had a choice - either give my child up for adoption or that child goes into an institution until 17 years of age.  Either way, I would not be getting that child back.  That was my choice, but is that a choice?  I knew what happened in institutions.  Even in those days, people were not that silly.  We knew what happened in those places.  I have met my daughter, but there are many adopted people who actually believe that their mothers went into a convent, had them and then decided to give them away for adoption.</p><p> Something else I feel strongly about is the nuns writing these reports.  The nun that did this to me wrote up my information, but I am supposed to sit back and say that that was grand and she was going to be fair.  This nun walked in and gave me a new name, a new number and that advice.  That was my choice - keep my mouth shut and get on with it.  She did not say, "Keep your mouth shut".  She just said, "You are not getting your child" and that it would go for adoption and have a privileged and good upbringing.  Unfortunately, I had had a privileged upbringing, in that I had a Catholic private education, so I was twice as bad as the rest of them.  At least they had some excuse because they were not educated by the nuns, etc.</p><p> The main point is that they be offered advice.  I spent two years sitting in the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland listening to a social worker before I even met my daughter.  We had to go out of our way to do that.  I turned around and said, "Hold on a minute".  I had blocked everything out because I had been so innocent, so I spoke at my daughter.  I did not get anyone who talked to me about what to expect when meeting my daughter.  I did not get any of that, so I actually spoke at my daughter for the first year and a half, not to her, and she spoke at me.  All she could think of was that it had been the worst time of my life and she was bringing it back to me.  The last time we met, we both cried.  We decided to leave it for a few weeks and then get back together.  We are looking forward to meeting each other.</p></speech>

I will keep my questions brief.  I am seeking elaboration on the points the witnesses have made.  The Collaborative Forum outlined the need for the Bill's definition of "care information" to include information on deprived care, as a mother has a right to know what happened to her child when in any care outside her presence.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the importance of this?</p> <p>  Adoption Loss-the Natural Parents Network of Ireland referred to the need to grant equal status to mothers and fathers under all heads of the Bill.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the importance of this so that everyone present might understand better?  Ms Thornton referred to the Tusla leaflet "regarding the laws on adoption and what papers may be contained within the file" as "a lesson in obfuscation."  Will she elaborate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Terri Harrison" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021101900002#C01100"><p>I will respond to the question on the language used.  Our submission refers to "deprived care" because, from what I read in the Bill, no explanation of "early care information" in respect of our children was being sought.  My son would not know that I was not totally allowed to provide any such care.  That is the reason I included "deprived care".  It is essential that people know that my son was locked away in a nursery that was only unlocked four hours every day, that I was to be supervised while feeding him and that, after he was taken from his cot, it took me 22 years to find out if he was alive.  All of this reflects on the attitude towards early care information.  He was my son and I did not sign an adoption paper.  I tried for several years to get information from the Eastern Health Board and Tusla about where the nun took my son to from St. Patrick's on the Navan Road.  I know now that she took him back to Bessborough where I had escaped from.  How long was he in that locked nursery in Bessborough?  Given that information on the care of many of our babies is questionable, why would a Bill say that we had care of them when we did not?  I hope that has clarified for the Deputy.  For me as a human being and as Niall's mother, I would love to know what happened to my son inside and outside the institution, for example, the strangers who frequented the nursery and the pharmaceutical companies' cluster groups.  I know his record after the age of 18 years, but if I looked for information about him or where he was before that age, I was threatened with the Garda.  This is all relevant to my son, who has no idea and who has never accessed his records.  As his mother of the time and as his mother now, I wish to know legally what they did to my baby boy when they had him in the same institution as me and when they took him from one institution to another before he went out to the people they chose to be his parents.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rhoda MacManus" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021101900002#C01500"><p>Regarding the question on early care, I agree with Ms Harrison.  I will give some of my personal story.  I went back to school after my daughter was born.  I remember how, when she was a few weeks old, I went back to the adoption agency and asked to see her at Temple Hill where she had been taken.  The agency simply refused; it just said "No".  At that age and in that situation, one just accepts what she is told to do as an obedient girl obeying the rules of society.  Subsequently, letters that I wrote to the agency inquiring about how she was went unanswered.  This continued for years and years.</p> <p>  Our solution to this problem, which is reflected in the Bill, is that mothers, because they were the only witnesses to what happened, should be allowed to read the whole file and write a statement, with the help of a social worker, to fill in the gaps, including how hard it was to make contact with them and find out how they were.  As Ms Harrison and Ms Coughlan said, to simply know your child is alive is a fundamental thing, and even that was denied to us.</p><p>That is the nightmare we live until the time we can meet children again.  Writing this statement would also remove another fear we have which is, in some cases, adopted people are looking for pieces of paper and bits of information to fill in missing gaps.  For us, the search is about contact.  It is about an emotional need to reunite with the child to whom we gave birth and about whom we have been wondering all our lives.  Where is the child on his or her communion or confirmation?  What is the child doing on his or her birthday?  We live with this all of our lives and our fear is when we, eventually, it is hoped, get to meet the child again, this will lead to a relationship.  However, the trouble is we have had no control over what was put into that file; what was written or said about us or even things such as whether cards we wrote were put into the file.  The statement gives us a chance to reflect the reality; tell the truth; name the father, if he has not been named, and to paint our personalities, illustrate our need and, it is hoped, persuade that person to want to have a relationship with us.  That is why this statement is so important.</p></speech>

Ms Thornton has requested the Bill head be changed, which we need to address.  It is worrying this is going on more than 20 years.  Everybody is getting older and children are growing up.  For me and the committee, the timing of this Bill will be crucial, as will how we make sure we get this Bill right, because, we need to do it right this time.  We have an opportunity to change things and that will happen this time.  I also want to address the comprehensive leaflet.  That is really important.  Communication and access will be absolutely vital and a comprehensive leaflet will be so important to access information.  What more can we do on that or what do the witnesses feel we should do to address that urgently?  That is one of the tools going forward.</p> <p>  I was going to ask about the social workers and counsellors.  That has been addressed in that there needs to be a qualified counsellor on this.  We are dealing with people who have been heartbroken and have gone through so much.  We have to make sure the counselling they receive is the proper counselling they need.  It is all about finding the right ways to make sure we address the witnesses' concerns.  I thank them and ask them to come back to me on the comprehensive leaflet and what we should be looking at in that.  All the witnesses spoke about how one gets the proper information.  We need to make sure that when the information is given, it is all the information, and people can access it themselves; we must ensure it is not pieces of paper.  I again thank them very much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rhoda MacManus" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021101900002#D00300"><p>The reason the leaflet is so important is, from our experience, we know how necessary this is.  We have sat with quite a number of mothers who received photocopies of the information in the file.  Many of them did not realise the significance of some of that information.  There was a woman who received her son's birth certificate, but she did not see straight off that his birth was not registered until he was six.  She had signed an adoption consent form, or so she thought, and then discovered it was a permission for her son to be boarded out, which was devastating news for her.  There needs to be somebody who is prepared to tell the truth about those documents, which these social workers do not tell.  They send out photocopies of the information, but they do not even tell you if this indicates an illegal adoption.  We have sat with a woman we were able to tell that there were signs of an illegal adoption.  The State organisation - I have to be careful here - that sent this to her, did not say in the covering letter that her son had been illegally adopted, but that was a fact.  They are not prepared to own up to the illegalities.  The reason the information needs to be so detailed is not even we, as mothers, know what might be in the file.  We do not know if anyone did write about us or wrote a report.  We do not know whether our children wrote in looking for information about us.  We know none of these things and unless there is a detailed list of what might be in the file in order that we can ask that question when we go to meet with a social worker and go through the file with her or him, it is pretty useless.  I apologise, I may be going off the point.</p></speech>

So much stuff was not included.  My daughter's adoptive mother had written to the agency for five years, giving details of how my daughter was doing.  I never have received that and even in the information I got from them, none of that was included.  My daughter went in when she was 19 and was going to Australia.  The Catholic Protection &amp;amp; Rescue Society of Ireland told her it was useless and there was no way she would ever be meeting me and that was it.  It told her it did not matter, she would not be meeting me and it did not make a difference.  There were so many things.</p> <p>  When I got my papers, or some of my papers, from the Catholic protection society, I was 18 on one page; 19 on another and 21 on the other.  My baby was born in St. Finbarr's Hospital, which she was, but my baby was also born in Bessborough.  It was said the social worker who was in charge of the adoption came down to Cork to meet me - which never happened.  I met her one day, when the adoption papers were being signed.  One can be terribly naive.  I genuinely believed this was my choice.  My daughter, at this stage, would be brought up in an institution, rented or boarded out, or whatever you like to call it and would have a horrendous life for her first 17 years, or I could give her some form of life.  I had to believe the person who wanted to adopt really wanted a child to love and cherish.</p> <p>  This social worker signed her name to say she knew me very well, had met me on more than one occasion and happened to be very well known to me.  I never met the woman until five minutes before I walked from South Anne Street to Dawson Street to sign a paper.  Yet, I am expected to believe the truth and everything else is in these papers which my daughter might read or receive.  These nuns, and I am sorry to call them that, are writing out details and without being rude, there are three downright lies by social workers.</p><p>I was in hospital because they left half the afterbirth in me.  I am not going to go into all of that but they actually wrote in one of my letters that they knew I was in hospital with a kidney infection.  Everything that was on the page - this is a better way of saying it - was half-truths, if that makes sense.  They were half-truths.  And that is what I got.</p></speech>

We all share a wish to address issues raised in the current general scheme of the birth information and tracing Bill in the interests of those who are most affected.</p> <p>  In my experience of this committee's engagement with the mother and baby home survivors, it is clearly stated that the right to truth is of the utmost importance and that "free and unfettered access to their own personal information and records is essential for survivors."</p> <p>  I will start with a question for Ms Coughlan.  From her own experience, how important is the full release of information for adopted persons?  In their opening statements, both our witnesses made reference to counselling assistance.  Could Ms Harrison perhaps elaborate on how these supports could be availed of if they wished to access them?  In her conclusion, Ms Thornton noted that fathers were also denied the right to be named on birth certificates.  Perhaps she can give us an example of this.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate the aspect of truth in records.  My abduction in the UK and being brought back here by the Catholic Crusade of Rescue is not reflected in my records, in many ways.  It would not be reflected to my son.  There was also rubber-stamping of adoption by judges where the clergy would present it.</p> <p>  I got my records and got access to quite a few items of correspondence in which the truth that is written is that I was a very difficult young girl.  My difficulty is not explained.  The explanation is that I would not sign any papers.  When I received a copy of my son's adoption, the person who signed my name had spelled it wrong.  What is also not on record is the fact that after returning from England, I went back  to collect my son.  I informed them that I was taking him.  He had already been adopted and they threatened me with the High Court, the police - everything.  I would like my son to know these very important details.</p> <p>  Ms MacManus said and I totally 100% agree that I would like to proceed without the help of any social worker.  As Ms Coughlan said, I have no trust whatsoever in authority.  I believe this belongs to the mother and the adult son or daughter and, therefore, given the choice, I would like to write a full, in-depth statement of journey of where we began when he began to grow inside me and the circumstances of living in London and being brought back to this country against my will.  Furthermore, I would like my son to know the complete journey of the lack of care while he was growing inside me, the lack of medical care after he was born and the lack of care in that I was denied to know, every night of the last 48 years, how my son is.  How is he?  Nobody can answer that question for me and I am his mother until the last breath has left my body.</p></speech>

If a child grows up - most of our children would be adults - and decides he or she does not wish to see his or her parent, that is his or her choice.  If a mother decides or she has not told her family or whatever the case may be and does not wish to have contact, both sides should be respected.  Both sides should have to see a psychologist regardless and actually sit down with somebody to try to go through what is going around in their heads.  There is nobody in a mother and baby institution who was not affected emotionally - in other words, destroyed emotionally.  It genuinely needs somebody who is able to get through to the mother or to the child.  The child maybe has this thing in his or her head.  Basically, we do not know how many children were told lies that their mother did this or did not want them.  We do not know how many children grew up thinking their parents or mother did not want them.  How many were a case of rape?  How many were a case of incest?  There are so many angles and so many issues, therefore, respect is needed on both sides, that is, respect for the adopted person and respect for the mothers of the babies.</p> <p>  Again, this idea of somebody writing one's letter is just incomprehensible.  It is just unbelievable that anyone would actually believe that somebody like a nun could actually write what happened to a person or about what way they were in those circumstances.  As I said, the big thing that gets me more than anything are half-truths.  They can just put something in that is a half-truth and, therefore, it can be made somewhat believable.  I will go back to Yvonne Murphy, the judge who turned around and asked one nun about the 38 babies.  That nun did not remember one death that occurred in her first year in the convent and yet Judge Murphy could tell her there were 38 deaths that year, and those were registered deaths.  We got this from the commission.  That is proof.  There were 38 registered deaths.</p></speech>

It was not until I got a copy of the consent form that I signed, which I never got a copy of at the time and which I was not aware I was entitled to, that I found they had increased my age from 16 to 18 years old on the consent form.  Now, if my daughter had access to the documents before she met me, she would think I was 18 years old when I gave birth to her and not 16 years old.  That is just an example of the kind of thing we need to correct.</p> <p>  I will also expand on something I said about when the social worker would help somebody to write a statement to be added to the file.  It is something we have looked at and have been talking about for 20 years.  I did not mean that the social worker would have any part in actually phrasing it but simply that he or she would act as a secretary and, maybe, because the women would be very emotional and nervous, remind her of particular aspects of her life that she might want to include or might have forgotten.  That is all.  It is not that he or she would have control over the statement but would simply be there to hold the woman's hand while she is doing it.  That is all.</p></speech>

I know it is really difficult for them to appear before this or, indeed, any committee to talk about how badly they have been repeatedly treated.</p><p>Many questions have already been asked about the counselling and that type of thing.  Ms Harrison spoke about the lack of trust she has.  Ms McManus, and Ms Coughlan as well, mentioned the lies that were written.  We have all these records now which we cannot trust.  Hopefully, the groups represented here can advocate, rewrite this and talk about the truth that happened to them and not a nun's truth that was convenient to these institutions at the time.  They got what they wanted, put the people here on the conveyer belt and it was boxed off.  Clearly that was done.</p><p> I am only asking for the witnesses' opinions on this because I feel absolutely useless.  I feel completely at a loss because of the lies that were written about the witnesses and the others in this situation and how badly they have all been treated.  How can we as a committee advocate for the witnesses, for people like them, for people who do not have the skills and for people who are not here, like the babies who are not alive?  How can we do our very best, in the witnesses' opinion to get the truth and to help get the truth, because the truth is not written down?  The truth is in people like the witnesses.  It is not really a question, I am just looking for opinions on that.</p></speech>

This has been talked about for decades.  The right to privacy has been used as a shield to prevent information getting out to the public.  It was really to protect the State.  That is what it was really about because if people got their information they would realise the wrongs that had been done to them.  We feel the present Attorney General has not properly explained why he now holds a different position to previous Attorneys General, in that he is saying it is possible for people to get their birth certificates.  He has never addressed the issue of our right to our child's adoption certificate but we have always felt as an organisation that there should be parity of esteem.</p> <p>  The way we have seen adoption is that there is a hierarchy of power and the powerless person in this was always the adopted person.  The person with less power and less agency was the natural mother and the people who had more choice were the adoptive parents.  We feel that hierarchy of rights should follow.  As we were constrained for so long and silenced for so long we think the least that can be done is for the right to information to be extended to us as mothers as well.  At the point a person reaches 18 years of age and is entitled to the birth certificate which will give them information on their original name then we should be entitled to our child's adoption certificate which will give us their new name.  When you think of it, for all those years we think of our children by the name we gave them.  It is very hard, when we find out the new name, to get used to that.  The earlier we can find out the new name the easier it will be for us to get used it.  It is also an emotional thing.  It is a preparation.  It is a preparation for the fact we will be meeting someone who has grown up into adulthood under other people's influence and it will help us with accepting that fact.</p></speech>

Like we said in our statement, we have been 20 years attending these meetings and I feel that strangers, all those years ago, made decisions that affected our lives for generations.  It is a basic human right to know where you come from so hopefully this Bill is going to do what it needs to do.  I agree wholeheartedly with what Ms McManus says about a referendum being the right way to go also.</p></speech>

They took that out of me.  I make no apology for that.  To trust in your own society and to lose that is somewhat horrifying.  I wish they would acknowledge what happened in the agreement of legalising everything they did and getting paid for our care, which did not happen, and the imprisonment of being an expectant mum outside the licence of marriage.  I agree with Ms McManus that it is essential more truth is acknowledged.  The more that is acknowledged, the more we can heal as a society.  Trans-generational trauma is very real and we are only a little island.  It is going to affect our society and culture for years to come.<br/><br/>I had three children after my firstborn son, Niall.  Niall John Kiernan only exists on paper.  Niall John Kiernan only exists for me.  The man he is today at 48 years of age goes by a different name and that was never my choice.  Our journey, good, bad or indifferent was supposed to be ours and ours alone, including his daddy.  DNA testing was not out back then.  Most fathers would never have been allowed on the birth certificate because the clergy registered your child.  On my son's birth certificate it says the residence is 384, Navan Road.  There is not a whisper of St. Patrick's, not a whisper of the nun who signed it Elizabeth, not Sister Elizabeth.  All of these institutions all around Ireland and all these same agencies, not one of them adhered to the Adoption Act 1952, which I only found out about eight years ago.  My son was 40 years of age when I found out the legal rights I had to keeping my son, even in 1973.  Therefore it must be exposed and must be acknowledged.  It must be allowed to be open and transparent and communicated to all.  Our children may suffer as adults, as fathers, as grandfathers or grandmothers.  Even today it is a third generation it is going to spill out on to, this huge void, this awfulness of not knowing anything.  It is barbaric actually.<br/><br/>We are 50 years behind Australia.  We are so many years behind so many countries in the same world.  Why is that?  I ask why we are so afraid to expose a church, I think it is called the Roman Catholic Church.  I am not a Catholic by the way.  I know it ran our State for years.  Is this what is wrong?  Are our leaders today so profoundly Catholic before they are Irish?  I often wonder about that myself because I am an Irish woman, very badly wronged, and my son is an Irish man but I am not Catholic Irish.  I am just Irish <i>per se</i>.  I wish to God - that is just a figure of speech - I wish for somebody somewhere who has access, who has the authority, who has the right, to stand up and say do you know what, this has been going on for 70 years.  I have run support groups for women for 22 years.  One of the women, Helen, is 87 years of age.  Her son is 70 years of age.  She is still waiting on somebody to do something.  It just has to stop.  If we want a future in this country of a healthy culture, an open society and to really reclaim our Irishness we need to go forward with truth and transparency for all.</p></speech>

I will leave this meeting impacted by that.  When this Bill was presented and as we have gone through it, we have seen it and hoped to report on it as being the right of adults and children to know who they are and to be able to trace who they are.  To be honest, I was very pleased with where we were going with that, but today abruptly stops me in my tracks with the thought that we have missed a big step here.  Let me try to reflect what I have heard.  The step is, first and foremost, that there is basic information that the witnesses, as mothers, have a right to know about the care of their children.  That is perhaps the least of the justified demands that I am hearing the witnesses share.</p> <p>  The second is the consent given.  I am a privacy lawyer by trade and consent must be fully informed and freely given for it to be truthful.  If girls did not understand the form they were filling out and could mistake an adoption form for a boarding out form, it is not consent.  If the opportunity is absolutely not even offered, then there is no consent.  That context of deliberate misleading and deliberate misinformation has to be borne in mind when we consider the right to information and who has that right to information.</p> <p>  I heard the witnesses articulate very movingly that they remember birthdays and Christmas and that they wonder about major events.  I can only imagine what that must be like and how difficult and challenging it is.  I am also hearing an anxiety about the files.  Clearly, there is access to the files to some degree, given that the witnesses can know the difference between them.  I am assuming that is the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  On what basis are the witnesses seeing the files?  I know also from the GDPR that they have a right to amend and correct where there is wrongful content in the files.  Perhaps an information piece has to happen about people's entitlement to that.  What I am hearing is that the files are not accurate.  There is a concern that the notes in them are jaundiced because they were written by people with an agenda and a context.  Perhaps they were nearly reckless as to the content.  It may have been human error for a small minority, or perhaps deliberate misleading and cover-up statements.  The witnesses have a right to know about their babies, what happened to their babies and the content of the file.  There is also an anxiety that when the grown-up baby gets that information, the information accurately portrays the mother and that the mother has a right to put a context on that.</p> <p>  I was struck by the words that the witnesses have a right to paint their personalities.  That is very powerful.  They are anxious to communicate who they are to the child.  The information leaflet needs to be more comprehensive.  I am very taken by having somebody sit with the witness to go through the file and to provide her with assistance and context.  Perhaps the accumulation of knowledge from that person after seeing lots of different files would mean the person could say, "That is what that means", so the witnesses would get the benefit of that advice.  I hear that very strongly.</p> <p>  I have been contacted anonymously and there are mothers who do not want contact because of their current circumstances.  It is not because of the child, but they want to keep it secret due to their current circumstances.  It may be difficult for them to come forward and seek the file to make sure about the file.  Do we need an information campaign to say these files are here and a sensitivity from the State that there may be gross inaccuracies here?</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to reflect their thoughts back.  Is that it?  That is what I think I am hearing the witnesses say.</p></speech>

As we said in our opening statement, this Bill has been constructed as if we never want or need information or contact with our children, and that is so wrong.  We have been fighting for this for many decades.  I will make a plea.  We made a submission as well, not just an opening statement.  The submission the committee has, which I hope the members have read, is very detailed.  We have presented it twice before, unamended and with exactly the same words.  We have been saying the same thing to the same civil servants for decades, and none of that has ever made its way into any legislation.  We do not know the reason for that.  We do not know why there seems to be some type of constructed wall against us as mothers and fathers.  We have a father on our committee as well whose child was adopted.  He is happily reunited with her.  We do not understand why we have not been listened to.  We hope this is a new generation of Deputies and Senators who will have open minds about this, but so far it is like we have been written out of history.</p> <p>  In the opening to our submission, we provided a series of quotations which I accessed in the National Archives.  It provides a walk through history and the changing attitudes towards adoption over the years.  Members will see that there is even a quote from a previous Minister for Justice, the late Mr. Paddy Cooney, who championed adoption as being better for the illegitimate baby than to be cared for by the baby's mother.  That was a Minister for Justice addressing the adoption social workers conference.  One can see the type of mindset we were working against and possibly the reason that people want to keep us silenced and want to keep the files closed.</p></speech>

I have assumed over the years that it is the fault of the system of the Civil Service.  When the civil servants have finished their work on helping with the drafting of a Bill, the information goes into a filing cabinet.  Those civil servants get promoted or are moved sideways, and then totally new civil servants come to the job.  They start from scratch and do not look back at the history of anything, just as the Senator, as a member of this committee, is hearing for the first time what we said to other politicians previously.  I assume that is the reason; I just do not know.</p></speech>

I am aware it is not easy.  The delegates have no idea how valuable this session is to our work and, I hope, our ability to get this legislation across the line.  I hope it will be the right legislation for everybody involved.  The delegates&rsquo; contribution is very much appreciated.  I realise it can seem a little impersonal when conducting the meeting online.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Harrison to say something.</p></speech>

I have gone to four Ministers to date begging, asking and hoping but, as Ms MacManus said, each Minister starts off anew.  Former Minister, James Reilly, had two terms, and I began again with the current Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, recently.  All we are asking for is humanity and for everyone concerned to rise above political and religious views and make our children and their mothers and fathers real.  We are real humans.  I would love to not die before my son knows it is okay for him to come forward and that he does not have to be afraid to do so and hear anything I have to say to him or about what I have left him in my will.  My eldest daughter has made sure she will find him and give him every single thing I have put aside for him so he will know his gene pool and about the love I had for him for the nine months he lived beside my heart and in the precious moment I came face to face with him.  That is what I want everybody to know.  Our children were taken and never ever given.  I ask anybody listening to please help us and stop this &ndash; how can I put it?  &ndash; process that just goes on and on and on.  Think of Helen living alone at 87 years of age.  Her son is 70.  Think of her if you can, but make it human thinking, not political or religious, or even related to society.  Make us human first.</p></speech>

It is difficult to know what words to use to say thanks; they seem so empty.  All I can say is that we have been on this committee together for about a year and three months and we are all genuinely motivated to work together to try to ensure this legislation and some of the other legislation we have dealt with, including the burials Bill, will be prioritised and dealt with.  We do appreciate, sincerely and from the heart, the statements and the really human, honest and passionate way in which the witnesses have answered questions.  They have given us an insight we absolutely would not have had otherwise.</p> <p>  I do not know but can imagine how frustrating it is for the witnesses.  I am not sure how many committees and Ministers they have dealt with but we will do our utmost to ensure it stops this time around and that the legislation is enacted and is fair, bringing in the human part, which is ultimately what it is all about.  We genuinely thank the delegates very much.  I thank the groups they represent, and also the mothers and fathers they represent.</p></speech>

I sincerely welcome Ms Lisa Kiernan and Ms Chris Wallace, members of In It Together-Who Am I?, and also Ms Alice McEvoy and Ms Joan McDermott, members of Solace for Mothers.  As we said to the previous witnesses, we are sincerely grateful that they have agreed to appear before the committee to tell their stories, make their statements and answer some questions on this Bill.  We are aware it is not an easy process.  It is extremely emotive but invaluable for us in our work on trying to ensure we get this right for everybody.  We very much appreciate it.</p> <p>  I need to go through parliamentary privilege before the witnesses make their opening statements.  As all the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if the witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Following the delivery of the opening statements, we will have questions and answers with the members.  Each member will have five minutes.  We will start with Ms McEvoy.  I thank her for being with us.  I invite her to deliver her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am here as a natural mother and part of a group called Solace for Mothers.  I am also a member of the Collaborative Forum and the steering group project on language and terminology representing mothers along with other members of the Collaborative Forum.  While we fully support the right of adopted adults to know their origins and identity, which we believe is their human right, we have concerns about the proposed adoption information Bill 2021 in its current draft.</p><p>The language with regard to mothers must be changed as we find the term "birth mother" offensive as it reduces mothers to the role of incubators.  We also object to other terms such as "given up".  We were forced to give up our children for adoption.</p><p> I will turn to birth parents&rsquo; privacy rights.  We are particularly concerned with regard to any medical information on our files which may be given to adopted people and their relatives.  Every citizen's medical files are covered by the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am also concerned by our medical files being treated as historical medical information and not our current medical information.  Is there a difference?  It appears that our historical medical information held by State agencies, for example, Tusla, should be handed over to our adopted children but not our current medical files, which are regarded as private.  We are also concerned about the Bill's contention that it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest that the applicant be provided with this information.  Our medical information should be given out only with our consent, which many of us have already given. </p><p> Head 13 concerns requests for information from agencies and authorities.  Our concern in this regard is about relatives of natural parents and adoptive relatives.  In some cases, mothers have not informed their families of the existence of their adopted child.  Can relatives of natural parents and adoptive relatives be contacted by State agencies having secured their names, addresses, etc., from other agencies without the natural parents&rsquo; consent? </p><p> Page 34 of the Bill, at Part 5, refers to a contact preference register and states that a significant minority of birth mothers gave up more than one child for adoption and may have different preferences as regards each child.  This statement is deeply offensive and derogatory to us as natural mothers in terms of the language used.  It is judgmental and its relevancy is questionable at best.</p><p> I thank the committee for listening to our concerns and I and my colleague, Ms McDermott, will try to answer any questions as best we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Chris Wallace" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021101900002#J00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to express our group's views of the proposed Bill.  We are representatives of a group, called relevant persons in the proposed Bill, and share one thing: each of our birth certificates contains false information making them illegal, not just incorrect.  We are not, as claimed by some groups, illegal adoptees but the victims of kidnap, child trafficking and identity theft.  We fall into three distinct but related groups.  The first group, Tusla file discoveries, currently stands at a membership of 151, with an assortment of records being held by Tusla.  We classify the second group as other or DNA discoveries.  This group currently accounts for 10% of our total with no paperwork to be found but incontrovertible proof of identity through DNA.  The third group comprises descendants of groups 1 and 2.  This is the largest group as it covers the descendants of both preceding groups.  The impact of this group will continue ad infinitum until this Bill is enacted and implemented.</p> <p>  False registrations are still occurring now.  The State&rsquo;s inability to provide a solution is now causing each of us to continually break the law while knowingly using false identities.  The number of acknowledged cases of false birth registrations is 151 but that does not take into account groups 2 and 3.  Based on our estimates, that number is actually 1,544 false birth records known to date.  If the suspected cases identified in the Shadow Cast Long report are used, this equates to a potential 178,000 false birth records.  If the marriage and death records are then added, close to 500,000 false records are being held at the General Register Office, GRO.  The Bill only deals with false birth registrations, when, in fact, the GRO must also hold false marriage and death certificates.</p> <p>  The State has maintained that the GRO records must be corrected.  Alterations without the immediate issue of a certificate of identity, coupled with a cut-off date for births at 31 December 1970, creates the potential for even more family trauma with potential multiple identities in use.  In an ideal world, all the records would be held by one easily accessible organisation but until that is possible, a detailed service level agreement must be put in place with any organisations involved to include key performance indicators to be regularly monitored by the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and Justice.</p> <p>  The use of DNA is critical in both verifying the information held in files and vital in proving identity.  Most of the record files held by the State are either incomplete, or partially or totally false, and some cannot be found.  In addition to making counselling available, the State needs to provide access to qualified genealogists to work with us to enable us to find our true identities.  Without DNA, the Act is of no use to us.  These amendments must be made now.</p> <p>  There is nothing in the current Bill to allow the members of this group to access their family data, even when their ancestors are deceased, nor to rectify those false entries.  This is leading to a continuation of false certification as the false information is carried forward by each new generation.  Despite declaring at the start of the Bill that we would be all included, the addition of clause C in head 29, entitled "Interpretation", the State is excluding a very large cohort from their right to rectify their false records.  If this is not changed, the State is merely continuing the conspiracy of silence that has brought the Government's predecessors into such disrepute.  Shame on the Government.</p> <p>  Justice has been excluded from this Bill while putting a heavy burden on the Irish taxpayer to provide resources.  Why not seize the assets of the organisations that committed the crimes and use that to properly resource and fully implement the Bill?  I am sure the Irish taxpayers would approve.  As Aldous Huxley once said, facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.</p> <p>  I thank the committee.  My colleague, Ms Kiernan, will be taking the lead in answering questions.</p></speech>

I appreciate their testimony.  I will ask my first question of the representatives of In It Together - Who Am I?  False records have been already spoken about a lot.  The current provisions of the Bill refer to affected persons as those whose entry in the register of births was made before 31 December 1970, and that cut-off mark is obviously problematic in itself.  I am wondering what problems the falsified records pose for those who have had false data recorded for them.  What about someone who would come up as born before the cut-off date but will be excluded because of falsified records?  Will someone comment on that?</p></speech>

I was born post 1970.  The best example I can offer relates to when I went in to get my pass to allow me to enter Leinster House.  I provided a form of identification on the basis of which I was Garda vetted.  That identification was false because my mother's birth surname I now know not to be correct.  It is not what is on her birth certificate.  For evermore, or until the records are changed, every time I go to renew my driver's licence or do anything else that requires a mother's birth surname or maiden name, for which one is often asked on the phone, through computers or wherever else, I will be passing on information which I now know to be untrue.</p><p>For a time before we were alerted to this, I was giving information that I knew was possibly untrue but I did not have an alternative to the information.  Now I am doing that constantly.  I can only really speak on behalf of our group and personally can only really speak for my mum and me.  When my mum got married, her marriage certificate had her birth surname as it is on her birth certificate.  Everything else can go with this, whether it is a mortgage application or anything else.  It is very important to people.</p><p> My mum does not want to have everything changed.  She has lived for 72 years as she thought she was or is.  We want acknowledgement of what is the truth.  These people are entitled to it and I am entitled to it.  We want it to be legal when we hand over legal documents.</p></speech>

I flew from England to Ireland and when I walked through the gate and was asked for a passport, I said to myself that it was false and asked myself what would happen if I got caught.  It is not something I have ever given thought to before but since this happened, every time I go through the airport I am asked for a passport or driving licence.  What am I supposed to say?  I might get away with telling the truth in Ireland but in England, Australia or America, I would have no chance.  Can members imagine having to explain it in a foreign language as well?  I have also got a female father, according to records.  How about that?  That is the immaculate conception with a vengeance.  That is as much as I will say on the subject.</p></speech>

I have a quick question for Ms McEvoy.  The submission speaks very much to terminology and language.  Will the witness speak to how the language in the legislation has framed a particular narrative with the Bill?  She mentioned that the term "birth mother" could be seen as offensive.  We can see it now and that should not have to be pointed out.  When it is, we can see it.  Will Ms McEvoy speak a little about why the language is so problematic and if that has any implications for the narrative attached to the Bill?</p></speech>

We are always our children's mothers.  The language may state "given up for adoption" but we did not give them up.  We were forced to sign these papers.  I feel the language could influence the whole narrative of the Bill.  I have found in the past with other changes of terminology, especially with LGBT groups, it changed people's thinking towards those groups.  That is how I see the narrative going.  It is so important to get the terminology of the Bill right.  Once it is entered into legislation, it will be there forever.  That is why if members might think we are going on about something minor, it is not minor to us.</p> <p>  There are phrases like "given up", "taken" and terms like "first offenders".  Mothers have been called every name under the sun but we are just mothers.  That is our preference.  If the language of the Bill is right, it will influence society in general to look at us as we are, just as mothers.  We are the same as everyone and all mothers in Ireland.  The labelling we see is not for our good.</p></speech>

I thank the Solas for Mothers group for focusing our attention on language and its impact.  Language should be accurate and considered.  The witnesses point out the term "birth mothers" as being offensive, along with phrases like "given up", and we all agree with that.  In other meetings the question of the language to be used has come up.  To clarify, was the suggestion that a reference to mothers should simply be the term "mother" with nothing before or after it?</p></speech>

There are many such terms and whoever is writing the legislation should check each one, especially when it relates to adopted adults.  The term "adoptees" should not be used.  I cannot even remember the entire list of terms but the legislation should be scrutinised thoroughly.  Everybody involved in the different groups should be consulted on what they would like to be called.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the term should be just "mothers".  That is how I look at myself.  I have two children and I am supposedly a birth mother to one and a mother to another.  That is ridiculous.  I am the same mother to all of them, whether I see one of them or not.  People's children do not put labels on us.  The members might think I am focusing too much on this but they could ask adopted adults what they think as well.  It is very complicated language and what is being used in the current draft is very outdated.  I am aware that group is taking notice of this draft and the terms.  Just because people use them in the world does not mean they are right.  Members know that people used to use all sorts of racist and discriminatory language, especially to LGBT groups.  Miraculously, that attitude has changed with the language used being changed.</p></speech>

As indicated in the opening statement, our group is not comprised of illegal adoptees.  I am not sure my mum would look to be referred to as an "adopted adult" as for her that would probably be as much of an insult as when Tusla representatives came to meet us and offered to see if they could have her adopted at 70 years old.  That would have been an official adoption.  My mum is my mum and she is who she is.  She does not know who she is but she is who she is.  She is not adopted.  She was bought, she was sold, she was trafficked; it can be whatever word people want to use.  It was the same with most of our group.</p> <p>  I take issue with the language.  The term "illegal adoptions" seems to be used regularly for the group, particularly with what was originally the 126 of the St. Patrick's Guild group.  We now know the number to be far bigger than that.  I ask sincerely that the practice of referring to these people as "adoptees" is stopped as they were never adopted.  I know it hurts my mum to use the words but they were bought, they were sold and they were trafficked.  That is what it is.  It must be acknowledged for anything to work with this Bill.</p></speech>

We really appreciate them appearing before the committee because today's sessions are really important for the Bill.  It is brilliant they are here.</p><p> The following question is for Ms Kiernan.  In the opening statement, there was mention of DNA.  There was also mention in the previous session of a DNA database and having accurate information.  In the previous session, we also continuously heard about not being able to trust the so-called records and the information that is in those files.  I want to ask Ms Kiernan her opinion on getting a DNA database that the State would recognise so that one would be able to know who one's family are legally.</p><p> Ms Kiernan mentioned the small group of 441.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, stated last month, in the context of illegal birth registrations, that it was a small group of 441.  Ms Kiernan used 151 as her base number.  What is the impact of those numbers for Ms Kiernan's group?</p><p> I thank Ms McEvoy for the clarification in respect of the mothers.  That cuts out all other labels because, after all, a mammy is a mammy, and Ms McEvoy is a mother.  My children call me some things, but I am also their mother.  I thank Ms McEvoy for that clarification as well.</p></speech>

We all have seen the advertisements on television, social media and radio for the likes of Ancestry and My Heritage.  People are buying family members DNA tests as Christmas presents, birthday presents and Mother's Day presents.  You innocently spit into a tube, you think you will find your whole family tree and then you suddenly discover there is not a single person on the family tree that you have ever heard of, let alone know.  It is imperative, as far as we are concerned, that there is some kind of database and that DNA is acknowledged to be proof of who you are.  We can use it in the criminal law system.  We can use it when mother and fathers are arguing over who the parent of the child is.  We can use it for all those, but why cannot we use it to know who we are?  From that point of view, DNA has to be involved in this Bill.  There is no way around it.  There is no other answer.<br/><br/>It has to be acknowledged that DNA services are not affordable for many people.  My understanding is that they costs approximately &euro;500 per test.  In order to test your DNA against somebody else's, you need at least two people.  That is not on.  It has to be a part of the final Bill.  We would beg for that one to be part of it.<br/><br/>The second question the Senator asked was about the 441 versus the 151.  We were shocked when, at the committee's meeting last month, the Minister described the illegal birth registrants as a very small group of 441.  We have been informed that it has always been 151.  It seems that there has been a giant leap in the month of September, but nobody alerted us to that fact.  Regardless of whether it was an error or a typo in the Minister's speech to the committee, it is a huge leap.  We would like to know where that number is coming from.  When we look at our numbers between all three different groups, we are looking at close to 180,000.  When you add all the others group together that are being considered for different parts of this Bill, such as the survivors of the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes, the number of those who actually have adoption orders does not even add up to 178,000.  We are a huge group.  We are not insignificant.  We have to be listened to.<br/><br/>I really hope we are heard.  There is a line at the end of the book <i>Banished Babies</i>which reads, &quot;Deny until they die.&quot;  There are many who are getting on in life.  Many of the mothers in our group - I use the word &quot;mothers&quot; quite easily, actually - such as my grandmother have passed, unfortunately.  We are running out of time and we need to give these women some kind of justice.</p></speech>

I had always used the word "mothers" but, in the context of adoption, we want to use the term "natural".  When it comes to the adoption, "natural mother" is our preferred term.  In the 1952 Act, that was the term legally used.  I just want to clarify that.</p></speech>

I have had two in my life: the one who gave birth to me and the one who I lived with most of my life.  They are both equally loved.  It is not derogatory towards birth mothers.  To me, they are one and the same.  I was given up for whatever reason but I had a good life.  I am not blaming anybody for it.  I loved both.  The birth mother was, sadly, dead by the time I knew of her and I could not possibly have met her.  From what I have heard, I am the spitting image of her and similar in personality and character as well.  She is living on.  One of my cousins on her side said, "Oh, Christ", and that she had got up out of her grave to come back and haunt us.  There you go.  There is nothing derogatory about calling someone a birth mother.  To me, it is an expression to differentiate between the two mothers I had.</p></speech>

When I was in Bessborough, prior to giving birth we were known as first offenders.  Then, after we gave birth, we were known as birth mothers.  It has connotations for us because when the term "birth mothers" is mentioned, it brings many of us back to the time when we were in the homes.  It actually diminishes our babies' connection to us.  That is the reason we feel that we have suffered enough trauma and endured being labelled and referred to as birth mothers.  We find it unacceptable but that is because we have lived through it.  That is all I have to say on that.</p></speech>

It is powerful for us to understand why the term "birth mother" is problematic for some people.  My own preference would be to use the word "mother" for everybody because the term "natural" is difficult for those women who lived with their children and had the opportunity to rear them.  Some have come before the committee and talked about the difficulty of being referred to as unnatural and of that being seen as opposite of natural.</p><p>Finding the right formula of words here is certainly going to be a challenge but after hearing why, it is the best explanation for why being referred to as &quot;birth mother&quot; is such a sensitive term.  I really get that and hear that.<br/><br/>When Ms Kiernan and I last met, she quoted  the line &quot;deny until they die&quot; from <i>Banished Babies</i>.  I wrote it down then and had it ready to come back to her today because I thought it was really powerful.  It is important that we are all very much upfront in what is going on here and about what needs to be articulated and, hence, that is why we wanted to make sure our guests came before the committee to speak to us.<br/><br/>The Bill has a portion that is supposed to address having a bespoke solution to ensure the legality of the identities people believe they had and believe they are and with which they have lived all of their lives.  Some people are content to continue with that identity or name and others are not.  Allowing for the fact that the official register of births needs to now be corrected, where possible, and allowing for the fact that there was such unlawful activity going on with some of the information that was given, I am not sure some of the information is going to be able to be sorted out.  There is, therefore, an issue that we need to perhaps explore a little bit.  That is where DNA is a really good solution.  I heard Ms Kiernan speak about that previously.  I know places like Ormond Quay Paternity Services carry out DNA testing for the courts' purposes but it is very expensive.  It comes in just shy of &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,000.  That is phenomenally expensive for people.<br/><br/>Could Ms Kiernan perhaps talk about that if she does not mind?  Could she outline her views of the bespoke solution that is within the Bill and how appropriate that is or how that needs to be amended?  I will hand over to her.</p></speech>

I am glad she noted that line from Mike Milotte's book because I think it really does say a lot.<br/><br/>When I think of it, the legalities of the Act are not taken into account for anyone other than the single person who is, if you like, I would also nearly go back to saying illegally adopted, which frustrates me because it has been consistently used for somebody who has been falsely registered.  It does not take into account the descendants, however, and, as Mr. Wallace so very correctly said, that will continue <i>ad infinitum</i>until we all have no more descendants.  That is a big issue.<br/><br/>Therefore, like that, my identification is never going to be corrected as per the Bill as it stands.  The Bill in its current format does not include allowing anybody other than the individual affected or the relevant person to have access to that information or to have access to have the information changed.  This was clarified to me not only by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, but also by Tusla.  It was actually very shocked when I brought up the fact that I would not be entitled to get the information if anything happened to my mum.  It does not, therefore, go far enough with the legalities.<br/><br/>I know the Senator has a superb legal background and we have other Senators and Deputies on this committee with legal backgrounds, particularly, for example, around constitutional rights.  We have the constitutional right to be who we are and to know who we are.  That is not taken into account in this Bill at all.</p></speech>

In the explanatory note, the provisions in the head are to "ensure that information on an incorrect birth can be sought and shared with the General Register Office ... for the purpose of enabling correction of an entry in the Birth Register".</p> <p>  Recently, I was waiting in anticipation for files under a subject access request and thought that I would sit down for the afternoon and read right through them.  Unfortunately, I was informed that the files for my era in Bessborough were probably burnt and that there were no files.  To my shock, however, I had in that envelope three registered papers relating to my son's adoption.  All contained my signature but none of these signatures were pertaining to me.</p> <p>  As I just quoted, head 30 of the Bill states, "for the purpose of enabling correction of an entry in the Birth Register".  Nowhere in the Bill could I find any reference regarding the correction of registrations on the adoption register.  I would like some answers on that, please.  I have three documents which led my son to think that he was legally adopted when he was not, and an incorrect birth certificate, of which he is now in possession since he met me in 2015.  He obviously had no access to his birth certificate but when he did receive information from the State agency, the birth information - the dates of birth - were incorrect.  It is one hell of a mess.</p> <p>  My question is a very pertinent one.  He said to me very recently that he kind of wonders where he fits in.  He asked, "Am I stateless?"  Could someone expand on that a bit?  He was born in this jurisdiction.  He has an incorrect date of birth.  As happened to many people in the 1960s, he has an inappropriate adoption.  The criterion in the late 1960s was that if a person was of good standing in his or her community, he or she could go to Bessborough and say, "I want one".  He or she went down along the row of cots and said, "I will have that one" like one would pick apples in the supermarket.  It is not a funny analogy but that really happened.</p></speech>

Therefore, here you have a man who is now in his 50s, with a name given to him that is not his at all, and an inappropriate - like the previous speaker, I do not know what word to use .  What do I say he is?  Is he illegally adopted?  I do not know.</p> <p>  Getting back to my original question, while there is provision in the Bill for the correction of the birth registration at the General Register Office, GRO, will the committee look favourably or speak with the Minister in the future about this?  Under subject access requests, more and more people are receiving files and they are shocking.  The information in them is shocking.  It is a very big issue in a person's life to ask, "Am I adopted or am I not if I am on the register as I am but my mother did not sign the signature?"  I will tell the Senator that my signatures were forged.</p></speech>

I think that goes to the heart of it.  So much of the information is false, fraudulently forged and made to appear correct when it is not and from others I have spoken to, it is patent lies and deliberate misleading.

There needs to be an inquiry into illegal adoptions.  Looking at my own files, while my signature was not forged, there were irregularities.  There was no commissioner of oaths.  None of them is perfectly legal, to be honest.  That gives a worry to adopted people.  If they are not properly adopted, what are they?  Most people I have talked to have irregularities in the adoption process, including my own.  I only discovered very recently when studying my own files that there were incorrect procedures.  There was also incorrect vetting of adoptive parents.  I am slow to bring that up but there was a lot of rules broken in the past and it is high time the whole thing was looked into from that angle.  There should be a public inquiry into the whole area of illegal adoption.</p></speech>

It is my name, it is the one I use, and it is spelled "ace".</p> <p>  To the birth mothers I say I agree with much of what the birth mothers have said.  My birth mother did not sign the adoption form.  It was forged.  I have never met her, she is dead, but I have proof that it was fake.  We do not take the birth mothers as being the wronged parties, we are all in the wrong.  It is the State and the religious orders that have caused it.

When we received the Tusla file I was referred to as Lisa with my incorrectly registered surname, so I am getting used to that at the moment.   I found this meeting exceptionally powerful.  I had not thought about some of the terminology.  The terminology that I always got annoyed about was the illegal adoptees.  I had thought about my grandmother an awful lot.  I would have loved to have met her.  She sounds like she was as wild as I am, or was, but I had never thought of how to think of her as anything other than my grandmother.</p> <p>  I want to return to GDPR.  Some people will be exceptionally disappointed if I do not mention it.  GDPR has been the best thing that ever happened to this State because it has been able to hide behind it.  I will say something that I had not prepared myself to say.  My mother finally received her file from Tusla a month ago, or maybe less.  I thought that the Minister, Deputy Zappone, had made an announcement regarding the St. Patrick's Guild and the 126 children in or around 30 May 2018.  GDPR came into effect four or five days before that.  Tusla searched for my mum and found my mum on 18 March 2018.  Tusla held on and did not contact my mum until 9 August 2018.  Stop hiding behind everything.  Just stop doing it.  It is wrong.  It is unjust.  People need to get the truth and the State is continually hiding behind these things.  I am not saying that to any of the members directly but I am saying that in general the State is hiding behind excuses like GDPR.  My mum is entitled to know who I am.  Chris is entitled to know who she is.  I am entitled to know my history.  Just, please, do it.  </p></speech>

Some mothers have very sensitive information on their files.  It relates to causes of pregnancy such as rape and incest.  If this information in their files was released without their consent, the distress and harm that would be done is immeasurable.  I am very mindful that our medical information past is called "historical" yet my current medical information is way more interesting than the past one when I was 20 years of age, which was very little.  I am very concerned about medical information which is covered by GDPR for every citizen in the State, yet the Bill proposes that adopted people and their relatives could have access to our private medial files.  That is a very worrying concern and I hope the committee takes it on board when it writes the report.</p></speech>

Some of them are suffering immensely both mentally and physically as a result of the circumstances surrounding their pregnancy, rape and incest.  This is where the Bill has to be clear as to how the rights and freedoms of the natural mothers are not adversely affected.  Any information the mother chooses to divulge has to be done with consent which must be honoured.</p></speech>

As I said in the earlier part of the meeting, it really is invaluable for the committee in its prelegislative report of the Bill and it is fantastic that everyone was able to join us and speak with such passion, from the heart and with such honesty.  We know that it is not easy and we really do appreciate it.  We want to sincerely thank everyone for taking the time.  We will take all their suggestions on board.</p><p>I know that the groups have made submissions and it is not just what we heard today.  We have appreciated this really informative debate and it has been really good to have the back and forth of questions and answers.  I thank the witnesses and the committee members.</p><p> Is it agreed to publish the opening statement to the Oireachtas website?  Agreed.  Again, I thank members and all of the witnesses.</p></speech>

We have discussed the Bill previously in committee and we are aware of its complexity.  It is substantial legislation, urgently required as we streamline the development process for our huge maritime area to replace the outdated Foreshore Act 1930.  The Bill will provide for planning and development but also the protection of our fragile marine environment.  It will also allow us to maintain public and community consultation and engagement as we enter a chapter of energy production in Ireland where there will be substantial offshore renewable energy development.</p> <p>  The Minister of State might wish to say a few words on the Bill before we commence.</p></speech>

This is very significant legislation.  I am grateful for the work of the Department and our officials in regard to how they have progressed it.  It has been fully underwritten by public consultation throughout the island of Ireland, with many stakeholder groups and meetings through the national marine planning framework, NMPF, our overarching document for the management of our maritime area.  I am grateful also to all the communities that have engaged in the consultation process.  Through the NMPF, I had the great privilege of chairing the advisory group in which many stakeholders were involved and had their say.  This is pivotal legislation we are putting through the Oireachtas.  It is a very exciting space and it is a privilege to work with officials in the Department leading this key policy item for the Government and the Thirty-third D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#A00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 16, line 1, after &ldquo;(6)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and (7)&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>I might make a couple of general comments while speaking to these amendments.  Given that so many amendments have been tabled, this will be the only time I will make general comments and I will thereafter stick to the specificity of the amendments as we go through them.  To expedite matters, I will speak to amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, as they are all, ultimately, related.</p><p>As we saw when we dealt with the general scheme in pre-legislative scrutiny, all members want this legislation to pass.  There is a universal acceptance that we absolutely need a good-quality, robust planning regime for the marine, alongside an appropriate agency with effective enforcement, not just because we urgently have to meet our 2030 renewable energy targets but also because it is the right thing to do.  Like the Minister of State, I acknowledge the very significant volume of work the officials have had to deal with, not just in regard to the Bill but over recent years.  They have been exceptionally helpful with members whenever we have asked for additional information, briefings and so on.</p><p>The challenge for us as a committee is that while a member can absolutely support the intention of a Bill, he or she will still want to play a role in scrutinising it thoroughly to ensure that when we get to the other side, the Bill and the mechanisms it will put in place will do exactly what we all want it to do, namely, to allow for good decisions about maritime use.</p><p>A member will also want the Bill to allow for a good planning regime, particularly for offshore wind, but one that protects and secures our marine environment and biodiversity.  Those are quite challenging things.  I was saying to the Chair at the start that one of the challenges for us is that this is incredibly complex.  It is certainly the most complex legislation I have encountered in my five years here.  We are trying to put in place almost four strands of a system - licensing, consents, the agency itself and enforcement - all of which must operate in a complex and comprehensive EU and domestic legislative framework as well as a cumbersome and complex planning framework.  I probably am saying all of that by way of a caveat so that if some of the amendments, as I go through them, are less coherent than I would like them to be it is merely because this is genuinely taxing, certainly for those of us on this side of the Chamber.</p><p> I still have the two concerns I have had from the start.  Many of the amendments I have tabled seek to give the Minister of State the opportunity to put on the record of the committee his responses to those concerns.  Depending on those responses, I may well withdraw my amendments if the answers are satisfactory.  There are some areas - these will be small in number - where the Bill could be improved.  Obviously, I hope that the Minister of State will take on board the spirit, if not the letter, of the amendments and come back.  All of my amendments are tabled - other colleagues' amendments would be the same - on the basis of trying to strengthen the legislation.</p><p> To reassure the Minister of State, we had a lengthy discussion earlier today on working to progress this legislation as quickly as possible while giving it the maximum amount of time.  The Minister of State will note the committee will be forthcoming in giving time to get through the Bill quickly but without scrimping on the necessary scrutiny.</p><p> On these first three amendments, like a lot of planning legislation, there are many areas where the outworkings of the legislation will depend on commencements and commencement dates.  In many areas, there is a lack of clarity on what the Government's intention is with respect to commencements.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related.  Amendment No. 3 speaks to the same issue, which is around the commencements of the maritime spatial plans set out in Part 2, Chapter 2, and when they will be commenced.  Obviously, they are crucial to many other aspects of the consents, the licensing and, ultimately, planning decisions.  There is also the issue of the marine planning framework review.  Given that some people still have some concerns about the content of that, it would make sense that we have clarity not only about commencements with respect to the maritime spatial plans, but also the interaction of the review with this section and related sections of the Bill.</p><p> There is a related issue around the role of the Oireachtas in all of this.  I refer to the question of whether the Oireachtas simply gets a copy of something or has a formal role in amending or approving it.  Therefore, there is a role for greater provision, as in amendment No. 3, for opportunities for the Oireachtas to debate fully those related matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#B00200"><p>Likewise, I will do my best to make sure things move quickly while seeking to do our job well and give the Bill the scrutiny it needs.</p> <p>  By way of brief opening comment before I get into the amendments, this is a very important Bill.  It is long overdue.  It is needed.  I have concerns about the protection of our fragile marine environment and whether this Bill will be sufficient in that regard.  I have concerns that, as with all development and planning processes, our approach to date in this country has been too developer-led, especially in terms of the marine environment, and that this Bill does not go sufficiently far to ensure it is not developer-led.  There was good correspondence from the Coastal Concern Alliance today which made the point that the best international practice is for countries to screen areas, pick sites for wind energy development and tender for those sites to be used, and that we have taken the opposite approach where it has been developer-led and developers have picked sites.  I would strongly share the alliance's concerns on this.</p> <p>  I am very concerned as well that we do not have the marine protected areas planned and mapped out.  We are meant to have 30% of our areas protected by 2030 and to date only 2% of them are.  It would be useful to hear from the Minister of State, in particular, on all of our amendments, exactly what will happen in terms of marine protected areas, what progress has been made and when we will get those designations in place because that relates to many of the concerns I have about the Bill and the processes.</p> <p>  In relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I refer specifically to the maritime spatial plans and when Part 2, Chapter 2 will come into operation.  My amendments seek to ensure it will come into operation on the enactment of the Bill.  The maritime spatial plans, the considerations which inform them, the requirements for them in relation to the review of the NMPF and the public participation requirements, and how they are approved by the Oireachtas, all are important.  Given that the NMPF will be an input into the decision-making process in respect of a range of matters under the Bill, it is important that it is urgently reviewed and that the overall architecture and requirements of the marine spatial plans for our marine environment are addressed.  It is critically important that these actions will not be delayed through these provisions not being commenced.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 seeks to ensure the review of the current NMPF is done under section 17(2) before it is used to inform a range of matters, such as the designated maritime area plans, DMAPs, the maritime area consents, MACs, and the decisions under the planning Act.</p> <p>  I apologise because I will be stepping out for a few minutes to move a Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I will be back straight after.</p></speech>

I do not see any others indicating.  For the information of the Minister of State, at the committee this morning, we discussed the opportunity for the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, or maybe you, to come in and discuss the progress on marine protected areas.  Hopefully, we will be able to do that directly after this Bill and that will inform the committee of the progress that has been made.  I believe good progress is being made there.  I invite the Minister of State to respond.</p></speech>

I concur that this is an important Bill and I look forward to working with everyone.  On points where we think we can make progress and find common ground, as a Government we will commit to do that.  I note in the amendments some important matters have been raised with Deputies and we will work to resolve them in partnership to ensure we get the best legislation scrutinised in this committee.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 2 proposes to commence Part 2, Chapter 2, relating to the provisions for the NMPF, on enactment.  Amendment No. 1 is a proposed technical amendment to enable amendment No. 2.  Section 1(5) provides for commencing various elements of the Bill by order.  This flexibility is necessary to ensure the necessary resources and structures are in place to operate the new provisions.  I will be opposing this amendment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 proposes to prevent the commencement of Part 2, Chapters 3 and 6, Part 4 and Part 8 pending a subsection (1) review of the NMPF, under section 17(2) and a subsequent statement to the Oireachtas and a debate in both Houses.  The Oireachtas cannot make commencement conditional on external events and factors.  I will be opposing amendment No. 3.</p></speech>

Could the Minister of State at least reassure the committee what the intentions are in terms of the commencement timeline of those relevant sections of the relevant Part?  While I understand the Minister of State saying he wants that necessary flexibility, if the committee was reassured of early commencement of those relevant sections, that might go some way to addressing our concern.</p></speech>

That is why it has progressed so quickly.  It got the necessary resources.  There is no intention to sit on parts of this and not commence them.  We will absolutely give resources to working through its commencement in a logical way.</p></speech>

That is the prerogative of the Government and its duty is to do that.  It is the job of the Oireachtas to hold the Government to account if it fails in doing that in any aspect.  I assure the committee there will be no delay with this legislation.  It is getting the utmost urgency from the Government and that will continue to be the case.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State give us some indicative timeline of the review of the marine planning framework and how he and his officials expect that review to interact with some of the new innovations that will come into force as a result of the enactment of this Bill?</p></speech>

The hope is to do it earlier.  We will take into account innovations in the area, which is a fast-moving space.  There is much happening, as other members alluded to in speaking to the complexity of the Bill.  I hope it will happen earlier than the specified timeframe.</p></speech>

Six years is a long time and one of the big issues with the marine planning framework arises because we did not have either the designation or even notional designations of the marine protected areas, MPAs.  When that legislation comes through there will be a beginning of the process of designation of the MPAs.  A commitment was previously given that before we even have the formal review of the marine planning framework, the outworking of the MPA designations could be kind of reverse-engineered into the framework.  Will the Minister of State give us a reassurance we will not have to wait either three, four, five or six years?  The marine planning framework was described as a living document and it will constantly evolve to take into account developments such as designation or even some of the interim protection measures that this committee recommended in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.</p></speech>

I recall when discussing the marine planning framework that there was a suggestion it would be reviewed in a much earlier timeframe.  That is my recollection.</p></speech>

What is in the legislation is a maximum of six years.  I do not want to be accused of giving an inaccurate response.  Additionally, I am saying it is the intention of the Government is to have it done earlier than that timeframe.  It is as much as I can say at the moment.  Notwithstanding the comments from the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, in the D&aacute;il relating to his work on MPAs, consultation is ongoing and may even be completed at this stage.  He expects to have legislation next year in that regard.  The process is progressing and the Minister of State will give an update to the committee on that in due course.</p></speech>

It seems odd there is no definition of an &quot;ecosystems-based approach&quot; in the legislation but perhaps it is elsewhere in existing legislation.</p><p>I am happy to be corrected if that is the case.  Given that this is such a fundamental principle of the twin concerns of ensuring we have an adequate supply of renewable offshore energy and, at the same time, we fully respect marine biodiversity, counteract some of the loss of that diversity and continue to protect what is there, particularly in the context of the forthcoming marine protected areas, it seems sensible to include this definition.  The definition I am proposing is in accordance with the marine strategy framework directive and the marine spatial planning directive, which are the two overarching EU legal frameworks within which all of this legislation and its subsequent workings have to comply.</p></speech>

The MSFD is not correctly referenced in this amendment.  Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishes a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy.  This is the marine strategy framework directive.  The term referred to in the amendment is not directly defined in either directive.  Instead, it is stated as a principle.  Construing a term in accordance with two different directives is not appropriate due to the risk of the use in different contexts and the potential for divergence and inconsistency, which would create potential practical issues as attendant legal risks.  As the legislation gives effect to the MSPD, it is appropriate to construe the term in accordance with that instrument and this is achieved in the Bill through section 13(2).  No amendment to section 13(2) has been proposed.  Therefore, if approved, this amendment would introduce inconsistency and conflict between section 2 and section 13 of the Bill.  For that reason, I oppose this amendment.</p></speech>

Will the definition of "ecosystems-based approach" in section 13(2) apply to all uses of an ecosystems-based approach or just those relevant to that section?  I am more than happy to withdraw my amendment if the Minister of State is saying that section 13(2) provides a sufficient definition for all other aspects of the Bill.  If it does, I am happy to proceed on that basis.  If it does not, I am still happy to withdraw my amendment but I ask the Minister of State to take another look at this issue to ensure there is a consistent definition of "ecosystems-based approach" that applies at all appropriate points.</p></speech>

I ask the officials to look again at the issue of the definition and its legal standing.  The only reason I might pursue this matter is that for a very long time, as I understand it, when we were talking about environmental protection inside or outside the marine area, we tended to list individual geographical locations, species or whatever.  The great value of putting an ecosystems-based approach at the heart of everything we are doing is that it is a systems-based approach.  Everything and how it interrelates with everything else becomes fundamental.  It seems to me that because this is planning legislation, things may get challenged legally at some point in the future.  Let us hope not.  Let us hope that the legislation is robust and that decisions are made in accordance with the best interests of all affected parties.  The greater the legal clarity on some of these issues, the better.  I would appreciate if the officials could undertake to look at this and to advise the Minister of State whether something is required on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It lists various days such as public holidays, the period between 24 December and 2 January, the first two weeks in August and any other period that the Minister may prescribe.  Consultation periods can be tricky, particularly with more complex types of consents or grants of planning permission under the framework created by this legislation.  People are going to need the maximum period of time.  This is, therefore, a very reasonable amendment.  If there is a better way to draft it, I will be more than happy to withdraw it.  The Minister of State might want to go away and come back with a better wording on Report Stage.  He can see the intention of the amendment.</p></speech>

Such times can be very convenient for those who would rather that the public did not have a full view of things that may significantly impact on them and their environment.  To exclude holiday periods, Christmas periods, bank holidays and so on, as this amendment proposes, is essentially a means of ensuring things do not pass by the public which could significantly impact upon them.  It gives people an opportunity to be involved in public participation and the sustainable planning and development of their local areas.  This is a very reasonable proposal.</p><p>I would like to mention an idea that occurred to me when I was reading through the amendments.  I have not tabled an amendment on this point, but I certainly will on Report Stage.  When we are doing public consultations, as well as having to put things in a national newspaper or on a website, there should be radio advertisements from the Department or the Government on such matters.  We regularly hear such material being broadcast to the public in respect of something of significance, including things to do with public health and some social welfare matters.  In the case of this legislation, a review of the NMPF or a marine spatial plan should be advertised, just as we regularly hear other matters being advertised.  Many people do not buy <i>The Irish Times</i>or the <i>Irish Independent</i>these days.  Much of the time people are completely unaware of these notices.  There should be radio advertisements.  Maybe we should consider social media as well, although I am slightly reluctant to encourage more use of social media, to be honest.  Radio advertisements can be quite effective.  I think we should include provisions to make this happen when important public consultations are taking place.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 10 proposes to exclude certain days from public consultation periods to ensure that such consultations are not inappropriately truncated.  I accept the spirit of this amendment and thank the Deputies for its proposal.  This amendment is not necessary for Part 2, which involves marine spatial planning, because the regulations made under sections 18(4) and 23(4) of the Bill will set out appropriate time periods for public consultation and will exclude certain times from the consultation period.  If it is agreeable to the committee, I will instruct my officials to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to prepare the necessary text and appropriate locations within the Bill as a supplementary amendment.</p><p>I will oppose the amendment as proposed.  Perhaps the Deputies would consider withdrawing the amendment to allow for further consideration.  Our main objective, as I hope I am demonstrating, is that the public will be involved in every step of this process.  We have demonstrated that through the national marine planning framework, whereby there were regional advertisements for the various roadshows it embarked on throughout its four year genesis until it was approved by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The revised provisions propose default boundaries of the nearshore areas of neighbouring coastal planning authorities, CPAs, subject to subsequent designation by order to account for local circumstances and geography.</p><p>Amendment No. 13 will simplify the definition of &ldquo;nearshore area&rdquo; in section 2.  Amendment No. 20 proposes that the boundaries of the nearshore areas will, by default, be equidistant between two neighbouring coastal planning authorities.  Amendments Nos. 21, 23, 24, 26, 27 and 29 are minor technical amendments to account procedurally for the variation from the default.</p><p>Amendment No. 28 will increase the timeframe for response from a coastal planning authority relating to a proposed designation.  This formal consultation period will only be initiated following detailed technical engagement with the authority concerned.  Finally, amendment No. 22 proposes procedural changes to the nearshore designation.</p><p>I thank Deputy McAuliffe for his proposal in amendment No. 22, which would have improved the legal text as initiated.  It has, however, been superseded by the revisions required for default boundaries between CPAs and, unfortunately, cannot be accepted.  He might consider withdrawing the amendment based on my comments.</p></speech>

I suspect the Minister of State will break the bad news to us shortly that he will not accept the amendment.  Nevertheless, it would be good if, elsewhere in the legislation, the Government made clear that in all aspects of the work of the various bodies and processes outlined in the Bill, whether regarding licensing, consent, planning or policy, the organisations listed in the amendment will, along with others, be central to everything that happens.  This could be stated in the regulations that will come at a later stage after the Bill has been enacted or elsewhere within the Bill.</p> <p>  We reflected quite a bit in pre-legislative scrutiny on the challenges, again to be generous about it, with strategic housing developments, for example, and the fear many organisations had that they were not being adequately involved in the process.  That led to greater disagreements regarding proposals, judicial reviews and so on, and we want to avoid all that.  If the Government were to give a clear statement of intent that these, along with others, are precisely the kinds of organisations it would like to have a central role at all the appropriate points, that would go some way to reassuring us on it.</p><p>I presume there will be a later stage where regulations will prescribe the specific organisations.  I am just making my proposals.  I presume there will be a point post the passing of the legislation where, by way of regulations, the Minister of State will list the prescribed organisations specific to the marine area.  Could he tell us if we will be surprised to see any of these organisations not on that list, if he has had discussions on that, or how would it ordinarily transpire?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#F00200"><p>I missed the first few minutes because I was in the D&aacute;il.  My concern, and that of a lot of people, is that we are pushing through legislation which is about facilitating development rather than starting with the proper mapping out of what should and should not happen, where it should happen and when it should happen in the marine environment, and having proper consultation around all of that.  In our opinion, consultation has not happened to the degree that it should.  We want to see this Bill remedy that as much as possible and ensure that all of those who have an interest in protecting our heritage, marine environment, fisheries, tourism and the general environment are properly consulted as a matter of course on those issues, as well as NGOs and stakeholders who have a real stake in decisions that might be made that impact on the maritime area.  It is reasonable that it should be set out who they are and the minimum requirements to consult with them.</p><p>It is not clear to me who exactly the Minister has to consult with in terms of the granting of MACs, which is what they are called now.  I will understand more as we go through the Bill, but as far as I understand it, the suggestion is that a MAC does not attract environmental and public participation obligations.  I do not accept that for a moment.  It does and should.  The problem we have is that developers have essentially selected their own sites, grabbed them and it becomes a <i>fait accompli </i>.  Somewhere further along the line we apparently rubber-stamp them, having vetted them, but it is all too late in reality.  We want to see all of those gaps plugged to guarantee that we do planning in a proper, sustainable manner in line with EU directives on spatial marine planning and get things in the right order.  This is part of that campaign.</p></speech>

While acknowledging the positive intentions of this proposal, it cannot be accepted.  Bodies may be prescribed under this Act for different purposes and not all of the listed bodies may need to be consulted for every single purpose.  For example, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Heritage Council are unlikely to be consulted regarding a development proposal 100 km offshore.  In addition, specifying bodies in primary legislation creates practical difficulties, as further primary legislation would be required to amend where titles or functions of bodies change over time.  As is normal practice, the prescription of bodies will be done through secondary legislation.  I can assure the Deputies of that.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, the advisory group I have chaired represents the entire maritime community.  Unfortunately, through Covid, we did not physically get to meet, but in the online meetings it was incredible to see the number of individuals and bodies present and taking an interest in the process.  One point we have learned in recent years as legislators is that the wider the consultation, involving more communities and interest groups, the better the legislation we will get.  I am certain that we are doing that in the current process.</p></speech>

I mean that respectfully.  Part of the purpose of tabling the amendments is to give us the opportunity to raise issues.  Where appropriate, it is important to see the organisations that are listed here in the regulations.  It may be the view of the Minister or his officials that an organisation may not want to be consulted on a particular aspect of the outworking of this legislation, but if it is not listed as a prescribed organisation in the necessary statutory instrument, it will not get the opportunity.  I ask the Minister of State to be as generous as possible to ensure as many organisations as possible are listed because, in particular in the early stages, the greater the level of participation, the better everyone will be.  We will pay close attention to the statutory instruments when they come out, but it would be very positive, and it would signal the Government's intent to ensure those organisations that are statutorily tasked with the variety of functions that are listed here will be given a central role as prescribed bodies to the maximum extent possible.  On that basis, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

They often decide an issue is not relevant to them and they skip over it, or sometimes they decide that it is relevant.  It is a very safe system in that sense, in that none of the prescribed bodies that may have a view misses out on the opportunity to give it.  Prescribed bodies are given lots of opportunities, but they only have so many resources and they must prioritise when something arises.  I would caution against assuming that a body should have no role or say.  It works better if the organisations make the decision in terms of their own priorities and resources as to whether they have an interest or not.  I accept that the further out we go, the less relevant it will be to some of the bodies whose main interests are closer to shore, but I would be cautious about taking too fixed a position.</p></speech>

As people know, FOI requests relate to documents, whereas access to information on the environment, AIE, requests have a wider application, not just to documents but also to information.  It is a much more robust mechanism for trying to access information and bring it into the public domain.  It could be due to a misreading of the section, but my concern with the text that I am seeking to amend is that because it talks about records, it could be interpreted at a later stage to be an attempt to restrict access to information requests on the environment to records and not the wider category of information.  That is the reason I have tabled the amendment outlined.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 15 relates to the potential content of such records and is inappropriate to include in this definition.  The legal effect and efficacy of "...shall not be confused with information held..." is also far from clear.  Sections 100 and 123 provide extensively for the management of records for MACs and licences, respectively.  I will be opposing this amendment.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is because I did not make it clearly enough.  A record is a physical document, so when I put in an FOI request, I ask for a copy of a letter sent from politician X to Minister Y.  Information is a much wider category, in the sense that it does not have to be in a formal record or document, it can be spread among a variety of different sources.  Very often, those of us who started putting in FOI requests at an early stage were looking for information, not records, but because of the way in which we framed those requests we were denied access to the information.</p><p>I urge the Minister to reconsider because my worry is that by not broadening the text of this section of the Bill to include that wider category of information, it could have the unintended consequence of restricting access to information that should otherwise be accessible under an access to information on the environment, AIE, request that would not, for example, be accessible under a freedom of information request because it would be restricted to records rather than the wider category of information.</p></speech>

While there is some provision for public consultation, it is not clear from the provisions of this section what the length of time, depth or scale of that consultation will be.  I have had concerns in this area about the absence of consultation with prescribed bodies.  </p><p>I am not looking for the Minister of State to support this amendment, because I know that will not be the advice from his officials, but I am asking what reassurance he can give us, both in terms of the intention of the Government but also the subsequent regulations, to ensure we can have the most appropriate period of time for public consultation in respect of this as well as the direct involvement of key stakeholders.  This amendment refers to &quot;fishing representative bodies and coastal community groups&quot;.

I am repeating to a degree something I alluded to earlier.  I was talking to fishermen in D&uacute;n Laoghaire yesterday.  The perception is, to use the colloquial language of the fishermen, that &quot;this Bill is going to screw us&quot;.  That is essentially what they perceive.  The Minister of State may say that is not the case but that is what they believe.  They believe the selection by developers of sites such as the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank, which are their fishing grounds and are spawning grounds for fish, makes the development of large-scale wind infrastructure on a very sensitive site a <i>fait accompli</i>.</p><p>The perception is that the Government wants to find the legislative means to facilitate that, rather than take on board their concerns.  Their concerns about how planned developments on the Kish Bank will take place have not been taken on board.  Similar views are held by groups like Save our Seafront and the Coastal Concern Alliance.  There is a group in Waterford that has similar concerns about the impact of development that close to shore and on particular sites.  There has not been a consideration of all the potential impacts on everything from heritage to fishing to the tourism amenity to the biosphere in Dublin Bay.  We could go through a list of things that are potentially impacted by something of that close proximity.</p><p> I would be interested to hear the Minister of State respond to those concerns.  The groups have a definite view.  I largely share their view.  They feel they have been excluded and that all of this has essentially been rammed in over their heads.  They feel that they will have little say and will be on the back foot, which they believe they already are.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State respond to those concerns.  </p></speech>

While noting the positive intention of the proposal, it is not necessary to itemise any particular category of the public, as well as all captured the broad term &ldquo;members of the public&rdquo; in subsection 4(b).  While fishing representative bodies and coastal community groups are commonly understood terms, neither is defined for the purposes of this Bill.  Throughout the four-year consultation period on the National Marine Planning Framework, we were always mindful of respecting equally all members of the maritime community.  That is right and proper.  We must be careful in this legislation not to state that one category of the public is more important than another.  This would only lead to exclusion.  In public consultations such as this, the procedure must be neutral.  There must be equality of opportunity for all to contribute and to be heard.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 39 proposes additional considerations in the development of the statement that appeared to fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of the statement as a high-level expression of Government policy.  This amendment requires a level of detailed consideration more appropriate to a marine spatial plan itself or, indeed, project-level assessment.  It also suffers from the same imbalance as present in earlier proposed amendments.</p> <p>  The statement will, in line with existing obligations and practices, have regard to the regulatory framework, including the birds and habitats directive, which to note, are two separate instruments and not a single directive, as referenced.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 44 proposes to extend the appropriate assessment requirements of section 31 to this statement.  The public consultation procedure set out in proposed amendments Nos. 31, 36, 37 and 46 will ensure that any submissions from any interested parties or groups will be considered.  As before, the amendment proposed here places certain groups, which have not yet been defined, above all others in terms of submissions or observations.  This is highly inequitable.  I will not be supporting this amendment.</p></speech>

I accept the premise of his critique of the amendment.  In response, while he is right as a general rule, in many aspects of planning and, indeed, in some aspects of licensing, prescribed organisations are given the preferential treatment of being statutorily included in the process whereby they are notified of the opportunity to engage in a way that a general member of the public would be.  Is it the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention, for example, on the passing of this Bill, to have any list of prescribed organisations for this section, by way of statutory instrument, for example?  Is that one way of dealing with the concerns?</p> <p>  Can the Minister of State give us some indication, because again I am not clear from this section, of the length of time of the public consultation period?  I ask because I am more than happy to withdraw this list of amendments, subject to the Minister of State&rsquo;s responses.</p></speech>

I live in a coastal community.  I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s logic in saying that every member of the public has to have access to public consultation and that nobody should be disadvantaged in that regard.  However, we should be clear that people engage in fishing and their representatives have played, and will need to play, an important role in their custodianship and guardianship of our marine biodiversity and marine environments.  They are not just another group of people.  These people have spent their lives on the seas, risking their lives.  Some of them have lost their lives.  They have a special knowledge and relationship.  It would be entirely appropriate for them to be involved in public consultation in particular way and given particular status to recognise their involvement, livelihood and connection.  Often, this connection goes back generations.  It is in the families and in their DNA.  We should be cognisant of that when discussing the fishing community, the important role it plays and the role it needs to play in protecting our marine environment.</p></speech>

Four weeks is a short period of time.  We are not dealing with a standard planning application.  We are dealing with things that can often be complex, both from a technical and scientific point of view.  Many of us would have met with, for example, the National Inshore Fishermen's Association.  The Minister of State is right that it was contacted and invited to a number of the consultations and participated in them.  Its members told us, and I am sure they have conveyed the same to the Minister of State and his officials, they feel that their capacity is small, because it is a small organisation comprising fishermen.  Their capacity to engage is more diminished than larger corporate organisations or various other bodies.  Four weeks is therefore a short period of time for those organisations.  They themselves have told us that they do not have the capacity or the technical expertise needed.</p> <p>  One could argue that they are members of larger organisations that represent wider sections of the fishing industry.  While that is true, the Minister of State knows as well as I do that there are disagreements, tensions, and divergences of interests.  Again, the National Inshore Fishermen's Association has stressed to us that it needs to be given the maximum opportunity to engage in this process.</p> <p>  I would ask the Minister of State to actively consider, between now and Report Stage, whether the length of time that has been provided for in section 5(5)(b)(iii) is sufficient.  In addition, how does one ensure that those smaller organisations or communities are not just given a notional right to participate, but that their participation is genuine and meaningful, given their own self-declared limited technical and scientific resources?</p></speech>

My big concern is that the marine environment is an enormous area that some people stand to potentially make a lot of money out of.  Let us call a spade a spade.  There were some disastrous mistakes made on land with planning and development, where money had a disproportionate, sometimes corrupt, influence on planning and development on land.</p><p>There were many dire consequences of that.  It contributed to arguably the greatest economic crash the country has ever seen, as well as the disastrous austerity that followed and the housing crisis we face today.  We could go through the disastrous consequences of letting money dictate what went on, in planning and development terms, in respect of land.  The potential for that to be replicated at sea is significant.  The vested interests are lining up and are so far ahead of the public in their working to further their interests in order to make money from the marine environment.  As a result, we have to tip the scales greatly in favour of the general public and stakeholders that do not have the resources large corporations and big industry have to pursue their own commercial interests.</p><p> When we talk about coastal development, the people who have a guardianship role are, self-evidently, the coastal communities that immediately adjoin the area in question.  I do not suggest that other people who do not immediately adjoin a particular development do not have a right - they absolutely do - but the coastal communities have a special guardianship role and that is important.  It is not just that they have the right to do it; in fact, I want them to do it because I do not trust what certain interests, left to their own devices, might do without the oversight of communities that are directly affected, understand what a coastal zone and so on are and can spot what others who might not live nearby would not see.  They have an especially important role in that regard.  Similarly, the fishers have been there for a long time and know the marine environment.  They know which marine species are operating there and the geography of the area.  Moreover, they make their livelihoods from it and should have the right to continue to do so and not be impacted by other people who just want to make money from the marine environment.</p><p> It is entirely justified, therefore, to guarantee that certain people who clearly have a stake and a role in ensuring the proper and sustainable planning and development of the marine environment will have that role, notwithstanding the need to give everybody the right to have input into decisions about the marine environment.</p></speech>

I have the utmost regard for our fishing families and communities.  As was stated, many of them have existed for several generations and many have paid the ultimate price in the course of their work.  In the context of anything I say that may be technical as I respond to each of the points, I underline that I appreciate the great work they do and the price some pay.  We want to support them in any way we can.</p> <p>  I think there may have been a misunderstanding.  We are talking about nearshore designates, that is, local authority designates.  We are not talking about planning permission or consent.  Whether with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, if it requires an environmental impact assessment or with the local authority, planning permission or consent requires a consultation of either five or eight weeks.  As I said, the consultation will take four weeks in respect of the nearshore designate.  This is not about zoning; it is about which local authority has jurisdiction for a particular area and the consultation regarding the termination of that.</p></speech>

I think he is saying that because this is just a technical drawing of boundaries to determine which local authority is responsible for each area, there will be a shorter consultation period.  Has there been discussion or consideration of whether there could end up being disputes, not necessarily between local authorities but between third parties, as to where that boundary would be drawn or is the working assumption that this will be simple and straightforward?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 32 will provide for those statements to require approval by the Oireachtas.  Marine planning policy statements are a significant part of the overall architecture.  I am concerned about the role of the Oireachtas in that, as the Bill stands, the statements will simply be required to be laid before the Oireachtas.</p><p>So apart from being laid before it, the Oireachtas will not have a role in this.  It is effectively for the Minister to do.  I have a lot of concerns about that in terms of the democratic process given that these are significant and have an impact on the architecture of the legislation, how this process works and how the marine policy is set down.  I am also concerned about how that could lead to judicial action relating to the Bill and the role of the Oireachtas, particularly in respect of Article 15(2) of the Constitution and other case law around that.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's view on that.</p><p> I have concerns about the level of ministerial discretion on marine planning policy statements and the lack of Oireachtas oversight.  I have concerns about the lack of public participation in terms of the Minister's actions.  I also have concerns about when the policy statements come into effect and about significant deficits in terms of environmental assessment requirements on the marine planning policy statements.  Could the Minister of State elaborate on the process for environmental assessment when drawing up these statements?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#L00200"><p>Before I deal with the amendments, I think it would be really useful if before the Minister of State responds to our questions about the amendments, he gives the committee a plain English explanation of what the marine planning policy statement is, its function and role.  I am particularly interested because we have a national marine planning framework and will have marine protected areas, designations and a variety of other plans.  Where does the policy statement fit into that overarching legal and policy architecture.  What is it going to do, what is its added value and, crucially, how does it relate to all of those?</p> <p>  As will become clear as we go through later Stages of the Bill, there is real concern, and I echo Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's remarks.  I presume this is a statement of some significance, particularly given the length of time it is due to run for.  I would not in any way question the Minister's intentions but giving the Minister the power to introduce such a significant statement without adequate public consultation and access to strategic environmental assessments or appropriate assessments, particularly in the absence of an adequate designation of Natura 2000 sites, has implications for any real functional role for the Oireachtas.  There was very extensive consultation when the national planning framework - the terrestrial planning framework - was being done in the previous Oireachtas and Department officials worked very hard.  However, there was no formal role outside of briefings and informal engagements on and off the record.  There was no formal role.  In fact, there was some controversy at the end because despite the fact that the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who introduced the legislation, said that it was always his intention for there to be a vote of the Oireachtas, the subsequent Government and Minister interpreted the legislation differently and said there would be no vote.  That became a large bone of contention.  </p> <p>  Could the Minister of State outline his general thoughts on those?  My arguments regarding the amendments are similar to those of Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  Something of this significance should get Oireachtas approval.  If the Minister of the day is satisfied that he or she has done his or her work properly, he or she should be able to easily get it through an Oireachtas vote.  I also think there should be a mechanism for Oireachtas amendments - I took the same position with the terrestrial planning framework - but also for the revocation of any such policy statement, particularly in the context of a change of Government.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 32 speaks to the issue of a timeframe.  In so many other areas of legislation, particularly in planning, the production of policy statements or guidelines can take far longer than they could or should.  I do not want to mention the war of the rural planning guidelines, which were much delayed both before the Minister of State was in office and are still delayed, but that is just one example of how very complex issues can end up taking far longer than they need to.  This creates planning uncertainty, which is not good for anyone.  </p> <p>  I will fall over backwards if the Minister of State considers accepting Amendment No. 33 because it completely rewrites this section of the Bill.  What I and others are trying to do with this amendment is set out a more comprehensive primary legislative basis for what that policy statement should be but also respecting the primacy of a number of key EU directives also highlighting what happens if at a later stage, there is a conflict between, for example, the revised marine planning framework and the marine spatial planning directive.  Where does that conflict play itself out?  By putting down these baskets of obligations in my amendment involving section 3(a), (b) and (c), I am trying to give clarity to that and detail who should be consulted in all of those.</p> <p>  Likewise, amendment No. 34 is a small amendment but it strengthens the need for compliance with the relevant sections rather than "have regard to".  We all know the difficulties involved in the difference between "comply with" and "have regard to" when it comes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding SDZs, something we are trying to remove from terrestrial planning legislation.  It would be good not to have that same weakness in this Bill.  This group of amendments goes up to amendment No. 38 and also includes amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 45.</p></speech>

I was commenting to one of the officials, who I think agreed with me, that this is complicated.  It is a huge Bill that is extremely complicated.  We are referring to multiple pieces of legislation and there are almost more acronyms than there are letters in the alphabet.  We have MACs, DMAPs, the NMPF, multiple directives and MARA and now we have these policy statements.  What is the acronym for them?  It is MPPS.  As a Deputy, I find this difficult.  If I was a member of the public, I would be baffled as to how this process will operate.  It would be very useful if a idiot's guide with a visual map of how these different elements interact could be produced.  In this case, we have a new acronym, which is the MPPS, which is the Minister making statements of principles.  How exactly do they relate to all the other different moving parts in this?  How do they relate to the national marine planning framework, which will be reviewed from time to time?  How will the national marine planning framework or the reviewed version of that framework be informed?  What will it be informed by?</p><p>To what extent will the statements of objectives and policies that the Minister might make be required to be compliant with the various directives?  How do they relate to the frameworks and reviews?  We need to understand all of this architecture and it needs to be set out in the clearest possible terms.  A visual representation of these parts would be useful for us because we will be at this for weeks.  I know one cannot be produced overnight, but it would be helpful.</p><p> Ministers cannot make any old statement that throws everything in a particular direction just because that is what they like doing, or can they?  Who might be influencing a Minister when he or she is coming out with particular statements in respect of policies and objectives?  One of the amendments deals with the representations the Minister may receive.  We need to know about those if statements are being made.  Critically, we need to know that the governing framework for policy statements dictating how planning and development are done and what type of planning and development is done in our marine environment is informed, constrained and regulated by all of the various directives in terms of marine spatial planning, protection of biodiversity and habitats, and so on.  We need to know that the tail is not wagging the dog in how we undertake marine planning and development.</p><p> That is a brief summary of the logic behind this series of amendments.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's response.  I hope to hear a positive signal from him and his officials about them putting together the kind of map I mentioned to show how these various elements relate to one another, given that it is not entirely clear.  Things are floating around, to use a marine metaphor.</p></speech>

I thank the officials for yesterday's briefing, which I found helpful.  I also found Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions at that briefing helpful.</p> <p>  I wish to address amendment No. 33.  It is a very good amendment.  I am biased, of course, as I submitted it and a number of others, but it would create a considerable amount of structure around marine planning policy statements.  If this amendment was inserted into the Bill now or, if the Minister of State is minded to improve the section and give more structure to it, on Report Stage, I would have much more confidence in this section.  Reading the current section, it does not give much information about marine planning policy statements.  It states that they will be there and they shall have regard to a few matters, but it does not provide a proper structure.  We do not know from the Bill when marine planning policy statements will be revoked and how they can be amended.  That is not clear.  If a new Minister makes a new statement, will that mean that the previous statements are then out of date?  If a Minister does something through a marine policy planning statement that is contrary to the majority wishes of the Oireachtas, will the Oireachtas have any ability to amend or revoke it or make an input into it?  What is the process in that regard?  As legislators, we must think about these questions in light of who the Minister might be.  The current Minister is one who has a keen interest in marine biodiversity, but what happens if there is a Minister who has no interest in the marine environment whatsoever and starts inserting all sorts of stuff into marine policy statements?  Could a Minister, through marine policy statements, create a large amount of damage to the marine environment by opening up avenues for mining activity or sand and gravel extraction, which have major implications for climate change?</p> <p>  I would welcome it if the Minister of State explained exactly where marine planning policy statements fit in with the rest of the Bill's architecture.  Where in the Bill is clarity provided in this regard?  What is the hierarchy?  Why not accept our amendment to ensure that the Minister must act explicitly in accordance with the objectives of the birds directive and Article 2 of the habitats directive?  Why not write that into the Bill in terms of marine planning policy statements just to make those aspects stronger and clearer?  Hearing the Minister of State's response would be useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#M00600"><p>I appreciate that this is a complex matter.  We can break it down further with a mapping process, although that would not take away from the significant complexity of what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  I will address the technical aspects first and then make a few comments.  The marine planning policy framework is a high-level expression of Government policy prepared by the Minister and agreed across the Government by the Cabinet.  This is a ministerial function.</p> <p>  The statement is intended to do the following: describe the existing components of Ireland's marine planning system; outline a vision for the future development of our marine planning system; set out the overarching policies and principles that the Government expects marine planning bodies and other public bodies that engage with the marine planning system to observe, for example, public engagement, transparency, governance, environmental assessment, climate action, and social and economic benefit; and set out high-level priorities for the enhancement of the marine planning system in Ireland.  This grouping of amendments proposes instead to establish a mechanism going far beyond oversight and democratic approval, effectively resulting in an Oireachtas marine planning policy statement, MPPS.  The Oireachtas would be acting, in part, as a quasi-marine planning body.  With all due respect to the various competencies and experience of my Oireachtas colleagues, that is not an appropriate role for a national legislature.</p> <p>  The amendments proposed appear to confuse the marine policy statement with a maritime spatial plan through the inclusion of considerations and matters that can only be properly expressed in a detailed plan.  They are not appropriate for a high-level statement.  Further to this, the amendments proposed contain technical deficiencies that would create inherent impracticalities, legal issues and severe limitations.  The net effect would be to establish procedures that were simply inoperable.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 30 proposes to include an Oireachtas approval of the MPPS.  This is a Cabinet function.  Amendment No. 32 repeats the Oireachtas approval requirement in respect of the first MPPS.  Again, this is a Cabinet function.  Amendment No. 33 revises the considerations for the development of the MPPS.  The proposed subsection (3)(a) would require the Minister to "act consistently with" a number of matters.  "Have regard to" is the standard phrasing used and is well understood by the public, practitioners and the courts.  Such a novel departure would inevitably require interpretation and clarification by the courts, perhaps over multiple cases and years.  We cannot introduce such a risk.</p> <p>  Marine spatial planning is based upon balancing the three pillars of sustainable development: environmental, economic and social.  The proposed subsection (3)(a), while expansive on a single pillar of marine spatial planning, is silent on the other two.   This creates an imbalance and severely limits the scope of the statement to the point of inoperability.</p> <p>  The proposed subsection (3)(b)(ii) is technically deficient.  The use of the word "it" is ambiguous and may be construed as a statement or that this provision is cumulative with the proposed subsection (3)(b)(i), which refers to the NMPF.</p><p>The proposed section 3(b)(iii) appears to require the Minister to have regard to future maritime spatial plans not yet developed.  Section 3(b)(iv) and (v) would require a level of detail appropriate to a detailed maritime spatial plan, not a policy statement.  The proposed section 3(c) explicitly limits consultation to two Ministers and Ministers of State, in stark contrast to the ministerial consultation on the first MPPS that engaged all Ministers, particularly those with maritime functions.  I see no justification for such a limit and am surprised because it goes against the ethos of all our consultation to date.</p><p> Amendment No. 34 proposes to replace "have regard to" with "must comply with" for ministerial considerations in section 6(3).  This phrasing stands in contrast to the Deputies' use of "have regard to" in amendment No. 33.  It is important we remain consistent with the terms we use around planning.  As previously mentioned, the term "have regard to" is used throughout planning and it works.  </p><p> Amendment No. 38 requires the Minister to have regard to interim measures to protect areas of marine environment as agreed by the Government.  I acknowledge the positive intentions of the amendment but it is not currently functional.  "Interim measures" has no legal meaning.  However, as detailed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in the Second Stage debate, we have undertaken to examine the possibility of using designated maritime area plans provisions of this Bill as an interim measure in advance of the MPA legislation.  Should this prove to be operable, there will be no need to refer to them as they are already fall under the definition of the national marine planning framework in section 2.</p><p> Amendment No. 42 proposes to establish Oireachtas engagement and public consultation procedures.  The Oireachtas procedure is unprecedented in scope and places something akin to a planning function on the Oireachtas.  I have proposed consultation procedures under amendments Nos. 31, 36, 37 and 46.  The public and Oireachtas Members and committees will be able to provide input into the development of the MPPS through this procedure.</p><p> Amendment No. 43 sets out further detail in relation to Oireachtas engagement procedure and relies upon section 6(3).  As detailed above, it is legally inoperable and contains multiple deficiencies.  Amendment No. 45 is a technical amendment relating to Oireachtas approval.  I oppose these amendments.</p><p> I support amendments No. 31, 36 and 37.  Ministerial amendment No. 31 is a technical amendment, necessary to facilitate additional provisions of amendment No. 46.  Ministerial amendment No. 36 is a technical amendment necessary to facilitate amendment No. 37.  Ministerial amendment No. 37 requires the Minister to have regard to representations made in public consultation.</p><p> In relation to the high level policy statement, I draw members' attention to page 27 of the Bill, where they will see detailed the requirements and those the planning policy statement has to have regard to.  It is also in terms of consultation, as I referenced in the amendments from No. 46.  Like our current planning policy, this is a high level expression statement at the top overarching our policy and it requires approval by the Cabinet.</p><p> I appreciate how complex this is.  It is the same for me as I try to grapple with all these terms and engagements.  I acknowledge the good faith being displayed by members in putting forward their amendments and I am willing to work with them on as many as I can.  I hope I demonstrated this from the start of the proceedings this afternoon.</p><p> The way I have broken it down for myself is that what we are doing involves three pillars.  There is forward planning, including the policy statement sitting on top, the national marine planning framework underneath it and the guidelines and directions that follow suit from that, as well as DMAPS, akin to local area plans in the current 31 local authority structure.  That will give a reflection of what it is like inland or an alternative snapshot.  The second pillar is development management, which is concerned with consents, giving licence to development and deciding whether it goes through An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authority, depending on where it is located or what environmental assessment is needed.  Enforcement is the last pillar and MARA will take a lead role in that.  Those are three pillars into which we have tried to break it down but I acknowledge it is a sizable and technical Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#N00200"><p>The policy statement comes at the top and that is the Government deciding what it wants to do.  Below that comes the marine planning framework.  Is that not what the Minister of State suggested?  I will consider what he said but my worries start there.  There are certain things that have to constrain our political whims concerning what might happen in the marine environment, namely, the need to meet certain obligations relating to biodiversity and environmental protection directives we are subject to and so on.  They are there to protect the public's right to participate in sustainable planning and development and to protect our environment, habitats, livelihoods and so on.  I am worried about that relationship.  The Minister of State said the Oireachtas cannot become a planning authority but the Minister will become a planning authority.  The Minister of State might like to come back on that point.  He might have concerns about the Oireachtas being a planning authority; I have significant concerns about a Minister being a planning authority.</p> <p>  Our development plans for local authority areas are far from perfect but they allow for fairly intensive public engagement and a democratic process for the designation of particular areas for particular activities.  That is done in an open, transparent and democratic way where elected representatives say houses can be build in such a place but not in another place because it is a protected environment, that a certain amount of land must be allocated for educational facilities, sport and so on, and certain things cannot be done in certain places.  Where are the guarantees that we will have a similarly democratic and transparent regime when it comes to the designation of different parts of the marine environment for different types of activities?  The public deserves an answer to that.  The fears are that we will not and Ministers will be able to dictate, possibly under the influence of lobbyists, that the marine area regulatory authority when established will not be fully transparent and that the issuing of licences, consents and so on will not involve a transparent, open process.  I would like to hear the Minister of State respond to all that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#N00300"><p>I thank the Minister.  I accept the spirit in which he is conducting the debate and I want to do likewise.  I am still not clear on the relationship between the policy statement, the marine planning framework and the marine spatial plans.  I am more confused now than when I first read the legislation.  When the Minister of State comes to respond, I am really interested to know the following.</p><p>If the planning framework is the overarching planning framework for the marine, it has or should have a variety of spatial and temporal detail through its maps and so forth.  I am trying to work out what the policy statement is and how it interacts with that.  Is one guiding the other or is it a summary of the other?  It would be very helpful if the Minister of State could give greater clarity on that.</p><p> The second issue is a question I asked in the first round.  Will the drafting and approval by the Minister and the Cabinet of the policy statement require SEAs or AAs?  That is very important.  I am also unclear about what the full level of consultation is.  The Minister of State said he has outlined some of that in his amendments, but perhaps he can talk through that again in plain English.  What opportunities would the public have?</p><p> With respect to the role of the Oireachtas, I appreciate the Minister of State's view.  These might not be the exact words he used - I am paraphrasing and I apologise if I have got it wrong - but there was a suggestion that this might be too technical and too high level for the collective genius of the Members of the Upper and Lower Houses.  If that is the case, putting it as the responsibility solely of a Minister, albeit with Cabinet approval, creates even bigger problems.  The Minister of State is right that the extent of Oireachtas involvement is unprecedented.  We did that to make a point.  However, the point, which is a very legitimate one, is that the Minister of State has gone too far in the other direction.  There is an appropriate role to be given to the Houses of the Oireachtas and appropriate committees.  The Minister of State should consider that there were real benefits in the engagements on the national planning framework which was processed through the previous D&aacute;il, notwithstanding the fact that there were no votes, which was one of its weaknesses.  There was a level of engagement with that.  I know that is more akin to the marine planning framework, but I still believe there is some value in that.</p><p> I have a few more responses to the Minister of State's criticisms of our amendments, some of them justifiable.  Of course, there will always be technical deficiencies in Opposition amendments.  We would be delighted if the Minister of State would second some of his hard-working and expert staff to us at the time for drafting amendments.  It would enormously improve the quality of the amendments.  However, technical deficiencies can always be dealt with and cleaned up.  What is important is the intention of the amendments.  I do not accept the Minister of State's contention that "shall have regard to" is the standard in planning legislation.  In fact, local authorities must comply with the county development plans.  There is a clear difference between the onerous obligation placed on a planning authority with respect to a planning decision based on a county development plan and when a similar decision is appealed to the board and the board has to "have regard to".  They are fundamentally different propositions.  If "have regard to" is the Government's preference, that is its preference, but the reason we are suggesting having a hierarchy of "comply with" and "have regard to", particularly in the longer amendment which is better worded, is to cater for what happens if there is a conflict between, for example, the appropriate directive and the marine planning framework.  If there happens to be a conflict, which gets precedence?  The Minister is going to have to make a call as to which he or she must comply with as opposed to have regard to.</p><p> There is a genuine concern and we see it with the substitute consent debate.  I do not wish to conflate the two, but where there are conflicts between domestic legislation and EU legislation, particularly on issues of environmental protection, inadequately addressing how to process those through the system at the legislative stage can lead to all sorts of difficulties, including the very substantial fines that this Government is paying and the previous Government had to pay in respect of substitute consent related matters.</p><p> I forgot to raise something on the interim measures in the first round.  First, what the Minister of State said sounds very positive.  This amendment is deficiently drafted but the reason it is there is that, as the Minister of State knows, the third recommendation of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report was that: "The Government implement interim measures to protect areas of the marine environment given the disparity between the introduction of the proposed legislation and the absence of legislation regulating maritime protected areas".  I am more than happy to withdraw that amendment, but perhaps the Minister of State could give us a little more information, if he has it, on the discussions about those interim measures.  The committee was strongly of the view that such interim measures would be very important.</p><p> I want to ensure, Chairman, that I do not miss any of the points.  The Minister of State is consulting his officials.  His job is more difficult than ours.  We just have to ask the questions while he has to know what the answers are.</p><p> With regard to the more limited list of Ministers, it was not my intention to exclude any of the Minister of State's colleagues.  I would be happy to amend that on Report Stage and include the entire Cabinet in it, but the Minister of State can see the point we are trying to make.  How do we involve the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas committees and all the relevant Ministers?  Notwithstanding the technical deficiencies and accidental exclusions of the Minister of State's colleagues, I still believe there is merit in the Minister of State rethinking the role that he is not giving to the Oireachtas.  Perhaps some compromise might be forthcoming from the Government between now and Report Stage.</p><p> I am sure I have forgotten something but I will come back to it.</p></speech>

For example, the new section 3(3) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill does it.  I commend the Government for doing that in that Bill and recommend that it follows that good practice in this Bill.  It has set a good precedent.  It is very important, for the reasons that Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined.  There can be conflicts, so setting out clearly which come first and a hierarchy for them absolutely makes sense.  That would be a big improvement in the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 43 are key amendments.  There is no issue if they have to be cleaned up to make them technically more compliant.  Bear in mind that we had quite short notice of the deadline for submitting amendments, so I would be happy to work with the Minister of State if they have to be updated or cleaned up.  It is the principle of the amendments that we are trying to get across.  I believe they would strengthen the Bill considerably, so I ask for that to be considered.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the marine planning policy statement feeding into the national marine planning framework and the marine spatial plan.  Where does the Bill refer to how that feeds in or how they connect or what the relationship is?  Is that explicitly set out in the Bill and where is it?  If so, does that need strengthening?  Perhaps, Chairman, the Minister of State will answer that question and I will then continue.  What he says will relate to the rest of my questions.</p></speech>

It is all set out there.  It is not something made like in the wild west on the back of an envelope.  It must comply with all those aspects.</p> <p>  Second, as regards its role, I would use the words "a shared vision", in terms of breathing life into the national marine planning framework, and to have a new plan-led system as opposed to it being developer-led.  That is what we have with the national planning framework.  There is the overarching, high-level statement and a shared vision from the national planning framework right down to the local area plans, the county development plans and the regional plans, with the spatial plans above that.</p><p>It is a shared vision and that is what a Cabinet should and would be trying to establish when it is doing its high-level statement, namely, having regard to all that other stuff.  Section 6(1) sets out how the Government interacts with it through this Bill, so again, it is a high-level statement.  It is up to the Government to set out a high-level statement and then it is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to hold it to account for that statement and other legislation it enacts.</p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett was talking about DMAPS, jurisdiction and that aspect.  That is another section.  In two days, we will be going on to the DMAPS and local area plan aspects, as well as who has jurisdiction over it.  Whether or not it is in the local authority functional area it is about it being fully compliant with public participation at every single corner of it.  That is most important, just as terrestrial planning laws when a county development plan is being done and put forward in terms of zoning, and various different local area plans attached to it.</p><p> In relation to a question, I think from Deputy &Oacute; Broin, they are indeed subject to SEA and appropriative assessment.  That is definite.  There is no issue regarding that.  I think the minimum is 30 days.</p></speech>

In order to have the maximum level of public confidence a public debate on the floor of the Houses, much as it might be painful for the officials to have to listen to six, nine or 12 hours of us droning on again, followed by a formal vote, is a helpful thing.  It may be that people agree or disagree but it gives is a legitimacy a Cabinet decision - no disrespect to any Cabinet or Government - does not necessarily have, so that would be a very positive development if the Minister of State was committing to that today.</p></speech>

That should be much clearer and the Government could do something on that on Report Stage to give a bit of clarity.  The Minister of State has articulated a good bit of that here.  It would be better if it were in black and white in the Bill so there is absolute clarity on that.  That then gives an idea of where that can begin and finish with the policy statements.  I still have the concern I articulated earlier that the Minister could go in all sorts of directions with those policy statements.  It is helpful that it would then be subject to a vote in the Houses because that gives a level of scrutiny.  However, I have the concern a particular Minister, perhaps lobbied in a particular area where there are particular interests, could be going down routes that are very bad for the marine environment.  Much of the substance of our amendments Nos. 33 and 43 would really give a framework the policy statements would have to comply with, which would be really beneficial.</p></speech>

It is self-evident that the amendment seeks to address concerns about lobbying.  We know that lobbyists operate for certain corporate and commercial interests operating or seeking to operate in the maritime area.  We want full transparency and visibility for lobbying that takes place around policy matters pertaining to the planning and development of the maritime area.  It is reasonable to make such a request so we know who seeks to influence policy decisions made by the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-19a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021101900002#Q02300"><p>The adoption of amendment No. 40 would make everybody's life in the Department much easier.  There is nothing wrong with lobbying, which is carried out by lots of different organisations, commercial organisations, NGOs, Deputies and Cabinet colleagues, etc.  I will show why amendment No. 40 would make everybody's life easier.  As the Minister of State will remember, we had discussions on the floor of the Oireachtas with respect to the recent amendments to Part V and he rightly pointed out that all of the public consultation submissions to the Government's new housing plan were received after the decision to take out Part V.  Now, to the great discomfort of the poor old folks in the freedom of information, FOI, section on housing, we are trying to find out who lobbied in the period between November-December 2020 and June 2021, when the decision was made.  Some of the information is in the lobbying register but not all of it.  It would be much easier if that information was volunteered and made public.  Such a move would make things fully transparent and say who was talked to.  There is no reason not to put that information in the public domain.  The measure would mean that we would not have to waste our time lodging FOI requests, the FOI unit in the Department would no longer receive pestering calls from Deputies Boyd Barrett, Cian O'Callaghan and I on a regular basis, and it would improve transparency.  Therefore, in the interests of transparency, I recommend amendment No. 40 as it stands or some revision of same.</p> <p>  Let me appeal to the better nature of the Minister of State.  Obviously. there are very large commercial interests in the sphere of offshore wind and we are going to need an awful lot of investment to provide the volume of wind that is required.  People will be concerned that some of that investment may not be in the public interest.  I presume, given the position adopted by the Minister of State, that he believes it is in the public interest, with which I have no quarrel at this point.  Therefore, assuaging public concern by publishing the information would be a valuable statement of intent.  </p> <p>  On amendment No. 41, I welcome the fact that it has been said that the policy statement will be subjected to strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment.  I always want to mention appropriate assessment, particularly in the absence of an adequate designation of Natura 2000 sites.  My one concern is that I have not seen anywhere where that is compelled.  The Minister of State may be promoted and elevated to a senior Ministry in another Department and somebody else may be in his position.  Can I hold that person to the same commitment that he has given to this committee?  There could also be a different government, different party, etc.  Would it not be better to make that very explicit in the legislation?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 40 is very practical.  It would give the public a lot of confidence in this process.  Administratively, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, it would make life much easier.  A large amount of this information is available through the lobbying register and by means of freedom of information requests, but much more comes from processes for all involved.  Providing clarity in a very accessible format as to what representations were made, and having this available in respect of this policy, would be very useful.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 41, which would amend section 31, I will wait to see what the actual number is.</p></speech>

The proposal in amendments Nos. 40 and 41 is to make provision for public consultation on the statement.  This matter was raised by Deputies on Second Stage.  I have tabled amendments Nos. 31, 36, 37 and 46 to set out public consultation procedures.  The proposed provisions in amendments Nos. 40 and 41 are, therefore, unnecessary.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 41 contains a proposal regarding a requirement for strategic environment assessments, SEAs, and appropriate assessments, AAs, of the statement, including screenings.  Again, as a result of the Second Stage debate, I have extended the provisions of section 31 to provide for such matters to include the statement in the amendment, the number of which I will confirm in a moment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 44 repeats the requirement for public consultation and is redundant.  The proposed subsection (7) allows for a statement to be amended or revoked.</p> <p>  The intention behind amendment No. 47 is that public bodies shall have regard to the marine planning policy statement.  This has been provided for in amendment No. 46.  I will therefore be opposing amendment No. 47.  I will instead be moving the Government amendment No. 46 that sets out the public consultation procedures in respect of a proposed marine planning policy statement in a new subsection (8).  The proposed subsection (6) also requires public bodies to have regard to the statement in the performance of its functions.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 41, which amends section 31, I can now clarify that it should read "to include the Statement in Amendment 117", rather than amendment No. 118.</p></speech>

On lobbying, I refer the Deputy to the Regulation of Lobbying Act.  That is the aim and the area to change to reflect this Bill.  If people are not happy with how the Regulation of Lobbying Act is performing or doing its duties then we would need to change the Regulation of Lobbying Act.  The legislation we are discussing today is subject to freedom of information also.  It is subject to both of those safety catches.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin already made the point.  This is to save the suspicion that there are untoward things happening and to have information such as that relating to the people who have lobbied, who met with who, what representations were made available up front, and that we list those out as a matter of course in the context of policies or policy statements.</p></speech>

In addition, there is a review of the freedom of information legislation and changes are being made to the Regulation of Lobbying Act.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Minister of State will not support this amendment.  I would make an appeal to the him, however.  I really want to emphasise what it is we are trying to achieve and for the Minister of State to think about it and chat to his officials about it.  When this Bill is passed and we start going through the consents, the licensing and the planning applications, particularly for large offshore wind projects, none of us want this to happen in the context of any public perception that decisions are being made behind closed doors and outside of the formal public consultations.  It would be really helpful for those who want to see the maximum volume of foreshore wind energy to meet a renewable energy targets in an environmentally sustainable way.  I am not at all suggesting that the Minister of State, his officials or any of the planning authorities would do that.  This is about going that extra mile to demonstrate absolute transparency.  Sure, the Minister of State can say that this is really a matter for the Regulation of Lobbying Act but, notwithstanding that, I believe this is an opportunity for him to find a way to ensure that when these policy statements are being developed, we are going to let the public know about anybody who engages with us.</p><p>That means anybody, by the way.  It could be me, it could be Deputy Cian O'Callaghan or it could be the Chairman.  Given the volumes of public and private money that are eventually going to flow through the system, the maximum transparency possible would be very welcome.  On that basis, I would be keen to press this amendment.</p></speech>

The Deputies are talking about agri people who use our maritime area, fishermen, tourists and sportspeople.  If people really want to do that, it has to be specified in the reform of the Regulation of Lobbying Act or the Freedom of Information Act.  That is the appropriate mechanism to do this, not a single piece of primary legislation in the maritime area.  That is my response.</p></speech>

This gets to the crux of how we are going to reach our climate targets because, to do that, we need to work with industry, yet we know that when we work with industry, there are occasions when the public interest needs to be asserted over the interests of industry.  My only fear with doing it in this <i>ad hoc</i>way is that, should there be further changes to the Regulation of Lobbying Act, this would sit as an outlier to that.  I am persuaded by the comments of the Minister of State that, if we believe in greater transparency and believe there needs to be a review, the place to do that is in the legislation which deals with how Ministers are lobbied, rather than inserting <i>ad hoc</i>amendments to different legislation.  For example, this committee recently dealt with the Land Development Agency Bill and I know we will deal with other Bills.  It is my view that the committee would be better seeking to have amendments to the lobbying legislation rather than to do it in an <i>ad hoc</i>way in this Bill.</p></speech>

One is that the information is available if people go looking for it.  They can go looking on the lobbying register, which most people probably do not know how to do, or they can go looking via freedom of information, which is hassle for people.  They can find it and it is possible, but it is hassle.  However, if we make a decision on this critical issue of the development of our marine environment in terms of policy, policy statements, guidelines, consents and anything to do with that, it will be a matter of course that attached to those things will be a detailing of all representations that were made.  It is just there for people.  They do not have to go searching for it and they do not have to wait for some Government Department to come back to them or possibly strike out bits.  It is just there.  There is a difference.  I do not accept the Minister of State's response.  While I accept people can do what he says they can do, this is doing something different.  This is just making it readily and easily available, transparent and visible.</p> <p>  I do not see that it is a very difficult thing to do and, in fact, it is quite an easy thing to do.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, we will all be lobbying on various aspects of these things, so the Deputies who lobbied, the NGOs who lobbied and the corporate or commercial interests that lobbied are there for everybody to see.  That is very reasonable and I do not think it is a major hassle to agree that.</p></speech>

The issue I have with that is that it could be several years until the lobbying legislation is updated.  This is live now in terms of what is going to happen in this area and, if we did make this change to this legislation, it would be very much in the public interest.  It then means that when the lobbying legislation is being updated and reviewed, people could look at what we have done in this Bill and it could help to move it in the right direction.  Public confidence in what happens is very important, especially because, until now, the process around what happens has been developer-led.  I appreciate this is an attempt to put a framework on it so that it is plan-led.  However, putting in these sorts of measures would be a good start in terms of building public confidence and, in an administrative sense, as was said, would reduce the burden.</p></speech>
