    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#A00300"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Catherine Murphy.  We are joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness.  I welcome everyone online to the meeting.  Due to the current situation with Covid-19 only the clerk, the support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  I ask those in attendance to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  I also ask them to use the "raise hand" feature when they wish to contribute and cancel it when they have finished.  As usual, I ask people to keep mobile phones on silent or switched off.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The business before us today is the minutes of previous meetings, accounts and statements, correspondence, the draft work programme and any other business.  The first business is the minutes of meetings of 1 and 3 June, which have been circulated to members.  Does any member wish to raise a matter in relation to the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The next matter is accounts and financial statements.  Four sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 14 and 18 June.  These are now appearing on screen.  They are from Dundalk Institute of Technology, the Private Security Authority, the National Asset Management Agency and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the accounts but our attention is drawn by him to certain matters in the accounts of Dundalk Institute of Technology and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address the accounts and statements before opening the floor to members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#A00400"><p>I want to point out to members that three of the sets of accounts relate to periods of account ending in 2019.  These are the accounts for Dundalk Institute of Technology, the Private Security Authority and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  A number of these are late in being presented.  Following the committee's procedure, it will probably want to follow up and get explanations on these.</p> <p>  With regard to Dundalk Institute of Technology, the code of governance for institutes of technology requires a review by the institute's governing authority of the system of control in the period of account.  This usually has to be carried out at or near the end of the year, and up to three months after the end of the period of account is allowed.  In Dundalk's case this was not carried out until six months after the end of the financial period.</p> <p>  With regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, I draw attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal control of weaknesses in the management and control of a capital project where the budget was &euro;1.2 million for refurbishment of an industrial property but it ended up costing &euro;3.5 million.  The board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has put in place further measures to improve the controls over capital projects as a result.</p> <p>  The accounts of the National Assets Management Agency are for 2020.  The turnover in the year was &euro;274 million and there is a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#A00500"><p>Mr. McCarthy mentioned with regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that the matter he is concerned about relates to an industrial property.  Where was the industrial property?  The estimated cost for refurbishment, if I heard Mr. McCarthy correctly, was &euro;1.2 million but subsequently it cost in the region of &euro;3 million.  Will Mr. McCarthy give us a little bit more detail about this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#A00600"><p>The detail is on pages 3 and 4 of the statement on internal control.  The property is in the Meath Gaeltacht, in R&aacute;th Chairn.  The original budget for the project was &euro;1.2 million but it ended up costing &euro;3.5 million.  The difficulty was that the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was not aware of the escalation of costs so there were obvious control failures there.  The project increased in scope and the board was not aware of it until quite late in the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#A00700"><p>As normal, we will write to Dundalk Institute of Technology regarding the late review of the internal control which, as the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined, should have happened within a three-month period.  I will ask the clerk to write to Dundalk Institute of Technology regarding this.</p><p>Are the accounting statements agreed?  Agreed.  They will be published as part of the minutes.  We have a standing agreement to write to the bodies that are late laying their accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas, in this case Dundalk Institute of Technology, as well as with regard to significant expenditure not compliant with procurement guidelines.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Moving to correspondence, as agreed, correspondence that was not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee on correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the committee's web page.</p><p>The first four items of correspondence have been held over from previous private meetings for consideration in today's public meeting.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>No. 606B is a comprehensive response from Mr. Adam O'Hare, director of finance and procurement, Beaumont Hospital, dated 21 May 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee on non-compliant procurement.  It is an example of the responses we receive to our requests for explanations for instances of significant expenditure not in compliance with procurement guidelines.  Interestingly, Mr. O&rsquo;Hare states:</p> <blockquote> 	... compliance with the public procurement regulations poses a greater challenge to the health sector than to most other public sector organisations.  Historically, the over-arching remit to provide rapid clinical care, coupled with the absence of an effective centralised purchasing model managed by the HSE, have dictated that local purchases were occasionally made, of necessity, without recourse to formal tendering procedures. </blockquote><p>At our meeting of 1 June we decided to note and publish this.  Deputy Carthy flagged the matter for discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00200"><p>We were meant to have the HSE before the committee before the summer break to discuss procurement, but it appears that will not now happen.  In that context, it is worth highlighting that Beaumont appeared to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the HSE, stating that, aside from the remit to provide clinical care, there has historically been an "absence of an effective centralised purchasing model managed by the HSE".  That is a direct quote.  Assuming that the HSE visit will now take place sometime in the autumn, it would be useful if we could clarify with Beaumont whether that absence is indeed historical, whether it has been addressed in full by health business services, HBS, or whether it considers the issue ongoing.  It would be useful also if we could ask the other voluntary hospitals to present a similar submission to get a broader overview ahead of that engagement with the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00300"><p>I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come in on this.  We have addressed this issue of the absence of a centralised procurement model within the HSE a number of times.  It is something that has been promised, and deadlines have been missed or, more correctly, targets to have it in place have been pushed out further and further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00400"><p>Obviously, there has been a systemic problem, and no doubt there are challenges in the health sector in achieving competitive procurement.  The table included at point 5 on page 2 of the submission is interesting in that it compares the five major teaching hospitals in Dublin and one can see that Beaumont Hospital and St. James's Hospital have the highest level of tendering.  They are publishing tenders to the market.  The other three have much lower levels of public competitive tendering.  What is instructive in that is that my office audits the first two, Beaumont and St. James's, and one can see that the pressure we and the committee have been putting on in seeking explanations has had an effect in ensuring there is competitive procurement.  I think Beaumont has made the point that between 2018 and 2019, it significantly increased the level of its expenditure that was competitively procured and compliant with the rules.  That is an indication that, although there are challenges, it can be done.  It is partly a responsibility on the hospitals, but certainly with a centralised procurement function assisting hospitals, much better competitive and compliant procurement can be achieved.</p> <p>  I think a number of years ago, in the lifetime of the previous committee, the HSE reported to the committee about an exercise it was undertaking looking at the compliance by voluntary hospitals, section 38 hospitals, with the code of practice.  One of the sticking points for many of the hospitals was compliance with the procurement rules.  Pressure does need to be kept up to ensure there is proper competitive procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00500"><p>Thank you for that, Mr. McCarthy.  I take it that Beaumont and St. James's are the two  hospitals the Comptroller and Auditor General audits.  The Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital and Tallaght Hospital are voluntary hospitals, as I understand it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00600"><p>That is correct.  They are all what are called section 38 hospitals.  Only five of the section 38 hospitals are within my remit.  It is an historical issue, but I have never been the auditor of the others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00700"><p>While we are looking at Beaumont Hospital, there was a public tendering procedure conducted in 43 cases in Beaumont Hospital in 2020, whereas in Tallaght Hospital, which is quite a large hospital, the figure is only six.  Deputy Carthy, could you restate your proposal?  That we write to-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00800"><p>In the first instance, the committee should get an appraisal from Beaumont Hospital as to whether it thinks these issues have been addressed by HBS.  Second, I understand what the Comptroller and Auditor General says about remit, but I think it would be useful if we were to write to all the other voluntary hospitals asking them for an overview of their procurement policies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B00900"><p>Is that agreed?  Mr. McCarthy signalled to come back in again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B01000"><p>Yes.  Because the HSE has carried out this exercise of reviewing the procurement practice, among other governance issues, it may be a better starting point to ask the HSE for the latest information it has on the procurement compliance of the section 38 hospitals.  That might give the committee a better starting point if it is going to carry out a survey or direct correspondence with the individual hospitals.  It is just a suggestion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B01100"><p>I accept that entirely.  I thank Mr. McCarthy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B01200"><p>We will ask the clerk to issue that correspondence to the HSE and we will take the matter from there.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 621B is from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs, RT&Eacute;, dated 28 May 2021, providing information requested by the committee arising from the Committee of Public Accounts meeting of 27 April 2021.  At our meeting of 15 June we agreed to note and publish this correspondence.  Regarding question No. 6, in which RT&Eacute; was asked to clarify whether it intends to follow the BBC in publishing a register outlining the external events undertaken by its staff in journalism, the response states that this is managed internally and that fees are not published to preserve "confidentiality of contract".  At our meeting of 15 June we decided to note and publish this correspondence.  We also agreed to request RT&Eacute; first of all to clarify whether it intends to bring any degree of transparency to non-RT&Eacute;-related work undertaken by its staff to ensure public confidence in the impartiality of the State broadcaster; second, to notify the committee if and when Revenue determines if further payments are required in respect of the engagement of contractors; third, to notify the committee of the outcome of a related Department of Social Protection audit; and, fourth, to provide further information on legal costs and settlements.  We reiterated our request that RT&Eacute; conduct a comparative review of remuneration for certain roles at RT&Eacute; and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta as well as our request that RT&Eacute; inform the committee how much it has already had to pay to Revenue in respect of the engagement of contractors.  That had to do with people being classified as contractors or self-employed when subsequently, after an investigation, they were deemed to be categorised more as employees.  These matters will arise again when we receive further responses from RT&Eacute;.  Deputy Munster flagged this item.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#B01300"><p>Much of this response arose out of RT&Eacute;'s misclassification of workers as self-employed.  We all know that this practice and the use of freelancers as staff are rife in the media.  Let us call it what it is: it is bogus self-employment.  It does not do RT&Eacute; any credit to drag its heels.  It creates an air of a lack of transparency.  We asked RT&Eacute; some weeks ago to respond to the committee to reveal how much it had paid to Revenue to date.  At the moment, RT&Eacute; is not even dragging its heels; it has not even bothered to respond to us.  It is as if it is hoping to run down the clock before the summer recess.</p><p>What date did we ask for a response?  On what date did we last write to RT&Eacute; about this?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021062200002#C00700"><p>I am glad that RT&Eacute; journalists are better at getting answers than their management is at giving them.  Otherwise, the "Six One News" in the evening would last for about four minutes.  It is unacceptable for a public service broadcaster, which is largely funded through the compulsory contributions of households, to evade benign and understandable questions from this committee.  As Deputy Munster said, it is unthinkable that we now know, after a great deal of toing and froing, that RT&Eacute; made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners, but it has not indicated exactly how much that was.  That is not good enough and I agree with Deputy Munster's proposal that we write to RT&Eacute; again and that we do not let this issue drop until we a get a full engagement.</p> <p>  As regards the proposition that we put to RT&Eacute; with regard to the fact that the BBC is publishing a register that outlines the external events undertaken by its on-air staff, that is a welcome development on the part of the BBC.  It ensures that the integrity of public service broadcasting is maintained into the future.  We asked RT&Eacute; about its plans in this regard and, essentially, it is referring to confidentiality again.  RT&Eacute; loves confidentiality, but confidentiality precludes it from disclosing this.  It made no reference as to whether it will even consider this in the future.  I suggest that in our follow-up correspondence we ask RT&Eacute; whether this will form a basis of future deliberations.  I do not mind a situation where an organisation has examined the potential for increased transparency and, for one reason or another, decides that it cannot be pursued, but in the case of RT&Eacute; it appears that whenever there is even a suggestion of increased transparency and accountability, the natural reaction is simply to say that it cannot or will not be done.  That is not good enough.  In our follow-up correspondence we should ask RT&Eacute; whether it plans to give consideration to this type of mechanism in its future contracts.</p></speech>

Subsequently, we followed it up with further correspondence seeking that, but it has not given the figures.  It is disappointing that it has not, given that it is the public broadcaster.  We are not dealing with a fiefdom here or with a private company that is beyond the reach of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are dealing with the public broadcaster that receives a substantial amount of public funds.  The fact is the figures are not available to us.

Bear in mind that when we first raised this issue with RT&Eacute; when its representatives were before the committee, they denied any knowledge of it on two occasions before at the third attempt by you, Chairman, they then said that they had made a settlement.  On two occasions in the space of half an hour prior to that, they said they were not aware of any bill from the Revenue Commissioners or any settlement with them.  Now, we see that they think they can ignore the committee and our requests for information.  It is up to us to insist that we get the answers in the interests of transparency.  It is not necessarily up to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is up to RT&Eacute; to tell us exactly what was paid and if there are any further bills due.  Personally, I do not believe it is any harm to flag our frustration with this to the Minister.</p></speech>

However, they admit that there were 11 settlements.  That related to personal injury.  Six of the settlements referred to exceeded &euro;20,000.  We will seek to follow this up with the Minister and bring to her attention the frustration of the committee with regard to any settlements there were with the Revenue Commissioners.  Perhaps we will ask the Minister to respond to us with her view of this and of what can be done.  Ultimately, this is a public body and it depends on public funding, so there must be some level of accountability here.  We will proceed with that.</p><p>The next item is No. 629B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health, in response to a request that the Department provide a copy of the report on the progress review of the national paediatric hospital.  The Secretary General states that the analysis remains ongoing.  He continues:</p> <blockquote> 	... elements of this exercise continue to be confidential and will remain commercially sensitive for an extended period, given that there is a live contract in place with the primary contractor which the Development Board is statutorily responsible for.  There is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs or dates, however hypothetical, even from the draft stages of the process, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract and very likely undermine the role of the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor. </blockquote> <p>He continues further:</p> <blockquote> 	... the Department and the Development Board have a responsibility to ensure the successful completion of this project and that any discussion of the details arising out of this process, at this time, would undermine and jeopardise that, and negatively impact any further options available to ensuring the delivery of what will be a world class healthcare facility for generations to come and the best value for public expenditure. </blockquote> <p>At our meeting on 15 June 2021, we agreed to note and publish this item and to accept the Department's offer to meet with it and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board before the summer recess.  Invitations have issued to both bodies for 13 July.  Deputy Munster flagged this for discussion.  Does she wish to contribute?</p></speech>

We delayed our meeting at the turn of the year because this report was not ready.  We pushed it from November out to January and from January out to February.  At the meeting on 9 February, they told us that we would have the report in March but we did not receive it then.  Every month has gone by since.  It seems to be moribund in the Department, which is probably trying to get a handle on this.  Being reasonable, at previous meetings recently, we decided to try to give the Department some space but at our last meeting, the consensus was that we needed some answers on this before the summer recess.  I think I said that if we needed to come back during the summer recess to deal with this matter, we would.  We cannot have a situation where this major capital project is literally cast adrift and we do not have the timelines, do not know where matters stand regarding the hundreds of claims between the contractor and the hospital board and do not have any shape on the final cost.  We need to close regarding how we handle that today.  Deputy Carthy indicated that he would like to speak on this.</p></speech>

The most recent figure I have to hand is &euro;1.7 billion and rising in terms of the development of this hospital so when Mr. Watt says that this is about ensuring the delivery of a world-class healthcare facility, I would say by Christ, I hope so for that type of money.  It is also becoming more evident by the month that the underlying foundations in terms of the contractual basis on which this hospital is being developed are severely damaged and that the measures taken to address those have been insufficient up until this point.  I have to say that anyone who thought the appointment of Mr. Watt as the new Secretary General would have led to a different type of impetus we all agree is warranted will be disappointed by the response.  He has indicated that the Department will return to the committee ahead of the summer recess but caveats it by saying it will be to discuss matters that are not commercially sensitive.  Commercial sensitivity is in place to protect the members of a contractual agreement.  Commercial sensitivity is not protecting the public interest in this regard.  In fact, it is undermining it.  In respect of it being used as a cloak to refuse to answer the questions this committee has or to disclose the details of the report, when we met the board, everything was being based on this report as if it was going to be the panacea when it came to answers.  We need to bring the Department in as quickly as possible.  I support the date of mid-July given by Deputy Munster.  I agree that if required, this committee should reconvene during the recess.  We can give no cover to the Department in this regard.  It needs to be made clear to the Department that we expect it to come in to answer questions relating to how the cost overrun has been so beyond anybody's imagination and what measures are now in place to curtail those overruns.  This committee has heard that we could be looking at &euro;2 billion and rising by the end of the day.  While we all agree that the hospital is a vital piece of public infrastructure, we also need to acknowledge that lots of other really important pieces of infrastructure will not be completed because of the overruns in this instance.</p></speech>

In the correspondence from the committee to the Department, we asked for a copy of the report prior to the meeting on 13 July.  We agreed that at our last meeting.  If that was not possible, we asked for an up-to-date report at that meeting regarding the matters outlined by the Department such as the final cost and a timeframe for completion and an update in terms of where matters stand regarding the hundreds of claims the Department told us about when it appeared before us on 9 February.  I think the number was almost 700.  This is where matters stand.  Is it agreed that we will continue to proceed with 13 July as the date and will continue to look for those answers regarding those matters - preferably with a copy of the full report from the Department because members were reasonable a few weeks back?  Members said we deferred bringing in the Department at that point because of the cyber attack and other matters and to give the Department the space to do it.  However, the requirement of this committee is that it happens before the summer recess.  I take that as being agreed.  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 636 B from Mr. Dave Walsh, chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, dated 3 June 2021, is correspondence providing further information requested by the committee arising from our meeting on 13 May 2021.  At our meeting on 15 June 2021, we agreed to note and publish the item and to request further details regarding judicial review related legal costs incurred by An Bord Plean&aacute;la broken down by costs recovered and incurred irrespective of whether the review processes found in favour of An Bord Plean&aacute;la; a detailed explanation as to why costs are not being awarded against unsuccessful applicants for judicial review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions; details of legal costs relating to cases that have been decided, including who is responsible for costs, and any lessons learned; and a further detailed note on those judicial reviews where An Bord Plean&aacute;la was found not to have given sufficient reasons for its decisions.  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Imelda Munster flagged this.  Deputy Murphy is absent so I invite Deputy Munster to speak on this.</p></speech>

There was only one data centre An Bord Plean&aacute;la did not like and even that was overturned on appeal.  It is clear to all of us that data centres will put a significant strain on the grid in the years ahead but there does not seem to be any national oversight of the impact.  The intervention of the CRU is welcome but it is hardly a strategy.  It is worrying to think of the strain they will put on the grid in the years ahead and the infrastructure not being there.  I suggest we bear this in mind when we are compiling on the hearing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

This is about the lack of infrastructure, the strain this is going to put on the grid and the sheer volume of data centres that we have in this country.  We have to bear this in mind unless other members have suggestions on what else we can do.  The fact that there is no national oversight is worrying because it is only in years to come that we will be landed with this problem.  This should be borne in mind when we are compiling our report on the hearing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I will be happy by all means to hear suggestions from other members.</p></speech>

I am unsure as to what date An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeared before the committee but it was probably a month ago.  It has come to my attention that in asking An Bord Plean&aacute;la officials what they had learned from all of the judicial reviews that had been taken against their decisions, we find that 16 cases that were not been granted permission were never put on public display on An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s website.  That opens it up automatically to a slam dunk with regard to judicial review.  I am disappointed, particularly after the engagement that the committee had with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that it appears that there has not been much learned.  Nothing in its correspondence would indicate to me that the board has learned anything.  All of these actions are preventing houses from being built.</p> <p>  With regard to the listing of the overview of the substantive legal issues in the judicial review cases, the reality is that they are all misinterpretations and unlawful decisions being made.  The courts only deal with unlawful decisions when finding in favour of a judicial review case.  We have to go a little bit further here and am concerned, like Deputy Munster, about what is happening with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am unsure but perhaps the clerk to the committee might inform us if we have written to it in respect of the grants of permission that were not put up for public display and whether we requested an explanation for this.  If we have not, we need to do so.  </p> <p>  Last year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had a legal bill of &euro;8.5 million, which was more than a 50% increase on the previous year.  If it transpires that there will be 16 more judicial reviews than even the board anticipated, we may have a bill of upwards of &euro;12 million.  We do not know where the bill will stop but it is a disgraceful waste of public funds.</p></speech>

We wrote to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and asked for a great deal of information.  We were looking for some insight on why the level of increase in legal fees had happened and on the decisions around those costs.  Reading that document has not greatly illuminated a significant amount for me.  By far the largest proportion of cases, 14 of them, relate to the ignoring or overturning of development plans, which are statutory documents.  I would be very interested to know if the costs that have been awarded against An Bord Plean&aacute;la relate to that larger group where development plans or legal issues concerning material contraventions of such plans are being ignored.  That would be useful to understand what is going wrong here.</p> <p>  I echo the comment by Deputies Murphy and Munster that we have not got to the bottom of this yet and we are going to see an escalation in judicial reviews because communities understand that they are successful and that, in effect, this situation is delaying the quality development of sites because they are getting tangled up in legal issues.  We should write back for further information on how those eight cases where costs were awarded against An Bord Plean&aacute;la relate to those first two categories where there was a material contravention of a development plan or a legal interpretation of the zoning provisions of development plans.  We are at a stage in this country where people are looking at the new set of development plans and it is very important that we understand what is going on there.</p></speech>

Most of these were no-hope cases from An Bord Plean&aacute;la's point of view.

It is a question then of whether we write to the Minister or whatever.  If it is left as it is, given the volume of proposed data centres, the fact is that there was only one such centre with which An Bord Plean&aacute;la had a problem, a decision on which was later overturned on appeal.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not seem to take into account of the impact that these will have down the road.  These data centres take up massive areas.  In my area, one will take up an entire industrial park for just a handful of jobs.  Perhaps we should write to the Minister and ask if a national oversight strategy is being formulated or ask whether the Government has looked at all into the impact of the volume of data centres that will be built.</p></speech>

The issue is outside of the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts, but is valid.  Concern on the issue of the data centres has surfaced at this committee on a number of occasions recently in the context of the potential problems of overheating the grid, the demands on electricity and the effect on our climate change and carbon reduction targets.  It was announced earlier that we did not meet our targets for 2020 even though we were locked down for half the year.  The county I live in was locked down for even longer than that because we had a local lockdown as well.</p><p>I suggest regarding the specific issue that we write to the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department to raise our concerns as to what the strategy is around it and whether there is oversight of it and ask if it is a case of <i>ad hoc</i>development, where there is no general policy in respect of the centres, and that wherever they pop up they go through the planning process with no account being taken of the greater problem that they may cause in electricity demand and effects in our carbon emissions.  Is the Deputy happy with that, which might be more appropriate?</p></speech>

No. 642B from Ms Mary Ellen Ring, Chair of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, dated 10 June 202, is a response to our request for further information in relation to the workload and resourcing of GSOC.  It is clear from the correspondence that GSOC&rsquo;s workload is increasing but there has not been a corresponding increase in personnel.  It has raised this with the committee a few times.  GSOC currently has 40 investigators and is of the view that its staffing &ldquo;is not in line with other Civil Service departments or agencies.&rdquo;  GSOC generally welcomes the general scheme of the proposed policing, security and community safety Bill, which will bring certain matters into the sphere of performance management and no longer will require a formal GSOC investigation but notes that the general scheme will also increase its mandate to over 17,000 personnel.  GSOC believes that insufficient resourcing is not conducive to efficient investigations and will result in a &ldquo;loss of faith in the general public in meaningful garda oversight&rdquo;.  That is cause for concern.</p> <p>  While an examination of the general scheme will be a matter for the Joint Committee on Justice, I have concerns regarding the resources available to GSOC to deliver an efficient service.  I propose that we note and publish this item, request GSOC&rsquo;s consent to forward this correspondence to the Minister for Justice and request a response to the matters raised.  I will open the matter to the floor before seeking agreement on that proposal.  Deputy Matt Carthy has flagged this issue for discussion.  </p></speech>

GSOC outlined the main aspects of the report in its correspondence, which is welcome, but it would be useful for the committee to write to the Department seeking clarification on when GSOC's annual report for 2020 will be published.</p> <p>  Second, on the burden under which GSOC works, it is painting a picture of the commission being under-resourced to handle the volume required.  There is always internal politics between organisations.  We had discussed adding GSOC to the work plan.  Would it be possible to do that, considering it has indicated in its correspondence that it would be happy to have discussions with the committee at any stage?  We could invite GSOC to appear, presumably separately rather than at the hearing that we have scheduled with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would like clarification as to whether we can do that.</p></speech>

There is also a second item of correspondence.  It surprised me that in a force of 14,500, in 2020 a total of 572 criminal investigations were opened.  That is an increase from 485 in 2019.  In 2020, there were 150 disciplinary cases opened, which is also a slight increase from 148 in 2019.  Those seem very high figures related to the size of the force, which is similar to the size of a regional constabulary in Britain, with the Manchester policing service or similar bodies being comparable to it.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about inviting GSOC.  My opinion is that it is open to us to bring it in but Mr. McCarthy might be able to outline the possibilities better.</p></speech>

I do not have detail of where we are with the 2020 audit but I can find that and come back to the secretariat with it.  That might be helpful in relation to the timing.</p></speech>

If it is any time soon then I suggest that we include GSOC on the committee's work plan shortly after that.</p></speech>

That is a very substantial number.  We will await the clarification from Mr. McCarthy on the 2020 audit and make a decision on it then.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 644B is from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, dated 11 June 2021 providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting of 20 April 2021 with the Department.  We considered the substantive response, No. 592B, at our meeting of 25 May. </p> <p>  The item of correspondence before us today provides a correction in respect of the previous correspondence.  In relation to the Land Development Agency, LDA, the original correspondence indicated that the Department did not offer non-agricultural lands to the LDA but this item sets out significant engagement with the LDA in relation to property vested in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, including former Land Commission Lands.  The list has been provided to the committee.</p> <p>  The correspondence also addresses the administrative inquiry conducted by the EU Commission into Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to apply the rules of the Common Agricultural Policy, the findings of which were communicated to Ireland last December.  The Commission deemed the Irish control and sanctioning system unsatisfactory and required that Ireland implement a number of remedial measures.  The proposed action is note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>Deputy Carthy has flagged the matter for discussion.  Does he wish to speak on it?</p></speech>

At our meeting of 18 May we had agreed to make inquiries in relation to expenditure on Galway 2020, and we await responses from the Department and both local authorities in Galway, namely, Galway City Council and Galway County Council.

I was going to say it would have been well over a month ago.  The handling of Galway 2020 seems to have caused quite a degree of concern across various quarters and stakeholders.  It is my understanding we saw a budget of some &euro;25 million of taxpayers' money spent and many people in Galway are asking what they received in return.  In the meantime, the project seems to have been run through a vehicle that seems to inhibit transparency or deny freedom of information requests despite the fact the project was entirely taxpayer funded.  It is my understanding the promised private investment never arrived.  Can I ask the secretariat what is the position regarding responses?  That correspondence was issued on 14 June.  Would the Comptroller and Auditor General be able to comment further on what he has seen of it to date?  Some &euro;25 million worth of public money has been spent and nobody seems to have got answers.  People said they saw nothing other than a few branded coffee cups to show for it at the time.  Has the Comptroller and Auditor General any further comment to make on it?</p></speech>

Regarding the resignation of senior staff, according to the correspondence, the artistic director, chairperson and the chief executive resigned.  It goes on to raise serious issues regarding public expenditure in the region of &euro;26 million, a 3% levy on commercial rates in Galway to pay for it over a three-year period and an allocation of &euro;15 million from the Department.</p></speech>

We would expect correspondence next week on that.  We will monitor it.  The Deputy is right to be concerned given the fact, according to this and previous correspondence, Galway County Council provided &euro;6 million and there was a 3% levy on the commercial rates.  We do not have an answer to it.  The issue is there does not appear to be any product or anything to show for it and the resignation of senior personnel over a period of time would indicate there are serious issues.

There was a non-sitting week and we are a week behind in issuing correspondence due to a shortage of staff.  There is a reduction in staff now, which is a matter for the secretariat to address.  That has caused some delay.  The correspondence was issued as early as possible.   I would point out those two facts.  A week is a week.  Let us await the outcome.  It is a matter we need to follow up and get a handle on.  It is clear there are major issues involved.  Substantial money has been spent and the fact we do not have anything to show for it, at least not that I am aware of unless somebody can correct me, is of major concern.  Some &euro;170,000 was spent on travel, substantial money was spent on wages and I understand &euro;1.1 million was spent on promotion.  We will see what happens with the response and we will come back to the issue.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 648C from an individual dated 14 June 2021 concerning the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The individual engaged with the previous Committee of Public Accounts and assisted in an examination of matters related to the OPW.  The individual acknowledges the work of the committee in exposing issues at the OPW but states "the urgent need now is to redirect government and policy committees to commence a meaningful debate and recommendations to government in how public property is managed from an organisational perspective&rdquo;.  The individual understands this committee does not have a policy remit but it is open to the committee to bring this correspondence to the attention of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach, which has a policy oversight.  We did a fairly substantial report on the OPW and members will recall we made recommendations in it.  Deputy Munster flagged this issue.  If other members wish to come in on it, they can feel free to do so.  I do not know if Deputy MacSharry has joined us.  He may wish to come in on this.  </p></speech>

As he sees it nothing has been done off the back of concerns he had raised with the OPW and the procedures costing the taxpayers money.  I suggest we could share his frustration.  He initially raised concerns going back to 2014 and given we have been waiting the best part of a year for the OPW to arrange a call with the landlord of the Miesian Plaza, we can understand his frustration.  Would it be possible for the secretariat to write to the OPW on this and to inquire what progress it has made in seeking a meeting with the landlord?  It said Covid was the reason on the last occasion but every country in the world is having meetings on line.  That was just an attempt to delay or detract.  I ask that we write to OPW asking what progress it has made in seeking that meeting with the landlord and if we could receive a response before the summer recess.  This has been going on a little long now.</p></speech>

A reply from the OPW has just come in and it will be on the list for next week.  The Deputy might wait until next week to have sight of that reply first.  Unfortunately, we do not have it here this morning.  It has just arrived.  The Deputy will recall our report contained five recommendations regarding the OPW, some of which cover the items she mentioned.  Regarding the forecasted lost of &euro;10 million, the committee set out a clear recommendation under recommendation 1 of its report.  The recommendation states:</p> <blockquote> 	The Committee recommends that the Office of Public Works  takes all necessary steps to prevent the forecasted lost of approximately &euro;10 million and that the OPW ensures that it has appropriate qualified staff to manage its property transactions on behalf of the State.  The Committee also requests that it is provided with quarterly updates in relation to this matter.   </blockquote> <p>The Deputy will recall in terms of the OPW's meeting with the landlord, much of it depends on, hopefully, some goodwill from the landlord regarding the wrong calculations in the size of the building.</p><p>This is simply to bring that recommendation to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General and committee members.  We have correspondence on this and can revisit it next week.<br/><br/>No. 652 is from Deputy John McGuinness, Cathaoirleach of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, dated 15 June.  The committee Cathaoirleach, Deputy McGuinness, is seeking cross-committee support for the following motion, which concerns the establishment of a future of banking forum:</p><blockquote>	The Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach calls for the establishment of a Future of Banking Forum to assess the current state of the Irish banking sector, North and South, the challenges it faces, and policy options that are available to secure its future in a manner that serves the interests of consumers, financial stability and fair competition, including the development of a public banking system to help meet the needs of society.  This forum should include, but not be limited to, the Departments of Finance, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Financial Services Union, business organisations, farming organisations, trade unions, and other relevant stakeholders.  This Committee calls for this forum to be established and convene before the end of 2021. </blockquote><p>The question is whether this committee wishes to lend its support for the motion.  I will open this to the floor for further consideration.</p></speech>

We have, by consensus, agreed to support it at the budgetary oversight committee.  The past year has been very difficult for banking in the State.  We have seen KBC and Ulster Bank retreat from the Irish market.  In the past we have looked at public banking in the State, when we had a much more active pillar bank sector.  Considering the issue of financial inclusion in this country, considering the impact on SMEs of Covid and Brexit, and how important it is for them to have access to credit, it is very important that we would really take a long, hard look at our banking sector.  This would be a very useful thing to do.</p></speech>

My own view is certainly in favour of supporting the motion.  It is very important that there be a banking forum and that it is time-limited in order that it does not sit indefinitely pondering over what should happen.  This autumn, Bank of Ireland will close more bank branches.  People might say that we can do everything online, but anyone in business will tell you, as indeed will the elderly or those who are not computer literate, that IT is not always an option.  Not all business can be transacted or done online.  The town of Mountrath in County Laois will be left completely without a bank.  The town of Durrow will be left without a bank also.  Six bank branches are to close in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  This leaves people with one option with regard to branch networks.  It is of huge concern.  On the general concept of examining what is happening, the Deputies are correct that the exit of those banks from the sector leave us with absolute dependence on two pillar banks and with little choice.</p> <p>  Also worthwhile in the motion is the proposal to look again at the issue of a public banking sector.  From replies I have received to parliamentary questions I am aware that it has been ruled out by the Minister.  If one considers countries where public banking systems operate, such as Germany, we see they can operate very successfully.  There is no reason it should not operate on this little island of ours.  If it is agreed by the committee, perhaps the two Deputies who spoke in support of this motion will be the proposer and seconder.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p> <p>  This concludes our consideration of correspondence.</p> <p>  Our next item is this committee's work programme.  On Thursday we will engage with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Matters for examination include from the 2019 Appropriation Accounts, Vote 27 - International Co-operation and Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade; and from the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019, Chapter 8 &ndash; Controls over humanitarian assistance funding.</p> <p>  If there are any specific areas of interest that members would like to raise with the Department that are not comprehended by the foregoing, please let the clerk know by close of business tomorrow.

We need to do that because there is a list, and some members also have suggestions, on which we need to move in the autumn.  I also bring to members' attention that the annual accounts from the Departments, audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, are normally ready in September.  We will have a busy autumn schedule.  I ask members to have a look at the work programme to see what we need to agree on to bring forward for the autumn period.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  That concludes consideration of our work programme.</p> <p>  I must remind members that we launch our report on last November&rsquo;s engagement with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners at 12.30 p.m. on Thursday next.

The format of the meeting is I will invite Mr. Joyce to make an opening statement, to be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has five minutes for questions and responses.  The witnesses are probably aware that the committee will publish the opening statement on the website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before proceeding, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect of they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised of this issue and they may believe it appropriate to take legal advice on same.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paraic Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to officials from the Department of Education to contribute to the work that the committee is undertaking in the area of anti-bullying and mental health.  Bullying is a complex and difficult issue that can occur in many different settings, including schools.  Bullying, by its nature, transcends boundaries and places.  It can occur in school, our homes, wider family circles, social groups youth clubs and sporting activities.</p> <p>  Schools can play a transformative role in the lives of young people.  The Department's well-being policy statement and framework for practice seeks to promote the mental health and well-being of all children and young people.  It is largely preventative in focus and seeks to reduce the risk factors and promote the protective factors for well-being in the school community.  The provision of a positive school culture where children and young people experience a sense of safety, belonging and connectedness is a key protective factor, as is the opportunity to experience positive and respectful relationships across the entire school community.  These preventative approaches provide an essential environmental context to raising awareness among the entire school community that bullying is unacceptable behaviour, regardless of where it occurs, and is central to a coherent, school-wide approach to tackling bullying.</p> <p>  The anti-bullying procedures for schools were developed in consultation with education partners in response to the National Action Plan on Bullying in 2013.  They are designed to give direction and guidance to school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying by promoting a positive school culture and climate that is welcoming of difference and diversity and based on inclusivity and respect.  By implementing effective preventative strategies and reducing risk factors, the opportunities and instances of bullying can be greatly reduced, thereby impacting positively on mental health.</p> <p>  Under the anti-bullying procedures, every school is required to formally adopt and have in place a published, readily accessible anti-bullying policy.  Schools must set out in their policy the procedures for investigating and dealing with bullying and the school&rsquo;s procedures for the formal noting and recording of bullying behaviour.  Where bullying occurs, the key focus is to resolve issues and work to restore as far as is practicable the relationships of the parties involved.</p> <p>  The anti-bullying procedures contain important oversight measures to strengthen accountability within schools for both preventing and dealing with bullying behaviour.  The school principal must report regularly to the board of management, setting out the overall number of bullying cases and confirmation that all of these cases have been, or are being, dealt with.  Boards of management must also undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation.</p> <p>  An important part of the overarching oversight measures is the range of inspections types carried out by the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate.  Inspection models have been adapted to include more evidence gathering concerning the effectiveness of the school's actions to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  The Department's inspectorate is currently reviewing how it evaluates the implementation by schools of anti-bullying measures with a view to developing further how such evaluation can be carried out in an in-depth and focused way.  This includes carrying out research in this area, involving consultation with parents, students and other stakeholders.</p> <p>  Bullying behaviour can also be influenced in a positive manner through a range of curricular initiatives such as social, personal, health education, SPHE.  The SPHE curriculum includes the resource, Growing Up LGBT, and by participating in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, awareness events, schools can address homophobic and transphobic bullying.  In addition, an annual grant has been provided by the Department to BeLonGTo youth services to support delivery of the Stand Up! campaign to address homophobic and transphobic bullying in schools and the serious impact it can have on the mental health of LGBTI+ students.</p> <p>  At primary level, the Stay Safe programme is a personal safety skills programme that seeks to enhance children&rsquo;s self-protection skills, including their ability to recognise and cope with bullying.  The relationship and sexuality education, RSE, programme at post-primary level provides opportunities to explore and discuss areas such as human sexuality and relationships, which have particular relevance to identity-based bullying.  The wider curriculum provides space and opportunities to foster an attitude of respect for all, to promote the value of diversity, to address prejudice and stereotyping and to highlight the unacceptability of bullying behaviour.</p> <p>  There are extensive training and curricular supports available to schools in this area.  The professional development service for teachers has a dedicated health and well-being team that supports schools and teachers to create a positive school culture.  The continuing professional development support range includes SPHE, child protection, Stay Safe programme workshops and the RSE curriculum.  There is also anti-bullying, personal safety, Internet safety and teacher well-being support.  Individualised bespoke school support in the area of anti-bullying is also available.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, also supports the well-being, as well as the academic, social and emotional development of all children and young people, through the provision of its casework service and a range of teacher professional learning opportunities.  Funding is also provided annually to the National Parents Council for the delivery of anti-bullying training workshops for parents, including cyberbullying.  The Department also provides annual funding to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre, ABC, in Dublin City University towards its research and training programmes.  I am aware that representatives from the centre have already briefed the committee on their activities. <br/><br/>The safe use of the Internet and preventing cyberbullying is of critical importance.<i>Webwise.ie</i>, which is funded by the Department of Education, is an important resource in this area.  However, online safety involves a whole-of-government response.  The 2018 Government's Action Plan for Online Safety involves six Departments working in partnership to deliver on actions impacting on online safety for every user of the Internet.  Of particular note was the establishment in 2018 of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, NACOS, whose role includes providing advice to the Government on online safety issues.  In addition, the online safety and media regulation Bill is currently at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and is expected to be enacted later this year.<br/><br/>The committee will be aware that the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 is currently awaiting an Order for Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The overall aim of this legislation is to foster a more inclusive culture in all schools by improving the level of engagement between the school community and by developing a listening culture in the school which is important in this area.<br/><br/>The Department understands that the committee, following on from its meetings and research in this area intends to publish a report on anti-bullying and mental health.  It is hoped that the Department will be able to assist the committee in its work today.</p></speech>

It is good to see so much happening and the proactive approach that the Department is taking many areas of which we may not have been aware.  I commend the Department on the preventive measures.</p> <p>  There will be a national roll-out of CPD, continuing professional development, training for well-being for every teacher starting this year for three years.  I take it then that every teacher will have the opportunity to avail of that training.  I am glad to see that the two-year pilot programme on restorative justice, about which we heard quite a bit in our past eight sessions, will be rolled out in 2021.  Teachers and principals have told me that it is a good programme and I think it will be a great asset.</p> <p>  It is up to individual boards of management to set mobile phone policies for students.  Has the Department a view on this?  Does it give advice on this?</p> <p>  When will the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 be enacted?  The voice of the student is hugely important.  The collaboration between school, parent and student is essential in terms of tackling bullying in any school situation.  Several witnesses and stakeholders spoke to the committee about a roadmap of supports being needed.  It was clear from various school bodies and patrons that they have different ways of dealing with bullying and preventive measures.  Has the Department got a roadmap of all of the different types of measures that would help schools?</p> <p>  It was interesting to note that the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme was not within the remit of the review to set out what students should learn about in an updated version.  I would have thought that it would have been something.  The witnesses spoke about the public and stakeholder engagement.  When will that be in place because we absolutely need to have an updated RSE curriculum in schools?</p> <p>  There have been numerous calls that emotional and therapeutic supports should be provided in every school.  I agree with that.  Does the Department envisage these being provided in schools?  Apart from what teachers do, they need that access to professional supports.  I accept the Minister sets policy.  Is that something, however, that the Department would support?</p></speech>

In senior cycle, while SPHE is not mandatory, there is a requirement to provide six sessions of RSE each year.</p> <p>  The Senator may be aware of the report on the review of RSE in primary and post-primary schools which was published by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in 2019.  As part of the work arising from this report, a redevelopment and updating of the RSE curriculum is being undertaken within the curriculum development structures in the NCCA.  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and to support guidance material for schools.</p> <p>  Both the primary and post-primary SPHE and RSE development groups have been meeting virtually on a monthly basis since the groups were convened in October of last year.  The immediate focus of the work is to create support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the interim guidance toolkit.  This work is progressing well and sections of the toolkit have already been published.  In tandem, and in preparation for the broader redevelopment and updating of the SPHE curriculum, as recommended by the NCCA in that report, the initial focus on the redevelopment of the junior cycle SPHE curriculum is under way.</p></speech>

We want to provide a sustained level of support.  We want to use a clustering model where schools come together and share best practice.  In that way, they learn from one another.  From autumn, the PDST will be rolling out a programme of support that will be accessible to all schools over the next three years.  It will be a sustained model and clustered arrangement.</p> <p>  In parallel with that, NEPS will be rolling out a national programme to support schools.  I have heard other speakers before the committee talk about therapeutically informed practice in schools.  Through the provision of a series of workshops and webinars for schools, NEPS will support schools in understanding and learning more about therapeutically informed practice.  We will be looking, for example, at the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy and how they can be applied in schools in appropriate and child-friendly ways.  We will also be looking at trauma informed practice and what we call attachment aware schools.  We will be raising the awareness and knowledge of the schools to ensure they can understand behaviour better and respond to it in what we call a therapeutically appropriate way.</p> <p>  The restorative justice programme will be rolled out by the PDST, starting again this autumn.</p></speech>

There is some cause for hope.  At all times we were aware that we were dealing with a difficult but enormously important topic.  Something that has stayed with me is the fact that bullying has always been a major problem but now it follows children home and, in some instances, it follows staff home.  This makes it all the more insidious.  Nobody wants to see bullying in our schools and I include the Department in that.  Good work is ongoing and I want to acknowledge that.  I welcome the fact that a pilot programme on restorative justice is to be rolled out and I hope the witnesses can expand on that.  Almost every submission we received referred to the importance of restorative justice.  </p><p> Having said all that, more can be done and I will focus my questions on that.  One issue that came up repeatedly was the fact that there is no centralised collection of data.  We do not have enough information on how many incidents are arising, whether they are transphobic, racist, anti-Traveller or whether they involve physical violence, for example, and that is holding us back.  If we do not fully understand the problem, we are not going to be able to tackle it properly.  Are there any proposals to ensure that we can centralise data such as that because that would be of value?</p><p> The other issue is the 2013 document, which remains the cornerstone of the Department's policy.  The document is eight years old and an awful lot has changed in that time.  There was no TikTok then and the social media picture was very different.  In so many contexts, circumstances are very different now.  We need to update that document and I would like the Department to outline where that stands because things are evolving very quickly.</p><p> There is talk of reforming the RSE and SPHE curricula, which is important.  I have expressed the view that there are issues with the RSE curriculum that could lend themselves to the othering of students, particularly those in the LGBTQI community.  I believe that access to counselling is vitally important but that is a broader issue, which also involves the Department of Health.  </p><p> My primary questions centre on data, the appropriateness of the Department's policy document and whether it needs to be updated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#C00200"><p>On the data, to date the Department's inspectorate has been collecting data on a number of matters relating to anti-bullying in schools.  It has been doing this through two main evaluation models.  One is the whole-school evaluation model and the other is a bespoke, in-depth, stand-alone child protection and safeguarding inspection model.</p> <p>  I will deal first with the type of data and information we are collecting through the whole-school evaluation model.  During the whole-school evaluation, the inspectorate reviews the school's anti-bullying policy.  That policy may also be reviewed in the context of SPHE-focused inspections at primary and post-primary level.  If, in the course of these inspections, an inspector finds that a school does not have an anti-bullying policy or is not implementing the policy appropriately, he or she will make recommendations for improvement.  While it is the responsibility of the principal and board to implement those recommendations, the inspector keeps a watching brief and follows up as needed.  There is another important source of data that the inspectorate gathers through these whole school evaluations, which is surveys of parents, students and teachers.  These surveys contain a number of items related to anti-bullying in schools.  The data from those surveys is analysed.  It is also discussed and shared with the school to enable the school to use it to inform its own anti-bullying measures.  It is also used to inform the inspection findings, to advise the school and it may be referenced in the evaluation report that is published.  Data collected by the Department's inspectorate through these whole school evaluation surveys is collated and the key insights arising will be updated further and reported on in the chief inspector's report, which is due to be published in the third quarter this year.  </p> <p>  The child protection and safeguarding inspections are another important source of data and information on anti-bullying measures in schools.  During these inspections, group discussions are held with a random selection of students in primary and post-primary schools.  As part of the discussions between the inspectors and primary school pupils, the themes of friendship and bullying are explored to ascertain the depth of understanding of pupils of the various forms of bullying, including exclusion, racist and homophobic bullying, bullying of children with special educational needs and cyberbullying.  Similarly, in post-primary schools during these discussions inspectors inquire into the students' knowledge and understanding of issues relating to personal safety, building and maintaining relationships and various kinds of bullying.  In the context of these child protection and safeguarding inspections, surveys of parents are carried out and focus groups with parents are also conducted.  These focus on a number of anti-bullying items, including the climate in the school, how parents feel about the school and their awareness of the school's child protection procedures, including its anti-bullying policy.  </p> <p>  Looking to the future, the inspectorate is working to strengthen its oversight of, and reporting on, the implementation of anti-bullying procedures in schools.  In that regard, in the coming school year inspectors will, during incidental inspections in primary and post-primary schools, look at the following areas: the extent to which schools have anti-bullying policies in place; the timely reporting by principals to the board on anti-bullying matters as required under the 2013 procedures; the annual review by boards of management of anti-bullying; the communication of the school's anti-bullying policies to all members of the school community, including parents; and the recording of incidents of bullying behaviour in accordance with the 2013 procedures.  The findings on anti-bullying measures in schools will be used to inform a composite report which will, in turn, feed into the way forward at departmental level in respect of anti-bullying.</p> <p>  On the issue of SPHE as raised by the Deputy, the committee should note that the curriculum is due to be reviewed at junior cycle.  From 2023, schools will be advised to include the SPHE short course as part of their well-being programme.  The brief for the review of the current junior cycle SPHE course has been drafted and will be considered by the board of the NCCA this summer.  Following an updated specification at junior cycle, work will begin on updating the senior cycle SPHE curriculum.</p></speech>

The whole-school evaluation only happens every five or six years as I understand it.  It is not a regular interaction with schools and, as Ms Keating has described it, it is a mechanism for evaluating policies and procedures.  What has been suggested to us by contributors at other meetings is that we do not have data on the age at which bullying starts, whether there is a gender or aggression dynamic, whether physical bullying is more prevalent than isolation-type bullying, whether there is a racial or sexual orientation element or whether it is more prevalent at second level than at primary level.  It is not just about how schools are dealing with bullying but also what it is.  We need to collect data to find out what bullying in our schools looks like.  I ask Ms Keating to speak to that aspect of data collection, as opposed to trying to find out how schools are dealing with bullying by way of their policies and procedures.  </p> <p>  My second question is one that was asked previously at this committee.  I am interested in the under-representation of minority groups among the teaching body.  We do not have a teaching body that is representative of the student body.</p><p>How can we find the mechanism to tackle that and ensure we do not have a homogenous teaching profession?  I raise that because it is much easier to tackle issues of sexual orientation or racial diversity in the student body if we have a staff body which is reflective of that.</p></speech>

In terms of whole-school evaluation, not only is the focus on looking at policies, but attention is also given to the gathering of the perspectives of students, teachers and parents on a number of anti-bullying items through online surveys.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned the frequency of whole-school evaluation.  It is a whole-school approach which takes a number of days in a school.  For that reason, the inspectorate has been and will be focusing, in the new term and during the 2021-22 school year, on conducting incidental inspections which are short and focused forms of inspection and take place over one day.  That will allow the inspectorate to gather information on the areas I have alluded to previously.  The plan is, from January 2022, to include a number of these checks on anti-bullying in schools through all the evaluation models.  A circular with regard to those plans has been issued to all primary and post-primary schools in recent weeks.</p></speech>

I do apologise.  Am I right in saying that there is no requirement on schools to detail the nature of each bullying incident, whether it was racially motivated or whether it involved a seven-year-old, a 12-year-old or a four-year-old?  None of that is a requirement of schools, as I understand it</p></speech>

The principal is required to report, at regular intervals, to the school board of management about the types of bullying, especially when bullying crosses a threshold and is considered a child protection issue.  There is a specific requirement for that type of bullying to be recorded.  In that case, there is a particular role for the designated liaison person, who is the member of staff with responsibility for child protection matters in the school.  In such instances, the designated liaison person must provide the board with summary data with regard to the number of child protection concerns arising from bullying behaviour and certain documents relating to each such child protection case file.  Those documents are specified in section 9.7.2 of the child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools 2017.</p></speech>

It is known that the teaching workforce is not representative of the student body in the school system.  We have been doing considerable work in the context of teacher supply.  The Teaching Transforms campaign, which is designed to attract young students into the teaching profession, is under way.  This year's campaign, which commenced in December, focused on diversity.  The young student teachers and teachers who were involved in that were all from groups which are under-represented in the teaching profession.  It is also important to note that path 1, which is an equity of access programme at third level, is working at increasing the number of under-represented groups in the teaching profession.  That was reviewed last year and is continuing.  With regard to the work involved in that, there are various projects.  The higher education institutions, HEIs, are working alongside secondary schools and some primary schools to raise the awareness of teaching and the pathways to teaching, etc.  We have more recently been looking at how we may be able to collect data on this question.  There are no readily available data but we are looking at that as part of our data collection and teacher supply work.</p></speech>

Our committee is here to help, support and try to drive protection for children and students.  That is our ultimate goal.  Over the past number of weeks, what we have been hearing has been extremely shocking.  I am sure the witnesses have heard a significant amount from many of the committee debates we have been through, with regard to the interviews and witnesses who have come before us.</p><p>It is disheartening to think it is one-in-three, globally.  Bullying happens.  It happens often, but it is about how we tackle it.  Our committee is about tackling bullying.  Some of my questions have come up through a number of witnesses who have spoken with us over the past number of weeks.  I do not know which of our witnesses may be most relevant to respond, but I would like him or her to respond in the spirit of how we will improve the current situation.  I would appreciate if he or she would respond in that spirit.</p><p>When we had Ombudsman for Children here, there was a question about the youth mental health path finder project.  I understand this may be linked with the HSE and the Department of Health as well, but can someone respond on that?</p><p>The measurement of bullying, which I know a number of other committee members have mentioned, came up before in terms of it being audited.  How we are auditing the action plan on bullying?  This was from the anti-bullying centre, ABC, in Dublin City University, DCU, especially from our UNESCO chair on tackling bullying, which is quite an impressive position to have in Ireland and in DCU.</p><p>Programmes have come up before.  I know the witnesses have mentioned programmes they are rolling out for teachers and teacher training, but it was noted that the FUSE programme was especially impactful.  We also heard about the Roots of Empathy early intervention programme in primary schools and how the levels of bullying in primary schools are quite high.  How will we support the likes of DCU in rolling out a programme such as FUSE to so many thousands of students?  It is incredible.  They are doing the best they can, but there is no way they will reach students.  We could be waiting for another 25 years and how many students would have gone through the system every five years?  What is the Department of Education's engagement with DCU on the FUSE programme and how is it supporting the roll-out of the programme?  I may leave it at that with regard to the Roots of Empathy early intervention programme.</p><p>One other point was on school inspector reports.  When you look up a school on <i>education.ie</i>and you download the report, it speaks about subject matter.  Child safeguarding has been mentioned.  We have spoken about how a positive school environment around bullying is so important and how some schools may not be as focused on this as others.  That is a huge challenge.  Should the inspector reports not speak directly about bullying and tackling bullying?  If it is not there, why not, considering we know it happens all the time and it is more about the mitigation factors?  I went through a couple of reports but they were from 2019 and maybe this has changed since then.  There was nothing about tackling bullying.  Maybe it was referenced under another term.</p></speech>

As part of the inspectorate's plans to strengthen its reporting on and evaluation of anti-bullying measures in schools, it has planned that following the incidental inspections, which are due to roll out from September 2022, each school will be provided with a written note on the findings of the inspection with regard to each of the areas of focus.  The note can be used by schools to inform their anti-bullying measures and take any necessary actions to strengthen them.  Those findings will also be used to feed into a composite report which will be published.  The inspectorate is aware of the need to ensure consistency in reporting on anti-bullying matters.  From January 2022, the extent to which all schools are implementing the anti-bullying procedures in the five areas of focus will be reported on, not only in all whole-school evaluation reports, but in all other inspection-type models as well.</p></speech>

The Department has been supporting the FUSE programme for three years and it is a successful programme, as the Senator has pointed out.  The aim of it is capacity building within schools.  We support that approach and will continue to support the DCU anti-bullying centre in the future.  We have some information about the efficacy of FUSE so far.</p><p>The attitudes of students to online safety are also positive following the FUSE programme engagement and when they have been asked about the programme, they have a very positive outlook on it.</p></speech>

How will that be possible?  Reference was made to the numbers but we have many thousands of students at both primary and secondary level.  How will this be done in a regional way that will have an impact in the next two to three years?</p></speech>

What I would like to see from the Department is a target.  If I said to Ms Murray there is a target for the roll-out of FUSE, be it at certain levels or certain years at secondary school level, what would that be?  Where can we see that we will be able to reach all schools, considering it is continuous as well.  That is a question I would like Ms Murray to come back to me on.</p> <p>  I have a question on the Pathfinder project as well, and the inspectorate report.  Ms Keating may have answered regarding the latter.</p></speech>

As the Senator will be aware, this was a collaborative project across several Departments to try to align and streamline youth mental health supports.  There was a proposal as a result of the work that a cross-government youth mental health Pathfinder unit would be established with the participation of the Departments of Health, Education and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We have received an update from the Department of Health on this.  The Department continues to engage extensively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the objective of agreeing an implementation option for the Pathfinder project.  We have been told that the demands on both Departments as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have presented challenges and probably have delayed progress in this area.</p></speech>

Ms Keating answered regarding the audit, from what I understand.  In the inspectorate reports, should a section on bullying be available?  It is up on the website, www.education.ie.  When one enters a school name, one gets all the details.  Should that inspectorate report include a section on how that school tackles bullying.  They talk about child safeguarding but that is a little different; it is about welfare.  Can Ms Keating respond to that?</p></speech>

Bullying, be it online bullying, in-class bullying or inside-the-school-gate bullying, has changed over the past number of years.  It is getting more complex, year-on-year.  Has the curriculum for teacher training changed in any way over the past number of years to cater for the changes in bullying and the complex issue that it is?  I refer to training a teacher and trying to equip him or her regarding bullying, which has definitely changed dramatically over the past five, ten or 20 years.  Teachers now have to look out for something different.  It might come to other complex needs of a pupil.  They might be able to outline some of the changes that have occurred in the past number of years.</p></speech>

That was published in November.  As part of the review leading up to that publication, the areas of intercultural, anti-racism and diversity have been given greater prominence in the new standards for ITE and global citizenship education is included as one of the seven core elements of ITE to include education for sustainable development, well-being, both personal and community, social justice, interculturalism.  The revised standards define inclusive education as "&lsquo;any aspect of teachers&rsquo; learning aimed at improving their capacity to address and respond to the diversity of learners&rsquo; needs; to enable their participation in learning; and remove barriers to education through the accommodation and provision of appropriate structures and arrangements to enable each learner to achieve the maximum benefit from his /her attendance at school".</p> <p>  As part of the review and accreditation process leading to the publication of C&eacute;im, the core elements were explored and examined with student teachers during their ITE programme.  It is also envisaged that the revised procedures for review and accreditation will include a thematic review, which will focus on specific areas of the curriculum and ITE programme.  All new programmes submitted to the Teaching Council for accreditation must be in alignment with C&eacute;im.  It is anticipated that existing programmes of ITE will be realigned in accordance with C&eacute;im for commencement in September 2022.</p> <p>  In addition to ITE, extensive CPD supports are available for teachers.  Particularly, in the online space, we have Webwise.  The Webwise programme is a multifaceted programme.  It targets a range of people within the system.</p><p>It targets schools, teachers and parents, and it has a youth hub for young people.  The school and teacher hub contains an extensive range of primary and post-primary curriculum tagged resources to support educators when teaching about the safe and responsible use of the Internet in the classroom and the promotion of student well-being.</p><p> Likewise, the parent hub provides practical advice and information to help parents safeguard their children as they use the Internet and helps to forge a link between the school and the home.  The hub provides guidance and practical information to parents on key issues such as the use of technology in the home, parental controls, screen time, emerging technologies, respectful online communication, cyberbullying, information around sexting and image sharing, and how to engage positively in their children's online lives.</p><p> The youth hub is a proactive and creative hub for young people where young people can get advice on Internet safety and become more involved in making the Internet a better and safer place for all users.  It provides advice on issues such as online harassment and how to deal with it.</p><p> Many of these programmes will provide advice around online bullying and bullying in general.  All of the continuing professional development, CPD, that is provided by the Professional Development Service for Teachers will include positive engagement in the school, respect for each other and respect for community, and these all add to the positivity in the school.  We can add to that if the committee wants more information.</p><p> Teachers are supported, either in their initial teacher education process or in continuing professional development.  Sometimes the CPD is the place for some of the programmes where we can support teachers better once they are in the classroom.  As we move forward and as we look at the procedures for anti-bullying, we will also take on board what changes may need to be brought into place for initial teacher education also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#F00200"><p>I thank Ms Kelly.  I have a question for Ms Tansey on the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and would like to broaden it out a little.  The committee published the report on the impact of Covid-19 on primary and secondary education.  The report recommends that emotional and therapeutic supports should be provided in all schools.  I have stated to some of the witnesses that perhaps this could be rolled out on a trial basis.  Would having access to a professional therapist or counsellor on site help students?  Does NEPS have any proposals in this regard?</p> <p>  I will widen the discussion out for other witnesses.  I am speaking as a public representative and as a parent, and having spoken to other parents and people who come to me looking for assistance.  Covid-19 has had a huge effect on some students, including some students where there may never have been any emotional issues or supports needed or required in the past.  I may be totally wrong, and I am referencing anecdotal evidence only, but it appears to be affecting more females than males.  They got more attached to their parents because they were at home from March to August, then back to school in September, and then back out of school for the year end again.  It was February before they got back going again.  Some of these children have never settled back into school.  Some of them will not go to school.  The parents are having absolutely nightmarish problems with them.  These pupils would never, ever have had any problems in the past.  Previously they would have gone to school very happily and were very happy students doing very well in school.  They have got into the trend of being at home, getting really attached to their parents and losing contact with their friends.  They are trying to build that confidence back up again in making friends and getting back into the school cycle and so on.  Many of these parents have told me they cannot wait until September comes with some form of normality.  This is a huge issue.  Is the Department of Education aware of this?  The recommendations in our report on the emotional and therapeutic supports are needed now more than ever.</p> <p>  In the past I would have been the person saying that the young people were looking for spoon-feeding, but having listened to the very personal stories from parents, I am convinced of the scale of problem.  If I am hearing these stories then I have no doubt other public representatives are hearing them.  It is not just where I come from in County Wexford.  I have no doubt it is happening throughout the country.  Perhaps Ms Tansey would come in on any NEPS proposals for emotional and therapeutic supports.  Is NEPS considering it?  Could it be rolled out on a trial basis, perhaps to a number of schools throughout the country?  Will an official from the Department of Education answer my wider question on the issues happening at the moment and what the Department is hearing from schools across the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Tansey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#F00300"><p>As the Chairman will be aware, the approach taken by the Department of Education is very much a focus on prevention and early intervention.  Our well-being policy statement and framework for practice is very much around that.  It is based on best international practice.  I am aware the committee has been talking over recent weeks about the important role of schools in supporting well-being.  They are supporting and providing children with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies.  They are like coping skills.  It is also about providing children and young people with the opportunity to experience strong, supportive relationships in the school setting and to learn through those.  It is about providing children and young people with opportunities to be part of a school environment that feels both physically and psychologically safe, an environment to which children and young people feel a sense of belonging, where they feel connected, where they feel their voice is heard, and where they feel supported.  While those statements are brief, they are very deep and there is a lot contained within them.</p> <p>  In the approach it takes, the Department of Education encourages schools to use the school self-evaluation process, which is an embedded process within schools.  We encourage them to use that process to focus on well-being.  We have developed a range of resources to support schools in so doing.  We have statements of effective practice.  People may ask what a good school looks like.  We have a range of statements around what a good school looks like with regard to those three areas.  We encourage schools to use questionnaires, focus groups and resources we have developed to reflect on their own needs, to see what they are doing well or  where they need to improve, and to put in place a school improvement plan to support that.  We know that, internationally, this approach is found to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people with increased inclusion, social capital and social cohesion.  It has benefits for mental health.  We strongly take that approach.  We recognise, however, that within this there is a continuum of need within schools and that while all of our universal supports will support a lot of our children and young people, there is a need for greater support for some children who need more targeted support.</p> <p>  On the query around school refusal behaviour, in our service we have noticed there has been quite a bit of school refusal behaviour since the schools have reopened.  It was not so much the first time the schools reopened but after the second closure and subsequent reopening.  NEPS provides a casework service as well as a support and development service for teachers.  As part of our casework service we support individual children.  Through our consultation service we have been supporting children, their teachers and their parents to support the successful return to school of the many children who have been experiencing school refusal behaviour.  We are there with the school on the ground.  Covid has allowed us to extend our practice to be a blended model.  We use online supports and we consult online with schools, which makes our response probably more immediate.  These are the things we have learned from the Covid-19 experience.  We have been supporting teachers, parents and young people around school refusal behaviour since March, among other things.  It has been part of our casework service.</p> <p>  The other approaches we use are very specific evidence-based approaches and projects.  We use the Friends programme, which is an anxiety prevention and resilience-building programme based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT.  It is a train the trainer programme.  We train teachers to deliver the programme within schools, where schools teach children to apply the principles of CBT to allow them to cope and problem solve, and ultimately to reduce anxiety and build resilience.  We use the Incredible Years teacher classroom management programme, which targets primary schools and the building of social and emotional competence.  It also looks at building resilience.</p><p>Specifically within that programme there is a section on bullying and what is called bully-proofing the school, whereby there is an atmosphere of problem-solving in the school and people work together in a non-threatening, non-blaming way.  The whole school community works together, including parents, who are a key part of that.  Those are two examples of the programmes we use to support the development of social and emotional learning in schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#G00200"><p>That is okay and I get what Ms Tansey said but this is not just about providing counselling services.  This is about having somebody on site.  The person does not have to be in the same school.  If we take the example of a school in Enniscorthy, this person could be shared between three or four different schools, perhaps one big school and three or four smalls or whatever.  Students would then feel they have somebody to go to on a confidential basis who they can absolutely trust.  I know they trust the teacher, the principal and so on but teachers and principals are not there for that type of need, even though they are doing that job.  The world has moved on and we must move on with it.  We need something like what I was talking about where there is somebody on site whom students can trust and who can provide therapeutic supports.  The people I am talking about, that is, the children who have not resettled back into school, do not have behavioural problems.  If they did their parents might be happy.  Instead these children have totally withdrawn into themselves.  They do not want to go to school.  They have not got the confidence to do it or to reconnect with their friends.  They have not got the confidence to go back into the class and reconnect with their teacher.  This is a huge problem.  The Department can ignore this problem and maybe it will go away, Covid-19 will be blamed and everything like that.  However, this problem is not going to go away.  It is one that is here to stay and Covid-19 his highlighted this issue.  I do not want to get stuck on that but I want to pass on my frustration about how things are with the situation.</p> <p>  Other members can come back in now but just before that I have one question.  In previous meetings the committee has heard calls from several witnesses about the need to update the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools published the same year.  At the meeting on 15 June Professor James O'Higgins Norman of the DCU Anti-Bullying Centre recommended a brief review and audit of both the 2013 action plan and the procedures to ensure they comply with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, recommendations.  I know this has been asked before but I must say this is of huge importance.  We are talking about 2013.  What has happened since 2013 and 2021?  The issues have compounded and gotten worse on a year-by-year basis.  I therefore plead with the Department to have a look at this issue.  It has been answered but does anyone want to come in briefly on that?  I am aware Senator Dolan wants to come back in.  I am not sure if Deputies &Oacute; Laoighaire and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in are there.  If they are, they can indicate to me.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoighaire will come in after Senator Dolan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#G00300"><p>I have a question for the principal officers.  What does an ideal school environment look like?  It is a question I have posed to a number of the witnesses who have presented to us, particularly principals.  Can the Department officials name a perfect pilot school or one which they would say is a great environment where the principals, teachers, parents and the board of management are tackling bullying in a very positive way?  Is there a school which is very transparent, accountable and very open, where the victims, the perpetrators, the bystanders and all those elements are included?  What might that look like?</p> <p>  Second, we have had a number of witnesses who have talked about further training for career guidance teachers and for teachers and indeed Mr. Joyce spoke about the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST.  However, the information we were getting back from principals is that teachers do not feel they have the tools or the skill set to identify bullying.  It seems to be cropping up that either the training is not reaching them or being effective or that somehow it is not working on the ground in the classroom.  I want to ask about that.</p> <p>  In summary then, what is the officials' ideal anti-bullying model which they would want to see working across all schools in Ireland?  Perhaps there would be difference between primary and second levels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paraic Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#G00400"><p>I might add something there.  If we were looking for an ideal school or one that has the best example of a positive school culture, we would be looking for somewhere where the wider school community is engaged on a regular basis in terms of their communication and respect.  We would be looking for a school that places an equal emphasis on the parents' and the students' voice.  We would be looking for somewhere with buy-in, in a very collegiate way, across all staff, not just the teaching staff in the school.  There would be a shared responsibility around the best ways to watch out for and tackle bullying.  One will usually find that a school which is open to various kinds of ideas has an awareness of the things the school must try, as well as the need to bring students with them.  Those tend to be the types of schools that are most successful in tackling bullying because they are open to that.  Usually the key person is the principal.  If there is effective leadership of the school one will find most other things tend to be successful.  Maybe some of my colleagues would have examples of that around the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#G00500"><p>I will add very briefly to that.  School culture is key as is willingness on the part of schools to take the appropriate actions to prevent and tackle bullying.  Another really important dimension Mr. Joyce alluded to there is involving parents and students and having an appropriate model of engagement.  We are all aware the student and parent charter is coming down the tracks and the intention here is very much around enhancing school engagement with parents and students and having a model of engagement for students that really gives them space to have their voice heard, and an audience in the school community that is willing to listen to them.  The other part of this is very much connected with the Lundy model of child participation, which is based on article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It consists of ensuring the students themselves can see that if they have issues, those issues are addressed and acted upon in the appropriate way.  School culture, in summary, is key, as is ensuring we have the involvement of all, whether it is parents, students, teachers or the broader community, so the school environment and school community is as safe as it can be for students.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#G00600"><p>It would be great to have some sort of word for our perfect school.  I am thinking of a sort of champion school or advocacy school in each of our regional areas.  There would be kudos for the school in being open and handling these things well.  Sometimes it is unfortunately seen as a stereotypical weakness if this is being talked about.  Parents might say they do not want to send their children to that school whereas we really should be embracing that and seeing as a really positive thing that children are feeling confident to speak out, to speak with their teachers and that it is being tackled.  My concern would be around when schools do not talk about it and when it is solely about the academic marks children achieve.  That is really where I want to get to with these inspectorate reports and this idea of a champion school.  Maybe the Department might think about how to recognise and acknowledge schools that are really effective in this way such that it becomes more normal and natural and that we are always talking about tackling bullying because it happens all the time.</p> <p>  I probably do not have any more time.  The other question I had was about teacher training.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Tansey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#G00700"><p>If I can add something, in the Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice we have in the Department, what we call indicators of success are set out.  These are concerned with what a successful school looks like.  The indicators of success span the culture and environment of the school, the curriculum and the teaching and learning in the school, the policy and planning in place within the school and relationships and partnerships.  Very briefly, in terms of the culture and planning of what we say is a really successful school in promoting well-being, it is about children, young people and staff experiencing that sense of belonging and connectedness.</p><p>It is about the feeling of being safe, physically and psychologically.  It means that systems are in place to hear the voice of the child and the voices of parents so that they are heard.  These all lead to improvements in the school community.  With regard to the curriculum, it means children and young people have positive learning experiences and high quality teaching, and have opportunities for success within the school.  It also means they have access to curricular activities that promote their physical, social and emotional competence to enhance their overall well-being.</p><p> In policy and planning it means good, strong policies are in place and schools have evaluations in place to support the work.  Relationships and partners are part of what was missed when schools were closed.  Schools provide a strong and supportive structure through relationships with adults.  Adults can mediate the world for our children and young people.  Adults can mediate difficulties and support children through them.  Our policy sets out a picture of what a very good school looks like and what we believe would be the indicator of the success of a good school.</p></speech>

I do not need another response on this and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senator Dolan have followed up on it.  It does not seem that the data being gathered is adequately dynamic and gives a full picture.  Problems probably have to reach a very high threshold before they end up in a whole-school evaluation.  I suppose surveys show a particular period and do not necessarily capture the full picture.  I do not need a response because Ms Tansey has answered as comprehensively as possible.  However, it needs to be improved.  Monitoring the implementation of anti-bullying policies is important but this is different from gathering data on incidence of bullying.</p> <p>  Social media is a huge element.  Earlier, Mr. Joyce spoke about the online safety Bill, which is very important and will play a key role.  I wrote legislation on this issue some time ago.  The ASTI made a proposal on a link with the key social media bodies, whereby schools would have a key point person to help them to work through particular problems that arise, particularly complex problems relating to these platforms.  Is this something the Department has explored or on which it has contacted the key platforms?</p></speech>

It is one point of contact.  We have a broadband help desk that assists with technical connectivity.  Connectivity of all schools is dealt with through the HEAnet backbone, which provides all levels of content filtering for schools.  It has a support service for schools.  PDST Technology in Education deals with learning platforms, resources for teaching and the embedding of digital technology, as does PDST overall because all curriculum development incorporates digital elements.  There are extensive online and face-to-face supports.  In the past year there has not been face-to-face support but PDST has developed a significant portal with resources for school leaders and teachers to develop and ensure safety in the use of digital technology in schools and being online.</p> <p>  With regard to digital technology, schools are required to have an acceptable use policy.  This policy is developed with the whole school community.  At present, schools are advised to consult the entire school community.  The student and parent charter underpins this in legislation.  The acceptable use policy provides schools with a framework whereby everybody in the school community understands the limits and sanctions for the misuse of digital technology elements of school activity.</p></speech>

I will give a hypothetical example and I will not name a particular platform.  A principal in a school in County Clare is having a recurring problem with a particular element of a particular platform.  Has the Department considered approaching all of the platforms to ask for a point person whom schools could contact if there is an issue?  That person could talk the schools through the modalities and answer questions.  Obviously a school has to decide how to deal with disciplinary action but it might be a useful resource the platforms might be willing to provide in order to give advice on how the platforms work.  It is for the school community to decide on sanctions through restorative approaches or other approaches.</p></speech>

We do not have a centralised platform as some jurisdictions do.  PDST is able to provide support for, and advise schools on, the most commonly used platforms.  In the main, schools also receive advice and support from the providers.  Very often, this is the source of support if a platform is not doing something it is supposed to do.  With regard to sanctions if somebody is misusing a platform, most schools have security built into the platforms.  I am not 100% clear on what the Deputy is getting at.  Is it a technical question or with regard to misuse?</p></speech>

Is it possible for the school to have a particular point person at the platform?  I am not saying it would be in any way outsourced.  It would be a source of information and feedback that could be of benefit to schools.  Has there been communication between the Department and the social media platforms on a resource that could be provided to schools for ongoing advice and support?</p></speech>

The PDST is our support service for schools when it comes to using the most common social media regardless of platform.  This is the point to call for schools.  It supports schools with various elements and aspects and with any difficulties they may have.  It is able to advise them on where they might need to go depending on the problem.  I see where the Deputy is coming from.  He is possibly talking about a particular social media mechanism that allows people to put up harmful content.  It is important to note that Coco's law, as the Deputy is probably well aware, was commenced in February.  This creates a legislative framework and makes it an offence for people to post harmful content.  The online safety and media regulation Bill will reinforce safety by requiring online platforms to have in place codes to underpin and allow for the removal of content.  These are being developed - perhaps not in the Department of Education - and safeguards are being put in place to deal with what the Deputy is getting at.</p></speech>

I fully agree they have to be the priority.  From anecdotal evidence, teachers are bullied and the students who see it happening feel that if the staff are doing it, they can also do it.  It happens in the school community.  Is this an issue for the Department of Education?  Is it a matter for the patrons of the school?</p><p>Who is responsible for that if there is anecdotal or clear evidence that this is happening within the school?  Senator Dolan spoke about the perfect school community.  We all want the perfect school community but what if it is not there because of the teachers or principal and there is anecdotal evidence of bullying?  I am not sure if the chief inspector or the deputy chief inspector is responsible for this area.  This is happening in different schools across the country.  It happens in every workplace.  I have anecdotal evidence and I have no doubt other people see this happening or hear about it.  I can say it here under privilege but there are not many platforms where I can raise this issue because it is very difficult to raise it but it is happening out there.  The pupils see it happening on a daily basis and my fear is that if they see that teachers are bullying each other, they will think "why can't I do it against my fellow pupils?"  </p></speech>

The aim is to promote the health and well-being of all employees in the workplace.  Part of that is an employee assistance service, which is provided by Spectrum Life.  It is a self-referral service where teachers have access to a dedicated free phone line that is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year providing advice on a range of issues such as well-being, legal and financial issues, mediation and management support.  It is also available on social media platforms like WhatsApp, email and live chat.  All contacts on the service are qualified, accredited and experienced mental health professionals.  Where required, short-term counselling is available to employees.  The employee assistance service also provides advice and supports to managers and delivers interventions to help them deal with health and well-being issues in the workplace.</p> <p>  The bespoke well-being portal app offers access to podcasts, blogs, live chat, all sorts of topics around well-being, mental health, family life and e-learning programmes across mental health, sleep and a range of well-being topics.  It is part of the service provided by Spectrum Life and its mental health promotion manager is available to develop and deliver evidence-based mental health and well-being initiatives to reduce mental health problems in teachers and create the conditions whereby these things can be addressed at school level.  It is an access point for advice for individual teachers.  It is obviously something-----</p></speech>

There is very clear evidence.  Parents go to the Department, which tells them that it is not its problem.  The parents are sent back to the patrons, who tell them that it is not their problem.  The parents are then sent between Billy and Jack - the chairman of the board of management and the parents' council.  This is happening in a very limited number of schools but nobody seems to take responsibility and the only people suffering are the students.  It is a significant problem and parents are pulling their hair out.  Nobody is taking responsibility and the only people suffering, and suffering badly in some cases, are the children.  They see with their own two eyes.  The Department is not taking any responsibility.  In fact, it is washing its hands of it and sending parents back to the patrons, who are not taking responsibility.  The chairman of the board of management is trying his or her best in very difficult circumstances and the only people suffering are the pupils.  The witnesses come in here today and say it is about the pupils, the pupils, the pupils but in respect of taking responsibility for the people they employ, who employs teachers?  Is it the patrons or the Department?  Someone has to take responsibility for some situations that arise.  There is no use in them closing their eyes, washing their hands of it and moving on thinking someone else will sort out the problem.  This problem is not going away.</p></speech>

The first is at school level.  We mentioned the school principal and his or her responsibilities regarding reporting regularly to the board, the annual review of the school's anti-bullying policies and all of its dimensions and reporting to the parents' association when a review of the anti-bullying policy has been undertaken.  In addition, the board of management has a particular oversight role in each school regarding how the school deals with child protection concerns arising from bullying.</p> <p>  The role of the Department has a number of dimensions.  First, as the Chairman will be aware, the school governance section devised the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools, which inform schools of their responsibilities, including the responsibilities of school principals and boards to ensure schools are safe places for all those in them.  As such, the school governance section has overall oversight of the implementation of the 2013 procedures.  If parents contact the Department with a complaint relating to the implementation of the procedures, initially they are advised to utilise the agreed complaints procedures at school level.  This will involve contacting the school principal initially and thereafter contacting the chairperson of the board of management.  If parents contact the Department with a child protection concern arising from alleged bullying behaviour among pupils, the Department official who receives that complaint completes a child protection concern form and forwards this to the Department's parents and learners unit.  Under the Department's procedures, that child protection concern form is forwarded to Tusla.  As part of the overall oversight responsibilities of the Department, the parents and learners unit also provides summary data relating to the number of child protection concerns, which are submitted to the Department's child protection oversight group and subsequently submitted to the Department's management board.  The responsibility to ensure that there is a safe working environment for all staff members would also be covered by various elements of employment law that are beyond my competence to go into here.  </p></speech>

In addition, inspection data are available from child protection and safeguarding inspections.  If the Senator wishes, I can give a flavour of some of the findings emerging from those data.  For example, during those child protection and safeguarding inspections, more than 2,000 parents completed a survey dealing with several anti-bullying aspects.  The main findings regarding anti-bullying were that almost all parents indicated they had been informed of the anti-bullying policy of the school and almost all indicated as well they knew who to approach in their school if their child experienced bullying.  Slightly less than one tenth of the parents surveyed reported they were not confident the school would act promptly and effectively if they had a concern about bullying.  While most parents indicated their children learned about bullying and about relationships and sexuality education, RSE, in school, nonetheless a significant minority of parents were not aware of their children's learning.  For example, almost one fifth of parents did not know or responded "No" when asked if their child had learned about RSE in school.  One tenth of the parents also did not know or said "No" when asked if their child had learned about bullying in school, and the same proportion did not know or responded "No" when asked if their child had done the Stay Safe programme in primary school.</p> <p>  Findings are also emerging from the whole-school evaluation surveys of parents, teachers and pupils.  I do not know if time will permit me to give details.  What I have said, however, will give the members of the committee some indication of the types of analysis the inspectorate have been doing regarding these findings.  These will be reported on further-----</p></speech>

He is a second-year student in the Patrician Academy in County Cork and he is here to brief the committee on school bullying and its impact on mental health.  This is a very important day for the committee as Mr. Ahern is the youngest witness ever to appear before it.  It is testament to his great enthusiasm for and commitment to educational issues that the committee has chosen to end our examination of this important issue with Mr. Ahern as a voice for young people.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Ahern to make his opening statement.  I will then invite members to ask questions.  Mr. Ahern will be aware that the committee will publish his opening statement following this meeting.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind the witness that he is giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  The witness has already been advised of this.  I also remind the witness of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that he should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech which might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if his statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, he will be directed by the Chair to discontinue, and it is imperative he comply with this direction.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Ahern now to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

My name is Hugh Ahern and I am a student of the Patrician Academy in Mallow.  I am in second year and I have a keen interest in social and political issues.  The definition of bullying is "the repeated use of threats or violence in an attempt to harm or intimidate others".  The definition for cyberbullying is &ldquo;the use of the internet to frighten or upset someone, usually by sending them unpleasant messages&rdquo;.  A nationwide survey of bullying in first and second level schools conducted by Trinity College Dublin estimates that 31% of primary and 16% of secondary school students have been bullied at some time during their school years.</p> <p>  While cyberbullying tends to not take place during the school day, it may be carried out by a student outside of school hours.  It is much more difficult for a teacher, fellow student, parent or guardian to spot cyberbullying compared with normal bullying.  However, normal bullying has no record of the act, only human reflection.  Cyberbullying, though, has a digital footprint and can be traced back to the day it began.  Cyberbullying can often be more harmful and threatening than other forms of bullying as it is always with you and there is no getting away from it.</p> <p>  What can the education system do?  I will make some recommendations.  Each school should be required to have a counselling service for students who need to talk to a professional rather than a teacher.  This service could be in the school building or the school could refer students to a counsellor.  I recommend the committee advise the Department of Education to look at updating the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary devised in September 2013, as some of the policy may be outdated.  It is eight years old and many changes have happened since in respect of cyberbullying.  There should also be a full overhaul of the topic of bullying within the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum and the production of a more up-to-date curriculum.  I also recommend that teachers should go on a training course about bullying in the school environment, and such a course should confront issues from the points of view of the bully, the victim and the bystanders.  In addition, I recommend that it should be mandated that a student representative be present when key decisions pertaining to student issues, such as an anti-bullying policy, are made by school boards of management.  Students get little or no say in these policy decisions and they are the ones with the experience.  Finally, I believe there should be a well-being day in each school as many students can get overwhelmed by day-to-day interactions.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for this opportunity and welcome any questions or concerns.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

We really value your insight.  It has been some time since those of us on the committee have been in the school system.  Many changes have happened in that time, including in respect of anti-bullying policies in recent years.  I hope many of them have been beneficial.</p> <p>  I will ask some general questions.  Much of what we have been talking about concerns the importance of the bystander effect.  I refer to people in a school stopping and intervening among their peers when they feel those peers are being bullied or carrying out bullying behaviour.  Do you think your generation feels confident to intervene when they see something happening before them that is wrong and somebody is being bullied?</p><p>Even though they might feel it is wrong, will they let it slide or does he think they will intervene?</p><p> Many of the recommendations you have put forward are very strong.  Some of them are ideas that other organisations have proposed as well, which helps us.  It means that when we are formulating our report there is a consensus forming on a few ideas.  What does he think about subjects such as social, personal and health education, SPHE, and relationships and sexuality education, RSE?  Do they need to be changed significantly?  Are students being given enough education on the diversity and differences in society and the different backgrounds students come from?</p></speech>

However, sometimes a student may not speak up for numerous reasons.  The student may not remember it or something like that.</p> <p>  On the second question about SPHE and the religion course, the two courses go into where people come from and a person's background.  The SPHE curriculum could go more into the background of minorities.  In addition, there is not enough in the SPHE curriculum on bullying at present.  I and my SPHE teacher were looking through the book in school and it is a very short chapter in the book.  It is not concerning, but makes one wonder if bullying is being talked about that much.</p></speech>

One of the points that has arisen repeatedly is that schools cannot do everything by themselves.  Teachers and boards of management will do their best, but one thing that is needed to tackle bullying is to ensure that schools have enough access to trained counsellors and that child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, are properly resourced to ensure that young people are supported and, indeed, staff as well.  This is something Hugh has spoken about too.  Is this something he, his friends and his peer group in school talk about much?  Would he be of the view that there is a serious need, and that there are inadequate resources at present for CAMHS and for counselling for young people, not just at school but more generally?</p></speech>

Teachers and school staff are not trained.  They do not get professional training on how to deal with bullying.  How teachers deal with bullying is more from personal experience.  I was just looking through the Department of Education's protocol and there is very little in it.  It is a sheet of paper that the teacher has to fill out on bullying.  The victim should be referred on to a proper counselling service or an in-school counsellor.  Bullying is something that lasts for people.  It is something that will never really go away.  It may remove the moral confidence.  In my report of the key results in the submission, I included the effects of bullying.  Depression and anxiety is another effect of bullying.  There are increased feelings of sadness and loneliness, changes in sleep and eating and permanent loss of interest in activity.  Children find that they cannot enjoy activities that much.  There is a need for a better service where it is needed.</p></speech>

We have been going through it.  We have been involved in this discussion on tackling bullying for a number of months so it is important that we hear from students about their experiences.  He has given us a number of recommendations and I like quite a few of them.  We have just finished a session with officials from the Department of Education.  I am curious.  When he was choosing his secondary school his parents probably spoke to him about the secondary school he would like to attend.  Did that conversation ever include an observation that students get on very well there and are happy in the school as well as the academic outcomes?</p></speech>

It does them annually, but there probably has been a delay due to the lockdown and everything else.  There should be a section there about how schools tackle bullying.  Does Hugh think that this would be important for parents, if they were reviewing that, when they are deciding what school to choose for their children, or that children would be looking at this as well?  At a young age it is very difficult, but he had a conversation about the school environment even when he was deciding which school he was going to attend.</p></speech>

It would be of value not just to people who experienced bullying but also students who may have concerns.</p><p>It would be useful in the inspectorate report.  I was reading through an inspectorate report - I think it was last year's report - and there was very little about bullying in schools.</p></speech>

The inspectorate stated that there would be a new report in January 2022 and that there would be a lot more included on that matter.  It referred to five successful indicators for schools.  Hopefully there will be more information on how schools are preforming against each of those indicators.</p> <p>  I sit on the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health and this is the first year the committee has been in place.  There is a dedicated committee for mental health and for education, as well as a few other areas.  In his recommendations, Hugh spoke about the importance of having a student advisory committee in the Department of Education to advise on mental health and well-being.  He also asked for a well-being day in his recommendations.  I liked the idea of that well-being day.  There is an anti-bullying week in November.  The first UNESCO international day against bullying was held last November.  Would it be good to have a well-being day during that week in November?</p></speech>

FUSE comes out to schools and engages with students and teachers.  I was curious whether it had come to Hugh's school yet.  There is another group called Soar which is for transition year students so next year he may get involved in it.  It is a group that comes out to schools and engages with transition year students about well-being and their school environment.  Has he heard of those programmes?</p></speech>

All witnesses raised this issue because bullying has changed over the years and it has increasingly gone online.  Hugh outlined, from his experience, how bullying can affect a student.  Would he welcome having an online safety commissioner?  How would it work with all the social media companies that are out there?  I have some anecdotal experience of what happens on those platforms.</p> <p>  Are there many students who never admit that they have been bullied?  This could be because they do not want to let their guard down, they do not want to admit it.  Perhaps they think they are tougher than what they actually are.  However, it affects them in later years because they did not seek help when they should have.  Can Hugh comment on those two issues?</p></speech>

I would be curious as to how an online safety commissioner would work in line with the new policies that have been put in place.  I know from reading about it that many social media companies have large legal teams and they have a lot of power.  They are willing to challenge anything that governments are trying to do.  I would be interested to know how that would work.  If students do not speak up personally about bullying in schools, it will affect them later in life.  They do not speak up fully about it.</p></speech>

Many of them know their sons or daughters are on social media, but they do not know what activity their sons or daughters are up to on social media.  They could be the nicest students face-to-face in school but when they get home, and use their mobile phones and different platforms, they could be the worst bully ever.  The witnesses say that it is the same parents who should come to the meetings and those who do not come to the meetings are the parents one would like to reach out to.  Does Hugh have any suggestions or ideas on how to interact with parents, or how the schools and the Department engage with parents to try to educate them on the dangers of social media and to let them know what happens on social media?</p></speech>

The parents one would like to reach out to are typically the parents who do not attend public sessions.  Most schools have public meetings to engage with parents.  The same parents turn up to these meetings all the time.  The parents who need to be engaged with are not turning up.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Department of Education could look at running an information campaign about cyberbullying on social media platforms.  It could advertise it in magazines and newspapers.  A national media campaign could work very well in that regard.  It is such an important topic.  Only in the recent years are people starting to take interest in cyberbullying.  The Department of Education or the Department with responsibility for communication should look at a media campaign to promote the prevention of cyberbullying.</p></speech>

I raised the following issue with the Department of Education today, and it was also raised at today's meeting.  Witnesses looked for the provision of emotional and therapeutic supports and someone who the students can trust and go to in the schools.  The principal of a school is very busy.  He or she may have a large school to run and there are additional pressures added in recent years.  Teachers do not have the time to do this as they are involved in the academic education of all the pupils.  We are suggesting that emotional and therapeutic support is provided to schools.  The role could be similar to a counsellor, but perhaps not as highly qualified.  It could be someone who the students can talk to and trust 100%.  The service should be discreet.  What would Hugh think about that, if it were to be rolled out in schools?  As I said to Department officials today, the role does not have to be in every school.  It could be shared among schools - one big school and a number of small schools.  The person could be in the school at least once or twice a week for pupils to talk to.  Pupils should be able to trust the person and it should be done in a discreet manner.</p></speech>

There are certain organisations in Ireland that offer these services but many of them are provided by phone whereby a student must ring or text a number.  Many others are online whereby a student must log on to a laptop.</p><p>Of course, it will be secure, but you may not get the time.  The parents may come in on you or something like that.  It would be good to have it in schools.  It would not have to be based in school, but regionally.  Maybe a representative would go to the schools once a week.  That person would cover the local electoral areas.  The person would be responsible, let us say, for the schools in the municipal district of Kanturk-Mallow.  Maybe there could be a representative to cover the Mallow-Kanturk district rather than numerous representatives who would all be spread out.  It would be the one professional dealing with that entire area and he or she might know what is happening in that area rather than someone different for a school, for instance, in Kanturk that may have the same issues as Mallow.</p></speech>

Is a student having the confidence to go to his or her parents if he or she is being bullied in the school an issue?  Do many students not have the confidence to go to, or do not feel comfortable in going to, their parents because they do not want to overly worry them?  How big a problem is that and how can it be overcome?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-22a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021062200002#N00300"><p>As I said to Senator Dolan, there is an issue.  People are not speaking up that much with the staff and teachers of the school.  That confidence needs to be built within the school environment.  Teachers should have a more friendly appearance than the teachers of the members' generation who came across as figures of authority.  They should still come across to our generation as figures of authority but they should also be welcoming of complaints.  Bullying should not be an issue that should be ignored.  It should be listened to.</p> <p>  In my school, we fill out a form every month.  It has not been happening during the Covid pandemic.  Students from each year fill out a form and it is completely anonymous.  The students write down, I think, three names - I forget it now because it has been so long since we did it - of people who they think may be being bullied and people they know are being bullied, and someone may speak out.  Then, I believe, they approach the students who are on that list and have a conversation with them to make sure that everything is okay.  That would be quite a good activity to roll out nationally as I believe students would speak out more if it was anonymous rather speaking to the teacher.</p></speech>

There is a lot of great sunshine down in Cork.  It might be a little hard to see you there.</p> <p>  I was asking who would you say the students would trust in school.  Would students go to a teacher or a career guidance teacher.  They may have a favourite teacher from their first year in school, from their leaving certificate year or from another year.  Is it always the teacher?  Could it be an SNA?  Could it be the school secretary?  Could it be the caretaker?</p></speech>

You know who to approach.  Maybe the teachers who seem interested.  For me, it would be the staff and teachers who seem interested in the students' emotional behaviour along with the students' academic achievements.  It is the members of staff and teachers who are the most interested in the student and who want to see the student academically improve, but also it is the people who are most pleasant who recognise the student for who he or she is.  It comes with the teacher's name as well.  It is the way that the teacher is portrayed around the school as to who you would go to.  Our staff are very kind.</p></speech>

You mentioned you were doing music.</p></speech>

Sometimes in drama and such subjects, role-play can be good as a way to get students to open up a little about how they are feeling about things.  Would subjects such as drama and more of the arts be worthwhile in school to encourage students to come out of their shell a little and talk more?</p></speech>

As I go to an all-boys school, being honest, not all boys are really interested in the arts or in drama.  Certain boys are interested in the arts and in drama while some others may be interested in football or hurling.</p></speech>

Maybe sports could be a good way to engage.  You make me laugh, Hugh, because when I went to school a long while ago the boys used to come to the girls' school for music and the girls would have to go to the boys' school to do physics.  I had hoped that things had changed a little since then.</p></speech>

Let me say that you are a credit to yourself, to your family and to your school, The Patrician Academy in Mallow in County Cork.  The committee is committed to hearing the voices of young people and this afternoon you have articulated the views of young people in a meaningful and substantive way.  You have a bright future ahead of you.</p> <p>  As Chair of the committee, I thank you for having the confidence to write to the committee.  Not many 15-year-olds take the time to write to a group of politicians.  If they say politicians do not listen to young people, you are very much proof of politicians listening to young people.  By writing to us, you have had the opportunity to appear before an Oireachtas committee.  There are a very limited number of people who have appeared before Oireachtas committees in public session over the years and you are, I would think, the youngest person to appear before an Oireachtas education committee.</p><p>It is only right and proper in discussing matters that have major effects on young people that we hear the voices of young people.  I thank the witness for giving his time.  I hope he enjoys the rest of his summer holidays and gets back to school in September.  I hope it will be a full school year and we will not still feel the effects of Covid-19.  I hope it will be well behind us because it has had such a significant effect on young people both in primary and secondary school.</p></speech>
