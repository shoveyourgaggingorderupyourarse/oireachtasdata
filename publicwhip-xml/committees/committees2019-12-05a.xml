He is joined by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy MacSharry.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting on 28 November.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is a matter arising out of the minutes.  As a result of the correspondence received from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which we discussed at the previous meeting, the committee agreed to forward a transcript of the meeting the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Houses of the Oireachtas for a response on matters discussed.  At that meeting, we asked for a response by Tuesday, 10 December in order that we could consider it at our meeting on Thursday, 12 December, which we will be our final meeting before the Christmas recess.  I propose we ask Mr. Finnegan and a senior representative of the OPW to be on standby in case we decide next Thursday morning that we would like to meet them on Thursday afternoon.  We may or may not wish to do so but it will be too late on Thursday morning to ask them.  We ask the secretariat, therefore, to put arrangements in place to have them on standby and we will decide on Thursday morning, having received the response, whether we want to call them to appear before us.  In case we decide to do so, they will be on standby.  Is that reasonable?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#B00400"><p>We will decide next Thursday what to do when we receive the report we have been assured we will receive before the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next items are correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is category A, comprising briefing documents and opening statements for the meeting.  There are quite a number of them because there will be several witnesses today.  Nos. 2610 to 2612, inclusive, from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 2561 and 2607 are documents from the Children's Health Ireland for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 2601, 2602, 2608 and 2609 are briefing documents and opening statements from the HSE for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2605 is correspondence from the Department of Health relevant to today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will discuss all the items presently.</p> <p>  The next category of correspondence, category B, comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers and their Ministers in follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publishing.  No. 2574 is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, dated 25 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of evidence required by SUSI in cases following difficult family circumstances.  The item has been overtaken by the letter we received from the City of Dublin Education and Training Board last week, which operates the SUSI scheme on behalf of the Department.  We will simply note the letter, given that it contains nothing we did not discuss at the previous meeting, and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2576 is from Dr. Alan Wall, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, dated 22 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of the use of occasional hourly payments for staff at third level institutions and the use of such payments in place of employment contracts.  The HEA states it will liaise with the higher education institutions to collate the information and will provide a report to the committee.  We welcome that step and will wait to see the report when it arrives.  We have put the issue on the authority's agenda and it will deal with it.</p> <p>  No. 2577 is from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 25 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of a perceived discrepancy between oral information provided at our meeting on 7 November and a parliamentary question answered on 12 November.  The matter relates to whether data of individuals were being stored outside the State.  Deputy Catherine Murphy tabled the parliamentary question.</p></speech>

I received a contradictory reply to a parliamentary question, which has been acknowledged in the correspondence from the Department.  I am reasonably happy with the response received.</p></speech>

We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2588 is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, dated 27 November, providing further information requested by the committee regarding the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema in Galway.  We asked about the implementation of the recommendations in the report.  Ms Licken stated that while the review has been completed and published only within the past two months, she can assure the committee the Department is working to progress all the recommendations.  There was a reference to buildings nearby in the report and she confirmed they are owned by Galway City Council, which Deputy Connolly had made clear to the committee.  Ms Licken stated they were referred to in the review in the context of the plans for Galway City Council, as set out in its strategy, namely, Everybody Matters: A Cultural Sustainability Strategy Framework for Galway 2016 - 2025.  Does Deputy Connolly wish to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#B01100"><p>I realise that the post-project review is recent and it is too early to ask about the recommendations.  Nevertheless, there is confirmation they are being implemented, which I welcome.  I also welcome the setting up of the special unit for 2040.  It seems there is ongoing learning in respect of matters but regarding the four properties, the clarification that has been received is unnecessary, given that, as the Chairman noted, the city council owns the properties.  My point was that in the post-project review, the council used the four properties to justify a F&aacute;ilte Ireland promotion of the area.  While I am delighted with that because I am from Galway and love it, the four properties have been empty since 2007.  A post-project review to consider value for money for the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema includes four properties that have been empty since 2007 but it did not raise one question mark as to why they have been empty since then.</p><p>They were bought at an astronomical price and have remained empty in the city which comes last in reaching its targets, although that is a matter for another day.  Should I put my hands up at this point and give up?</p></speech>

If it is going to include four houses, it should at least ask why they are empty and when they will be used.  Does the Chairman think it might do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#C00400"><p>We will watch how it implements the recommendations.  There is another item of correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt which relates to what was learned from the project.</p></speech>

"Misleading" would be a strong word but it was used to colour the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema as being at the centre of this cultural area of four houses.  It was used to give it a particular colour rather than describing it in black and white terms.</p></speech>

As I say, there is a follow-up item of correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to post-project reviews coming up in a moment.  It follows on from us getting on to the Department about its role in post-project reviews and the learning process.  We will come to that in a moment.  It is a related item of correspondence.  We will note and publish this item and issue the letter we have mentioned.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2589B from Mr. David Leahy, chief executive officer of Galway and Roscommon education and training board, ETB, providing information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement recorded in financial statements for Galway and Roscommon ETB.  We will note and publish this item and use the information as part of the work we will be doing in the new year, if we are all here, with regard to public procurement and compliance with public procurement rules.</p></speech>

It is an issue we need to explore.  We have agreed on that.  Mr. Leahy makes this clear in the third paragraph.</p></speech>

We are actually really on the job when we are doing this type of work and compiling information in respect of every single reference to non-compliant procurement in 2019.  It is an issue to which we will return, time permitting.  We are doing an important job and we will continue to do it diligently.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 2590B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of Health Service Executive, dated 28 November 2019 providing further detail requested by the committee regarding the national integrated staff records and pay programme.  He recognises that there were some teething problems with the system when it was introduced.  These issues affected approximately 200 staff, which equates to 1% of the people involved.  He gives a comprehensive response.  Does Deputy Catherine Murphy want to comment?</p></speech>

There is another item of correspondence, No. 2585C, on the same topic.  We are being given an assurance.  The whole point of asking this question is to find out whether the system is flexible enough and fit for purpose.  There will always be teething problems.  I acknowledge that.  It is not about trying to resolve the problems of an individual or group of individuals but they represent a good test of whether the system is working.  The HSE tells us "There is no change to how staff are paid in this regard and the system is fully configured to calculate and make these payments."  It essentially says that there were teething problems.  Correspondence we received from people on the other end of the system tells us something very different.  It tells us that SIPTU is involved in trying to resolve a problem.  I understand that this system is being rolled out incrementally.  That is a very good way to do things because, if one is going to run into a problem, it is better to find out before a great number of people are affected.

These are agreements.  It challenges what the HSE is saying.  The allowance for working on a Sunday has been cut by more than &euro;40.  We are being given very practical examples.  I am only using these to demonstrate that what one side tells us about the system working well is being challenged by the other side.  We are told that SIPTU is involved and that it cannot get the issue resolved.  My question for the Committee of Public Accounts is whether this system is fit for purpose.  Is there an input problem?  I do not think we can take the HSE's word that there is no problem now and that it was just a case of teething problems.  There appear to be ongoing problems in this regard.  The last thing we want is some sort of industrial relations issue because problems are being caused by a system that exists to improve things.</p></speech>

The HSE says that "The introduction of the new system has had a particular impact on the 400 Time Returning Officers".  I do not know whether this is a full-time post or just part of someone's job.  If everyone is directly inputting their own information, what are the 400 time returning officers doing now?  The HSE also says "In addition, staff in the payroll and staff records departments, spend less time on manual data entry and increased time on data validation."  Where is the saving if these staff are not doing the inputting but are spending more time checking what everyone else has done?

They must input the times they work so they can get paid the correct amount.  That is my interpretation but I could be wrong.  These are people who do not work standard hours and they must input their hours.  It is like fobbing in and out.</p></speech>

They are different staff.  There are time-returning officers and next sentence mentions the staff in the payroll and staff records department spending less time on manual data entry and increased time on data validation.

We want them to spell out who are the time-returning officers and the staff in the payroll and staff records department.  We want a more detailed view.  This correspondence will come back to us when we get that information.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 2591B from Mr. Terry Sheridan, principal in planning policy and legislation in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing information relating to gender equality and the appointment of board members to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It gives detail of how many people were nominated, with 37 male nominees and 23 female nominees.  Four men and three women were appointed to the board.  The board now comprises seven men and three women in comparison with the position before 2017, when there were nine men and one woman on the board.  We will keep after this but that provides some clarification.</p> <p>  No. 2592B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE, dated 29 November 2019, providing information requested by the committee on the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Cuisle holiday resort.  We will note and publish this but we will hold over discussion.  Deputy MacSharry raised the matter of the facility in Roscommon the last day we met and we can give him an opportunity to discuss it next time.</p> <p>  No. 2596B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee regarding the post-project review of the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema project.  We will note and publish this.  It is interesting as, essentially, we were critical of the post-project review and the Department's response that a particular section in a particular Department would get this report to learn from it.  We said there is no Department-wide learning process and, far more important, there is no learning across the wider public sector from such post-project reviews.  We wrote to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to determine its role with respect to learning from these post-project reviews.  We also asked Mr. Watt about the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, which was referred to in the report but which most people had not heard of before.  He gives the detail of this and we will publish that.</p> <p>  There was a second recommendation that spending codes should include a requirement for every post-project review to have a section outlining key learning for the public service.  It was suggested that an appropriate way of communicating such learning to all public bodies be explored.  Mr. Watt's response is that the recommendation is being addressed in the forthcoming update on the public spending code, a guide to evaluation, planning and managing public investment, which is due to be published shortly subject to Government consideration and approval.  It appears that after all these years this type of process will be included in learning through the public spending code.  Where mistakes happen or learning should occur from a particular project, there should be a system-wide learning experience.  It is similar to the HSE experience with State claims.  Everybody makes a mistake, gets something wrong or does not do something the best way but people seem to do an internal report and do not tell anybody else about it.  We would like a little more openness and the correspondence is indicating we will get there.  We will keep an eye on that new code whenever it is published.  We will note and publish the correspondence, and at least it is a positive response to a recommendation that there should be learning across the public sector from these reports.</p> <p>  Next is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  We can deal with these but we will not publish them because they are from private individuals.  The first is from the Irish Road Hauliers Association, IRHA, dated 5 November 2019, responding to recent correspondence from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on its functions that have an impact on the licensed road haulage sector.  The IRHA expresses doubts about the capacity, competence and the effectiveness of the RSA in enforcing regulations and controls in the haulage sector.  The president of the organisation also states that it is not inclined to participate in meetings with the RSA.  We will note that item.  The matter has been well aired.</p></speech>

It is a transport matter but RSA issues have come before the committee.  This is another element of much previous correspondence.  We will just note it and we are not taking any further action on it.</p> <p>  No. 2573C is from an individual, dated 6 November 2019, requesting the committee to enquire about the international numbering system and procurement relating to the public services card.  The committee requested information regarding procurement following the recent meeting with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I propose we forward a link to the transcript of the meeting to the correspondent and we will make further inquiries regarding the numbering system.  At our meeting next week, we will also have the response on matters raised with the Department and we can also forward this to the correspondent.  There is information on the way from the Department about the public services card and we will have it next week.  We will inform the individual accordingly.</p> <p>  No. 2582C is from an individual and is related to the school transport scheme.  The individual has previously corresponded with the committee.  At our meeting on 21 November 2019, we agreed to request further information from the Department regarding the accounting arrangements for the scheme.  I propose to note this item for the time being until we receive the further information from the Department.  We have asked the Department whether the scheme is in surplus and the details arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General report.  When we get the reply from the Department, we can forward it to the individual.</p> <p>  No. 2584C is from an individual, dated 28 November 2019, who is making some points about the Oireachtas printing equipment, as many people have.  We have arrangements in place for more detailed information to be submitted to the committee in advance of next week's meeting.  The Secretary General and the Office of Public Works are on stand-by in the event that the committee decides it wants to meet them next Thursday afternoon.  That matter will be discussed in correspondence at a minimum next week.</p></speech>

We have already discussed this.</p><p> Next is No. 2586 from Deputy Cullinane, dated 25 November, providing details of the methodology for the application of commercial rates to Irish Water.  We discussed the global valuation regarding Irish Water at our meeting on 21 November and have requested that the Valuation Office provide further information on the rateable valuation of Irish Water apportioned to each county from when it was established to when the global valuation was determined.  We will note Deputy Cullinane&rsquo;s correspondence and wait for a response.  It is clear from the document provided to the committee by the Deputy that the apportionment is done strictly on a population basis and is not based on the facilities in a particular local authority's area.</p></speech>

The Valuation Office had no choice and had to value the water assets in those local authority areas.  Waterford was given an allocation of &euro;4.7 million, but when the allocation was based on population, that figure dropped to &euro;1.3 million.  It was a substantial cut in funding to the councils in question, and that is something of a sore point.  There were winners and losers.  Some local authorities gained substantially.  There is an unfairness, given that the figures are locked in.  Local authorities had that funding since 2013.  Now they have to increase rates to make up the difference.</p> <p>  I am seeking more information on the matter and a justification as to why the Valuation Office used this process.  It is generally used for large infrastructural utilities.</p></speech>

In 2013, Irish Water paid the rates.  From 2014 to date, it was paid by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the form of compensation to each local authority.  That is why I am seeking clarity.  My understanding is that there was a change in the legislation through the Water Services Act 2017, one that means Irish Water will pay the rates from next year onwards.  I wanted to clarify whether my understanding was right.</p></speech>

It is a policy issue.  I imagine that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had intended or hoped that Irish Water would be more commercial, but because of all the difficulties, Irish Water was not in a position to pay the rates or rates were not applied to it.  Instead, the Department paid the rates for the local authorities.  It has discontinued that payment now, leaving some local authorities high and dry and substantially down funding.</p></speech>

It was just money in, money out.  Through no fault of the local authorities, the Valuation Office had no choice but to rate the water infrastructure.  Waterford services the south east with wastewater treatment plants, but the apportionment is not based on those.  Rather, it is based on population.  The change was a kick to some local authorities.</p></speech>

I continue to be dissatisfied that we do not have oversight of Irish Water.  There were major transfers of infrastructure involved.  Somewhere in the region of &euro;11 billion in assets - some of them were liabilities - went to Irish Water.  We need to examine Irish Water's income, which is primarily from public funds.  It has an income from commercial water services, but we do not know what the collection rate is.  There are many elements that we need to examine.  Some local authorities applied significant development contributions that were used to build up those assets.  Now, they have found themselves with sizable deficits.</p> <p>  This all feeds into the question of the funding of local government.  While the issue under discussion is a specific one, we have been told numerous times that a cross-departmental group was working on local authorities' baselines, that there would be winners and losers and that the distribution of, for example, local property tax to fund local authorities would be reconfigured.  We were told by the Department earlier this year that the reconfiguration was imminent.  Even though a report has been provided, however, we are being told that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight must consider it before decisions can be made.  This is a gigantic issue in terms of the impact on local authorities' budgets, particularly in areas with rapidly growing populations.</p></speech>

This matter will be before us again, if not at next week's meeting, then in January.  We will ask the Department to clarify the matters that the Valuation Office will not be able to.  I have not seen this useful table that Deputy Cullinane has forwarded to us before.  It seems to have come from a report entitled, "AFM Report 29 Compensation Calculations - Rates Income Leakage and Irish Water rating".  Is this an Irish Water report?</p></speech>

We discussed previous correspondence from this individual on 14 November and advised the individual accordingly.  We provided details of who was at the meeting in question, as requested.  We will provide the information requested now that this correspondent has replied seeking further information. </p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 2594, is a letter from me, dated 13 November, providing a reply to a parliamentary question on carbon taxes for the information of the committee.  On foot of that, we might write to the Revenue Commissioners seeking details of the carbon tax collected under various headings in 2019.  We will request those figures as soon as possible when Revenue has the year-end figures in January.  Revenue always has the figures very shortly after the end of the year.  We will also request Revenue's projections for 2020 if we have not already asked for them.  We will discuss carbon tax collection and the use of those funds as soon as possible.  We will request those in January.  We will write to the Revenue Commissioners now asking for this information.  Revenue supplied information which was up to date at the time in response to that parliamentary question, but that was not at the year end.

This was mentioned before.  Vodafone and St. James's Hospital were fined by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, because of their failure to purchase and surrender carbon credits before the deadline.  We encountered that some time ago.  We asked the EPA's representatives about it when they appeared before the committee.  It has now appeared in the financial statement for St. James's Hospital.</p></speech>

We will note that as well as the issue of non-compliant procurement to which our attention has been drawn and the EPA fine.</p> <p>  No. 4.2 is the clear audit opinion for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The item following that, No. 4.3, is Pobal's 2018 accounts, which also feature non-compliant procurement.  We will send the standard letter to Pobal regardless of the fact that its representatives will be before us next Thursday.  Chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report examines Pobal's administration of the early learning and childcare funding programme.  That chapter is on our agenda for next week. </p> <p>  No. 4.2 is the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's 2018 financial statements, which we will discuss in public session in a few minutes.  The statement notes that the cost of superannuation entitlements is accounted for as they become available rather than in the year of entitlement, as is standard for health bodies.  We will raise that question in public session very shortly.  </p> <p>  The next matter for discussion is the committee's work programme.  Pobal's representatives will appear next Thursday to account for that organisation's expenditure and we will discuss the chapter from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report dealing with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We will decide on Thursday morning whether to have a separate session dealing with the Oireachtas printer and related matters.</p> <p>  For the first meeting in the new year on 16 January, we have pencilled in an engagement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Our second meeting will be with the Department of Education and Skills.  A meeting with the Office of Public Works has been provisionally arranged for 2 February.  There is a gap on 31 January next year, for which we will have a proposal next week.  That is as far as the work programme for next year has got.  </p> <p>  Chapter 8 of this year's report from the Comptroller and Auditor General deals with controls over humanitarian assistance funding.  Irish Aid operates a humanitarian assistant programme which falls under Vote 27, international co-operation, and is managed by the Department.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges the challenges in effectively distributing aid in such circumstances.  The total amount involved was &euro;792 million in 2018.  We can very easily examine everything that happens here in the jurisdiction but it is important to occasionally examine how taxpayer's money is spent overseas.  The difficulties in Syria and Yemen account for approximately a quarter of the total aid.  In light of that, I suggest that in the new year, if we are all here, the committee should consider a visit to one of the overseas aid projects.  We did that some years ago.  Perhaps at this point we can agree in principle to let the secretariat make some provisional arrangements.</p><p>It would be helpful if we agree, in principle, to let the secretariat make provisional arrangements.  There is no decision to go yet.  We will see how the provisional arrangements work out and they can be discussed here after the break.  We may chose to go or not to go.  As I said, it is that part of expenditure that is expended outside the State, which is worth intermittent scrutiny not every year but on occasion, and we can decide to do that.</p></speech>

Representatives of Pobal will be here next Thursday to deal with Pobal's annual financial statements.  It works for various Government Departments.  Its main Department is the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I inadvertently suggested that we would be dealing with Chapter 16 - Early Learning and Childcare Programmes, which is a matter for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The chapter in question will not be the specific item for discussion next week.  Deputies can read the chapter and anything relating to Pobal's administration of the scheme can be discussed next week.  I want to confirm that officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will not be here next week.  They can deal with childcare programme issues at a separate meeting of the committee.  Pobal, which covers a range of Departments, will be the primary focus of our examination next Thursday.  Any of the schemes it administers under any Department can be discussed at that meeting.  I just wanted to clarify that.</p></speech>

This afternoon, we will meet representatives of the HSE to discuss primary care centres and other matters.  This morning, we are dealing with 2018 financial statements of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  As we last met representatives of the board on 16 May 2019, it is timely that we are engaging with them again on the management of the children's hospital project and the associated costs of this key capital project for the State.  In the committee's sixth periodic report, we made a number of recommendations relating to and arising from our previous meetings on the 2017 accounts.  Today's meeting gives us an opportunity to review the progress that has been made in addressing these issues.</p><p>We are joined this morning by Mr. David Gunning, who is the chief executive officer of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  I think this is the first time he has attended a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He is welcome.  Mr. Gunning is accompanied by Mr. Fred Barry, who is the chairperson of the board; Mr. Jim Farragher, who is the board's finance officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, who is the board's project director; and Dr. Emma Curtis, who is the board's medical director.  We are also joined this morning by Mr. Jim Breslin, who is the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  He is accompanied by Mr. Barry McGreal, who is a principal officer in the new children's hospital unit of the Department, and Mr. Liam Morris of the Department's acute hospitals division.  Ms Pamela Carter, who is a principal officer in the Department, and Ms Anna Wallace, who is an assistant principal in the Department, are also in attendance.  We are also joined this morning by Mr. Dean Sullivan of the HSE chief strategy office and by Mr. Jim Curran, who is the head of estates with the HSE.  Mr. Paul de Freine, who is the HSE's chief architectural adviser, is also in attendance.  We are also joined this morning by Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, who is the chief executive of Children's Health Ireland.  All of the witnesses are very welcome.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to turn all mobile phones off.  That means putting them into airplane mode.  Merely putting them on silent can still interfere with the recording system.  I wish to advise all witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

When they have been commissioned, all three facilities will be operated by Children's Health Ireland, which was formally established with effect from 1 January 2019.  To date, the development board has been funded fully by State grants provided by the HSE.  In 2018, the board's expenditure amounted to &euro;127.6 million, representing an addition to the value of fixed assets recorded in the financial statements.  Total accumulated project capital costs to the end of 2018 amounted to just under &euro;260 million, inclusive of VAT.</p></speech>

In common with other public sector health bodies, the Minister requires that pension entitlements earned by employees are accounted for as they become payable.  The reporting standard requires that such obligations are recognised in the period when they are incurred.  I am satisfied that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the board&rsquo;s affairs, except for that one departure from the standard, but I am obliged to give a qualified audit opinion in the circumstances.</p><p>The financial statements were certified by me on 24 October 2019.</p></speech>

I am joined here today by Mr. David Gunning, chief officer, Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer, Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, and Mr. Phelim Devine, project director.</p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, and the two paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres - one already complete and operational at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and a second under construction at Tallaght University Hospital. </p> <p>  Following the approval of a guaranteed maximum price in December 2018, the NPHDB provided the Committee of Public Accounts in January 2019 with a breakdown of costs approved by Government for the design, build and equipping of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The agreed investment decision is &euro;1.433 billion.  The investment decision approved at the time was exclusive of residual risks as was communicated at the time of approval.  These exceptions were also set out within the PwC report published in April.  As pointed out by PwC, some of these risks are under our control and some are not.  We are actively managing those under our control while monitoring those that are not. </p> <p>  The 2018 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 24 October 2019.  The expenditure as at 31 December 2018 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;127,603,801.  An analysis of expenditure to 31 December 2017 and 2018 is included in the opening statement submitted to the committee.  </p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to give members an update on the construction progress; those of you who have had the opportunity to visit the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital &ndash; or indeed any of you that have passed by the site recently - will have seen the progress that has been achieved.  Across the 12 acre site the excavation, piling, and the structural frame to the underground basement for campus-wide facilities management, energy centre, and the 1,000 space underground carpark are nearing completion and the first window has actually been installed in the hospital.  Well over 1 million sq. ft. of slabs have been poured.  Mr. Gunning will give the committee some further detail on the construction shortly.  The outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown was handed over to our colleagues in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for operational commissioning earlier this year, and since we last met services have commenced there.    </p> <p>  Since I appeared before the committee in May, there have been a number of changes in leadership, and in relation to project governance.  Following a competitive process overseen by the Public Appointments Service, Mr. David Gunning was appointed as chief officer in September and Mr. Phelim Devine was appointed project director in October.  We have additionally added to the capabilities of the project team by engaging expertise in a number of areas.  We have reorganised the board committee structure to focus our attention on what will be our critical challenges over the coming years.  As a result of the resignation of a number of board members this year, there are vacancies on the board.  These positions were advertised via the Public Appointments Service, and we understand that a shortlist of potential candidates will be submitted to the Minister in December.             </p> <p>  We report to the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme, CHP&amp;P, steering group on a monthly basis, providing comprehensive updates on all aspects of the project, and we also report to the CHP&amp;P board. </p></speech>

There are quite a few different strands in the development of the hospital, including our colleagues in Children's Health Ireland who will operate the hospital; there is input on the ICT side from other parties and there are many issues around staffing and so on.  There is a very broad array of interests and stakeholders in the project.  There is considerable interest in the project on all fronts from the Department of Health and the HSE and that reports right up to the Minister.  There is a steering group which meets monthly to track and co-ordinate progress from all the different parties including ourselves but going far beyond ourselves and a board oversees that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for his welcome.</p> <p>  I thought, building on what Mr. Barry has pointed out here, that I would show some photographic evidence, if that can be put up on the slides here.  It is there.  We sent it in in advance just to show here.  I have a number of photographs and I would just like to talk the members of the committee through the work that is going on.</p> <p>  For an orientation point of view, the first photograph is taken from the north end, looking south towards the Dublin mountains.  One can see in this photograph, starting on the right-hand side, this U-shaped road which comes in from South Circular Road, comes all around the perimeter of the children's hospital site and eventually appears over on the left-hand side into St. James's.  That is the new access road, into the hospital and into the St. James's campus.</p></speech>

This is access for the emergency services, in and out, and all traffic, in and out.</p> <p>  This is a view of the 12-acre site.  One does not get to see a lot on this and I guess the access road is the key point.</p> <p>  I would like to move on to the next slide.  This is taken, again, looking in that same direction, but the key point here is we are starting to see a hospital emerging from the building site.  To talk about some of the areas here, one will see the area, "Concourse", that is labelled there in the centre of the photograph.  That will be, if you like, the main street up through the hospital.  One may remember that from previous presentations or models.  Again, to emphasise, that street is the length of Grafton Street, as a reference point.  Off that street, there is a multi-storey on each side.  We see on the left, going from bottom to top, we have the decontamination unit, radiology above that, critical care and then the various therapy rooms along that.  On the right, these are the fingers that one will notice if one drives by the South Circular Road.  They will be the outpatient departments.  Above that, we have cardiology, a surgical ward or other therapies, and the haematology and oncology ward on the top, and others will go on top of that.  Down on the bottom left, one will see a plant room is being constructed.  That is the location of the former access road, which has now been practically fully excavated.  That is a recent milestone that we have passed.  That plant room there will provide energy and various other services to the building.  Again, to emphasise, we are starting to see a hospital emerge from the building site.</p> <p>  If I could have the next one, please.  It is hard to see some of this in red.  Again, to show the scale, one will see the workers in the foreground there laying out reinforcing bar, rebar, in advance of a concrete pour.  Right above them, one sees B2, which is basement 2, basement 1 above that.  There is lower-ground floor, ground floor, levels 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Just beside the "L" on level 4, one starts to see some columns emerging that are the start of the supports for levels 5, 6 and 7.  An enormous amount of work has been achieved.  I will say probably the progress is not as much as we would like but we are making quite considerable progress.  That gives the scale from basement 2 all the way up to what has been done.</p> <p>  The next slide shows the view if one drives along South Circular Road.  The old entrance is where that traffic warden is on the left-hand side at the break in the timber there.  Again, one can see these three different figures that stick out.  What one cannot see because of the scaffolding is that we now have facade going up on these particular buildings.  Mr. Barry mentioned there is one window in.  Now tens of windows have gone in, even in the past week.  There is quite a lot of progress.  The outpatients are over on this side.  Gardens will be on top of this to provide a healing environment for the children and their families.  I mentioned previously the haematology and oncology there on the left, as that will go three more storeys on top of those fingers for the wards and other locations.</p> <p>  The next slide gives another view.  There is a lot of scaffolding there which is paving the way for facade, insulation, etc., that get affixed to the structure along with the windows.  That is the north block, which is probably the slower part of the build but is moving along now at a fair degree of pace.</p> <p>  The next slide shows the view from close to the offices that we occupy in Herberton, beside Fatima Luas stop.  The Luas runs along there from left to right and the other side of the fence is our view of the building.  To the left of that will be where the helipad is located and in there we see a so-called "linear park", which is a development along the Luas which provides a nice environment there for the local community.</p> <p>  On the next slide, just going into some of the mechanical and electrical detail, a lot of work has been done in this particular area and it is not all just concrete and steel.  On the left-hand side, one can see lagged pipes up towards the top with the silver coating on them.  Those are all for steam and hot water.  On the fire protection in the centre, the red pipes are the already-installed sprinkler system for the areas that have been developed.</p><p>A large number of air handling units have been installed in the level two basement, which will provide ventilation and various other services related to air quality in the entire hospital.  Basement level one is a car park and is practically complete, only requiring some lining up and finishing.  The final slide shows the orientation of the hospital from a height.  As one looks through the main street of the hospital, one can see in the distance, if one's eyesight is very good, a couple on the roof of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  This will all be enclosed eventually.  These photographs are two weeks old.  We had a presentation from the design team on Tuesday that showed even more progress than we are showing here today.  I wanted to share those photographs with the committee to give an indication of the progress made to date.  </p><p> As I went through the slides, I spoke about insulation.  The sustainability of the hospital has been raised in the past.  I wish to emphasise that the hospital is being built to the highest standard set out by the Building Research Establishment, BRE.  It will reach the "excellent" rating for energy performance and sustainability or the building energy rating, BER, A-3 standard.  This means that there will be a 60% to 70% reduction in the energy costs of this hospital in comparison to the existing hospitals being operated by CHI, which is significant.  </p><p> Mr. Barry mentioned the outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital and construction is also ongoing at Tallaght University Hospital.  The CHI unit at Connolly is open and is delivering services.  Almost 2,000 children have attended urgent care clinics and 1,000 outpatient appointments have taken place since the opening.</p><p> The images do not convey the full reality of what is going on and the scale of it.  In that context, we would be delighted to host a visit from the committee as a group or as individuals.  That invitation stands and we would welcome such a visit.</p></speech>

Mr. Barry said that some risks are under the board's control and some are not.   We are interested in the items that are not in the &euro;1.433 billion budget, which will ultimately be a cost to the taxpayer.  There seems to be a suggestion that these items are separate from the &euro;1.433 billion budget but these are the items with which we are concerned.

However, that budget is not the full budget at all because there are lots of issues outside of the board's control.  He has not said a single syllable about them.  That is important in the context of our role.  I am just making that point because I want the other members to come in.

I have a concern as well because what we got was a presentation on the build which is nothing to do with our job.  That is for the health committee.  The witnesses are before the Committee of Public Accounts and what we expect is up-to-date information on costs, with proper breakdowns.  We have many questions and I hope we will get the answers.  If we do not get those answers today, then I do not know why Mr. Barry has come in.  He and his team should have been aware of what this committee does and what it expects of witnesses who come before it.  Given what I have just heard and the questions put by the Chairman, I have concerns but I will reserve judgment until I put my questions.  I hope that when I do so, I will get an adequate response.</p></speech>

That is what we all want.  However, what we are here today to do is determine if accountability is emerging.

I hope they can zoom in on that rather than just showing us lovely pictures.</p></speech>

Note No.11 in the 2018 accounts on page 27 refers to contingent liabilities.  Those liabilities are not quantified.  Liabilities have been incurred, the value of which has yet to be determined.  This is referenced in the 2018 accounts.  We need details, fleshed out, on what those contingent liabilities are in respect of accounts signed off 11 months ago.  They are relevant to the 2018 accounts and we need to know more about them.  I am sure the witnesses can see where we are coming from.

We have said previously and I repeat that it is very likely that some of those risks will come to pass but they have not hit us as yet during this year.

Mr. Barry said that currently approximately 50% of those claims have been processed.  Most of them were the smaller claims.  The other 50% of claims are outstanding and further claims will be submitted over the next three years and beyond.  In that context, how can he say that there is a GMP when contractors' claims are being submitted on an ongoing basis and will be for years to come?  He said recently it could be 2024 or later before the final accounts are ready and we know what is what.</p></speech>

Mr. Barry made reference that the PwC had given a range for inflation, but in the minutes of the most recent meeting of the board, which is online, it says the board discussed the risks associated with inflation.</p></speech>

It was the PwC report that had given the rate of inflation at the time.  When Mr. Barry was questioned at the health committee last week, that was very evident.  The public need is not served by Mr. Barry redacting the information and the two reasons he gave have amounted to nothing.  Anyway, people can see that for themselves.</p></speech>

If one gets to four years, it is difficult.  I know certainly in the private sector, in which I am very involved at the moment, nobody will give fixed price contracts for large amounts for such a long-term contract as this one.</p></speech>

One will get fixed prices readily enough for two or three years.  With inflation rising, getting out to four years is very difficult and certainly, one will not get bigger contractors to give fixed prices for anything going beyond that without an inflationary adjustment for a project lasting seven or eight years.  I do not think one would get that in a public or private project.</p></speech>

The contractor can put in endless claims.  There is no restriction on the amount a contractor can actually come looking for.  If one has a contract in place, as we have, which covers the vast majority of the costs out there, then it is not as though the guaranteed maximum price bears no relationship to the end costs or that billions of euro of extra costs can arise; they cannot.  As I have said before, the contractor will make claims, we will resist them and it will be a surprise if some of those claims do not stick before the jobs is over.</p></speech>

With that response, it is fair to say that the &euro;1.7 billion is aspirational rather than a reality.</p> <p>  At the committee last week, Mr. Barry said that some contractors tend to approach claims differently.  Some make claims that can be managed and substantiated, hence 50% of claims are done while another 50% are not done.  Mr. Barry said that other contractors would make more inflated claims.  This is what Mr. Barry said at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  What record has the contractor BAM in this regard?  Given the use of this particular procurement model for the first time ever in a public build, I assume that the board would have examined this at an early stage.  </p></speech>

This is not just a children's hospital matter, it is a more general matter.  I am aware that some of the relevant Departments are working on this issue currently and may come up with an approach that will allow the purchasing agencies to reflect and include consideration of past performance a little better than can be done at the moment.  Right now, under the rules that are there, essentially if contractors meet the pre-qualification criteria, one cannot stop them tendering.  If they tender and their tender is the most economically advantageous, then they have to be awarded the contract.  There is a challenge there, certainly.</p></speech>

This was done in 2015 and they were pre-qualified around the end of 2015.  We tendered the project in 2016.  On the criteria against which they were assessed, past performance was not one of the criteria.  Obviously, financial capability, record and experience were some of the criteria.  My understanding of public procurement, which complied with EU rules at that stage in 2015, is that one cannot preclude a contractor from tendering for a project based on their past performance in the context of relationship or claims history, as Mr. Barry has already outlined</p></speech>

Different parishes or locations around the country or different ETBs could be involved.  Deputy Catherine Murphy will be aware of one project in my constituency and in her county in respect of which references were granted and a person who was not short-listed was not given an opportunity to comment on the adverse reference they were given.  They took the case to court and, because they were not given an opportunity to comment on what they felt was not a good recommendation from a previous employer, the tendering had to start again.  What this demonstrates to me is that, as far as the public sector is concerned, the Department of Education and Skills has a budget, builds &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million worth of schools and has a practice of getting references from previous employers that engaged those contracts.  I am now surprised to hear that while that happens on school projects, the Department of Health does not seem to know anything about it when it comes to the children's hospital or does not even know whether that practice exists in the public sector.

If there are weaknesses on the State side, it is not the fault of the contractor that puts in for tender.  If it wins in conciliation or in a court case, it is legally entitled to that and cannot be prevented from future work.  It has done everything, as it sees it, legally and properly.  The onus then is on public bodies contracting to make sure that their systems are tight and close, that decisions are made in a timely way and that processes are followed.

They may have been.  I need to go back and clarify that as part of the pre-qualfication process Mr. Curran talked about, that cannot be taken into account.  We have just had that discussion.  The other bit of information I would like to add is that the process we undertook through pre-qualification and the tender process was fully compliant with both public rules and European rules on procurement.  We independently audited that to that effect as well.</p></speech>

I refer to what was said about past performance in the private sector.  Whoever said it laughed straight away.  Of course past performance comes into it, but not in the public sector.</p> <p>  My next question is about delays.  Last week in the health committee Mr. Barry gave the impression that there were fairly minor delays with the build, but when he was pressed later on he mentioned there was a deadline to remove and replace a road that was causing a delay.  Can he give us a bit of information about that and any other delays?</p></speech>

When I was first before this committee and indeed the health committee, around May or so of last year, the main contractor was behind schedule by weeks.  I said at the time that it was well within the contractor's compass to make up that time.  I said last week and I will say again to this committee that it is unfortunately the case that the contractor has not made up that time - not only that, but it has slipped further weeks.  As an example of where this would show up on a milestone in work to date, the removal of the old road that crossed the centre of the site was a milestone in the ongoing activity.  Its removal took place a couple of months later than it would have taken place had it been done per the contracted programme.  The work going on at the moment is primarily the pouring of concrete: the concrete frame, the columns, the slabs and so on.  There is other work going on around the site as well.</p></speech>

I was curious because what Mr. Barry said at the health committee about minor delays did not tally with what Mr. Reid, I think, from the HSE said.  There were media reports going back to last September that an internal memo in the HSE had stated that capital project for the new children's hospital is facing delays to the construction programme which could impact critical timelines if mitigation measures are not taken.  I presume the NPHDB has taken those stringent mitigation measures.  I ask Mr. Barry to outline to the committee what they are.</p></speech>

What we are doing about that is we are working very closely with the contractor on the details of the programme.  Just to step back a little bit, at the time of contract the contractor puts forward a programme scheduling the works as to how he is going to get from the start of the construction to the end within the timeline set out in the contract.  As the work unfolds there are normally changes to that programme.  Some things get ahead and some things get behind but in everything things are rarely done exactly in accordance with that programme.  The contractor comes up with new programmes and rescheduling of the work.  The contractor is developing new programmes at the moment and we are working very closely with him to ensure that those programmes are consistent with the contract.</p></speech>

The Contractors understand the contractual relationships better than the NPHDB, allowing them to exploit opportunities to increase prices."  Is that not more or less saying they can make buck eejits out of the entire board?  Have they made fools of the board?  I have cited what the report refers to as one of the controllable risks.</p></speech>

Before I put questions to our witnesses I want to make the following clear.  I do not like witnesses taking a casual approach to the Committee of Public Accounts and getting irritated when questions are put.  I very much hope that there will be a step change as the meeting progresses because we can stay here and ask a second, third and fourth round of questions, if needs be.</p> <p>  I am also disappointed that we have not got additional information on what we received last year, which is a point that the Chairman made at the start of the meeting.  We are here to hold the witnesses to account in terms of governance, accountability and spend, and the control mechanisms that are in place.  I will concentrate on all of that.  I will go under the bonnet to see what is actually happening and, hopefully, get responses to my questions.  If I do not get responses then we will stay for a second and third round of questions because this is a very important issue.  We are here to do a job and we must do it.</p> <p>  I shall start with the guaranteed maximum price.  Mr. Barry said, in response to Deputy Munster, that the price of &euro;1.433 billion is guaranteed in the context of the agreed framework and contract and there are residual risks that are outside of that.  The &euro;1.433 billion that is guaranteed is only what is guaranteed in terms of what is within the framework of the contract.  Is that correct?      </p></speech>

What the public expect and hear when one says there is a "guaranteed maximum price" is that not a cent more above the &euro;1.433 billion will be spent because we have a guaranteed maximum price.  When most lay people hear the words "guaranteed" and "maximum" they will think that is the price and the amount will not go beyond that but that is not the case.  Can we at least accept as a start that the guaranteed maximum price is a qualified maximum price and that it is possible if not likely that the price will be higher than &euro;1.433 billion?</p></speech>

Additional cost claims that can be made by the developer were mentioned.  A developer may make a claim but it does not necessarily mean they will be paid so one has to go into a negotiation, there will be a barter and they may or may not be paid.  I assume that is what Mr. Barry was talking about.  There are residual risks and because of them there may well be additional cost claims.  If that is the case, if Mr. Barry agrees with that, can he outline the areas in which there is the possibility of a risk in terms of additional costs?</p></speech>

I would just add to it because the contractor's claims are not restricted to what we would call residual risks.

We should have the information.  I do not see any issue with it.  If there is to be an additional cost, my estimate is it will be approximately &euro;40 million.  I am not an expert but it is my estimate in light of what inflation will be.</p> <p>  I will ask a question rather than giving my view, which Mr. Barry might consider unfair.  Is it the case that the minutes were redacted and he does want to give us the information because he does not want a headline to result from a meeting of the committee to the effect that the cost will higher than &euro;1.433 billion?  It goes back to the issue the Chairman raised earlier, namely, that we are not getting any additional information because there is a preciousness over the cost.  For understandable reasons, the costs have escalated and the board discussed the matter.  We have a responsibility to probe the information.  We have a version of the minutes that has been redacted in respect of what is clearly either another cost overrun or an additional cost, yet Mr. Barry is not in a position to tell us the figure.  I do not know why and I can only surmise.  Is it because he does not want, at this point, the public and the committee to know there could be an additional cost of at least &euro;40 million for construction inflation?</p></speech>

First, it is already in the public domain, and we referenced the figures in the PwC report, that if inflation is over 4%, there will be extra costs over the &euro;1.433 billion.  I reiterate that inflation this year is running at about 7%.  It is an absolute certainty that we will pay extra money on foot of that inflation.  If inflation runs at 7% for the life of the project, the total additional cost from inflation will be in the order of &euro;50 million.  If it is higher, it will be more, while if it is less, it will be less.  There is no suggestion on our part that there is not going to be an additional cost from inflation over the &euro;1.433 billion.  If I have given the impression that we think there will not be a cost through inflation, I did not mean to give that impression.</p></speech>

Part of our considerations at the moment are around how much we will pay for this year.  We have a pretty good idea in that regard but there will be some negotiations around it.  For the committee's interest, assuming inflation stays at 7% this year, depending on how much is paid in invoices at the end of the year and the exact figure, the additional cost for 2019 will be in the order of &euro;2 million or &euro;2.2 million.  We will not have the exact figures until we get the indices, which will come out-----</p></speech>

I do not take minutes of those meetings.  The records that are kept of those meetings are kept by the civil servants supporting the Minister.

Surely from a good governance perspective, there will be somebody present to take minutes of the meetings.  At the meetings, does Mr. Barry discuss the potential of increased costs in terms of some of the residual risks or reasons there may be additional costs?

I am sure all those issues arise but I am asking whether Mr. Barry has ever had a discussion with the Minister at any of the meetings about the possibility of additional costs and the fact that there are risks.

The question arose last week about the recent meeting in November.  There is a record of that meeting.  It is on the file.  We record the meeting.  There was toing and froing as to whether the record was a minute.  A minute is usually signed off at a subsequent meeting and everybody agrees on it.  We do not do that at all the meetings where Ministers meet people.  We take our own record.  We place it on the file and that suffices for-----</p></speech>

That is a credible answer.  I have no difficulty with the answer but the difficulty concerns where there are additional costs.  We should remember the history of this project.  There were additional costs, and questions were asked about when Ministers knew or did not.  There was no suggestion that the Ministers had done anything wrong.  Let me outline what creates suspicion and difficulties.  Let us just say there are additional costs, that they have been discussed at meetings with the Minister and that a future Committee of Public Accounts is looking for notes of minutes and is told there were none, or that there was a note that was not a minute-----</p></speech>

It would be better for the Minister.  How many times has the HSE found itself in a position where there were difficulties over record-keeping and minutes, and what was in them and what was not?  If clear minutes are taken, there is no issue.</p></speech>

The Deputy will have seen over the course of this project that there has been no lack of record-keeping.  We published all of that.  It went to PwC.  It showed the timeline of all the escalations and the information.  There is a record of the most recent meeting too.</p></speech>

It relates to what Deputy Munster said earlier.  The BAM report is in some respects quite damning regarding the board.  I do not refer to Mr. Barry; I refer to the previous incarnation of the board.  I acknowledge he said there have been a number of changes.  It is stated that the contractors - in this case, BAM - understand the contractual relationships better than the development board, allowing them to exploit opportunities to increase prices.  It is quite incredible that this is what PwC arrived at.  I would like Mr. Barry's or Mr. Breslin's understanding of it.  My layman's reading of it is that there may have been a lack of expertise in regard to how the contract works and cost controls.  If there are many potential additional claims, people are needed who have the experience and knowledge to address them.  PwC's view is that the contractors understand the contractual relationships better than the development board.</p></speech>

I know that the development board has substantially enhanced its claims-management process and has brought expertise into the board to support it in that regard.  It has stronger control systems in place post-PwC than would have been in place at the time.</p></speech>

I have one or two questions arising from the opening statement.  One of the things we do is try to decode language or spot things that may imply something that one expects to mean something different.  I have two questions in that regard.  The first is on the Blanchardstown facility.  It was handed over to CHI.  Since we last met, services have commenced there.  When will they be fully operational?  Knowing that will give us some sort of an idea as to how the children's hospital will work when fully operational.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.  This is the first time representatives of CHI have been before the committee.</p><p> Children's Health Ireland is a State body established under the Children's Health Act 2018 and a section 38 organisation under the health Act, which means it is commissioned to provide services under the HSE via an annual service arrangement.  Children's Health Ireland commenced operation in January 2019.  Our main role is to provide services to approximately 336,000 children who turn up to our paediatric services at Crumlin Hospital, Temple Street hospital, Tallaght Hospital and the new facility at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown which opened in July.  These four services operate as one organisation, led by one board and one management team.  We provide services through 4,000 staff, working through 39 different clinical specialties, to the sickest children of 25% of the population and all of the children in the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

There are two major elements to it, namely, outpatients and urgent care.  Outpatients is fully operational, Monday to Friday, 9.a.m. to 6 p.m, providing general paediatric services.  It is building up its services incrementally and it is working very well.  In regard to urgent care, we have had challenges in recruiting emergency medicine consultants.  When the facility opened, we had seven new emergency medicine consultants, which is a great increase, but due to unplanned leave and an inability to find locums, we could not expand the opening hours beyond Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The facility closes at 8 p.m. but it takes approximately three hours to clear the department of patients.</p></speech>

We have a pipeline of consultants coming in over 2020.  When they come on board, we will be able to expand the service.  Between now and then, what we are trying to do is increase the hours-----</p></speech>

Many of the issues in regard to this facility are matters for the Joint Committee on Health.  I am trying to deal with matters relevant to this committee.  We are building a hospital that is to be completed on a particular date from the point of view of BAM and other contractors walking off the site and the hospital being handed over.  The operation of this facility gives us some idea of the likely challenges of getting that hospital fully operational.  I will move on.</p> <p>  The second issue arising from the opening statement is the updates on all aspects of project delivery.  Controlling costs is critically important.  A lengthy list of technicians is involved in the project, including quantity surveyors, architectural technicians, valuation officers and portfolio planners.  I would like Mr. Gunning to elaborate on the role of each of these professionals and if that role changes over time.  We are all interested in containing cost overruns or even reducing some costs.  What are the prospects of that happening?</p></speech>

The Chairman made an interesting point about the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board when he said, "They go way when the development is over."  The organisation has been set up for a specific purpose and it is staffed by a wide range of contractors and consultants on a particular basis, including a design team of over 200 from whom we purchase services.  We have people closer to the organisation who are part of the national paediatric hospital organisation.  These are known as constructive management services and they provide an array of different services on site.  We also buy in specialist services from others.  Deputy Murphy is correct that there is a lengthy list of urban planners, healthcare planners, architects, building engineers, civil and structural engineers and so on.</p> <p>  In the design team we have, predominantly, a large number of architects.  BDP is the lead architectural firm.  It also provides what is know as the employers' representative function.  We have quantity surveyors from Linesight, who measure costs and do various other activities.  The ARUP company provides mechanical and electrical, primarily design verification, services and supervises implementation of that on site.  We then have an organisation called OCSE Civil and Structural Work looking at all the structural design, the concrete, the steel and the pulling together of the whole thing.  They are the range of services within the project.</p></speech>

It is well staffed but it is pretty lean.  We do not have any surplus staff.  In terms of administration, there is administration in all of the key areas but it is around contract administration and claims administration.  As we are engaged in processes that are legal or quasi-legal in terms of conciliation and arbitration, it is really important that there is excellent record keeping and we are in a position to find information.  We have strengthened the team and our software support and so on to enable that.</p></speech>

Leaving aside building inflation and other issues arising from design changes, the project is on course to complete at a cost of &euro;1.43 billion.  In terms of this table, are there variations from what was presented last year?  If the witnesses do not have that information to hand, they might provide the committee with an updated table of the profile of changes at a later date.</p></speech>

We could then see where changes are taking place.  In respect of our periodic report, there were 11 recommendations from the PwC report.  Have they all been implemented at this stage?</p></speech>

Some of the recommendations are broader and perhaps the Secretary General might want to speak to those.  The development board has implemented all the recommendations made that are addressed to us.</p></speech>

Approvals were given for those and recruitment done.  The two recommendations that relate to major capital projects in general, not specifically the national children's hospital, are relevant to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is on the record as saying it is taking them into account in how it is going to revise the public spending code.  I think the Chairman referenced the fact that they have updated the committee on that and expect to conclude it shortly.  As an addendum to that, I also identified earlier that as soon as we have that, at the same time as the public spending code concludes, we would intend to revise our overarching governance structures to make sure we are fully in line with the public spending code.  That will streamline the bit above the development board in Children's Health Ireland, which people have commented on.  I think they are fair comments.</p></speech>

It engaged external expertise and technical support, according to today's briefing paper, and &euro;35.1 million has been invested across the workstreams.  There is long-term investment there.  That was between 2016 and 2019.  Given that Children's Health Ireland has not employed many of the people who will run the services in Blanchardstown, is this work concluded?  Is it delayed by virtue of the fact that Children's Health Ireland does not have the staffing fully in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#T00900"><p>Again to give the context for that, I outlined what we do on a day-to-day basis, which is delivering services across four sites in Dublin.  In addition to that, we are actually client to the project.  For the last six years, we have been working with the development board inputting into the design of the hospital.  We have inputted into the business cases and the ICT that is required to deliver this hospital.  When the business case was approved by Government in 2017, we clearly indicated that we had to bring on expertise to take on the client role to support the design and development of the hospital.  What I have included in those costs are, for example, we have set up a new entity, Children's Health Ireland.  We have had to dissolve the boards of two other voluntary hospitals and dissolve those organisations.  All of the legal work and what we call the pre-commencement assessment and review process make up some of those costs.  That is expertise in mergers, for example, and legal expertise that we would not have in Children's Health Ireland.  Like the development board, these are short-term initiatives that we had to do.  Besides providing the services to children - I appreciate that the work we are doing is challenging and we badly need this hospital because of that - we have to integrate the three children's hospitals.  When we looked at major projects like this, there are not many in the world that merge three hospitals and then move them into a new hospital.  If we do not get the integration correct, there will be challenges around that.  We are working with the staff to get our clinical and corporate processes aligned and to align how we actually operate.  This investment has been around standardising our models of care and a significant amount of it has been around ICT.  That is the other remit we have.  We are implementing projects now in the children's hospitals as single instances that we move into the children's hospital.  It is investment that we need to make now to make it happen.</p></speech>

The vast majority of people will understand that money needs to be spent on that side and on the physical side.  The greatest disappointment is the delay in the facility becoming fully operational.  What work is Children's Health Ireland doing to minimise the delay in opening the new national children's hospital or can that even be done at this stage?  I know it is a few years away but clearly there is a learning curve here in respect of this delay.  What is Children's Health Ireland doing and what can be done?</p></speech>

This integration is about merging hospitals and we know from national and international experiences that this can be a challenge.  Something like 75% of mergers do not achieve success.  Very early on, we were working on the process to be commenced as a single organisation, which we have just done this year.  A significant amount of investment was to make that happen.  When we opened up Connolly it afforded us an opportunity to have, for example, a single, unique identifier for all of the patients in Children's Health Ireland.  That means that the patients can go to any of our facilities and the staff can see their records.  It is a really important safety issue and also it is a really important matter when we are under pressure.  We are now actually moving the patients and the staff around to where the resources are.  We have invested-----</p></speech>

It has already been demonstrated by our waiting lists.  The Deputy is right that we have long waiting lists.  For example, general paediatrics is one of the services in which we have invested.  They have developed new ways of working and are now using an automated system to look at their patients.  In the last six months, we have reduced our general paediatrics waiting list by 35%.  That has been done because the paediatricians are working across the cities and we are managing-----</p></speech>

The most important part of it, I would say, is that we have some long waiters and we started with them first.  Our long waiting lists, meaning anything over 12 months, which is the target set by the HSE and which should be shorter, we have managed to reduce that by 65% in five months.  The reason we have done it is that we have new ways of working and new facilities open.</p><p>That is really important because these new ways of working are-----</p></speech>

I acknowledge the experience of Deputy O'Connell and other families, for which we apologise.  We are dealing with a significant pressure arising from the flu and respiratory illness winter season.  Without the unit at Connolly hospital, it would have been an awful lot worse.  That facility has allowed us to decompress some of the other emergency departments and move patients to wherever there are better facilities.  We have also been able to move staff.  That was possible because we have the same systems in place across the hospitals, so the staff are familiar with the set-up.  In addition, we have an IT system which shows where all the beds are in each hospital.  Our staff are now working in an integrated way.  The important point to emphasise is that it takes a lot of time to plan and put things in place, but it means we will be ready to get working when we move to the new hospital.</p></speech>

They seem to have been misadvised on that point.  The witnesses are here for the purposes of accountability.  We do not need to see photographs of a construction site.

We want moneys to be used efficiently so that so everyone can access a public health service.  That is why we are here.  The background to this is before my time but I understand the previous Committee of Public Accounts was assured that what happened before would never happen again.  Not alone has it happened again but it is just as bad as the first time.  I understand &euro;30 million or &euro;35 million was written off on the previous occasion and now we are dealing with the same issue again.  I do not need photographs of construction sites but I do need to know the cost of the overall project and when mistakes are made and that the witnesses are learning from those mistakes.  It is totally unacceptable to have that level of spending on the services of a public relations company.  It is an absolute waste of taxpayers' money.  The witnesses are here for the purposes of accountability.  Our work should be done in a polite way and none of our questions should be put in a personalised fashion.  However, the witnesses must be held to account at this committee and every committee before which they appear.  They do not need to consult a public relations company for that purpose.  There is something seriously wrong if they are resorting to that and, in this instance, they were ill advised on the question of producing photographs.</p> <p>  Mr. Gunning has undertaken to provide the committee with a breakdown of spending under the heading of communications and community engagement.  Spending on other professional fees was &euro;793,000 in 2018, which is a huge jump as far as I can see.  What does that expenditure include?  Does it include fees for external bodies?</p></speech>

Each of the three children's hospitals, as independent voluntary hospitals up until December of this year, had its own associated foundation.  As part of our merger and integration of the three hospitals, the foundations have agreed to merge into one foundation.  Speaking personally, I was delighted with that because I was the chief executive of a hospital - Tallaght Hospital - with three foundations.  That was a positive change.  The foundations were independent charities, but they were affiliated.  The new foundation's sole purpose is to raise funds for us.  Internationally, children's hospitals have a good reputation in that regard.</p></speech>

We already have this facility in Crumlin Hospital.  We have a 20-bed unit that has been run for the past 15 years and is a critical part of services for a children's hospital.  We also have another facility near Temple Street.  The charity is a part of a global network of charities that support family accommodation in children's hospitals.  We mapped out how many beds we required and the charity has identified the increased requirements.  There is a waiting list of families at the moment.

We removed that about four years ago.  If one is a private patient in a public hospital, even if one is not in a single room, it is a chargeable event and one can be charged for that.  That is the position as of today.</p> <p>  Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health know that policy will change, going forward.  Sl&aacute;intecare has said we should remove private practice from public hospitals.  We have commissioned a group, led by Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, that has issued and published its report which is under consideration.  The Minister has talked of his interest in taking an initiative, with consultants, to try to address the de Buitl&eacute;ir recommendations.  That is likely to change the mix of private practice in our public hospitals, if not entirely eliminate it.  The important thing is that the outpatient rooms that are being talked about as potentially available for private work are absolutely the same as all the other outpatient rooms.  If they are not needed for private work, they will be used for public patients.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell and I had a slight feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  We went around the houses last week but there are many more players today.  To be fair to Mr. Gunning and Mr. Barry, they have taken on a poisoned chalice, in a way.</p><p>Some of the questions at the Joint Committee on Health, especially to Mr. Gunning about his history and where he was before this, were probably a tad unfair.  I will not go anywhere near that.  Sometimes the most obvious question is that one that needs to be asked, so my first question is not to Mr. Barry or Mr. Gunning, but to Dr. Curtis, Mr. Devine, Mr. Breslin, Mr. McGreal, Mr. Farragher, Mr. Morris, Mr. Sullivan and Ms Hardiman.  "Reeling in the Years" is my favourite programme on television because it is a quick snapshot of a year in 25 minutes, with good music, usually, though not all the time.  I am showing my age but someone here is older than me.  We all know that the big issue here is the overrun in the costs of the hospital.  All of the people I have named are here to do a job.  Today is 5 December 2019, and could be played out on "Reeling in the Years" in the future, hence the link.  Is there anything that any of the witnesses want to say to us and to the public watching?  Are there any concerns that they would like to put on the record of the committee or to present to the public?  Is there anything at all in what they know at this point regarding concerns about the spend on or timelines for this hospital?  Do any of the witnesses have anything they would like to share with us?  Now is the time to say so.  If they do not say so, it is date-stamped.  If anyone I have referred to would like to share anything, please tell us now.</p></speech>

The other risk I flagged up, which was picked up in response to some of the questions from Deputy Catherine Murphy, relates to the staffing of the existing site.  That is small in comparison to the staffing of the new hospital.  We are seeking to mitigate all of those risks but those are the risks I would put on the table.</p></speech>

We have talked about them at the Joint Committee on Health and it has been publicly aired.  I will open this up to Mr. Barry and Mr. Gunning but, pardon the pun, they have probably been interrogated on this enough.  Does anybody else want to say anything publicly to Ireland that is not known, that people are not aware of, or any concerns that they need to air?</p></speech>

We know all of that.  It has been aired publicly.  Does anyone have anything else?  No.  That is fine.</p> <p>  I asked at last week's health committee meeting about additional claims for the project, so I presume Mr. Gunning or Mr. Barry will have an answer today.  They outlined how just over &euro;1 million to date has been paid in extra charges.  Correct me if I am wrong because this is from memory since the Official Report of that meeting is not up yet.  That was approximately 50% of overall claims.  The witnesses acknowledged that smaller claims are quicker than larger claims, which is obvious to most people.  I asked how much of the claims were based on the Connolly site rather than the main site and the witnesses were to come back to me but they have not yet.  Presumably they have the answer to that.</p></speech>

Anyone who really interrogates this document, particularly the most revealing pages - 26, 27 and 28 - which are about design, will see that.  On the previous occasion, Mr. Barry and Mr. Gunning told me that the design of the hospital was more or less complete when the GMP was signed off.</p></speech>

I did not on that day because I thought I would research it a bit more, which is the appropriate thing to do.

According to this report, &euro;27 million extra was paid to design companies, which is 63% more than what was agreed.  In any correlation if we go from the GMP to the IFC cost - and I am sorry for all of the jargon but people who know this know what I am talking about and there are arguments with regard to a significant change that would have a massive impact on the costs - a key signal is the fact that 63% more than what was expected had to be paid for the design consultants who have designed the hospital to date in the first place.  The correlation indicates that the IFC cost is way off.  If there is a 63% differential, it would in indicate that we are heading for a big problem here.</p></speech>

At the end of 2018, the design team submitted claims to us in terms of additional services it felt it undertook, or was about to undertake, associated with the project when compared to when it tendered for the job back in 2014.  The design team tendered for the job in 2014 and, through its lifescale, the job was supposed to finish in 2020 to 2021.  There are entitlements for the design team on prolongation in accordance with the standard contract.  We entered into a conciliation with the design team at the end of 2018.  We appointed a conciliator.  We stated our position and it stated its position and an agreement was made.  In terms of what was agreed, the design team recovered &euro;24.5 million, including VAT, or &euro;19.9 million, excluding VAT.  There were two categories in this.  One category was variations it was entitled to as set out in the contract.  These were prolongation of stages 2C and 3 up to the time of GMP and stage 4 because of the construction programme-----</p></speech>

I asked my next question last week and I hope Mr. Barry has had a week to reflect on it because transparency is an issue.  The board is changing and that is fair enough.  Fair play to anybody who is volunteering for this job, as I said on the that occasion.  I thank them because it is not an easy role to jump into.  In fairness to Mr. Barry jumping into this role, when he got the phone call, he had to think about it for a while.  This is a very important question and that is the reason he sat down with Q4 PR but I will get on to that in a while.  Is the board strengthened or weakened by the fact the head of procurement in Ireland is no longer on it?  I am not asking about the person but the role.  Is the board strengthened or weakened by the fact the head of procurement in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who is the most senior person in Ireland when it comes to procurement, is no longer on it?  On the previous occasion we were told much of the procurement is out of the way and while I am not sure whether I accept it, I accept it as an answer.  I am not going to dwell on this.  Is the board strengthened or weakened by the fact the role is no longer part of it?</p></speech>

He is the deputy director general and head of strategy and planning.  Future capital investment is generally planned five years ahead.  This year a three-year plan has been released ten months late.  Can Mr. Sullivan say on the record whether the delivery time of any capital project related to the HSE anywhere in Ireland been impacted by the spend on the hospital?  That is my second last question. </p><p> My last question is for the chairman of the board.  I asked this at our last meeting but I wish to put it on the record.  The minutes of a meeting on 3 April state that a presentation was made by the design team to the finance and construction committee.  It was reported that provisional findings had identified additional monetary risk.  I asked for the presentation and for the minutes of the procurement subcommittee on 29 April.  Mr. Barry said he would not supply us with the complete report but he would redact it and supply the minutes.  They have not yet been received.  Can he please provide them?  Those two questions were directed to Mr. Sullivan.</p><p> In response to Deputy Connolly the witnesses said they would outline the scope of the work of Q4 Public Relations.  I wish to echo that request.  The documents the witnesses supply must predate today.  They cannot be written up now. </p></speech>

My support has been based on the recommendation of a tri-located model with the capacity to include a maternity hospital and an adult hospital on the site.  This will mean children can be born and transferred while women who have babies do not have to be separated from them.  All the evidence that has been presented to me, mostly through Professor Hardiman-----</p></speech>

We will give Ms Hardiman an honorary title.  Once I committed myself to studying all the information I was convinced that this was the right place to put the hospital.  I was given a document at the Oireachtas Committee on Health about four years ago.  It stated that about 75% of the patient cohort came from the greater Dublin area.  I do not care what trouble I get into.  I cannot get into any more trouble than last week.  Anyone who tries to reverse out of the hospital's current position is really doing a disservice to the children of Ireland.  Despite some media reports, I have been a user of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin for ten years.  I have been an inpatient and a day patient.  I have used the cardiac facilities in the medical tower, the accident and emergency department and everything bar the oncology unit, touch wood.  I am fully aware of the challenges children are facing.  This is about children.  I do not see this as a poisoned chalice but as a wonderful opportunity to deliver something that successive Governments, boards and groups have failed to deliver.  I recognise the huge challenges.  I have sat in so many meetings about the children's hospital.  I understand that we need to get value for taxpayers' money and we need the best possible hospital for our children, but the constant pushback against providing this only serves to damage outcomes for the children of Ireland.  While our role is to interrogate this process, when any of us criticise the progress of the hospital we have to be very conscious of how much we needed it when it was first mooted.  Perhaps Ms Hardiman could outline this.  Consider the changes that have taken place at Temple Street Children's University Hospital and Crumlin.  We still have not delivered.  I remember seeing surgical pods being installed at Crumlin ten years ago and thinking it was a waste as we were going to build a hospital.  Ten years later we do not have that hospital.  For the record, I would like to encourage the board to keep going to get this delivered.  However everyone should consider the children who have missed out due to the persistent delays that have plagued this project.</p> <p>  Turning to the Children's Health Ireland, CHI, it is very positive that there has been a 35% reduction in general paediatric waiting lasts in the last six months.  Can we replicate that over the next six months or is that just a push to the start line?  Similarly, there has been a reduction of 65% in the 12-month waiting list.  Can we keep pushing in that direction or have we reached a saturation point?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.882" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#Z01400"><p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to elaborate on that.  Our board has taken this very seriously.  With due credit to the previous hospitals, we tend to stay within our limits financially.  We do our best around safety issues, which are really important.  Access is one area in which we must make improvements.  Our overall waiting list for outpatients has reduced by 8% this year.  The biggest reduction has been in the number waiting for longer than 12 months.  That has decreased by 12%.  This does not just apply to general paediatrics.</p> <p>  As I was saying, general paediatrics is the one specialty to be based at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown in which we have made early investment into new ways of working.  Staff there work virtually.  There are virtual triage clinics and patients are moved to the next available slot.  There is central referral so a patient is not referred to a particular doctor.  Whoever has the shortest list gets the next patient.  It is a much more efficient way of working.  Clinics have now been set up at Connolly that do not need paper.  If the patient has been in another hospital, his or her records are scanned and sent over.  We do not have vans of paper going from place to place.  This new way of working needed investment.</p> <p>  I can assure the committee that we have been successful in reducing our waiting lists through initiatives with the HSE.  We are definitely starting to make an impact.  The facility in Tallaght will be opening next year.  To be quite honest, our biggest issue is the constraints of the facilities.  We are trying to implement some strategic initiatives between now and 2023 so that we do not come into this hospital with long waiting lists.  We want to start successfully and be able to implement the services that the children and families of Ireland deserve, as Deputy O'Connell says.  Our staff deserve to be working in those facilities as well. </p></speech>

CHI is streamlining practices so that staff can be transferred to the new hospital without a fuss about name tags, pay packets or practices.</p></speech>

The issue of parents' rooms constantly comes up.  All rooms outside of the intensive care unit and the high dependency unit have facilities for parents.  On the Crumlin road there is a charitable organisation providing facilities where parents or other children can stay.  For the benefit of people who have never been in that situation, parents need to wash clothes, feed their children and feed themselves.  I have never used Ronald McDonald House because I am based in Dublin, but the facilities there are absolutely essential to supporting families who come from further away so they can live their lives without incurring huge hotel expenses.</p><p>This might be a question for the Department but is there any issue with Children's Health Ireland being a section 38 organisation in terms of the committee's access to its accounts in the future?</p></speech>

There was an option at one stage of purchasing a single electronic health record, EHR, for the whole country.  The children's hospital, as we all know, has many unique features.  Children's Health Ireland will procure an EHR for the children's hospital but we will build linkages to the national project and how that gets rolled out so that there is compatibility.  For example, the individual identifiers will be the same and they will use the same standards and so on, but the purchase and deployment will be separate from the children's hospital deployment.</p></speech>

My understanding from what Mr. Devine said is that the increase was to get more design because it precedes the GMP and the detailed drawings for where the plugs and cables go.  It is not really the case that it was a pure increase but the costs increased by 63% to get more design.  There was almost an impression given that it was a waste or nothing was got in return for the increase.  Perhaps that could be clarified so that an incorrect headline does not go out from here.</p></speech>

The first aspect was that a large part of the &euro;15 million cost I talked about was for the prolongation.  We have our design team for an extra two years.  The numbers were mentioned and we are talking about 100 to 200 people.  Those prolongation periods happened during the intense period between going to tender and then finalising the GMP.  They had 200 people working on the job for an extra six months.  When we get to this stage, which is all about the construction and implementation, there are probably over 100 people working for another year or year and a half on that.  That is where most of the cost was generated.  The timeline of the project has extended out for different reasons.</p> <p>  The second aspect was the &euro;9.5 million cost.  As a development board, taking our experience of the GMP and what is in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, we strengthened certain aspects of the design team and the capability within that team.  We decided, after looking at other large-scale projects internationally, that we needed additional people from the design team checking quality on site, more than we had allowed for in 2014.  There was an impact there in that the building control regulations were only in their infancy in 2014 when we tendered the job.  This is a highly complex project.  There are 6,000 rooms, every one of which has medical services in it.  We need to do a huge amount of assurance and checking to ensure our contractors complete the job and commission the hospital to the right standards so we hand over a fit-for-purpose hospital to Children's Health Ireland.</p></speech>

Between 25% and 40% of its procurement is non-compliant.  The committee deals with its procurement every year.  It tops the list in terms of non-compliance with procurement rules, as the Comptroller and Auditor General will confirm.  Some 24% of procurement within a sample he took last year was non-compliant.  I say that as a warning that Mr. Barry should not rely on the HSE in respect of compliance.  If he, as chairman of the board, is looking for people to advise on complying with procurement rules, the HSE is not necessarily the right choice.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable for the committee to have to wait nine or ten months after year end before it can see the financial statements for last year of an organisation as sensitive as this.  I ask that the accounts for 2019 be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of February and that the Comptroller and Auditor General give them priority.  I cannot dictate the workload of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I acknowledge that the appropriation accounts must be done but the HSE and the NTMA are given priority.  Similar priority should be given to the largest capital project in the State.  I do not know who will be here this time next year, but the Oireachtas should not have to wait until October of next year to see the financial statements for the period that will conclude in three weeks' time.  Mr. Barry gets my point.  There should be more urgency.  It is possible that the change of directors or another matter was the reason for the delay.  Many organisations appear before the committee.  I consider this to be a critical organisation in which there is a significant amount of public interest.  It is good for the reputation of the project if information is provided in a timely manner but it damages its reputation if information must be dragged out.  I am making that point in a positive way.  I ask Mr. Barry to try to get ahead of the curve on these matters.</p> <p>  This is the first time Ms Hardiman has appeared before the committee.  Children's Health Ireland, CHI, deals with the hospitals in Crumlin, Temple Street, Tallaght and Blanchardstown.  What about children who live outside Dublin and those who are sick in hospitals elsewhere in the country?  Do they fall under the umbrella of CHI?</p></speech>

We cover local services along the eastern seaboard and in the greater Dublin area.  Patients in Cork would go to Cork University Hospital, which has a children's unit, while those in the west would go to a hospital in Galway or Limerick, for example.

However, there is a plan to take a network approach to the delivery of services.  What is part of our job is all of the national services.  We are the only hospital in the system that has all of the national services in one organisation.  The sickest children, who comprise 25%, are all in our group.  A very sick baby in Cork who needs intensive care will come to us.  Children with complex and chronic illnesses or a rare disease come to us.  We deal with all of the national services, as well as some for Northern Ireland.  In addition, we provide secondary care in the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

As Mr. Breslin outlined, there initially was a plan for a national electronic healthcare record but it was agreed for us to proceed with our system.  Interoperability is very important for us.  The records of many children born in four of the maternity hospitals are stored on an electronic system.  We must have a process whereby files can be transferred to ensure a continuity of care.

Paragraph H.10 of our report says:</p> <blockquote> 	Members questioned the cost of Phase A, the substructure, in relation to the overall project.  The NPHDB stated that Phase A works were approximately &euro;100m, including VAT, of all project costs.  This represents approximately 7% of the current construction cost estimate of &euro;1.4 billion. </blockquote> <p>That was several months ago.  The board was able to give us that cost after the main meeting.  It was an approximate figure at that time.  There are several obvious questions.  These are the financial statements.  There is a reference to phase A having been completed.  My question is simple.  What was the final cost for phase A?</p></speech>

We are looking at the board's 2018 accounts.  We have done a periodic report and the board has been in here twice.  This is its third time before the committee this year.  It was here at the beginning of January and in May.  We did a periodic report based on figures provided in respect of the board.  I asked a basic question.  We spent some time this morning talking about the estimates for the future.  I am asking about the part of the project that has been completed.  I am sitting here as Chairman looking at the board's accounts in respect of the completed works and I am being told that I cannot be given a breakdown of the &euro;100 million.  That is not a good place for us to be in.  Does Mr. Barry understand my point?</p></speech>

That is what the Committee of Public Accounts is about.  Getting a set of accounts is just the start of the meeting.  We give our thanks and note that we have them on file and then delve into and analyse the accounts.  The first question I asked referred to the board's note which said that phase A, which related to the substructure, had been completed.  I asked whether we could have a breakdown of the costs now that it has been completed.  That is what this committee is for.  We are here to ask those questions.  The Committee of Public Accounts expects answers to such questions today, not in ten days' time.  Doe the witnesses get my point?  They might not like that point but I am making it to everyone collectively.  I will come to Mr. Breslin because he is the chairman of the children's hospital project programme board.  Does he know the cost of phase A or can he give me a breakdown?</p></speech>

We might not be here for too much longer.  I am expressing the frustration of all members here today.  We were here last January and we extracted the figure of &euro;1.433 billion at that meeting.  We have not been given one single new figure today, 11 months on.  There is a bit of frustration on this side of the table.  We have a set of audited accounts and when I asked my first question about them, I expected a breakdown to be available today.  It is going to come and that is fine but I believe Mr. Breslin sees my point.</p></speech>

It is part of the project.  If the Chairman asked a question about expenditure on the project to date, including how much has been paid to the contractor, I believe people would be able to answer that.</p></speech>

I am starting from the board's financial statements, which include a reference to phase A.  I am not inventing a question.  I am asking for details on matters the board refers to in paragraph 7, page 35 of its financial statements.  It is fine.  I will take the figure of &euro;100 million for now.  We will get the breakdown.  Can anyone indicate how much of this figure was paid to BAM?  Was it 70% or 80%?</p></speech>

That is the breakdown.  Mr. Devine has answered that question.  I will take that as an answer.</p> <p>  I am now moving on to phase B.  I am reading on in the same paragraph: "In 2018, having agreed the GMP [guaranteed maximum price] for the project, the contract for the main works [which was held by BAM, if I am correct] was awarded for &euro;887.7m (ex vat)".  VAT came to &euro;120 million so the contract comes to &euro;1.007 billion, including VAT.  I am reading the board's figures.  Am I right in my figures?  I believe I am.</p></speech>

The sum of &euro;260 million has already been incurred on the balance sheet.

There is not a single norm.  Some contractors put in extremely high claims and they come down an awful lot.  Some put in more measured, considered ones and they still come down.  One cannot really benchmark claims on the basis of the amount claimed and say that, therefore, there would be so much to pay.  However, one can say that, over the life of a construction project, it would be most unusual if a contractor could not find some things that were additional to the original.</p></speech>

I do not expect the witnesses to have a breakdown now but can they provide it for the &euro;1.257 billion, including contractual commitments entered into?</p></speech>

I will not rehash that.  It will be subject to assumptions.  There is a clear implication that there are other costs associated with the children's hospital not in the construction contract.  Will Mr. Breslin start telling us what else will be in there to get this children's hospital up and running?  Children's Health Ireland will have significant costs and other costs may not be met directly by that organisation.  What will be the costs of getting the hospital open?  He is chairman of the project programme board, which comprises two people from the Department and two from the HSE.  The members of the programme board are the people with the global picture of how this hospital will work.</p> <p>  We will start with the figure of &euro;1.433 billion, which is fine.  Let us hope it is as close to that as possible.  Mr. Barry referred to issues in his opening statement that are not in that guaranteed maximum price.  What are those elements not included in what we have been talking about today?</p></speech>

There is what has been discussed in the meeting around residual risks relating to the paediatric hospital development board's costs and there are some costs outside the paediatric hospital development board.  I can go into either of those if the Chairman so wishes.</p> <p>  The residual risks are a challenge to the development board at bringing this in at &euro;1.433 billion.  We have spoken about inflation and so on.  The Government has clearly stated the budget is &euro;1.433 billion.  Outside this are elements not in the budget for the construction of the hospital.  These lie primarily with Children's Health Ireland, and they include ICT, the electronic health record and integration of services.  They all form into the total figure seen before of &euro;1.7 billion.</p></speech>

The &euro;1.433 billion figure has been subject to quite a bit of interrogation.  Mr. Barry is smiling as I say that.</p><p>The other costs have not been subject to any interrogation here at all.  Today, we have dealt with the &euro;1.7 billion.  In meeting members of the board, we have only focused on the bare costs.  This committee has never had a discussion on the &euro;293 million in other costs.  What information can Mr. Breslin give us on that?

That will go through a peer review process under the office of the chief information officer.  The procurement process and the project have already been looked at.  We would hope to go to tender shortly and, on receipt of the tenders, CHI will contract with a provider to deliver an electronic health record.  The budget that is provided for this has been looked at on a number of occasions, most recently in the request to the peer review process for permission to go to tender, and it seems to be within the norms that might be expected for a project of this nature.</p></speech>

What we have at the moment is a patient administration system.  That is a basic foundation system with the patients' data and information on it.  What we are going out to procure is an electronic healthcare record.  That is a different system that has all of the clinical notes.  It also has all of the medications.  It can combine their X-rays and all of their lab feedback.  It also allows the clinicians to order electronically their diagnosis of the investigations.  It is a very different system.</p> <p>  As the Secretary General outlined, we have developed a business case.  So it has been through the HSE.  As with any major ICT project in health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a peer review process.  We have been before this peer review independent group three times this year.  It interrogates the business case, the costs, independent of the Department or the HSE and reports back up to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have been through those three meetings.  The final one was only last week and we hope to get a positive indication to go out to procure after that.</p></speech>

I only heard recently that it is not wide enough to carry all the necessary facilities going through these corridors, ducts, ducting or whatever one wants to call them to carry the electric cables, toilet pipes and all that.  I have heard that the ducts are not wide or big enough to take them and that is causing a problem.  My second question is about rumours relating to steel beams.  I do not actually know what kind of beams were involved.  When they were brought in from abroad, they were too big to fit and had to be cut or adapted to fit.  This resulted in a major cost.

We have a 3D representation of every single service in the building.  That was done for GMP.  We are very confident that all of the services fitted within the corridors.  I can also confirm that I am not aware of any claim that has come in to say that the services are not fitting in the corridors.  I am not aware of any steelwork that came in that had to be cut or altered.  If such a thing should happen, it would be the contractor's responsibility and not that of the employer.</p></speech>

We are meeting the HSE to discuss the accounts of the public service for 2018 and, in particular, chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which deals with the development of primary care centres.  We made the decision a number of weeks ago, in the interests of time, to try to limit our consideration today to certain key topics because the HSE was here in July just before the summer recess and we discussed its 2018 financial statements at that stage.  Given that the HSE is here to discuss chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we decided to add a few other items for discussion as follows: an update on measures to reduce incidents of clinical negligence that may lead to state claims, which is an ongoing topic; an update on matters related to oversight of section 38 and section 39 organisations and practice in issuing advance funding to such organisations; private ambulance contracts and; home support services.  Those matters were mentioned by the members as being of interest this afternoon.</p><p>We are joined by Mr. Paul Reid, chief executive officer; Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief safety officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; and Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary affairs division, HSE.  We are also joined by Mr. Fergal Goodman, head of primary care division; and Mr. Andy Conlon, principal officer, primary care, Department of Health. <br/><br/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>While we expect witnesses to answer questions clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.<br/><br/>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

We previously examined and reported on the progress made by the Department and the HSE in delivering the network up to 2010.  I felt it was appropriate, after a further eight years, to revisit the issue and provide a further update, and have done so in chapter 15 of my report.</p></speech>

In simple numeric terms, this is just over one third of the network originally envisaged.  A target timeframe for the delivery of the centres has not been set.  If delivery continues at the current rate, it is estimated that it will take at least a further 20 years to develop the full network.</p> <p>  We sought information from the HSE on the size of the existing centres, the staff deployed to each, the nature of the services provided, the procurement method and the cost.  This type of information was not available centrally, so information relating to the premises and their procurement was compiled manually from multiple sources across the HSE.  We could not get a clear picture of the range of services offered.</p> <p>  A key finding that emerged is that there is currently no formal definition of a primary care centre in terms of the core services to be accommodated.  The HSE currently defines a PCC in very broad terms which encompass pre-existing and new buildings, stand-alone centres and centres co-located with other services such as community hospitals.  The absence of a clear definition of what constitutes a primary care centre hinders meaningful tracking and reporting of progress. </p> <p>  In 2011, the HSE carried out a detailed assessment, which identified 297 potential locations for delivery of PCCs, in addition to the 43 operating at the end of 2010.  The HSE ranked all 340 locations in order of priority for delivery or development, based on assessments of local service need, existing infrastructure and the level of deprivation in the catchment area.  That ranking has not been revisited by the HSE since 2012, despite significant changes in population and economic conditions.</p> <p>  Some 27 PCCs were brought into operation in 2011 and 2012.  Following the HSE&rsquo;s location ranking exercise, a further 57 centres were delivered between 2013 and March 2019, but the delivery of these centres has not followed the ranked order of priority.  As a result, almost half of the 50 locations ranked with highest priority in 2012 were recorded in March 2019 as being at "early planning" stage, or had no indication of progress in the delivery of a centre. </p> <p>  The HSE has used three main models for procurement of the centres delivered since 2013, namely, direct commissioning of a building by the HSE; long-term leasing from local developers and-or investors; and a public private partnership, PPP, to build and make available a bundle of 14 care centres on HSE-owned sites.  The various delivery models have very different cost structures, making any comparison of the costs and benefits of each option difficult.  Given the volume of delivery over the past five years or so, it would be opportune for the HSE to undertake a formal cost-effectiveness comparison of the different procurement methods.</p> <p>  The original model outlined for primary care delivery envisaged that each PCC would accommodate one or more core primary care teams, supported by a wider network of health and social care professionals, as outlined in figure 15.1 of this chapter of the report.  However, as the HSE does not currently have an integrated reporting system, specific information is not available on the number and mix of teams in each operational centre, the numbers of filled and vacant posts, or the types of services being provided by the teams.  For the purposes of this examination, the HSE reported that, as of July 2019, there were 421 primary care teams in place, of which only about 56% had direct GP involvement.  As shown in figure 15.13, most community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas do not have the planned number of primary care teams. Only Dublin north CHO has the target number of teams with GP involvement.</p> <p>  The report makes four recommendations in regard to the management and monitoring of the development of primary care centres.  These recommendations have been accepted by the Department of Health and the HSE, which will be able to provide members with an update on their implementation. </p></speech>

The submitted statement makes reference to 341 locations, but that figure should be 340.  That was corrected by the Comptroller and Auditor General yesterday.  I apologise for that.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 report.  The senior management colleagues joining me today are Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief strategy officer; and Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer.  I am also joined by Mr. Jim Curran, our head of estates, who has stayed on from this morning's session.  We submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and so I will confine my opening remarks to a few specific issues.</p> <p>  I will first give a financial overview of the situation.  A key priority for the HSE is maximising the provision of safe services to the people we serve, while operating within the funding provided to us.  This continues to be a significant challenge due to the ever-increasing level of demand on our services, which is influenced by factors such as a growing population with an ageing demographic, changes in technology and clinical practice, and ongoing societal and economic change.  We have continued our intensive focus on current year financial management and financial planning for 2020.  Senior managers across the organisation have been engaging with us regarding activity and expenditure and the related challenges of operating within available resources.</p> <p>  The latest financial position, as of September 2019, shows a variance from budget, including first charge, of &euro;319 million or 3%.  Of this, 37%, or &euro;119 million, relates to our operational service areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was almost 100% higher at &euro;636 million of which 80%, or &euro;507 million, was in the operational service areas.  Pension and demand-led areas account for &euro;200 million of the variance as of September 2019.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services relate to the provision of residential placements to people with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialised emergency care within acute hospital settings, particularly in the context of an ageing population with increasingly complex needs.  The costs within our pensions and demand-led areas are mostly driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic environment and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  State Claims Agency reimbursements also fall within this area and there is a significant and ongoing focus on mitigating, insofar as is practical, the underlying risks which give rise to claims.</p> <p>  My monthly financial management meetings with community healthcare organisation, CHO, chief officers and hospital group CEOs will continue to year end.  All areas are clear about their allocated financial limits and performance expectations up to year end to mitigate, insofar as is practical, any deviations from those limits, thereby reducing the extent of any challenge to be dealt with in 2020.</p><p>The discipline of these monthly financial meetings will continue throughout 2020.<br/><br/>A key focus for ongoing financial management efforts have been on improving compliance with our pay and staffing controls, including whole-time equivalents, agency and overtime.  Although staffing levels will increase again in 2019, any increases must be managed in a way that is both planned and affordable. This necessary adjustment to the controls on pay and staffing is proving difficult but it must become part of our normal way of working.  I acknowledge that this is a challenging process but the board of the HSE and I are committed to ensuring that there is an improved culture of delivery within the funding provided by the State.  I fully believe that doing this will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which will ultimately be in the best interest of our service users and their families.<br/><br/>The HSE national service plan for 2020 was adopted by the board on 4 November and submitted to the Minister for consideration.  The approval process is well advanced with correspondence having been received from him and replied to within the past week.  I expect the plan will be published within the next week or so.<br/><br/><b></b>The HSE welcomes the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on primary care centres.  I note that the four recommendations in the report have been accepted and will be implemented in consultation with the Department of Health and in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  The development of PCCs to accommodate the HSE primary care teams and GPs in the one location is a key enabler for the delivery of primary care services.  A number of years ago the primary care division of the HSE, in conjunction with HSE estates, identified 341 locations for primary care centres.  In 2012, these locations were prioritised on the basis of service need, existing facilities and level of deprivation.  The most suitable delivery model of the primary care centre was also identified.<br/><br/>The three models used for the development of PCCs are as follows: Exchequer-funded development, capital plan; PPP, the Government stimulus programme; and the operational lease.  Of the 341 locations identified during the 2012 prioritisation process, 127 locations are now operational.  A further 77 primary care centres are in the process of being developed.  Taken together, this represents 204 or 60% of the original 340 locations identified.  The HSE, in 2020, will complete an overarching review of PCCs that will include an update of the rankings of the proposed locations, and a determination of how further delivery is to be prioritised.  This review will help us better understand how PCCs are currently used.  It will also allow us to review the characteristics of these facilities to identify the most effective service models.<br/><br/>The review will consider the utilisation of centres and how this would increase as services in the community are expanded, commencing with the Sl&aacute;intecare investment of &euro;10 million that will increase to &euro;60 million.  This will result in to 1,000 additional front-line staff employed in community services.  This work will also insure an integrated system among key HSE stakeholders, and a consistent process for coding primary care teams across the networks and CHOs.<br/><br/>Between January and September this year, the HSE provided almost 13 million hours of home support nationally, with an expenditure of more than &euro;320 million.  This service provides essential supports to more than 50,000 people to either remain at home or assist with their discharge from hospital.  Demand for this service continues to outstrip funding levels and at the end of September, 7,667 people nationally were assessed as requiring new or additional services.  The HSE winter plan will continue to support this service by allocating an additional 600 home care packages, targeted at both acute hospital and community waiting lists.<br/><br/>Regarding sections 38 and 39 organisations, the HSE recognises and supports the essential work of the voluntary sector in providing health and social services.  We wish to strengthen and deepen the ongoing dialogue between our organisation and the voluntary sector, in line with the recommendations of the Day report.  We acknowledge that a number of voluntary organisations are facing difficult challenges, including financial challenges.  Various factors may contribute to expenditure exceeding the funding level set out in the annual service agreement signed with the HSE, and any overruns arising require careful analysis of the specific causal factors lest they undermine budgetary discipline within the overall health sector.  In the first instance, dealing with any in-year or accumulated historic financial overruns within voluntary organisations, funded under sections 38 and 39, is a matter for the boards of these organisations.  We know their boards take that responsibility seriously.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is nearly identical to his reports of 2001 and 2010.  We all know that the ambition of primary care is to keep as many people as possible out of hospital and in their homes.  We all know it seeks to ensure that people are cared for and treated as near as possible to their own homes without blocking up the system, taking up hospital beds, etc. particularly in view of the current trolley situation.</p> <p>  Governments down through the years have placed great emphasis on primary care and such care has been mentioned in all of the manifestos and by the HSE.  However, it seems that great progress has not been made and it seems to be at a standstill.  Almost 20 years have elapsed yet only one third of the target set in 2001 has been achieved.  Why has it taken so long to roll out primary care?  After 20 years more than one third of the target should have been achieved.</p></speech>

The ones that we do have up and operational, there is no doubt, where we have a GP presence in place, it provides a significant extra service to the community, and provides specific relief to our acute settings, particularly our emergency departments.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare direction is absolutely the way we want to go.  We have a lot of PCCs that do not have the diagnostic capability that would enhance the supports they can give the community. </p></speech>

Currently, all of the pressure points head towards our emergency department and hospital acute settings.  I am convinced in the six months that I have been here that the shift that we have to make is to reduce the number of presentations, not through anyone's fault, to our emergency departments.  That has to be done through a number of ways.  Sl&aacute;intecare sets out a strategy for this.  We need more GPs.  I have been talking with the training body for GPs.  Bringing more on-stream will be key for us.  We need to enhance the capacity and capability of our pharmacies in terms of their reach into communities.  We can only reduce the number of people who need to present to emergency departments by strengthening our primary care teams.</p> <p>  A positive element of our service plan, which is being finalised and is with the Minister to go to the Government shortly, is an enhanced investment for next year in our complete primary care settings from a number of perspectives.  This will enhance investment in the nursing home support scheme and home help hours.  In particular, there will be capacity to increase our resourcing in community settings, for example, primary nursing, by more than 1,000 personnel by the end of 2020.  There is a &euro;10 million investment.</p> <p>  We need to shift the investment profile from the acute setting, which is under pressure, into primary care settings primarily while supporting the acute setting.</p></speech>

Is it down to money?  Are GPs not interested in rolling it out?  Is it down to structures or grant aid?  What is the main failing?  Why has it not been taken up more?  The centres in Kilkenny, in my constituency, are working brilliantly and there are plans for more, but those have been spoken about for ten years and they are still not up and running.  Why is that the case?</p></speech>

There are 127 and a further 77 are coming on-stream.  Ten will be from our corporate plan next year and 67 will be from primary care operational leases.  A significant number will come on-stream over the next three years.</p> <p>  Reverting to the original point, it is not just about building a primary care centre; it is about equipping the centre with the facilities that can enhance the patient and public's experience in them.  The Deputy referred to his own experience.</p><p>It varies across the country.  We do not have PCCs with the capacity that is needed.  We do not have sufficient GPs coming on-stream.  That is getting better.  I agree with the Deputy that we have to strengthen capacity in all of our centres.  Diagnostics, GPs and therapist skills are needed to ensure people have outpatient appointments in acute settings.  An investment shift is required to strengthen our community settings.</p></speech>

Which of these methods is the most prominent?  Which of them involves the best system?  Which of them is the most effective?  As we go forward, which of these methods will be of most use as we try to get the other projects - two thirds of the total - up and running?  Which of them is the most cost-effective?  Which of them represents the best value for money?</p></speech>

We will do a new review of them, as recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A review was done in 2008.  It concluded on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis that the operation of lease agreements was the most cost-effective of the three methods.  We want to review that again now, based on our experience with PPPs and our own-----</p></speech>

Which of them is the best?  I presume the lease agreement method involves leasing a building.  I understand what is involved in PPPs.  Someone comes in from the private sector as part of a partnership.  The HSE builds some of these facilities directly itself.  I ask Mr. Reid to explain each of these methods.  Which of them is the most cost-effective?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked which of them works best.  If we are enhancing an existing premises of our own on our own land, it calls out for a capital plan investment that we should do.  In other cases, we try to reduce, mitigate or share the risk by operating in a PPP environment.  From a cost perspective, we enter into operational leases when the opportunity arises.  We do not always have a choice because all three methods do not always present themselves.  People might not be ready for leases, or people might not want to work on PPPs with us.</p></speech>

As Mr. Curran may elaborate in a second, it is not always possible to enter into such a lease.  We may wish to put a primary care centre in a particular location through the operational lease model, but it becomes problematic to do so if we cannot attract interest locally or we cannot identify a site locally.  That conclusion was reached in the review.  We intend to undertake a cost-evaluation exercise next year.  This will be informed by the guidance of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will explore the three different modes or models of delivery again to see which of them is the most appropriate in today's circumstances.  Of course we will look at that.  The models we have on the ground now reflect that fact that there is no one right solution.  Each of them has strengths and weaknesses.  Perhaps Mr. Curran would like to add some light and shade.</p></speech>

We have also focused on developing our own facilities, extending existing health centres to provide additional accommodation for primary care and upgrading or remodelling some of our existing facilities, including old mental health institutions and hospitals.  For instance, we are developing a primary care unit at the St. Davnet's campus in Monaghan.  We hope to do something similar in Portlaoise.  We have enhanced an old community nursing unit in Loughrea to provide primary care there.  We have provided new PCCs in Inchicore and Ballyfermot from our capital plan.  We will deliver centres in Finglas and Rowlagh from the capital plan as well.  When we pursue the operational lease method, we get the benefit of commercial interest in providing primary care, including the capacity to leverage off PCCs for other commercial developments associated with health, including pharmacies.  Other private consultancy suites often come into these facilities.  All of these developments enhance the delivery of primary care.</p></speech>

Some GPs throughout the country seem to be reluctant to get involved in PCCs.  What kind of grant aid is there for a GP who wishes to set up in such a centre?  I assume assistance is provided as part of the effort to get full primary care services in place.  Is a certain percentage of the cost provided as grant aid to get people interested?  What way does it work?  What efforts are made to get business people involved in PPPs?</p></speech>

I forget what year it was done.  It was probably 2013 or 2014.  The report did not propose that the provision of grant aid or the introduction of tax measures would be the way to go.  The report suggested that the models we had in place should be sufficient to develop primary care.  GPs who have invested in their own facilities might be reluctant to abandon what they have developed.  They might need see any reason to move into another facility.  They might have incurred mortgages or leases.  This might mean they do not have the freedom to go into new locations.  We offer GPs the opportunity to take out licences in rooms in our own facilities at fairly attractive rates to encourage them to operate from our PCCs.</p></speech>

I presume a small village of a couple of hundred people would not have a primary care centre.  Does the HSE focus on bigger towns with larger populations?  Are certain areas targeted?

As part of the 2012 prioritisation exercise that was mentioned earlier, we identified priority projects in the context of the service requirements, the accommodation available and the deprivation index.  That exercise gave us an initial priority list for primary care delivery.  It can be seen from the priority list that there is a focus on areas of deprivation with poor facilities and on areas of increasing population without any existing facilities for the delivery of primary care.  Such areas tend to be around cities and towns.  It is probably timely to review the priority list now in the context of what was referred to earlier as the recommendation report.  That would allow us to see where we should refocus our efforts.</p></speech>

It is a problem we all encounter.  I refer to home care hours.  It is a help to keep people at home.  It is obvious that there is not enough funding to facilitate the demand.  Will more personnel and funding be made available to keep people in their homes as long as they can?  There is a significant demand on the home support framework that we have, with people only getting half an hour when they should get two or three hours, and others not getting any and having to wait three or four months before they can even get access to some help.  Will Mr. Reid comment on that?</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Anne O'Connor, will comment as well.</p> <p>  The home help supports are significant for us in terms of the demands of demographics that we face as a country.  With the funding that we have this year, as the Deputy will see, we have set out the number of people that will support.  We have sought additional funding, as part of our winter plan, from Government.  Positively, this year we have secured additional funding, not in December but in October, which has been invested already.  Enhanced home care supports will be put in up to Christmas and during the winter.</p> <p>  Our service plan for next year has to be agreed shortly, but the Deputy will have heard it publicly announced in the Government budgeting process that an extra 1 million home help hours will be deployed into the community settings.  Those are welcome.</p> <p>  Our total winter funding of &euro;26 million is very significant.  Last year, that was &euro;10 million in total.  A significant portion of that is being put into home help, and, indeed, the nursing home support scheme and delayed transfer of care beds.</p></speech>

I accept there is more funding.  We are grateful for getting more funding, and 1 million more home care hours as well, but it is still not fulfilling the demand.  What level of demand does the HSE want to fulfil to keep people out of hospital, off trolleys and from holding up beds in hospitals?  Does Mr. Reid agree the way forward is more funding on home care?</p></speech>

Any extra funding we get in terms of home care supports is excellent value for money when compared to the cost of a patient being delayed in an acute setting or, indeed, in a bed.  It is much more cost-effective.</p> <p>  Specifically, there is a number of aspects in terms of the supply and demand.  On the demand side, as I said in my statement, we have more than 7,000 people, which is combination of people looking for new hours and extended hours throughout the day.  More funding in next year's budget will be supportive of that.</p> <p>  We also have a supply factor in terms of home help providers and care providers, which is a significant challenge in some parts of the country.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have a mix between direct labour and indirect labour across the country for historical legacy reasons, but that is where the supply is.  We have a bit of supply of the home care hours and help where we want to get more and we have a bit on the demand side in terms of the extra provision required.  Positively, next year's budget will reflect significant extra hours.</p></speech>

I was approached by people who work for the HSE providing home care regarding agencies.  There seems to be a bit of conflict, at least in my area, about the HSE employing agency staff instead of employing people directly.  What is Mr. Reid's opinion on that?  Why does the HSE use agencies when people are available who could do the work and are employed by the HSE?  They are not getting full hours and yet the HSE is bringing agency nurses in to do it instead.  There is a bit of a conflict over that to the effect that the priority should be given to the HSE workers.  I am not going into industrial relations or anything like that.</p></speech>

There have been extra cost pressures on us this year such as wage inflation and Workplace Relations Commission agreements so the cost per hour has gone up.</p></speech>

From our perspective, the best mix is to have a blended solution.  We have two areas in the country where we have no direct provision of home support.  They are all provided by external providers and that presents some challenges.  What we find is that it can be difficult to source carers in isolated rural areas at present, and we work closely.  When there is a blend of HSE directly-provided services and agencies, we can work closely together.  However, it is challenging in terms of being able to secure carers all over the country.</p> <p>  In terms of the cost that the Deputy referenced, we had the tender which went up.  In terms of travel time and paying for travel, that impacted on our own employees but also some of the charges coming in from external providers went up in the same way slightly.  Our preferred way of working is to have availability of both.</p></speech>

I cannot remember the exact number.  In 2012, centres were prioritised based on demographics, need, etc.  Is Mr. Reid telling us today that no review has been done since 2012?  Is there still need in those areas?  My concern is that a pathway was carved out seven to ten years ago and the position has significantly changed in the interim how we deliver healthcare, with Sl&aacute;intecare being the biggest change .  I am concerned that a pathway was embarked on and has not been reviewed since and one of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations is that an analysis be done retrospectively of whether the benefits that the HSE set out to achieve were realised.  I cannot see why it would keep going unless it was sure what was being done was the correct thing to do.  Will Mr. Reid comment on that?</p></speech>

We are moving towards a new regionally integrated model where the acute and community settings will work together, as the Deputy will be aware.</p></speech>

The delivery of care has changed.  The skills we will put into our PCCs will change in the future.  Looking two years rather than ten years ahead, we want to make sure that the next prioritised list takes on board the new direction that we are going in the delivery of healthcare in respect of the regions and integrated care.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid stated that there are 127 already plus 77 on the way, which will be delivered in a certain period of time but that cannot be guaranteed, because not one has ever reviewed it, if they are what is needed in this new era.</p></speech>

First, of the 77 that are in train, as the Deputy correctly said, ten are in our capital plan, are definitely priorities and would be delivered under any model.  The remaining 67 will be from an operation lease.  Twenty-four are in construction at present and 43 are at an agreement stage.  I will be strongly recommending we move ahead with them.</p></speech>

It is a fair comment.  The review was done in 2012.  The prioritisation exercise was helpful at the point in time.  There has not been, as the Comptroller and Auditor General's report stated, any national reprioritisation since then but there have been a number of local reprioritisations - new locations identified, existing locations merged, etc.</p><p>As Mr. Reid has said, the fact that we have the 127 and will have the 77 is of huge value.  It is much better than starting from nothing, and they are well distributed across the country.  We have the platform here to build on into the future.  The models we have will be sufficiently flexible to allow a range of different services to be put in place.  The most important thing is that we have something that brings together the integrated primary care teams, including the GPs, in one location as a single one-stop shop for patients.  We have prioritised the completion next year of an exercise that will review how we are using the existing centres.  We will look at Sl&aacute;intecare in the round and how things have moved in our thinking over the past ten years.  We will make sure as we go forward now, building on the 204 that will be in place between now and 2023 or so, that we redirect as appropriate and maximise the value from the 204 we will have by then.</p></speech>

We have no definition of what they should be.  We have not looked at whether they are fulfilling what we set out for them to fulfil in 2008.  We do not know whether they are achieving what we set out for them to achieve.  I am very concerned that we would continue going down a certain pathway.  That is fairly clear from what I have said.  Mr. Sullivan said the models would be sufficiently flexible.  If 14 are PPP-based, what is the flexibility there?  A developer builds the site and leases it to us.  Is that how it works?  It is a 25-year lease.  Who owns the staff?  Are they HSE staff?  They are.</p></speech>

The important thing in the beginning was the development of primary care teams after the primary care strategy of 2001.  We had groupings of primary care professionals coming together to work in the interests of the local population.  From that we started to develop primary care centres.  In reality, we have from the beginning had GPs who were very invested and wanted to be in the middle of the teams.  We had other GPs who had invested in their own practices and wanted to work in a more virtual way.  The priority for those teams was to ensure ease of referral with GPs and to ensure that the team worked and had a weekly meeting with GPs.  There have been different models throughout the years.</p><p>Some GPs just do not want to be in the middle of a primary care centre.  They want to be in their own practice that they have invested in and which is their own business.</p></speech>

That is still the core team, including a GP, public health nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist and home support, with speech and language therapists, psychologists and dieticians in the mix more in the network.  They are the core professionals of the primary care team.  In recent years, we have focused on the inclusion of diagnostics.  In reality, the core disciplines are very similar.  We have looked at the local demography.  In Dublin 15, where we have developed centres in Corduff, we have focused primarily on children.  We have brought in the children's disability team as well as the primary care team.  In other areas, we might have a stronger focus on older persons and the mix of the team will change.  Over the years, we have tried to adapt in response to the local population and through collaboration with local communities to see what the best fit for that population is.</p></speech>

After reading the documents last night, the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General have to be implemented.  If we look back at this in ten years and we have built 204 things for which we do not even have a definition or know who should be in them, which are not Sl&aacute;intecare-proofed, so to speak, and have not been reviewed to see if they deliver what we wanted them to deliver, it will not be a good outcome for any of us, especially the people who are depending on them.  Have we any timeline for the review?  I read recommendation 2 last night, which states that the Accounting Officer of the Department of Health agrees and continues, "However, this will require consultation with the HSE and will need to recognise that variation in the design or utilisation of PCCs is a function of local circumstances, population need".  That, to my mind, is code for the Department will do this if it wants.  It is not defined enough.  We have to review what money is being spent on and see if it is working.  This seems very loose and sounds like the Department will do this if it suits.</p></speech>

They are a core member of the team, as they were in the 2001 strategy.  That being so, at the same time, there were always some GPs, as HSE colleagues have indicated, who were enthusiastic early adopters, but we had no contractual arrangement with the GPs that bound them more closely into the primary care team and network model.  In negotiations that we had this year with the Irish Medical Organisation, one of the key objectives that was secured was a contractual obligation on behalf of general practice to work in an integrated way with primary care networks and teams.  It is not about the physical co-location.  That, as people have explained, is dependent on many other circumstances.  The primary care strategy was very much about ways of working, teamwork and multidisciplinary care.  GPs are moving closer into collaboration with the salaried staff of the HSE in delivering services to populations.  It is worth noting that as part of the service delivery objective.</p></speech>

I went along to my own CHO area.  It had a briefing for Oireachtas Members that was very useful and addressed a range of areas.  I asked a question about an area that keeps cropping up in the personal experience of some of my constituents.  They get an appointment and then there is an interruption in the therapy service.  It is often maternity leave since a large number of women are employed in that area of healthcare and they absolutely have to be supported in the maternity leave that they take.  They do not want to come back to long lists and such.  The functioning of these primary care centres has to take that into account too.  Is that an aspect that the HSE will look at?  I understand that, at any given time, one third of therapists are on maternity leave, which is a very high number.  That goes with the territory when one has a cohort of workers with that age profile.</p></speech>

There will have to be two aspects to a review.</p><p>The first will be what the Comptroller and Auditor General called a "re-look" at which is the best model for delivery in the future between public private partnerships, lease and the capital funded plan.  We want to have that aspect of the review done in the first half of next year because it is key.</p><p> The second aspect of the review, which Deputies O'Connell and Catherine Murphy just mentioned, is to proof it against Sl&aacute;intecare.  Part of the proposal that went to the Government about the announcement of regions was that we would revert to the Government in the first half of next year about the functioning and establishment of regions and real, integrated operational care between acute and primary care.  How we use primary care centres must be a key aspect of our next report.  The history of primary care centres is long, going back to the health board system and through the nine CHO settings.  We need to look at them as much more of an integrated service which is a very different way of looking at them.  It might mean a reassessment of priorities.</p><p> The second part of the question related to the staff and therapists in general.  If one stands back from the Deputy's point, it is absolutely correct.  Some 80% of our staffing, across the HSE, are women and approximately 35% of staff are on reduced working hours, maternity leave, or work part-time, etc.  It is a significant issue to manage and, much of the time, we have to manage it through agency because it would not be cost-effective to have all full-time replacements.  We meet certain pinch points when it comes to resourcing.  Maternity leave also affects some of the primary care centres.  We try to cover some of the vacancies through agency or by moving staff between primary care teams.  It is an issue that is difficult to manage.  That is why we use agency and move staff between some of the primary care teams.</p></speech>

Are there other strategies in place for workforce planning to cover maternity care?  It is unattractive for someone returning to work to face long lists and so on because no cover has been provided in her absence.  Taking somebody back on a part-time basis is better than not having them back at all, especially when the staff in question are experienced.</p></speech>

Our strategy, in terms of workforce planning for next year, involves putting an extra 1,000 staff into our primary care settings.  That will cost &euro;10 million, rising to &euro;60 million.  We should have an extra 1,000 staff in community settings by the end of next year which should give some relief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#VV00400"><p>The cost of agency cover, for example, is greater than direct employment of a member of staff.  It is difficult to have somebody roving and employed in different parts of the country.  Cost-effectiveness and retention should be central to the review.  Retention obviously gives rise to costs for training and experience and many other factors come into the equation when one looks at value for money and quality of service.  We want people to be shouting from the rooftops that this is the way to go and, in order for them to do that, they must have a good experience.  They also must have certainty regarding the provision of service when we invest in these primary care centres.</p></speech>

Historically, disciplines in the community and elsewhere have worked in their own professional silos so, when someone is gone, his or her list is not covered.  Multidisciplinary working changes that slightly.  It does not mean that we magic up capacity that we do not have but it does mean that families and children coming through primary care centres, whether attending the primary care team, children's disability teams or whatever, are familiar with the team and there is less of a gap when an individual member of staff is lost.  There is no doubt that we struggle to cover leave but at least by having teams that are co-located, we are able to work differently with people.</p></speech>

Is it the lifespan of a facility that has been developed through a PPP as opposed to a direct build?  Are there real options in the choices that are to be made?  Will funding be provided in the event that direct build is found to be more cost-effective way of dealing with the primary care centres?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the various models we have.  We have seen, in our review in the past, that the operating lease was the most cost-effective.  We will look at that again by the first half of next year.  There is funding for 30 primary care centres in our capital plan and we still expect those to progress, as they should.  Where we have our own sites and are extending an existing site, as I mentioned earlier, the best model is our own capital plan and infrastructure.  It is about balancing the risk of the investment.</p></speech>

As they are not part of the framework, these payments are clearly not compliant.  Mr. Reid has said the main ones are compliant.  I query whether they are compliant given that the roll-over period has concluded.  On 25 May 2017, the HSE advertised for tenders to replace the current framework.  This has gone on for a long time.  I have had correspondence from people who are very competent.  They might be subcontractors for some of the companies approved by the HSE.  They are legitimately trying to get on to the list.  The most recent letter I received as from the HSE's national director of procurement.  He skirts around the current competition but the letter states that, due to competing priorities in the past 12 months with planning for CervicalCheck and Brexit planning, the HSE did not have the resources to replace the existing framework agreement and it has not been processed.  However, it will examine the market position in early 2020 and will either progress the existing competition - it would be hard to resurrect because it is now three years old - or relaunch a procurement process with a view to establishing a new framework next year.  The HSE has been in the tendering process for three years and my reading of the letter is that it might be abandoned and a new one started.  What is going on?  I am not talking about &euro;1 million here or there but several million euro every year.  Part of this should be covered by the framework.  Having been two years in the process, the HSE is now putting its hands up and potentially abandoning the tendering process.  This is what it reads like to me.  Is Mr. Reid familiar with this?</p></speech>

That process starts around what the service level agreements should look like.  That process will be worked through with the sections 38 and 39 organisations.  A new group has been established by the Minister, which is made up of representatives from sections 38 and 39 organisations, the HSE and the Department, to look at the recommendations from the report produced by Dr. Catherine Day in terms of engagement with the sector, working in partnership and better communications with the sector.  This has started.  The group convened last week.  In parallel to this, service agreements are up for renewal in 2020.  This will also involve direct engagement with the organisations.  This may relate to the Acting Chairman's point on audits and oversight of the sector.</p></speech>

We have governance reviews ongoing.  The last time we appeared before the committee, 22 of X number of reviews has been completed.  The reviews are looking at the governance inside section 38 organisations predominantly.  They are not value-for-money reviews but look more at internal governance, for example, whether they have internal audit functions, rotating board memberships and so on.  We can give an update on that.</p> <p>  Ms O'Connor referred to an exercise that is looking at disability and mental health residential placements around the appropriateness, procurement, cost, effectiveness and value in placements.  That is also under way.  As Mr. Reid said, next year we will look at our standard contractual agreement with all the section 38 and 39 organisations.  That is also ongoing.  There is a lot going on in that space.  We need to clarify specifically how we can best address the question the Acting Chairman asked.</p></speech>

The committee is often informed by the experiences brought to members' attention.  One cannot get that kind of insight if one has not experienced it directly.  When several people start saying the same thing, it piques one's interest.</p><p>A range of different services, for example, for young people with autism or intellectual disabilities are outsourced.  They are not provided directly by the HSE but by a provider through a service level agreement.  People are reluctant to complain because they see the person on behalf of whom they are complaining as a vulnerable person.  It is all the more important that the questioning is one step removed from the individuals.  There have been questions about how much it is costing to do that, the effectiveness of the outsourcing, and whether there are better outcomes with different providers.  Is that part of this review?</p></speech>

We are looking at everybody who is in a private residential placement with either intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties.  It is interesting because one of the key components, particularly for younger people, is the distance from home and family.  That is a key component in what we are looking at as well.</p> <p>  On the value for money question, people are placed in what we call an emergency placement, if things break down at home, or whatever happens.  They are left in this placement that can often be very high cost and highly-supported.  We are bringing in a new system of reviewing all of these placements.  That is under way.  We have worked through many different placements to look at the appropriateness of the placement, its oversight, whether there is a different type of placement that would meet that person's needs in a better way, where it is in relation to local community and family, and all of that.  We are actively working through all of those at the moment.  Hopefully, this will address the concerns the acting chairman is raising.</p></speech>

The reality is that we often have people who have highly specialised needs.  We would not be able to keep those services going in respect of staffing, etc.  We rely on private providers who often specialise in a specific condition.  Our challenge is to ensure that we respond in a more agile way to people's needs.  Just because people go into a placement one day does not mean that they should have the same staffing and remain in the same place forever.  We must ensure we have a system of reviewing placements to meet their changing needs.  This is particularly the case if they go in when they are younger and grow older, or their condition changes, or whatever.  Many things can change.  The idea is that we look at getting the most appropriate care setting.</p> <p>  There is definitely a value for money component.  Sometimes we find that three or four CHOs may be dealing with one provider, unaware that the other CHOs are also talking to the provider.  This impacts on the cost and staffing levels.  We are trying to join all of that up nationally to make sure that when we are talking to a provider, particularly where there might be three or four people in a house funded by different areas, that we bring all of that together and look at its appropriateness.  The most important thing is we meet the person's needs in the most appropriate way.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that we are often challenged to get service providers who can provide the right level of care to people with very complex needs.  We received funding last year, however, to look at a specific autism initiative to improve services in one way but also to look at our approach to people with autism.  In reality, people with autism need to be able to access our whole range of services.  We have an extensive new initiative on autism, which is about to be launched in the relatively near future, and it will be similar to the Understand Together dementia campaign.  Much work has been done on autism and we are very happy with that in ensuring that our services and the public are aware of what autism is and what it means for people who have autism.  At the other end of the spectrum we need to ensure that we have the right providers to provide for a very complex need.  Sometimes people with autism have a range of other needs as well.  We are very focused on that at the moment.</p></speech>
