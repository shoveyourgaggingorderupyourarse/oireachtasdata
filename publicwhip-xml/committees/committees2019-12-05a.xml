He is joined by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy MacSharry.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting on 28 November.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is a matter arising out of the minutes.  As a result of the correspondence received from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which we discussed at the previous meeting, the committee agreed to forward a transcript of the meeting the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Houses of the Oireachtas for a response on matters discussed.  At that meeting, we asked for a response by Tuesday, 10 December in order that we could consider it at our meeting on Thursday, 12 December, which we will be our final meeting before the Christmas recess.  I propose we ask Mr. Finnegan and a senior representative of the OPW to be on standby in case we decide next Thursday morning that we would like to meet them on Thursday afternoon.  We may or may not wish to do so but it will be too late on Thursday morning to ask them.  We ask the secretariat, therefore, to put arrangements in place to have them on standby and we will decide on Thursday morning, having received the response, whether we want to call them to appear before us.  In case we decide to do so, they will be on standby.  Is that reasonable?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#B00400"><p>We will decide next Thursday what to do when we receive the report we have been assured we will receive before the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next items are correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is category A, comprising briefing documents and opening statements for the meeting.  There are quite a number of them because there will be several witnesses today.  Nos. 2610 to 2612, inclusive, from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 2561 and 2607 are documents from the Children's Health Ireland for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 2601, 2602, 2608 and 2609 are briefing documents and opening statements from the HSE for today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2605 is correspondence from the Department of Health relevant to today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will discuss all the items presently.</p> <p>  The next category of correspondence, category B, comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers and their Ministers in follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publishing.  No. 2574 is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, dated 25 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of evidence required by SUSI in cases following difficult family circumstances.  The item has been overtaken by the letter we received from the City of Dublin Education and Training Board last week, which operates the SUSI scheme on behalf of the Department.  We will simply note the letter, given that it contains nothing we did not discuss at the previous meeting, and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2576 is from Dr. Alan Wall, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, dated 22 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of the use of occasional hourly payments for staff at third level institutions and the use of such payments in place of employment contracts.  The HEA states it will liaise with the higher education institutions to collate the information and will provide a report to the committee.  We welcome that step and will wait to see the report when it arrives.  We have put the issue on the authority's agenda and it will deal with it.</p> <p>  No. 2577 is from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 25 November, providing information requested by the committee in respect of a perceived discrepancy between oral information provided at our meeting on 7 November and a parliamentary question answered on 12 November.  The matter relates to whether data of individuals were being stored outside the State.  Deputy Catherine Murphy tabled the parliamentary question.</p></speech>

I received a contradictory reply to a parliamentary question, which has been acknowledged in the correspondence from the Department.  I am reasonably happy with the response received.</p></speech>

We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2588 is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, dated 27 November, providing further information requested by the committee regarding the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema in Galway.  We asked about the implementation of the recommendations in the report.  Ms Licken stated that while the review has been completed and published only within the past two months, she can assure the committee the Department is working to progress all the recommendations.  There was a reference to buildings nearby in the report and she confirmed they are owned by Galway City Council, which Deputy Connolly had made clear to the committee.  Ms Licken stated they were referred to in the review in the context of the plans for Galway City Council, as set out in its strategy, namely, Everybody Matters: A Cultural Sustainability Strategy Framework for Galway 2016 - 2025.  Does Deputy Connolly wish to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#B01100"><p>I realise that the post-project review is recent and it is too early to ask about the recommendations.  Nevertheless, there is confirmation they are being implemented, which I welcome.  I also welcome the setting up of the special unit for 2040.  It seems there is ongoing learning in respect of matters but regarding the four properties, the clarification that has been received is unnecessary, given that, as the Chairman noted, the city council owns the properties.  My point was that in the post-project review, the council used the four properties to justify a F&aacute;ilte Ireland promotion of the area.  While I am delighted with that because I am from Galway and love it, the four properties have been empty since 2007.  A post-project review to consider value for money for the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema includes four properties that have been empty since 2007 but it did not raise one question mark as to why they have been empty since then.</p><p>They were bought at an astronomical price and have remained empty in the city which comes last in reaching its targets, although that is a matter for another day.  Should I put my hands up at this point and give up?</p></speech>

If it is going to include four houses, it should at least ask why they are empty and when they will be used.  Does the Chairman think it might do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#C00400"><p>We will watch how it implements the recommendations.  There is another item of correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt which relates to what was learned from the project.</p></speech>

"Misleading" would be a strong word but it was used to colour the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema as being at the centre of this cultural area of four houses.  It was used to give it a particular colour rather than describing it in black and white terms.</p></speech>

As I say, there is a follow-up item of correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to post-project reviews coming up in a moment.  It follows on from us getting on to the Department about its role in post-project reviews and the learning process.  We will come to that in a moment.  It is a related item of correspondence.  We will note and publish this item and issue the letter we have mentioned.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2589B from Mr. David Leahy, chief executive officer of Galway and Roscommon education and training board, ETB, providing information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement recorded in financial statements for Galway and Roscommon ETB.  We will note and publish this item and use the information as part of the work we will be doing in the new year, if we are all here, with regard to public procurement and compliance with public procurement rules.</p></speech>

It is an issue we need to explore.  We have agreed on that.  Mr. Leahy makes this clear in the third paragraph.</p></speech>

We are actually really on the job when we are doing this type of work and compiling information in respect of every single reference to non-compliant procurement in 2019.  It is an issue to which we will return, time permitting.  We are doing an important job and we will continue to do it diligently.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 2590B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of Health Service Executive, dated 28 November 2019 providing further detail requested by the committee regarding the national integrated staff records and pay programme.  He recognises that there were some teething problems with the system when it was introduced.  These issues affected approximately 200 staff, which equates to 1% of the people involved.  He gives a comprehensive response.  Does Deputy Catherine Murphy want to comment?</p></speech>

There is another item of correspondence, No. 2585C, on the same topic.  We are being given an assurance.  The whole point of asking this question is to find out whether the system is flexible enough and fit for purpose.  There will always be teething problems.  I acknowledge that.  It is not about trying to resolve the problems of an individual or group of individuals but they represent a good test of whether the system is working.  The HSE tells us "There is no change to how staff are paid in this regard and the system is fully configured to calculate and make these payments."  It essentially says that there were teething problems.  Correspondence we received from people on the other end of the system tells us something very different.  It tells us that SIPTU is involved in trying to resolve a problem.  I understand that this system is being rolled out incrementally.  That is a very good way to do things because, if one is going to run into a problem, it is better to find out before a great number of people are affected.

These are agreements.  It challenges what the HSE is saying.  The allowance for working on a Sunday has been cut by more than &euro;40.  We are being given very practical examples.  I am only using these to demonstrate that what one side tells us about the system working well is being challenged by the other side.  We are told that SIPTU is involved and that it cannot get the issue resolved.  My question for the Committee of Public Accounts is whether this system is fit for purpose.  Is there an input problem?  I do not think we can take the HSE's word that there is no problem now and that it was just a case of teething problems.  There appear to be ongoing problems in this regard.  The last thing we want is some sort of industrial relations issue because problems are being caused by a system that exists to improve things.</p></speech>

The HSE says that "The introduction of the new system has had a particular impact on the 400 Time Returning Officers".  I do not know whether this is a full-time post or just part of someone's job.  If everyone is directly inputting their own information, what are the 400 time returning officers doing now?  The HSE also says "In addition, staff in the payroll and staff records departments, spend less time on manual data entry and increased time on data validation."  Where is the saving if these staff are not doing the inputting but are spending more time checking what everyone else has done?

They must input the times they work so they can get paid the correct amount.  That is my interpretation but I could be wrong.  These are people who do not work standard hours and they must input their hours.  It is like fobbing in and out.</p></speech>

They are different staff.  There are time-returning officers and next sentence mentions the staff in the payroll and staff records department spending less time on manual data entry and increased time on data validation.

We want them to spell out who are the time-returning officers and the staff in the payroll and staff records department.  We want a more detailed view.  This correspondence will come back to us when we get that information.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 2591B from Mr. Terry Sheridan, principal in planning policy and legislation in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing information relating to gender equality and the appointment of board members to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It gives detail of how many people were nominated, with 37 male nominees and 23 female nominees.  Four men and three women were appointed to the board.  The board now comprises seven men and three women in comparison with the position before 2017, when there were nine men and one woman on the board.  We will keep after this but that provides some clarification.</p> <p>  No. 2592B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE, dated 29 November 2019, providing information requested by the committee on the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Cuisle holiday resort.  We will note and publish this but we will hold over discussion.  Deputy MacSharry raised the matter of the facility in Roscommon the last day we met and we can give him an opportunity to discuss it next time.</p> <p>  No. 2596B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee regarding the post-project review of the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema project.  We will note and publish this.  It is interesting as, essentially, we were critical of the post-project review and the Department's response that a particular section in a particular Department would get this report to learn from it.  We said there is no Department-wide learning process and, far more important, there is no learning across the wider public sector from such post-project reviews.  We wrote to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to determine its role with respect to learning from these post-project reviews.  We also asked Mr. Watt about the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, which was referred to in the report but which most people had not heard of before.  He gives the detail of this and we will publish that.</p> <p>  There was a second recommendation that spending codes should include a requirement for every post-project review to have a section outlining key learning for the public service.  It was suggested that an appropriate way of communicating such learning to all public bodies be explored.  Mr. Watt's response is that the recommendation is being addressed in the forthcoming update on the public spending code, a guide to evaluation, planning and managing public investment, which is due to be published shortly subject to Government consideration and approval.  It appears that after all these years this type of process will be included in learning through the public spending code.  Where mistakes happen or learning should occur from a particular project, there should be a system-wide learning experience.  It is similar to the HSE experience with State claims.  Everybody makes a mistake, gets something wrong or does not do something the best way but people seem to do an internal report and do not tell anybody else about it.  We would like a little more openness and the correspondence is indicating we will get there.  We will keep an eye on that new code whenever it is published.  We will note and publish the correspondence, and at least it is a positive response to a recommendation that there should be learning across the public sector from these reports.</p> <p>  Next is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  We can deal with these but we will not publish them because they are from private individuals.  The first is from the Irish Road Hauliers Association, IRHA, dated 5 November 2019, responding to recent correspondence from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on its functions that have an impact on the licensed road haulage sector.  The IRHA expresses doubts about the capacity, competence and the effectiveness of the RSA in enforcing regulations and controls in the haulage sector.  The president of the organisation also states that it is not inclined to participate in meetings with the RSA.  We will note that item.  The matter has been well aired.</p></speech>

It is a transport matter but RSA issues have come before the committee.  This is another element of much previous correspondence.  We will just note it and we are not taking any further action on it.</p> <p>  No. 2573C is from an individual, dated 6 November 2019, requesting the committee to enquire about the international numbering system and procurement relating to the public services card.  The committee requested information regarding procurement following the recent meeting with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I propose we forward a link to the transcript of the meeting to the correspondent and we will make further inquiries regarding the numbering system.  At our meeting next week, we will also have the response on matters raised with the Department and we can also forward this to the correspondent.  There is information on the way from the Department about the public services card and we will have it next week.  We will inform the individual accordingly.</p> <p>  No. 2582C is from an individual and is related to the school transport scheme.  The individual has previously corresponded with the committee.  At our meeting on 21 November 2019, we agreed to request further information from the Department regarding the accounting arrangements for the scheme.  I propose to note this item for the time being until we receive the further information from the Department.  We have asked the Department whether the scheme is in surplus and the details arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General report.  When we get the reply from the Department, we can forward it to the individual.</p> <p>  No. 2584C is from an individual, dated 28 November 2019, who is making some points about the Oireachtas printing equipment, as many people have.  We have arrangements in place for more detailed information to be submitted to the committee in advance of next week's meeting.  The Secretary General and the Office of Public Works are on stand-by in the event that the committee decides it wants to meet them next Thursday afternoon.  That matter will be discussed in correspondence at a minimum next week.</p></speech>

We have already discussed this.</p><p> Next is No. 2586 from Deputy Cullinane, dated 25 November, providing details of the methodology for the application of commercial rates to Irish Water.  We discussed the global valuation regarding Irish Water at our meeting on 21 November and have requested that the Valuation Office provide further information on the rateable valuation of Irish Water apportioned to each county from when it was established to when the global valuation was determined.  We will note Deputy Cullinane&rsquo;s correspondence and wait for a response.  It is clear from the document provided to the committee by the Deputy that the apportionment is done strictly on a population basis and is not based on the facilities in a particular local authority's area.</p></speech>

The Valuation Office had no choice and had to value the water assets in those local authority areas.  Waterford was given an allocation of &euro;4.7 million, but when the allocation was based on population, that figure dropped to &euro;1.3 million.  It was a substantial cut in funding to the councils in question, and that is something of a sore point.  There were winners and losers.  Some local authorities gained substantially.  There is an unfairness, given that the figures are locked in.  Local authorities had that funding since 2013.  Now they have to increase rates to make up the difference.</p> <p>  I am seeking more information on the matter and a justification as to why the Valuation Office used this process.  It is generally used for large infrastructural utilities.</p></speech>

In 2013, Irish Water paid the rates.  From 2014 to date, it was paid by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the form of compensation to each local authority.  That is why I am seeking clarity.  My understanding is that there was a change in the legislation through the Water Services Act 2017, one that means Irish Water will pay the rates from next year onwards.  I wanted to clarify whether my understanding was right.</p></speech>

It is a policy issue.  I imagine that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had intended or hoped that Irish Water would be more commercial, but because of all the difficulties, Irish Water was not in a position to pay the rates or rates were not applied to it.  Instead, the Department paid the rates for the local authorities.  It has discontinued that payment now, leaving some local authorities high and dry and substantially down funding.</p></speech>

It was just money in, money out.  Through no fault of the local authorities, the Valuation Office had no choice but to rate the water infrastructure.  Waterford services the south east with wastewater treatment plants, but the apportionment is not based on those.  Rather, it is based on population.  The change was a kick to some local authorities.</p></speech>

I continue to be dissatisfied that we do not have oversight of Irish Water.  There were major transfers of infrastructure involved.  Somewhere in the region of &euro;11 billion in assets - some of them were liabilities - went to Irish Water.  We need to examine Irish Water's income, which is primarily from public funds.  It has an income from commercial water services, but we do not know what the collection rate is.  There are many elements that we need to examine.  Some local authorities applied significant development contributions that were used to build up those assets.  Now, they have found themselves with sizable deficits.</p> <p>  This all feeds into the question of the funding of local government.  While the issue under discussion is a specific one, we have been told numerous times that a cross-departmental group was working on local authorities' baselines, that there would be winners and losers and that the distribution of, for example, local property tax to fund local authorities would be reconfigured.  We were told by the Department earlier this year that the reconfiguration was imminent.  Even though a report has been provided, however, we are being told that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight must consider it before decisions can be made.  This is a gigantic issue in terms of the impact on local authorities' budgets, particularly in areas with rapidly growing populations.</p></speech>

This matter will be before us again, if not at next week's meeting, then in January.  We will ask the Department to clarify the matters that the Valuation Office will not be able to.  I have not seen this useful table that Deputy Cullinane has forwarded to us before.  It seems to have come from a report entitled, "AFM Report 29 Compensation Calculations - Rates Income Leakage and Irish Water rating".  Is this an Irish Water report?</p></speech>

We discussed previous correspondence from this individual on 14 November and advised the individual accordingly.  We provided details of who was at the meeting in question, as requested.  We will provide the information requested now that this correspondent has replied seeking further information. </p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 2594, is a letter from me, dated 13 November, providing a reply to a parliamentary question on carbon taxes for the information of the committee.  On foot of that, we might write to the Revenue Commissioners seeking details of the carbon tax collected under various headings in 2019.  We will request those figures as soon as possible when Revenue has the year-end figures in January.  Revenue always has the figures very shortly after the end of the year.  We will also request Revenue's projections for 2020 if we have not already asked for them.  We will discuss carbon tax collection and the use of those funds as soon as possible.  We will request those in January.  We will write to the Revenue Commissioners now asking for this information.  Revenue supplied information which was up to date at the time in response to that parliamentary question, but that was not at the year end.

This was mentioned before.  Vodafone and St. James's Hospital were fined by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, because of their failure to purchase and surrender carbon credits before the deadline.  We encountered that some time ago.  We asked the EPA's representatives about it when they appeared before the committee.  It has now appeared in the financial statement for St. James's Hospital.</p></speech>

We will note that as well as the issue of non-compliant procurement to which our attention has been drawn and the EPA fine.</p> <p>  No. 4.2 is the clear audit opinion for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The item following that, No. 4.3, is Pobal's 2018 accounts, which also feature non-compliant procurement.  We will send the standard letter to Pobal regardless of the fact that its representatives will be before us next Thursday.  Chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report examines Pobal's administration of the early learning and childcare funding programme.  That chapter is on our agenda for next week. </p> <p>  No. 4.2 is the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's 2018 financial statements, which we will discuss in public session in a few minutes.  The statement notes that the cost of superannuation entitlements is accounted for as they become available rather than in the year of entitlement, as is standard for health bodies.  We will raise that question in public session very shortly.  </p> <p>  The next matter for discussion is the committee's work programme.  Pobal's representatives will appear next Thursday to account for that organisation's expenditure and we will discuss the chapter from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report dealing with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We will decide on Thursday morning whether to have a separate session dealing with the Oireachtas printer and related matters.</p> <p>  For the first meeting in the new year on 16 January, we have pencilled in an engagement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Our second meeting will be with the Department of Education and Skills.  A meeting with the Office of Public Works has been provisionally arranged for 2 February.  There is a gap on 31 January next year, for which we will have a proposal next week.  That is as far as the work programme for next year has got.  </p> <p>  Chapter 8 of this year's report from the Comptroller and Auditor General deals with controls over humanitarian assistance funding.  Irish Aid operates a humanitarian assistant programme which falls under Vote 27, international co-operation, and is managed by the Department.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges the challenges in effectively distributing aid in such circumstances.  The total amount involved was &euro;792 million in 2018.  We can very easily examine everything that happens here in the jurisdiction but it is important to occasionally examine how taxpayer's money is spent overseas.  The difficulties in Syria and Yemen account for approximately a quarter of the total aid.  In light of that, I suggest that in the new year, if we are all here, the committee should consider a visit to one of the overseas aid projects.  We did that some years ago.  Perhaps at this point we can agree in principle to let the secretariat make some provisional arrangements.</p><p>It would be helpful if we agree, in principle, to let the secretariat make provisional arrangements.  There is no decision to go yet.  We will see how the provisional arrangements work out and they can be discussed here after the break.  We may chose to go or not to go.  As I said, it is that part of expenditure that is expended outside the State, which is worth intermittent scrutiny not every year but on occasion, and we can decide to do that.</p></speech>

Representatives of Pobal will be here next Thursday to deal with Pobal's annual financial statements.  It works for various Government Departments.  Its main Department is the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I inadvertently suggested that we would be dealing with Chapter 16 - Early Learning and Childcare Programmes, which is a matter for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The chapter in question will not be the specific item for discussion next week.  Deputies can read the chapter and anything relating to Pobal's administration of the scheme can be discussed next week.  I want to confirm that officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will not be here next week.  They can deal with childcare programme issues at a separate meeting of the committee.  Pobal, which covers a range of Departments, will be the primary focus of our examination next Thursday.  Any of the schemes it administers under any Department can be discussed at that meeting.  I just wanted to clarify that.</p></speech>

This afternoon, we will meet representatives of the HSE to discuss primary care centres and other matters.  This morning, we are dealing with 2018 financial statements of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  As we last met representatives of the board on 16 May 2019, it is timely that we are engaging with them again on the management of the children's hospital project and the associated costs of this key capital project for the State.  In the committee's sixth periodic report, we made a number of recommendations relating to and arising from our previous meetings on the 2017 accounts.  Today's meeting gives us an opportunity to review the progress that has been made in addressing these issues.</p><p>We are joined this morning by Mr. David Gunning, who is the chief executive officer of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  I think this is the first time he has attended a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He is welcome.  Mr. Gunning is accompanied by Mr. Fred Barry, who is the chairperson of the board; Mr. Jim Farragher, who is the board's finance officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, who is the board's project director; and Dr. Emma Curtis, who is the board's medical director.  We are also joined this morning by Mr. Jim Breslin, who is the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  He is accompanied by Mr. Barry McGreal, who is a principal officer in the new children's hospital unit of the Department, and Mr. Liam Morris of the Department's acute hospitals division.  Ms Pamela Carter, who is a principal officer in the Department, and Ms Anna Wallace, who is an assistant principal in the Department, are also in attendance.  We are also joined this morning by Mr. Dean Sullivan of the HSE chief strategy office and by Mr. Jim Curran, who is the head of estates with the HSE.  Mr. Paul de Freine, who is the HSE's chief architectural adviser, is also in attendance.  We are also joined this morning by Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, who is the chief executive of Children's Health Ireland.  All of the witnesses are very welcome.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to turn all mobile phones off.  That means putting them into airplane mode.  Merely putting them on silent can still interfere with the recording system.  I wish to advise all witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

When they have been commissioned, all three facilities will be operated by Children's Health Ireland, which was formally established with effect from 1 January 2019.  To date, the development board has been funded fully by State grants provided by the HSE.  In 2018, the board's expenditure amounted to &euro;127.6 million, representing an addition to the value of fixed assets recorded in the financial statements.  Total accumulated project capital costs to the end of 2018 amounted to just under &euro;260 million, inclusive of VAT.</p></speech>

In common with other public sector health bodies, the Minister requires that pension entitlements earned by employees are accounted for as they become payable.  The reporting standard requires that such obligations are recognised in the period when they are incurred.  I am satisfied that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the board&rsquo;s affairs, except for that one departure from the standard, but I am obliged to give a qualified audit opinion in the circumstances.</p><p>The financial statements were certified by me on 24 October 2019.</p></speech>

I am joined here today by Mr. David Gunning, chief officer, Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer, Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director, and Mr. Phelim Devine, project director.</p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  A planning application was lodged in 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in 2016 for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, and the two paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres - one already complete and operational at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown and a second under construction at Tallaght University Hospital. </p> <p>  Following the approval of a guaranteed maximum price in December 2018, the NPHDB provided the Committee of Public Accounts in January 2019 with a breakdown of costs approved by Government for the design, build and equipping of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The agreed investment decision is &euro;1.433 billion.  The investment decision approved at the time was exclusive of residual risks as was communicated at the time of approval.  These exceptions were also set out within the PwC report published in April.  As pointed out by PwC, some of these risks are under our control and some are not.  We are actively managing those under our control while monitoring those that are not. </p> <p>  The 2018 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 24 October 2019.  The expenditure as at 31 December 2018 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;127,603,801.  An analysis of expenditure to 31 December 2017 and 2018 is included in the opening statement submitted to the committee.  </p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to give members an update on the construction progress; those of you who have had the opportunity to visit the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital &ndash; or indeed any of you that have passed by the site recently - will have seen the progress that has been achieved.  Across the 12 acre site the excavation, piling, and the structural frame to the underground basement for campus-wide facilities management, energy centre, and the 1,000 space underground carpark are nearing completion and the first window has actually been installed in the hospital.  Well over 1 million sq. ft. of slabs have been poured.  Mr. Gunning will give the committee some further detail on the construction shortly.  The outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown was handed over to our colleagues in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for operational commissioning earlier this year, and since we last met services have commenced there.    </p> <p>  Since I appeared before the committee in May, there have been a number of changes in leadership, and in relation to project governance.  Following a competitive process overseen by the Public Appointments Service, Mr. David Gunning was appointed as chief officer in September and Mr. Phelim Devine was appointed project director in October.  We have additionally added to the capabilities of the project team by engaging expertise in a number of areas.  We have reorganised the board committee structure to focus our attention on what will be our critical challenges over the coming years.  As a result of the resignation of a number of board members this year, there are vacancies on the board.  These positions were advertised via the Public Appointments Service, and we understand that a shortlist of potential candidates will be submitted to the Minister in December.             </p> <p>  We report to the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme, CHP&amp;P, steering group on a monthly basis, providing comprehensive updates on all aspects of the project, and we also report to the CHP&amp;P board. </p></speech>

There are quite a few different strands in the development of the hospital, including our colleagues in Children's Health Ireland who will operate the hospital; there is input on the ICT side from other parties and there are many issues around staffing and so on.  There is a very broad array of interests and stakeholders in the project.  There is considerable interest in the project on all fronts from the Department of Health and the HSE and that reports right up to the Minister.  There is a steering group which meets monthly to track and co-ordinate progress from all the different parties including ourselves but going far beyond ourselves and a board oversees that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for his welcome.</p> <p>  I thought, building on what Mr. Barry has pointed out here, that I would show some photographic evidence, if that can be put up on the slides here.  It is there.  We sent it in in advance just to show here.  I have a number of photographs and I would just like to talk the members of the committee through the work that is going on.</p> <p>  For an orientation point of view, the first photograph is taken from the north end, looking south towards the Dublin mountains.  One can see in this photograph, starting on the right-hand side, this U-shaped road which comes in from South Circular Road, comes all around the perimeter of the children's hospital site and eventually appears over on the left-hand side into St. James's.  That is the new access road, into the hospital and into the St. James's campus.</p></speech>

This is access for the emergency services, in and out, and all traffic, in and out.</p> <p>  This is a view of the 12-acre site.  One does not get to see a lot on this and I guess the access road is the key point.</p> <p>  I would like to move on to the next slide.  This is taken, again, looking in that same direction, but the key point here is we are starting to see a hospital emerging from the building site.  To talk about some of the areas here, one will see the area, "Concourse", that is labelled there in the centre of the photograph.  That will be, if you like, the main street up through the hospital.  One may remember that from previous presentations or models.  Again, to emphasise, that street is the length of Grafton Street, as a reference point.  Off that street, there is a multi-storey on each side.  We see on the left, going from bottom to top, we have the decontamination unit, radiology above that, critical care and then the various therapy rooms along that.  On the right, these are the fingers that one will notice if one drives by the South Circular Road.  They will be the outpatient departments.  Above that, we have cardiology, a surgical ward or other therapies, and the haematology and oncology ward on the top, and others will go on top of that.  Down on the bottom left, one will see a plant room is being constructed.  That is the location of the former access road, which has now been practically fully excavated.  That is a recent milestone that we have passed.  That plant room there will provide energy and various other services to the building.  Again, to emphasise, we are starting to see a hospital emerge from the building site.</p> <p>  If I could have the next one, please.  It is hard to see some of this in red.  Again, to show the scale, one will see the workers in the foreground there laying out reinforcing bar, rebar, in advance of a concrete pour.  Right above them, one sees B2, which is basement 2, basement 1 above that.  There is lower-ground floor, ground floor, levels 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Just beside the "L" on level 4, one starts to see some columns emerging that are the start of the supports for levels 5, 6 and 7.  An enormous amount of work has been achieved.  I will say probably the progress is not as much as we would like but we are making quite considerable progress.  That gives the scale from basement 2 all the way up to what has been done.</p> <p>  The next slide shows the view if one drives along South Circular Road.  The old entrance is where that traffic warden is on the left-hand side at the break in the timber there.  Again, one can see these three different figures that stick out.  What one cannot see because of the scaffolding is that we now have facade going up on these particular buildings.  Mr. Barry mentioned there is one window in.  Now tens of windows have gone in, even in the past week.  There is quite a lot of progress.  The outpatients are over on this side.  Gardens will be on top of this to provide a healing environment for the children and their families.  I mentioned previously the haematology and oncology there on the left, as that will go three more storeys on top of those fingers for the wards and other locations.</p> <p>  The next slide gives another view.  There is a lot of scaffolding there which is paving the way for facade, insulation, etc., that get affixed to the structure along with the windows.  That is the north block, which is probably the slower part of the build but is moving along now at a fair degree of pace.</p> <p>  The next slide shows the view from close to the offices that we occupy in Herberton, beside Fatima Luas stop.  The Luas runs along there from left to right and the other side of the fence is our view of the building.  To the left of that will be where the helipad is located and in there we see a so-called "linear park", which is a development along the Luas which provides a nice environment there for the local community.</p> <p>  On the next slide, just going into some of the mechanical and electrical detail, a lot of work has been done in this particular area and it is not all just concrete and steel.  On the left-hand side, one can see lagged pipes up towards the top with the silver coating on them.  Those are all for steam and hot water.  On the fire protection in the centre, the red pipes are the already-installed sprinkler system for the areas that have been developed.</p><p>A large number of air handling units have been installed in the level two basement, which will provide ventilation and various other services related to air quality in the entire hospital.  Basement level one is a car park and is practically complete, only requiring some lining up and finishing.  The final slide shows the orientation of the hospital from a height.  As one looks through the main street of the hospital, one can see in the distance, if one's eyesight is very good, a couple on the roof of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  This will all be enclosed eventually.  These photographs are two weeks old.  We had a presentation from the design team on Tuesday that showed even more progress than we are showing here today.  I wanted to share those photographs with the committee to give an indication of the progress made to date.  </p><p> As I went through the slides, I spoke about insulation.  The sustainability of the hospital has been raised in the past.  I wish to emphasise that the hospital is being built to the highest standard set out by the Building Research Establishment, BRE.  It will reach the "excellent" rating for energy performance and sustainability or the building energy rating, BER, A-3 standard.  This means that there will be a 60% to 70% reduction in the energy costs of this hospital in comparison to the existing hospitals being operated by CHI, which is significant.  </p><p> Mr. Barry mentioned the outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital and construction is also ongoing at Tallaght University Hospital.  The CHI unit at Connolly is open and is delivering services.  Almost 2,000 children have attended urgent care clinics and 1,000 outpatient appointments have taken place since the opening.</p><p> The images do not convey the full reality of what is going on and the scale of it.  In that context, we would be delighted to host a visit from the committee as a group or as individuals.  That invitation stands and we would welcome such a visit.</p></speech>

Mr. Barry said that some risks are under the board's control and some are not.   We are interested in the items that are not in the &euro;1.433 billion budget, which will ultimately be a cost to the taxpayer.  There seems to be a suggestion that these items are separate from the &euro;1.433 billion budget but these are the items with which we are concerned.

However, that budget is not the full budget at all because there are lots of issues outside of the board's control.  He has not said a single syllable about them.  That is important in the context of our role.  I am just making that point because I want the other members to come in.

I have a concern as well because what we got was a presentation on the build which is nothing to do with our job.  That is for the health committee.  The witnesses are before the Committee of Public Accounts and what we expect is up-to-date information on costs, with proper breakdowns.  We have many questions and I hope we will get the answers.  If we do not get those answers today, then I do not know why Mr. Barry has come in.  He and his team should have been aware of what this committee does and what it expects of witnesses who come before it.  Given what I have just heard and the questions put by the Chairman, I have concerns but I will reserve judgment until I put my questions.  I hope that when I do so, I will get an adequate response.</p></speech>

That is what we all want.  However, what we are here today to do is determine if accountability is emerging.

I hope they can zoom in on that rather than just showing us lovely pictures.</p></speech>

Note No.11 in the 2018 accounts on page 27 refers to contingent liabilities.  Those liabilities are not quantified.  Liabilities have been incurred, the value of which has yet to be determined.  This is referenced in the 2018 accounts.  We need details, fleshed out, on what those contingent liabilities are in respect of accounts signed off 11 months ago.  They are relevant to the 2018 accounts and we need to know more about them.  I am sure the witnesses can see where we are coming from.

We have said previously and I repeat that it is very likely that some of those risks will come to pass but they have not hit us as yet during this year.

Mr. Barry said that currently approximately 50% of those claims have been processed.  Most of them were the smaller claims.  The other 50% of claims are outstanding and further claims will be submitted over the next three years and beyond.  In that context, how can he say that there is a GMP when contractors' claims are being submitted on an ongoing basis and will be for years to come?  He said recently it could be 2024 or later before the final accounts are ready and we know what is what.</p></speech>

Mr. Barry made reference that the PwC had given a range for inflation, but in the minutes of the most recent meeting of the board, which is online, it says the board discussed the risks associated with inflation.</p></speech>

It was the PwC report that had given the rate of inflation at the time.  When Mr. Barry was questioned at the health committee last week, that was very evident.  The public need is not served by Mr. Barry redacting the information and the two reasons he gave have amounted to nothing.  Anyway, people can see that for themselves.</p></speech>

If one gets to four years, it is difficult.  I know certainly in the private sector, in which I am very involved at the moment, nobody will give fixed price contracts for large amounts for such a long-term contract as this one.</p></speech>

One will get fixed prices readily enough for two or three years.  With inflation rising, getting out to four years is very difficult and certainly, one will not get bigger contractors to give fixed prices for anything going beyond that without an inflationary adjustment for a project lasting seven or eight years.  I do not think one would get that in a public or private project.</p></speech>

The contractor can put in endless claims.  There is no restriction on the amount a contractor can actually come looking for.  If one has a contract in place, as we have, which covers the vast majority of the costs out there, then it is not as though the guaranteed maximum price bears no relationship to the end costs or that billions of euro of extra costs can arise; they cannot.  As I have said before, the contractor will make claims, we will resist them and it will be a surprise if some of those claims do not stick before the jobs is over.</p></speech>

With that response, it is fair to say that the &euro;1.7 billion is aspirational rather than a reality.</p> <p>  At the committee last week, Mr. Barry said that some contractors tend to approach claims differently.  Some make claims that can be managed and substantiated, hence 50% of claims are done while another 50% are not done.  Mr. Barry said that other contractors would make more inflated claims.  This is what Mr. Barry said at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  What record has the contractor BAM in this regard?  Given the use of this particular procurement model for the first time ever in a public build, I assume that the board would have examined this at an early stage.  </p></speech>

This is not just a children's hospital matter, it is a more general matter.  I am aware that some of the relevant Departments are working on this issue currently and may come up with an approach that will allow the purchasing agencies to reflect and include consideration of past performance a little better than can be done at the moment.  Right now, under the rules that are there, essentially if contractors meet the pre-qualification criteria, one cannot stop them tendering.  If they tender and their tender is the most economically advantageous, then they have to be awarded the contract.  There is a challenge there, certainly.</p></speech>

This was done in 2015 and they were pre-qualified around the end of 2015.  We tendered the project in 2016.  On the criteria against which they were assessed, past performance was not one of the criteria.  Obviously, financial capability, record and experience were some of the criteria.  My understanding of public procurement, which complied with EU rules at that stage in 2015, is that one cannot preclude a contractor from tendering for a project based on their past performance in the context of relationship or claims history, as Mr. Barry has already outlined</p></speech>

Different parishes or locations around the country or different ETBs could be involved.  Deputy Catherine Murphy will be aware of one project in my constituency and in her county in respect of which references were granted and a person who was not short-listed was not given an opportunity to comment on the adverse reference they were given.  They took the case to court and, because they were not given an opportunity to comment on what they felt was not a good recommendation from a previous employer, the tendering had to start again.  What this demonstrates to me is that, as far as the public sector is concerned, the Department of Education and Skills has a budget, builds &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million worth of schools and has a practice of getting references from previous employers that engaged those contracts.  I am now surprised to hear that while that happens on school projects, the Department of Health does not seem to know anything about it when it comes to the children's hospital or does not even know whether that practice exists in the public sector.

If there are weaknesses on the State side, it is not the fault of the contractor that puts in for tender.  If it wins in conciliation or in a court case, it is legally entitled to that and cannot be prevented from future work.  It has done everything, as it sees it, legally and properly.  The onus then is on public bodies contracting to make sure that their systems are tight and close, that decisions are made in a timely way and that processes are followed.

They may have been.  I need to go back and clarify that as part of the pre-qualfication process Mr. Curran talked about, that cannot be taken into account.  We have just had that discussion.  The other bit of information I would like to add is that the process we undertook through pre-qualification and the tender process was fully compliant with both public rules and European rules on procurement.  We independently audited that to that effect as well.</p></speech>

I refer to what was said about past performance in the private sector.  Whoever said it laughed straight away.  Of course past performance comes into it, but not in the public sector.</p> <p>  My next question is about delays.  Last week in the health committee Mr. Barry gave the impression that there were fairly minor delays with the build, but when he was pressed later on he mentioned there was a deadline to remove and replace a road that was causing a delay.  Can he give us a bit of information about that and any other delays?</p></speech>

When I was first before this committee and indeed the health committee, around May or so of last year, the main contractor was behind schedule by weeks.  I said at the time that it was well within the contractor's compass to make up that time.  I said last week and I will say again to this committee that it is unfortunately the case that the contractor has not made up that time - not only that, but it has slipped further weeks.  As an example of where this would show up on a milestone in work to date, the removal of the old road that crossed the centre of the site was a milestone in the ongoing activity.  Its removal took place a couple of months later than it would have taken place had it been done per the contracted programme.  The work going on at the moment is primarily the pouring of concrete: the concrete frame, the columns, the slabs and so on.  There is other work going on around the site as well.</p></speech>

I was curious because what Mr. Barry said at the health committee about minor delays did not tally with what Mr. Reid, I think, from the HSE said.  There were media reports going back to last September that an internal memo in the HSE had stated that capital project for the new children's hospital is facing delays to the construction programme which could impact critical timelines if mitigation measures are not taken.  I presume the NPHDB has taken those stringent mitigation measures.  I ask Mr. Barry to outline to the committee what they are.</p></speech>

What we are doing about that is we are working very closely with the contractor on the details of the programme.  Just to step back a little bit, at the time of contract the contractor puts forward a programme scheduling the works as to how he is going to get from the start of the construction to the end within the timeline set out in the contract.  As the work unfolds there are normally changes to that programme.  Some things get ahead and some things get behind but in everything things are rarely done exactly in accordance with that programme.  The contractor comes up with new programmes and rescheduling of the work.  The contractor is developing new programmes at the moment and we are working very closely with him to ensure that those programmes are consistent with the contract.</p></speech>

The Contractors understand the contractual relationships better than the NPHDB, allowing them to exploit opportunities to increase prices."  Is that not more or less saying they can make buck eejits out of the entire board?  Have they made fools of the board?  I have cited what the report refers to as one of the controllable risks.</p></speech>

Before I put questions to our witnesses I want to make the following clear.  I do not like witnesses taking a casual approach to the Committee of Public Accounts and getting irritated when questions are put.  I very much hope that there will be a step change as the meeting progresses because we can stay here and ask a second, third and fourth round of questions, if needs be.</p> <p>  I am also disappointed that we have not got additional information on what we received last year, which is a point that the Chairman made at the start of the meeting.  We are here to hold the witnesses to account in terms of governance, accountability and spend, and the control mechanisms that are in place.  I will concentrate on all of that.  I will go under the bonnet to see what is actually happening and, hopefully, get responses to my questions.  If I do not get responses then we will stay for a second and third round of questions because this is a very important issue.  We are here to do a job and we must do it.</p> <p>  I shall start with the guaranteed maximum price.  Mr. Barry said, in response to Deputy Munster, that the price of &euro;1.433 billion is guaranteed in the context of the agreed framework and contract and there are residual risks that are outside of that.  The &euro;1.433 billion that is guaranteed is only what is guaranteed in terms of what is within the framework of the contract.  Is that correct?      </p></speech>

What the public expect and hear when one says there is a "guaranteed maximum price" is that not a cent more above the &euro;1.433 billion will be spent because we have a guaranteed maximum price.  When most lay people hear the words "guaranteed" and "maximum" they will think that is the price and the amount will not go beyond that but that is not the case.  Can we at least accept as a start that the guaranteed maximum price is a qualified maximum price and that it is possible if not likely that the price will be higher than &euro;1.433 billion?</p></speech>

Additional cost claims that can be made by the developer were mentioned.  A developer may make a claim but it does not necessarily mean they will be paid so one has to go into a negotiation, there will be a barter and they may or may not be paid.  I assume that is what Mr. Barry was talking about.  There are residual risks and because of them there may well be additional cost claims.  If that is the case, if Mr. Barry agrees with that, can he outline the areas in which there is the possibility of a risk in terms of additional costs?</p></speech>

I would just add to it because the contractor's claims are not restricted to what we would call residual risks.

We should have the information.  I do not see any issue with it.  If there is to be an additional cost, my estimate is it will be approximately &euro;40 million.  I am not an expert but it is my estimate in light of what inflation will be.</p> <p>  I will ask a question rather than giving my view, which Mr. Barry might consider unfair.  Is it the case that the minutes were redacted and he does want to give us the information because he does not want a headline to result from a meeting of the committee to the effect that the cost will higher than &euro;1.433 billion?  It goes back to the issue the Chairman raised earlier, namely, that we are not getting any additional information because there is a preciousness over the cost.  For understandable reasons, the costs have escalated and the board discussed the matter.  We have a responsibility to probe the information.  We have a version of the minutes that has been redacted in respect of what is clearly either another cost overrun or an additional cost, yet Mr. Barry is not in a position to tell us the figure.  I do not know why and I can only surmise.  Is it because he does not want, at this point, the public and the committee to know there could be an additional cost of at least &euro;40 million for construction inflation?</p></speech>

First, it is already in the public domain, and we referenced the figures in the PwC report, that if inflation is over 4%, there will be extra costs over the &euro;1.433 billion.  I reiterate that inflation this year is running at about 7%.  It is an absolute certainty that we will pay extra money on foot of that inflation.  If inflation runs at 7% for the life of the project, the total additional cost from inflation will be in the order of &euro;50 million.  If it is higher, it will be more, while if it is less, it will be less.  There is no suggestion on our part that there is not going to be an additional cost from inflation over the &euro;1.433 billion.  If I have given the impression that we think there will not be a cost through inflation, I did not mean to give that impression.</p></speech>

Part of our considerations at the moment are around how much we will pay for this year.  We have a pretty good idea in that regard but there will be some negotiations around it.  For the committee's interest, assuming inflation stays at 7% this year, depending on how much is paid in invoices at the end of the year and the exact figure, the additional cost for 2019 will be in the order of &euro;2 million or &euro;2.2 million.  We will not have the exact figures until we get the indices, which will come out-----</p></speech>

I do not take minutes of those meetings.  The records that are kept of those meetings are kept by the civil servants supporting the Minister.

Surely from a good governance perspective, there will be somebody present to take minutes of the meetings.  At the meetings, does Mr. Barry discuss the potential of increased costs in terms of some of the residual risks or reasons there may be additional costs?

I am sure all those issues arise but I am asking whether Mr. Barry has ever had a discussion with the Minister at any of the meetings about the possibility of additional costs and the fact that there are risks.

The question arose last week about the recent meeting in November.  There is a record of that meeting.  It is on the file.  We record the meeting.  There was toing and froing as to whether the record was a minute.  A minute is usually signed off at a subsequent meeting and everybody agrees on it.  We do not do that at all the meetings where Ministers meet people.  We take our own record.  We place it on the file and that suffices for-----</p></speech>

That is a credible answer.  I have no difficulty with the answer but the difficulty concerns where there are additional costs.  We should remember the history of this project.  There were additional costs, and questions were asked about when Ministers knew or did not.  There was no suggestion that the Ministers had done anything wrong.  Let me outline what creates suspicion and difficulties.  Let us just say there are additional costs, that they have been discussed at meetings with the Minister and that a future Committee of Public Accounts is looking for notes of minutes and is told there were none, or that there was a note that was not a minute-----</p></speech>

It would be better for the Minister.  How many times has the HSE found itself in a position where there were difficulties over record-keeping and minutes, and what was in them and what was not?  If clear minutes are taken, there is no issue.</p></speech>

The Deputy will have seen over the course of this project that there has been no lack of record-keeping.  We published all of that.  It went to PwC.  It showed the timeline of all the escalations and the information.  There is a record of the most recent meeting too.</p></speech>

It relates to what Deputy Munster said earlier.  The BAM report is in some respects quite damning regarding the board.  I do not refer to Mr. Barry; I refer to the previous incarnation of the board.  I acknowledge he said there have been a number of changes.  It is stated that the contractors - in this case, BAM - understand the contractual relationships better than the development board, allowing them to exploit opportunities to increase prices.  It is quite incredible that this is what PwC arrived at.  I would like Mr. Barry's or Mr. Breslin's understanding of it.  My layman's reading of it is that there may have been a lack of expertise in regard to how the contract works and cost controls.  If there are many potential additional claims, people are needed who have the experience and knowledge to address them.  PwC's view is that the contractors understand the contractual relationships better than the development board.</p></speech>

I know that the development board has substantially enhanced its claims-management process and has brought expertise into the board to support it in that regard.  It has stronger control systems in place post-PwC than would have been in place at the time.</p></speech>

I have one or two questions arising from the opening statement.  One of the things we do is try to decode language or spot things that may imply something that one expects to mean something different.  I have two questions in that regard.  The first is on the Blanchardstown facility.  It was handed over to CHI.  Since we last met, services have commenced there.  When will they be fully operational?  Knowing that will give us some sort of an idea as to how the children's hospital will work when fully operational.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.  This is the first time representatives of CHI have been before the committee.</p><p> Children's Health Ireland is a State body established under the Children's Health Act 2018 and a section 38 organisation under the health Act, which means it is commissioned to provide services under the HSE via an annual service arrangement.  Children's Health Ireland commenced operation in January 2019.  Our main role is to provide services to approximately 336,000 children who turn up to our paediatric services at Crumlin Hospital, Temple Street hospital, Tallaght Hospital and the new facility at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown which opened in July.  These four services operate as one organisation, led by one board and one management team.  We provide services through 4,000 staff, working through 39 different clinical specialties, to the sickest children of 25% of the population and all of the children in the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

There are two major elements to it, namely, outpatients and urgent care.  Outpatients is fully operational, Monday to Friday, 9.a.m. to 6 p.m, providing general paediatric services.  It is building up its services incrementally and it is working very well.  In regard to urgent care, we have had challenges in recruiting emergency medicine consultants.  When the facility opened, we had seven new emergency medicine consultants, which is a great increase, but due to unplanned leave and an inability to find locums, we could not expand the opening hours beyond Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The facility closes at 8 p.m. but it takes approximately three hours to clear the department of patients.</p></speech>

We have a pipeline of consultants coming in over 2020.  When they come on board, we will be able to expand the service.  Between now and then, what we are trying to do is increase the hours-----</p></speech>

Many of the issues in regard to this facility are matters for the Joint Committee on Health.  I am trying to deal with matters relevant to this committee.  We are building a hospital that is to be completed on a particular date from the point of view of BAM and other contractors walking off the site and the hospital being handed over.  The operation of this facility gives us some idea of the likely challenges of getting that hospital fully operational.  I will move on.</p> <p>  The second issue arising from the opening statement is the updates on all aspects of project delivery.  Controlling costs is critically important.  A lengthy list of technicians is involved in the project, including quantity surveyors, architectural technicians, valuation officers and portfolio planners.  I would like Mr. Gunning to elaborate on the role of each of these professionals and if that role changes over time.  We are all interested in containing cost overruns or even reducing some costs.  What are the prospects of that happening?</p></speech>

The Chairman made an interesting point about the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board when he said, "They go way when the development is over."  The organisation has been set up for a specific purpose and it is staffed by a wide range of contractors and consultants on a particular basis, including a design team of over 200 from whom we purchase services.  We have people closer to the organisation who are part of the national paediatric hospital organisation.  These are known as constructive management services and they provide an array of different services on site.  We also buy in specialist services from others.  Deputy Murphy is correct that there is a lengthy list of urban planners, healthcare planners, architects, building engineers, civil and structural engineers and so on.</p> <p>  In the design team we have, predominantly, a large number of architects.  BDP is the lead architectural firm.  It also provides what is know as the employers' representative function.  We have quantity surveyors from Linesight, who measure costs and do various other activities.  The ARUP company provides mechanical and electrical, primarily design verification, services and supervises implementation of that on site.  We then have an organisation called OCSE Civil and Structural Work looking at all the structural design, the concrete, the steel and the pulling together of the whole thing.  They are the range of services within the project.</p></speech>

It is well staffed but it is pretty lean.  We do not have any surplus staff.  In terms of administration, there is administration in all of the key areas but it is around contract administration and claims administration.  As we are engaged in processes that are legal or quasi-legal in terms of conciliation and arbitration, it is really important that there is excellent record keeping and we are in a position to find information.  We have strengthened the team and our software support and so on to enable that.</p></speech>

Leaving aside building inflation and other issues arising from design changes, the project is on course to complete at a cost of &euro;1.43 billion.  In terms of this table, are there variations from what was presented last year?  If the witnesses do not have that information to hand, they might provide the committee with an updated table of the profile of changes at a later date.</p></speech>

We could then see where changes are taking place.  In respect of our periodic report, there were 11 recommendations from the PwC report.  Have they all been implemented at this stage?</p></speech>

Some of the recommendations are broader and perhaps the Secretary General might want to speak to those.  The development board has implemented all the recommendations made that are addressed to us.</p></speech>

Approvals were given for those and recruitment done.  The two recommendations that relate to major capital projects in general, not specifically the national children's hospital, are relevant to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is on the record as saying it is taking them into account in how it is going to revise the public spending code.  I think the Chairman referenced the fact that they have updated the committee on that and expect to conclude it shortly.  As an addendum to that, I also identified earlier that as soon as we have that, at the same time as the public spending code concludes, we would intend to revise our overarching governance structures to make sure we are fully in line with the public spending code.  That will streamline the bit above the development board in Children's Health Ireland, which people have commented on.  I think they are fair comments.</p></speech>

It engaged external expertise and technical support, according to today's briefing paper, and &euro;35.1 million has been invested across the workstreams.  There is long-term investment there.  That was between 2016 and 2019.  Given that Children's Health Ireland has not employed many of the people who will run the services in Blanchardstown, is this work concluded?  Is it delayed by virtue of the fact that Children's Health Ireland does not have the staffing fully in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#T00900"><p>Again to give the context for that, I outlined what we do on a day-to-day basis, which is delivering services across four sites in Dublin.  In addition to that, we are actually client to the project.  For the last six years, we have been working with the development board inputting into the design of the hospital.  We have inputted into the business cases and the ICT that is required to deliver this hospital.  When the business case was approved by Government in 2017, we clearly indicated that we had to bring on expertise to take on the client role to support the design and development of the hospital.  What I have included in those costs are, for example, we have set up a new entity, Children's Health Ireland.  We have had to dissolve the boards of two other voluntary hospitals and dissolve those organisations.  All of the legal work and what we call the pre-commencement assessment and review process make up some of those costs.  That is expertise in mergers, for example, and legal expertise that we would not have in Children's Health Ireland.  Like the development board, these are short-term initiatives that we had to do.  Besides providing the services to children - I appreciate that the work we are doing is challenging and we badly need this hospital because of that - we have to integrate the three children's hospitals.  When we looked at major projects like this, there are not many in the world that merge three hospitals and then move them into a new hospital.  If we do not get the integration correct, there will be challenges around that.  We are working with the staff to get our clinical and corporate processes aligned and to align how we actually operate.  This investment has been around standardising our models of care and a significant amount of it has been around ICT.  That is the other remit we have.  We are implementing projects now in the children's hospitals as single instances that we move into the children's hospital.  It is investment that we need to make now to make it happen.</p></speech>

The vast majority of people will understand that money needs to be spent on that side and on the physical side.  The greatest disappointment is the delay in the facility becoming fully operational.  What work is Children's Health Ireland doing to minimise the delay in opening the new national children's hospital or can that even be done at this stage?  I know it is a few years away but clearly there is a learning curve here in respect of this delay.  What is Children's Health Ireland doing and what can be done?</p></speech>

This integration is about merging hospitals and we know from national and international experiences that this can be a challenge.  Something like 75% of mergers do not achieve success.  Very early on, we were working on the process to be commenced as a single organisation, which we have just done this year.  A significant amount of investment was to make that happen.  When we opened up Connolly it afforded us an opportunity to have, for example, a single, unique identifier for all of the patients in Children's Health Ireland.  That means that the patients can go to any of our facilities and the staff can see their records.  It is a really important safety issue and also it is a really important matter when we are under pressure.  We are now actually moving the patients and the staff around to where the resources are.  We have invested-----</p></speech>

It has already been demonstrated by our waiting lists.  The Deputy is right that we have long waiting lists.  For example, general paediatrics is one of the services in which we have invested.  They have developed new ways of working and are now using an automated system to look at their patients.  In the last six months, we have reduced our general paediatrics waiting list by 35%.  That has been done because the paediatricians are working across the cities and we are managing-----</p></speech>

The most important part of it, I would say, is that we have some long waiters and we started with them first.  Our long waiting lists, meaning anything over 12 months, which is the target set by the HSE and which should be shorter, we have managed to reduce that by 65% in five months.  The reason we have done it is that we have new ways of working and new facilities open.</p><p>That is really important because these new ways of working are-----</p></speech>

I acknowledge the experience of Deputy O'Connell and other families, for which we apologise.  We are dealing with a significant pressure arising from the flu and respiratory illness winter season.  Without the unit at Connolly hospital, it would have been an awful lot worse.  That facility has allowed us to decompress some of the other emergency departments and move patients to wherever there are better facilities.  We have also been able to move staff.  That was possible because we have the same systems in place across the hospitals, so the staff are familiar with the set-up.  In addition, we have an IT system which shows where all the beds are in each hospital.  Our staff are now working in an integrated way.  The important point to emphasise is that it takes a lot of time to plan and put things in place, but it means we will be ready to get working when we move to the new hospital.</p></speech>

They seem to have been misadvised on that point.  The witnesses are here for the purposes of accountability.  We do not need to see photographs of a construction site.

We want moneys to be used efficiently so that so everyone can access a public health service.  That is why we are here.  The background to this is before my time but I understand the previous Committee of Public Accounts was assured that what happened before would never happen again.  Not alone has it happened again but it is just as bad as the first time.  I understand &euro;30 million or &euro;35 million was written off on the previous occasion and now we are dealing with the same issue again.  I do not need photographs of construction sites but I do need to know the cost of the overall project and when mistakes are made and that the witnesses are learning from those mistakes.  It is totally unacceptable to have that level of spending on the services of a public relations company.  It is an absolute waste of taxpayers' money.  The witnesses are here for the purposes of accountability.  Our work should be done in a polite way and none of our questions should be put in a personalised fashion.  However, the witnesses must be held to account at this committee and every committee before which they appear.  They do not need to consult a public relations company for that purpose.  There is something seriously wrong if they are resorting to that and, in this instance, they were ill advised on the question of producing photographs.</p> <p>  Mr. Gunning has undertaken to provide the committee with a breakdown of spending under the heading of communications and community engagement.  Spending on other professional fees was &euro;793,000 in 2018, which is a huge jump as far as I can see.  What does that expenditure include?  Does it include fees for external bodies?</p></speech>

Each of the three children's hospitals, as independent voluntary hospitals up until December of this year, had its own associated foundation.  As part of our merger and integration of the three hospitals, the foundations have agreed to merge into one foundation.  Speaking personally, I was delighted with that because I was the chief executive of a hospital - Tallaght Hospital - with three foundations.  That was a positive change.  The foundations were independent charities, but they were affiliated.  The new foundation's sole purpose is to raise funds for us.  Internationally, children's hospitals have a good reputation in that regard.</p></speech>

We already have this facility in Crumlin Hospital.  We have a 20-bed unit that has been run for the past 15 years and is a critical part of services for a children's hospital.  We also have another facility near Temple Street.  The charity is a part of a global network of charities that support family accommodation in children's hospitals.  We mapped out how many beds we required and the charity has identified the increased requirements.  There is a waiting list of families at the moment.

We removed that about four years ago.  If one is a private patient in a public hospital, even if one is not in a single room, it is a chargeable event and one can be charged for that.  That is the position as of today.</p> <p>  Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health know that policy will change, going forward.  Sl&aacute;intecare has said we should remove private practice from public hospitals.  We have commissioned a group, led by Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, that has issued and published its report which is under consideration.  The Minister has talked of his interest in taking an initiative, with consultants, to try to address the de Buitl&eacute;ir recommendations.  That is likely to change the mix of private practice in our public hospitals, if not entirely eliminate it.  The important thing is that the outpatient rooms that are being talked about as potentially available for private work are absolutely the same as all the other outpatient rooms.  If they are not needed for private work, they will be used for public patients.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell and I had a slight feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  We went around the houses last week but there are many more players today.  To be fair to Mr. Gunning and Mr. Barry, they have taken on a poisoned chalice, in a way.</p><p>Some of the questions at the Joint Committee on Health, especially to Mr. Gunning about his history and where he was before this, were probably a tad unfair.  I will not go anywhere near that.  Sometimes the most obvious question is that one that needs to be asked, so my first question is not to Mr. Barry or Mr. Gunning, but to Dr. Curtis, Mr. Devine, Mr. Breslin, Mr. McGreal, Mr. Farragher, Mr. Morris, Mr. Sullivan and Ms Hardiman.  "Reeling in the Years" is my favourite programme on television because it is a quick snapshot of a year in 25 minutes, with good music, usually, though not all the time.  I am showing my age but someone here is older than me.  We all know that the big issue here is the overrun in the costs of the hospital.  All of the people I have named are here to do a job.  Today is 5 December 2019, and could be played out on "Reeling in the Years" in the future, hence the link.  Is there anything that any of the witnesses want to say to us and to the public watching?  Are there any concerns that they would like to put on the record of the committee or to present to the public?  Is there anything at all in what they know at this point regarding concerns about the spend on or timelines for this hospital?  Do any of the witnesses have anything they would like to share with us?  Now is the time to say so.  If they do not say so, it is date-stamped.  If anyone I have referred to would like to share anything, please tell us now.</p></speech>

The other risk I flagged up, which was picked up in response to some of the questions from Deputy Catherine Murphy, relates to the staffing of the existing site.  That is small in comparison to the staffing of the new hospital.  We are seeking to mitigate all of those risks but those are the risks I would put on the table.</p></speech>

We have talked about them at the Joint Committee on Health and it has been publicly aired.  I will open this up to Mr. Barry and Mr. Gunning but, pardon the pun, they have probably been interrogated on this enough.  Does anybody else want to say anything publicly to Ireland that is not known, that people are not aware of, or any concerns that they need to air?</p></speech>

We know all of that.  It has been aired publicly.  Does anyone have anything else?  No.  That is fine.</p> <p>  I asked at last week's health committee meeting about additional claims for the project, so I presume Mr. Gunning or Mr. Barry will have an answer today.  They outlined how just over &euro;1 million to date has been paid in extra charges.  Correct me if I am wrong because this is from memory since the Official Report of that meeting is not up yet.  That was approximately 50% of overall claims.  The witnesses acknowledged that smaller claims are quicker than larger claims, which is obvious to most people.  I asked how much of the claims were based on the Connolly site rather than the main site and the witnesses were to come back to me but they have not yet.  Presumably they have the answer to that.</p></speech>

Anyone who really interrogates this document, particularly the most revealing pages - 26, 27 and 28 - which are about design, will see that.  On the previous occasion, Mr. Barry and Mr. Gunning told me that the design of the hospital was more or less complete when the GMP was signed off.</p></speech>

I did not on that day because I thought I would research it a bit more, which is the appropriate thing to do.

According to this report, &euro;27 million extra was paid to design companies, which is 63% more than what was agreed.  In any correlation if we go from the GMP to the IFC cost - and I am sorry for all of the jargon but people who know this know what I am talking about and there are arguments with regard to a significant change that would have a massive impact on the costs - a key signal is the fact that 63% more than what was expected had to be paid for the design consultants who have designed the hospital to date in the first place.  The correlation indicates that the IFC cost is way off.  If there is a 63% differential, it would in indicate that we are heading for a big problem here.</p></speech>

At the end of 2018, the design team submitted claims to us in terms of additional services it felt it undertook, or was about to undertake, associated with the project when compared to when it tendered for the job back in 2014.  The design team tendered for the job in 2014 and, through its lifescale, the job was supposed to finish in 2020 to 2021.  There are entitlements for the design team on prolongation in accordance with the standard contract.  We entered into a conciliation with the design team at the end of 2018.  We appointed a conciliator.  We stated our position and it stated its position and an agreement was made.  In terms of what was agreed, the design team recovered &euro;24.5 million, including VAT, or &euro;19.9 million, excluding VAT.  There were two categories in this.  One category was variations it was entitled to as set out in the contract.  These were prolongation of stages 2C and 3 up to the time of GMP and stage 4 because of the construction programme-----</p></speech>

I asked my next question last week and I hope Mr. Barry has had a week to reflect on it because transparency is an issue.  The board is changing and that is fair enough.  Fair play to anybody who is volunteering for this job, as I said on the that occasion.  I thank them because it is not an easy role to jump into.  In fairness to Mr. Barry jumping into this role, when he got the phone call, he had to think about it for a while.  This is a very important question and that is the reason he sat down with Q4 PR but I will get on to that in a while.  Is the board strengthened or weakened by the fact the head of procurement in Ireland is no longer on it?  I am not asking about the person but the role.  Is the board strengthened or weakened by the fact the head of procurement in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who is the most senior person in Ireland when it comes to procurement, is no longer on it?  On the previous occasion we were told much of the procurement is out of the way and while I am not sure whether I accept it, I accept it as an answer.  I am not going to dwell on this.  Is the board strengthened or weakened by the fact the role is no longer part of it?</p></speech>

He is the deputy director general and head of strategy and planning.  Future capital investment is generally planned five years ahead.  This year a three-year plan has been released ten months late.  Can Mr. Sullivan say on the record whether the delivery time of any capital project related to the HSE anywhere in Ireland been impacted by the spend on the hospital?  That is my second last question. </p><p> My last question is for the chairman of the board.  I asked this at our last meeting but I wish to put it on the record.  The minutes of a meeting on 3 April state that a presentation was made by the design team to the finance and construction committee.  It was reported that provisional findings had identified additional monetary risk.  I asked for the presentation and for the minutes of the procurement subcommittee on 29 April.  Mr. Barry said he would not supply us with the complete report but he would redact it and supply the minutes.  They have not yet been received.  Can he please provide them?  Those two questions were directed to Mr. Sullivan.</p><p> In response to Deputy Connolly the witnesses said they would outline the scope of the work of Q4 Public Relations.  I wish to echo that request.  The documents the witnesses supply must predate today.  They cannot be written up now. </p></speech>

My support has been based on the recommendation of a tri-located model with the capacity to include a maternity hospital and an adult hospital on the site.  This will mean children can be born and transferred while women who have babies do not have to be separated from them.  All the evidence that has been presented to me, mostly through Professor Hardiman-----</p></speech>

We will give Ms Hardiman an honorary title.  Once I committed myself to studying all the information I was convinced that this was the right place to put the hospital.  I was given a document at the Oireachtas Committee on Health about four years ago.  It stated that about 75% of the patient cohort came from the greater Dublin area.  I do not care what trouble I get into.  I cannot get into any more trouble than last week.  Anyone who tries to reverse out of the hospital's current position is really doing a disservice to the children of Ireland.  Despite some media reports, I have been a user of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin for ten years.  I have been an inpatient and a day patient.  I have used the cardiac facilities in the medical tower, the accident and emergency department and everything bar the oncology unit, touch wood.  I am fully aware of the challenges children are facing.  This is about children.  I do not see this as a poisoned chalice but as a wonderful opportunity to deliver something that successive Governments, boards and groups have failed to deliver.  I recognise the huge challenges.  I have sat in so many meetings about the children's hospital.  I understand that we need to get value for taxpayers' money and we need the best possible hospital for our children, but the constant pushback against providing this only serves to damage outcomes for the children of Ireland.  While our role is to interrogate this process, when any of us criticise the progress of the hospital we have to be very conscious of how much we needed it when it was first mooted.  Perhaps Ms Hardiman could outline this.  Consider the changes that have taken place at Temple Street Children's University Hospital and Crumlin.  We still have not delivered.  I remember seeing surgical pods being installed at Crumlin ten years ago and thinking it was a waste as we were going to build a hospital.  Ten years later we do not have that hospital.  For the record, I would like to encourage the board to keep going to get this delivered.  However everyone should consider the children who have missed out due to the persistent delays that have plagued this project.</p> <p>  Turning to the Children's Health Ireland, CHI, it is very positive that there has been a 35% reduction in general paediatric waiting lasts in the last six months.  Can we replicate that over the next six months or is that just a push to the start line?  Similarly, there has been a reduction of 65% in the 12-month waiting list.  Can we keep pushing in that direction or have we reached a saturation point?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.882" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#Z01400"><p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to elaborate on that.  Our board has taken this very seriously.  With due credit to the previous hospitals, we tend to stay within our limits financially.  We do our best around safety issues, which are really important.  Access is one area in which we must make improvements.  Our overall waiting list for outpatients has reduced by 8% this year.  The biggest reduction has been in the number waiting for longer than 12 months.  That has decreased by 12%.  This does not just apply to general paediatrics.</p> <p>  As I was saying, general paediatrics is the one specialty to be based at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown in which we have made early investment into new ways of working.  Staff there work virtually.  There are virtual triage clinics and patients are moved to the next available slot.  There is central referral so a patient is not referred to a particular doctor.  Whoever has the shortest list gets the next patient.  It is a much more efficient way of working.  Clinics have now been set up at Connolly that do not need paper.  If the patient has been in another hospital, his or her records are scanned and sent over.  We do not have vans of paper going from place to place.  This new way of working needed investment.</p> <p>  I can assure the committee that we have been successful in reducing our waiting lists through initiatives with the HSE.  We are definitely starting to make an impact.  The facility in Tallaght will be opening next year.  To be quite honest, our biggest issue is the constraints of the facilities.  We are trying to implement some strategic initiatives between now and 2023 so that we do not come into this hospital with long waiting lists.  We want to start successfully and be able to implement the services that the children and families of Ireland deserve, as Deputy O'Connell says.  Our staff deserve to be working in those facilities as well. </p></speech>

CHI is streamlining practices so that staff can be transferred to the new hospital without a fuss about name tags, pay packets or practices.</p></speech>

The issue of parents' rooms constantly comes up.  All rooms outside of the intensive care unit and the high dependency unit have facilities for parents.  On the Crumlin road there is a charitable organisation providing facilities where parents or other children can stay.  For the benefit of people who have never been in that situation, parents need to wash clothes, feed their children and feed themselves.  I have never used Ronald McDonald House because I am based in Dublin, but the facilities there are absolutely essential to supporting families who come from further away so they can live their lives without incurring huge hotel expenses.</p><p>This might be a question for the Department but is there any issue with Children's Health Ireland being a section 38 organisation in terms of the committee's access to its accounts in the future?</p></speech>

There was an option at one stage of purchasing a single electronic health record, EHR, for the whole country.  The children's hospital, as we all know, has many unique features.  Children's Health Ireland will procure an EHR for the children's hospital but we will build linkages to the national project and how that gets rolled out so that there is compatibility.  For example, the individual identifiers will be the same and they will use the same standards and so on, but the purchase and deployment will be separate from the children's hospital deployment.</p></speech>

My understanding from what Mr. Devine said is that the increase was to get more design because it precedes the GMP and the detailed drawings for where the plugs and cables go.  It is not really the case that it was a pure increase but the costs increased by 63% to get more design.  There was almost an impression given that it was a waste or nothing was got in return for the increase.  Perhaps that could be clarified so that an incorrect headline does not go out from here.</p></speech>

The first aspect was that a large part of the &euro;15 million cost I talked about was for the prolongation.  We have our design team for an extra two years.  The numbers were mentioned and we are talking about 100 to 200 people.  Those prolongation periods happened during the intense period between going to tender and then finalising the GMP.  They had 200 people working on the job for an extra six months.  When we get to this stage, which is all about the construction and implementation, there are probably over 100 people working for another year or year and a half on that.  That is where most of the cost was generated.  The timeline of the project has extended out for different reasons.</p> <p>  The second aspect was the &euro;9.5 million cost.  As a development board, taking our experience of the GMP and what is in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, we strengthened certain aspects of the design team and the capability within that team.  We decided, after looking at other large-scale projects internationally, that we needed additional people from the design team checking quality on site, more than we had allowed for in 2014.  There was an impact there in that the building control regulations were only in their infancy in 2014 when we tendered the job.  This is a highly complex project.  There are 6,000 rooms, every one of which has medical services in it.  We need to do a huge amount of assurance and checking to ensure our contractors complete the job and commission the hospital to the right standards so we hand over a fit-for-purpose hospital to Children's Health Ireland.</p></speech>

Between 25% and 40% of its procurement is non-compliant.  The committee deals with its procurement every year.  It tops the list in terms of non-compliance with procurement rules, as the Comptroller and Auditor General will confirm.  Some 24% of procurement within a sample he took last year was non-compliant.  I say that as a warning that Mr. Barry should not rely on the HSE in respect of compliance.  If he, as chairman of the board, is looking for people to advise on complying with procurement rules, the HSE is not necessarily the right choice.</p></speech>

It is unacceptable for the committee to have to wait nine or ten months after year end before it can see the financial statements for last year of an organisation as sensitive as this.  I ask that the accounts for 2019 be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of February and that the Comptroller and Auditor General give them priority.  I cannot dictate the workload of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I acknowledge that the appropriation accounts must be done but the HSE and the NTMA are given priority.  Similar priority should be given to the largest capital project in the State.  I do not know who will be here this time next year, but the Oireachtas should not have to wait until October of next year to see the financial statements for the period that will conclude in three weeks' time.  Mr. Barry gets my point.  There should be more urgency.  It is possible that the change of directors or another matter was the reason for the delay.  Many organisations appear before the committee.  I consider this to be a critical organisation in which there is a significant amount of public interest.  It is good for the reputation of the project if information is provided in a timely manner but it damages its reputation if information must be dragged out.  I am making that point in a positive way.  I ask Mr. Barry to try to get ahead of the curve on these matters.</p> <p>  This is the first time Ms Hardiman has appeared before the committee.  Children's Health Ireland, CHI, deals with the hospitals in Crumlin, Temple Street, Tallaght and Blanchardstown.  What about children who live outside Dublin and those who are sick in hospitals elsewhere in the country?  Do they fall under the umbrella of CHI?</p></speech>

We cover local services along the eastern seaboard and in the greater Dublin area.  Patients in Cork would go to Cork University Hospital, which has a children's unit, while those in the west would go to a hospital in Galway or Limerick, for example.

However, there is a plan to take a network approach to the delivery of services.  What is part of our job is all of the national services.  We are the only hospital in the system that has all of the national services in one organisation.  The sickest children, who comprise 25%, are all in our group.  A very sick baby in Cork who needs intensive care will come to us.  Children with complex and chronic illnesses or a rare disease come to us.  We deal with all of the national services, as well as some for Northern Ireland.  In addition, we provide secondary care in the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

As Mr. Breslin outlined, there initially was a plan for a national electronic healthcare record but it was agreed for us to proceed with our system.  Interoperability is very important for us.  The records of many children born in four of the maternity hospitals are stored on an electronic system.  We must have a process whereby files can be transferred to ensure a continuity of care.

Paragraph H.10 of our report says:</p> <blockquote> 	Members questioned the cost of Phase A, the substructure, in relation to the overall project.  The NPHDB stated that Phase A works were approximately &euro;100m, including VAT, of all project costs.  This represents approximately 7% of the current construction cost estimate of &euro;1.4 billion. </blockquote> <p>That was several months ago.  The board was able to give us that cost after the main meeting.  It was an approximate figure at that time.  There are several obvious questions.  These are the financial statements.  There is a reference to phase A having been completed.  My question is simple.  What was the final cost for phase A?</p></speech>

We are looking at the board's 2018 accounts.  We have done a periodic report and the board has been in here twice.  This is its third time before the committee this year.  It was here at the beginning of January and in May.  We did a periodic report based on figures provided in respect of the board.  I asked a basic question.  We spent some time this morning talking about the estimates for the future.  I am asking about the part of the project that has been completed.  I am sitting here as Chairman looking at the board's accounts in respect of the completed works and I am being told that I cannot be given a breakdown of the &euro;100 million.  That is not a good place for us to be in.  Does Mr. Barry understand my point?</p></speech>

That is what the Committee of Public Accounts is about.  Getting a set of accounts is just the start of the meeting.  We give our thanks and note that we have them on file and then delve into and analyse the accounts.  The first question I asked referred to the board's note which said that phase A, which related to the substructure, had been completed.  I asked whether we could have a breakdown of the costs now that it has been completed.  That is what this committee is for.  We are here to ask those questions.  The Committee of Public Accounts expects answers to such questions today, not in ten days' time.  Doe the witnesses get my point?  They might not like that point but I am making it to everyone collectively.  I will come to Mr. Breslin because he is the chairman of the children's hospital project programme board.  Does he know the cost of phase A or can he give me a breakdown?</p></speech>

We might not be here for too much longer.  I am expressing the frustration of all members here today.  We were here last January and we extracted the figure of &euro;1.433 billion at that meeting.  We have not been given one single new figure today, 11 months on.  There is a bit of frustration on this side of the table.  We have a set of audited accounts and when I asked my first question about them, I expected a breakdown to be available today.  It is going to come and that is fine but I believe Mr. Breslin sees my point.</p></speech>

It is part of the project.  If the Chairman asked a question about expenditure on the project to date, including how much has been paid to the contractor, I believe people would be able to answer that.</p></speech>

I am starting from the board's financial statements, which include a reference to phase A.  I am not inventing a question.  I am asking for details on matters the board refers to in paragraph 7, page 35 of its financial statements.  It is fine.  I will take the figure of &euro;100 million for now.  We will get the breakdown.  Can anyone indicate how much of this figure was paid to BAM?  Was it 70% or 80%?</p></speech>

That is the breakdown.  Mr. Devine has answered that question.  I will take that as an answer.</p> <p>  I am now moving on to phase B.  I am reading on in the same paragraph: "In 2018, having agreed the GMP [guaranteed maximum price] for the project, the contract for the main works [which was held by BAM, if I am correct] was awarded for &euro;887.7m (ex vat)".  VAT came to &euro;120 million so the contract comes to &euro;1.007 billion, including VAT.  I am reading the board's figures.  Am I right in my figures?  I believe I am.</p></speech>

The sum of &euro;260 million has already been incurred on the balance sheet.

There is not a single norm.  Some contractors put in extremely high claims and they come down an awful lot.  Some put in more measured, considered ones and they still come down.  One cannot really benchmark claims on the basis of the amount claimed and say that, therefore, there would be so much to pay.  However, one can say that, over the life of a construction project, it would be most unusual if a contractor could not find some things that were additional to the original.</p></speech>

I do not expect the witnesses to have a breakdown now but can they provide it for the &euro;1.257 billion, including contractual commitments entered into?</p></speech>

I will not rehash that.  It will be subject to assumptions.  There is a clear implication that there are other costs associated with the children's hospital not in the construction contract.  Will Mr. Breslin start telling us what else will be in there to get this children's hospital up and running?  Children's Health Ireland will have significant costs and other costs may not be met directly by that organisation.  What will be the costs of getting the hospital open?  He is chairman of the project programme board, which comprises two people from the Department and two from the HSE.  The members of the programme board are the people with the global picture of how this hospital will work.</p> <p>  We will start with the figure of &euro;1.433 billion, which is fine.  Let us hope it is as close to that as possible.  Mr. Barry referred to issues in his opening statement that are not in that guaranteed maximum price.  What are those elements not included in what we have been talking about today?</p></speech>

There is what has been discussed in the meeting around residual risks relating to the paediatric hospital development board's costs and there are some costs outside the paediatric hospital development board.  I can go into either of those if the Chairman so wishes.</p> <p>  The residual risks are a challenge to the development board at bringing this in at &euro;1.433 billion.  We have spoken about inflation and so on.  The Government has clearly stated the budget is &euro;1.433 billion.  Outside this are elements not in the budget for the construction of the hospital.  These lie primarily with Children's Health Ireland, and they include ICT, the electronic health record and integration of services.  They all form into the total figure seen before of &euro;1.7 billion.</p></speech>

The &euro;1.433 billion figure has been subject to quite a bit of interrogation.  Mr. Barry is smiling as I say that.</p><p>The other costs have not been subject to any interrogation here at all.  Today, we have dealt with the &euro;1.7 billion.  In meeting members of the board, we have only focused on the bare costs.  This committee has never had a discussion on the &euro;293 million in other costs.  What information can Mr. Breslin give us on that?

That will go through a peer review process under the office of the chief information officer.  The procurement process and the project have already been looked at.  We would hope to go to tender shortly and, on receipt of the tenders, CHI will contract with a provider to deliver an electronic health record.  The budget that is provided for this has been looked at on a number of occasions, most recently in the request to the peer review process for permission to go to tender, and it seems to be within the norms that might be expected for a project of this nature.</p></speech>

What we have at the moment is a patient administration system.  That is a basic foundation system with the patients' data and information on it.  What we are going out to procure is an electronic healthcare record.  That is a different system that has all of the clinical notes.  It also has all of the medications.  It can combine their X-rays and all of their lab feedback.  It also allows the clinicians to order electronically their diagnosis of the investigations.  It is a very different system.</p> <p>  As the Secretary General outlined, we have developed a business case.  So it has been through the HSE.  As with any major ICT project in health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a peer review process.  We have been before this peer review independent group three times this year.  It interrogates the business case, the costs, independent of the Department or the HSE and reports back up to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have been through those three meetings.  The final one was only last week and we hope to get a positive indication to go out to procure after that.</p></speech>

I only heard recently that it is not wide enough to carry all the necessary facilities going through these corridors, ducts, ducting or whatever one wants to call them to carry the electric cables, toilet pipes and all that.  I have heard that the ducts are not wide or big enough to take them and that is causing a problem.  My second question is about rumours relating to steel beams.  I do not actually know what kind of beams were involved.  When they were brought in from abroad, they were too big to fit and had to be cut or adapted to fit.  This resulted in a major cost.

We have a 3D representation of every single service in the building.  That was done for GMP.  We are very confident that all of the services fitted within the corridors.  I can also confirm that I am not aware of any claim that has come in to say that the services are not fitting in the corridors.  I am not aware of any steelwork that came in that had to be cut or altered.  If such a thing should happen, it would be the contractor's responsibility and not that of the employer.</p></speech>

We are meeting the HSE to discuss the accounts of the public service for 2018 and, in particular, chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which deals with the development of primary care centres.  We made the decision a number of weeks ago, in the interests of time, to try to limit our consideration today to certain key topics because the HSE was here in July just before the summer recess and we discussed its 2018 financial statements at that stage.  Given that the HSE is here to discuss chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we decided to add a few other items for discussion as follows: an update on measures to reduce incidents of clinical negligence that may lead to state claims, which is an ongoing topic; an update on matters related to oversight of section 38 and section 39 organisations and practice in issuing advance funding to such organisations; private ambulance contracts and; home support services.  Those matters were mentioned by the members as being of interest this afternoon.</p><p>We are joined by Mr. Paul Reid, chief executive officer; Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief safety officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; and Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary affairs division, HSE.  We are also joined by Mr. Fergal Goodman, head of primary care division; and Mr. Andy Conlon, principal officer, primary care, Department of Health. <br/><br/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>While we expect witnesses to answer questions clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.<br/><br/>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

We previously examined and reported on the progress made by the Department and the HSE in delivering the network up to 2010.  I felt it was appropriate, after a further eight years, to revisit the issue and provide a further update, and have done so in chapter 15 of my report.</p></speech>

In simple numeric terms, this is just over one third of the network originally envisaged.  A target timeframe for the delivery of the centres has not been set.  If delivery continues at the current rate, it is estimated that it will take at least a further 20 years to develop the full network.</p> <p>  We sought information from the HSE on the size of the existing centres, the staff deployed to each, the nature of the services provided, the procurement method and the cost.  This type of information was not available centrally, so information relating to the premises and their procurement was compiled manually from multiple sources across the HSE.  We could not get a clear picture of the range of services offered.</p> <p>  A key finding that emerged is that there is currently no formal definition of a primary care centre in terms of the core services to be accommodated.  The HSE currently defines a PCC in very broad terms which encompass pre-existing and new buildings, stand-alone centres and centres co-located with other services such as community hospitals.  The absence of a clear definition of what constitutes a primary care centre hinders meaningful tracking and reporting of progress. </p> <p>  In 2011, the HSE carried out a detailed assessment, which identified 297 potential locations for delivery of PCCs, in addition to the 43 operating at the end of 2010.  The HSE ranked all 340 locations in order of priority for delivery or development, based on assessments of local service need, existing infrastructure and the level of deprivation in the catchment area.  That ranking has not been revisited by the HSE since 2012, despite significant changes in population and economic conditions.</p> <p>  Some 27 PCCs were brought into operation in 2011 and 2012.  Following the HSE&rsquo;s location ranking exercise, a further 57 centres were delivered between 2013 and March 2019, but the delivery of these centres has not followed the ranked order of priority.  As a result, almost half of the 50 locations ranked with highest priority in 2012 were recorded in March 2019 as being at "early planning" stage, or had no indication of progress in the delivery of a centre. </p> <p>  The HSE has used three main models for procurement of the centres delivered since 2013, namely, direct commissioning of a building by the HSE; long-term leasing from local developers and-or investors; and a public private partnership, PPP, to build and make available a bundle of 14 care centres on HSE-owned sites.  The various delivery models have very different cost structures, making any comparison of the costs and benefits of each option difficult.  Given the volume of delivery over the past five years or so, it would be opportune for the HSE to undertake a formal cost-effectiveness comparison of the different procurement methods.</p> <p>  The original model outlined for primary care delivery envisaged that each PCC would accommodate one or more core primary care teams, supported by a wider network of health and social care professionals, as outlined in figure 15.1 of this chapter of the report.  However, as the HSE does not currently have an integrated reporting system, specific information is not available on the number and mix of teams in each operational centre, the numbers of filled and vacant posts, or the types of services being provided by the teams.  For the purposes of this examination, the HSE reported that, as of July 2019, there were 421 primary care teams in place, of which only about 56% had direct GP involvement.  As shown in figure 15.13, most community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas do not have the planned number of primary care teams. Only Dublin north CHO has the target number of teams with GP involvement.</p> <p>  The report makes four recommendations in regard to the management and monitoring of the development of primary care centres.  These recommendations have been accepted by the Department of Health and the HSE, which will be able to provide members with an update on their implementation. </p></speech>

The submitted statement makes reference to 341 locations, but that figure should be 340.  That was corrected by the Comptroller and Auditor General yesterday.  I apologise for that.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 report.  The senior management colleagues joining me today are Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief strategy officer; and Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer.  I am also joined by Mr. Jim Curran, our head of estates, who has stayed on from this morning's session.  We submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and so I will confine my opening remarks to a few specific issues.</p> <p>  I will first give a financial overview of the situation.  A key priority for the HSE is maximising the provision of safe services to the people we serve, while operating within the funding provided to us.  This continues to be a significant challenge due to the ever-increasing level of demand on our services, which is influenced by factors such as a growing population with an ageing demographic, changes in technology and clinical practice, and ongoing societal and economic change.  We have continued our intensive focus on current year financial management and financial planning for 2020.  Senior managers across the organisation have been engaging with us regarding activity and expenditure and the related challenges of operating within available resources.</p> <p>  The latest financial position, as of September 2019, shows a variance from budget, including first charge, of &euro;319 million or 3%.  Of this, 37%, or &euro;119 million, relates to our operational service areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was almost 100% higher at &euro;636 million of which 80%, or &euro;507 million, was in the operational service areas.  Pension and demand-led areas account for &euro;200 million of the variance as of September 2019.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services relate to the provision of residential placements to people with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialised emergency care within acute hospital settings, particularly in the context of an ageing population with increasingly complex needs.  The costs within our pensions and demand-led areas are mostly driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic environment and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  State Claims Agency reimbursements also fall within this area and there is a significant and ongoing focus on mitigating, insofar as is practical, the underlying risks which give rise to claims.</p> <p>  My monthly financial management meetings with community healthcare organisation, CHO, chief officers and hospital group CEOs will continue to year end.  All areas are clear about their allocated financial limits and performance expectations up to year end to mitigate, insofar as is practical, any deviations from those limits, thereby reducing the extent of any challenge to be dealt with in 2020.</p><p>The discipline of these monthly financial meetings will continue throughout 2020.<br/><br/>A key focus for ongoing financial management efforts have been on improving compliance with our pay and staffing controls, including whole-time equivalents, agency and overtime.  Although staffing levels will increase again in 2019, any increases must be managed in a way that is both planned and affordable. This necessary adjustment to the controls on pay and staffing is proving difficult but it must become part of our normal way of working.  I acknowledge that this is a challenging process but the board of the HSE and I are committed to ensuring that there is an improved culture of delivery within the funding provided by the State.  I fully believe that doing this will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which will ultimately be in the best interest of our service users and their families.<br/><br/>The HSE national service plan for 2020 was adopted by the board on 4 November and submitted to the Minister for consideration.  The approval process is well advanced with correspondence having been received from him and replied to within the past week.  I expect the plan will be published within the next week or so.<br/><br/><b></b>The HSE welcomes the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on primary care centres.  I note that the four recommendations in the report have been accepted and will be implemented in consultation with the Department of Health and in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  The development of PCCs to accommodate the HSE primary care teams and GPs in the one location is a key enabler for the delivery of primary care services.  A number of years ago the primary care division of the HSE, in conjunction with HSE estates, identified 341 locations for primary care centres.  In 2012, these locations were prioritised on the basis of service need, existing facilities and level of deprivation.  The most suitable delivery model of the primary care centre was also identified.<br/><br/>The three models used for the development of PCCs are as follows: Exchequer-funded development, capital plan; PPP, the Government stimulus programme; and the operational lease.  Of the 341 locations identified during the 2012 prioritisation process, 127 locations are now operational.  A further 77 primary care centres are in the process of being developed.  Taken together, this represents 204 or 60% of the original 340 locations identified.  The HSE, in 2020, will complete an overarching review of PCCs that will include an update of the rankings of the proposed locations, and a determination of how further delivery is to be prioritised.  This review will help us better understand how PCCs are currently used.  It will also allow us to review the characteristics of these facilities to identify the most effective service models.<br/><br/>The review will consider the utilisation of centres and how this would increase as services in the community are expanded, commencing with the Sl&aacute;intecare investment of &euro;10 million that will increase to &euro;60 million.  This will result in to 1,000 additional front-line staff employed in community services.  This work will also insure an integrated system among key HSE stakeholders, and a consistent process for coding primary care teams across the networks and CHOs.<br/><br/>Between January and September this year, the HSE provided almost 13 million hours of home support nationally, with an expenditure of more than &euro;320 million.  This service provides essential supports to more than 50,000 people to either remain at home or assist with their discharge from hospital.  Demand for this service continues to outstrip funding levels and at the end of September, 7,667 people nationally were assessed as requiring new or additional services.  The HSE winter plan will continue to support this service by allocating an additional 600 home care packages, targeted at both acute hospital and community waiting lists.<br/><br/>Regarding sections 38 and 39 organisations, the HSE recognises and supports the essential work of the voluntary sector in providing health and social services.  We wish to strengthen and deepen the ongoing dialogue between our organisation and the voluntary sector, in line with the recommendations of the Day report.  We acknowledge that a number of voluntary organisations are facing difficult challenges, including financial challenges.  Various factors may contribute to expenditure exceeding the funding level set out in the annual service agreement signed with the HSE, and any overruns arising require careful analysis of the specific causal factors lest they undermine budgetary discipline within the overall health sector.  In the first instance, dealing with any in-year or accumulated historic financial overruns within voluntary organisations, funded under sections 38 and 39, is a matter for the boards of these organisations.  We know their boards take that responsibility seriously.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is nearly identical to his reports of 2001 and 2010.  We all know that the ambition of primary care is to keep as many people as possible out of hospital and in their homes.  We all know it seeks to ensure that people are cared for and treated as near as possible to their own homes without blocking up the system, taking up hospital beds, etc. particularly in view of the current trolley situation.</p> <p>  Governments down through the years have placed great emphasis on primary care and such care has been mentioned in all of the manifestos and by the HSE.  However, it seems that great progress has not been made and it seems to be at a standstill.  Almost 20 years have elapsed yet only one third of the target set in 2001 has been achieved.  Why has it taken so long to roll out primary care?  After 20 years more than one third of the target should have been achieved.</p></speech>

The ones that we do have up and operational, there is no doubt, where we have a GP presence in place, it provides a significant extra service to the community, and provides specific relief to our acute settings, particularly our emergency departments.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare direction is absolutely the way we want to go.  We have a lot of PCCs that do not have the diagnostic capability that would enhance the supports they can give the community. </p></speech>

Currently, all of the pressure points head towards our emergency department and hospital acute settings.  I am convinced in the six months that I have been here that the shift that we have to make is to reduce the number of presentations, not through anyone's fault, to our emergency departments.  That has to be done through a number of ways.  Sl&aacute;intecare sets out a strategy for this.  We need more GPs.  I have been talking with the training body for GPs.  Bringing more on-stream will be key for us.  We need to enhance the capacity and capability of our pharmacies in terms of their reach into communities.  We can only reduce the number of people who need to present to emergency departments by strengthening our primary care teams.</p> <p>  A positive element of our service plan, which is being finalised and is with the Minister to go to the Government shortly, is an enhanced investment for next year in our complete primary care settings from a number of perspectives.  This will enhance investment in the nursing home support scheme and home help hours.  In particular, there will be capacity to increase our resourcing in community settings, for example, primary nursing, by more than 1,000 personnel by the end of 2020.  There is a &euro;10 million investment.</p> <p>  We need to shift the investment profile from the acute setting, which is under pressure, into primary care settings primarily while supporting the acute setting.</p></speech>

Is it down to money?  Are GPs not interested in rolling it out?  Is it down to structures or grant aid?  What is the main failing?  Why has it not been taken up more?  The centres in Kilkenny, in my constituency, are working brilliantly and there are plans for more, but those have been spoken about for ten years and they are still not up and running.  Why is that the case?</p></speech>

There are 127 and a further 77 are coming on-stream.  Ten will be from our corporate plan next year and 67 will be from primary care operational leases.  A significant number will come on-stream over the next three years.</p> <p>  Reverting to the original point, it is not just about building a primary care centre; it is about equipping the centre with the facilities that can enhance the patient and public's experience in them.  The Deputy referred to his own experience.</p><p>It varies across the country.  We do not have PCCs with the capacity that is needed.  We do not have sufficient GPs coming on-stream.  That is getting better.  I agree with the Deputy that we have to strengthen capacity in all of our centres.  Diagnostics, GPs and therapist skills are needed to ensure people have outpatient appointments in acute settings.  An investment shift is required to strengthen our community settings.</p></speech>

Which of these methods is the most prominent?  Which of them involves the best system?  Which of them is the most effective?  As we go forward, which of these methods will be of most use as we try to get the other projects - two thirds of the total - up and running?  Which of them is the most cost-effective?  Which of them represents the best value for money?</p></speech>

We will do a new review of them, as recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A review was done in 2008.  It concluded on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis that the operation of lease agreements was the most cost-effective of the three methods.  We want to review that again now, based on our experience with PPPs and our own-----</p></speech>

Which of them is the best?  I presume the lease agreement method involves leasing a building.  I understand what is involved in PPPs.  Someone comes in from the private sector as part of a partnership.  The HSE builds some of these facilities directly itself.  I ask Mr. Reid to explain each of these methods.  Which of them is the most cost-effective?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked which of them works best.  If we are enhancing an existing premises of our own on our own land, it calls out for a capital plan investment that we should do.  In other cases, we try to reduce, mitigate or share the risk by operating in a PPP environment.  From a cost perspective, we enter into operational leases when the opportunity arises.  We do not always have a choice because all three methods do not always present themselves.  People might not be ready for leases, or people might not want to work on PPPs with us.</p></speech>

As Mr. Curran may elaborate in a second, it is not always possible to enter into such a lease.  We may wish to put a primary care centre in a particular location through the operational lease model, but it becomes problematic to do so if we cannot attract interest locally or we cannot identify a site locally.  That conclusion was reached in the review.  We intend to undertake a cost-evaluation exercise next year.  This will be informed by the guidance of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will explore the three different modes or models of delivery again to see which of them is the most appropriate in today's circumstances.  Of course we will look at that.  The models we have on the ground now reflect that fact that there is no one right solution.  Each of them has strengths and weaknesses.  Perhaps Mr. Curran would like to add some light and shade.</p></speech>

We have also focused on developing our own facilities, extending existing health centres to provide additional accommodation for primary care and upgrading or remodelling some of our existing facilities, including old mental health institutions and hospitals.  For instance, we are developing a primary care unit at the St. Davnet's campus in Monaghan.  We hope to do something similar in Portlaoise.  We have enhanced an old community nursing unit in Loughrea to provide primary care there.  We have provided new PCCs in Inchicore and Ballyfermot from our capital plan.  We will deliver centres in Finglas and Rowlagh from the capital plan as well.  When we pursue the operational lease method, we get the benefit of commercial interest in providing primary care, including the capacity to leverage off PCCs for other commercial developments associated with health, including pharmacies.  Other private consultancy suites often come into these facilities.  All of these developments enhance the delivery of primary care.</p></speech>

Some GPs throughout the country seem to be reluctant to get involved in PCCs.  What kind of grant aid is there for a GP who wishes to set up in such a centre?  I assume assistance is provided as part of the effort to get full primary care services in place.  Is a certain percentage of the cost provided as grant aid to get people interested?  What way does it work?  What efforts are made to get business people involved in PPPs?</p></speech>

I forget what year it was done.  It was probably 2013 or 2014.  The report did not propose that the provision of grant aid or the introduction of tax measures would be the way to go.  The report suggested that the models we had in place should be sufficient to develop primary care.  GPs who have invested in their own facilities might be reluctant to abandon what they have developed.  They might need see any reason to move into another facility.  They might have incurred mortgages or leases.  This might mean they do not have the freedom to go into new locations.  We offer GPs the opportunity to take out licences in rooms in our own facilities at fairly attractive rates to encourage them to operate from our PCCs.</p></speech>

I presume a small village of a couple of hundred people would not have a primary care centre.  Does the HSE focus on bigger towns with larger populations?  Are certain areas targeted?

As part of the 2012 prioritisation exercise that was mentioned earlier, we identified priority projects in the context of the service requirements, the accommodation available and the deprivation index.  That exercise gave us an initial priority list for primary care delivery.  It can be seen from the priority list that there is a focus on areas of deprivation with poor facilities and on areas of increasing population without any existing facilities for the delivery of primary care.  Such areas tend to be around cities and towns.  It is probably timely to review the priority list now in the context of what was referred to earlier as the recommendation report.  That would allow us to see where we should refocus our efforts.</p></speech>

It is a problem we all encounter.  I refer to home care hours.  It is a help to keep people at home.  It is obvious that there is not enough funding to facilitate the demand.  Will more personnel and funding be made available to keep people in their homes as long as they can?  There is a significant demand on the home support framework that we have, with people only getting half an hour when they should get two or three hours, and others not getting any and having to wait three or four months before they can even get access to some help.  Will Mr. Reid comment on that?</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Anne O'Connor, will comment as well.</p> <p>  The home help supports are significant for us in terms of the demands of demographics that we face as a country.  With the funding that we have this year, as the Deputy will see, we have set out the number of people that will support.  We have sought additional funding, as part of our winter plan, from Government.  Positively, this year we have secured additional funding, not in December but in October, which has been invested already.  Enhanced home care supports will be put in up to Christmas and during the winter.</p> <p>  Our service plan for next year has to be agreed shortly, but the Deputy will have heard it publicly announced in the Government budgeting process that an extra 1 million home help hours will be deployed into the community settings.  Those are welcome.</p> <p>  Our total winter funding of &euro;26 million is very significant.  Last year, that was &euro;10 million in total.  A significant portion of that is being put into home help, and, indeed, the nursing home support scheme and delayed transfer of care beds.</p></speech>

I accept there is more funding.  We are grateful for getting more funding, and 1 million more home care hours as well, but it is still not fulfilling the demand.  What level of demand does the HSE want to fulfil to keep people out of hospital, off trolleys and from holding up beds in hospitals?  Does Mr. Reid agree the way forward is more funding on home care?</p></speech>

Any extra funding we get in terms of home care supports is excellent value for money when compared to the cost of a patient being delayed in an acute setting or, indeed, in a bed.  It is much more cost-effective.</p> <p>  Specifically, there is a number of aspects in terms of the supply and demand.  On the demand side, as I said in my statement, we have more than 7,000 people, which is combination of people looking for new hours and extended hours throughout the day.  More funding in next year's budget will be supportive of that.</p> <p>  We also have a supply factor in terms of home help providers and care providers, which is a significant challenge in some parts of the country.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have a mix between direct labour and indirect labour across the country for historical legacy reasons, but that is where the supply is.  We have a bit of supply of the home care hours and help where we want to get more and we have a bit on the demand side in terms of the extra provision required.  Positively, next year's budget will reflect significant extra hours.</p></speech>

I was approached by people who work for the HSE providing home care regarding agencies.  There seems to be a bit of conflict, at least in my area, about the HSE employing agency staff instead of employing people directly.  What is Mr. Reid's opinion on that?  Why does the HSE use agencies when people are available who could do the work and are employed by the HSE?  They are not getting full hours and yet the HSE is bringing agency nurses in to do it instead.  There is a bit of a conflict over that to the effect that the priority should be given to the HSE workers.  I am not going into industrial relations or anything like that.</p></speech>

There have been extra cost pressures on us this year such as wage inflation and Workplace Relations Commission agreements so the cost per hour has gone up.</p></speech>

From our perspective, the best mix is to have a blended solution.  We have two areas in the country where we have no direct provision of home support.  They are all provided by external providers and that presents some challenges.  What we find is that it can be difficult to source carers in isolated rural areas at present, and we work closely.  When there is a blend of HSE directly-provided services and agencies, we can work closely together.  However, it is challenging in terms of being able to secure carers all over the country.</p> <p>  In terms of the cost that the Deputy referenced, we had the tender which went up.  In terms of travel time and paying for travel, that impacted on our own employees but also some of the charges coming in from external providers went up in the same way slightly.  Our preferred way of working is to have availability of both.</p></speech>

I cannot remember the exact number.  In 2012, centres were prioritised based on demographics, need, etc.  Is Mr. Reid telling us today that no review has been done since 2012?  Is there still need in those areas?  My concern is that a pathway was carved out seven to ten years ago and the position has significantly changed in the interim how we deliver healthcare, with Sl&aacute;intecare being the biggest change .  I am concerned that a pathway was embarked on and has not been reviewed since and one of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations is that an analysis be done retrospectively of whether the benefits that the HSE set out to achieve were realised.  I cannot see why it would keep going unless it was sure what was being done was the correct thing to do.  Will Mr. Reid comment on that?</p></speech>

We are moving towards a new regionally integrated model where the acute and community settings will work together, as the Deputy will be aware.</p></speech>

The delivery of care has changed.  The skills we will put into our PCCs will change in the future.  Looking two years rather than ten years ahead, we want to make sure that the next prioritised list takes on board the new direction that we are going in the delivery of healthcare in respect of the regions and integrated care.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid stated that there are 127 already plus 77 on the way, which will be delivered in a certain period of time but that cannot be guaranteed, because not one has ever reviewed it, if they are what is needed in this new era.</p></speech>

First, of the 77 that are in train, as the Deputy correctly said, ten are in our capital plan, are definitely priorities and would be delivered under any model.  The remaining 67 will be from an operation lease.  Twenty-four are in construction at present and 43 are at an agreement stage.  I will be strongly recommending we move ahead with them.</p></speech>

It is a fair comment.  The review was done in 2012.  The prioritisation exercise was helpful at the point in time.  There has not been, as the Comptroller and Auditor General's report stated, any national reprioritisation since then but there have been a number of local reprioritisations - new locations identified, existing locations merged, etc.</p><p>As Mr. Reid has said, the fact that we have the 127 and will have the 77 is of huge value.  It is much better than starting from nothing, and they are well distributed across the country.  We have the platform here to build on into the future.  The models we have will be sufficiently flexible to allow a range of different services to be put in place.  The most important thing is that we have something that brings together the integrated primary care teams, including the GPs, in one location as a single one-stop shop for patients.  We have prioritised the completion next year of an exercise that will review how we are using the existing centres.  We will look at Sl&aacute;intecare in the round and how things have moved in our thinking over the past ten years.  We will make sure as we go forward now, building on the 204 that will be in place between now and 2023 or so, that we redirect as appropriate and maximise the value from the 204 we will have by then.</p></speech>

We have no definition of what they should be.  We have not looked at whether they are fulfilling what we set out for them to fulfil in 2008.  We do not know whether they are achieving what we set out for them to achieve.  I am very concerned that we would continue going down a certain pathway.  That is fairly clear from what I have said.  Mr. Sullivan said the models would be sufficiently flexible.  If 14 are PPP-based, what is the flexibility there?  A developer builds the site and leases it to us.  Is that how it works?  It is a 25-year lease.  Who owns the staff?  Are they HSE staff?  They are.</p></speech>

The important thing in the beginning was the development of primary care teams after the primary care strategy of 2001.  We had groupings of primary care professionals coming together to work in the interests of the local population.  From that we started to develop primary care centres.  In reality, we have from the beginning had GPs who were very invested and wanted to be in the middle of the teams.  We had other GPs who had invested in their own practices and wanted to work in a more virtual way.  The priority for those teams was to ensure ease of referral with GPs and to ensure that the team worked and had a weekly meeting with GPs.  There have been different models throughout the years.</p><p>Some GPs just do not want to be in the middle of a primary care centre.  They want to be in their own practice that they have invested in and which is their own business.</p></speech>

That is still the core team, including a GP, public health nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist and home support, with speech and language therapists, psychologists and dieticians in the mix more in the network.  They are the core professionals of the primary care team.  In recent years, we have focused on the inclusion of diagnostics.  In reality, the core disciplines are very similar.  We have looked at the local demography.  In Dublin 15, where we have developed centres in Corduff, we have focused primarily on children.  We have brought in the children's disability team as well as the primary care team.  In other areas, we might have a stronger focus on older persons and the mix of the team will change.  Over the years, we have tried to adapt in response to the local population and through collaboration with local communities to see what the best fit for that population is.</p></speech>

After reading the documents last night, the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General have to be implemented.  If we look back at this in ten years and we have built 204 things for which we do not even have a definition or know who should be in them, which are not Sl&aacute;intecare-proofed, so to speak, and have not been reviewed to see if they deliver what we wanted them to deliver, it will not be a good outcome for any of us, especially the people who are depending on them.  Have we any timeline for the review?  I read recommendation 2 last night, which states that the Accounting Officer of the Department of Health agrees and continues, "However, this will require consultation with the HSE and will need to recognise that variation in the design or utilisation of PCCs is a function of local circumstances, population need".  That, to my mind, is code for the Department will do this if it wants.  It is not defined enough.  We have to review what money is being spent on and see if it is working.  This seems very loose and sounds like the Department will do this if it suits.</p></speech>

They are a core member of the team, as they were in the 2001 strategy.  That being so, at the same time, there were always some GPs, as HSE colleagues have indicated, who were enthusiastic early adopters, but we had no contractual arrangement with the GPs that bound them more closely into the primary care team and network model.  In negotiations that we had this year with the Irish Medical Organisation, one of the key objectives that was secured was a contractual obligation on behalf of general practice to work in an integrated way with primary care networks and teams.  It is not about the physical co-location.  That, as people have explained, is dependent on many other circumstances.  The primary care strategy was very much about ways of working, teamwork and multidisciplinary care.  GPs are moving closer into collaboration with the salaried staff of the HSE in delivering services to populations.  It is worth noting that as part of the service delivery objective.</p></speech>

I went along to my own CHO area.  It had a briefing for Oireachtas Members that was very useful and addressed a range of areas.  I asked a question about an area that keeps cropping up in the personal experience of some of my constituents.  They get an appointment and then there is an interruption in the therapy service.  It is often maternity leave since a large number of women are employed in that area of healthcare and they absolutely have to be supported in the maternity leave that they take.  They do not want to come back to long lists and such.  The functioning of these primary care centres has to take that into account too.  Is that an aspect that the HSE will look at?  I understand that, at any given time, one third of therapists are on maternity leave, which is a very high number.  That goes with the territory when one has a cohort of workers with that age profile.</p></speech>

There will have to be two aspects to a review.</p><p>The first will be what the Comptroller and Auditor General called a "re-look" at which is the best model for delivery in the future between public private partnerships, lease and the capital funded plan.  We want to have that aspect of the review done in the first half of next year because it is key.</p><p> The second aspect of the review, which Deputies O'Connell and Catherine Murphy just mentioned, is to proof it against Sl&aacute;intecare.  Part of the proposal that went to the Government about the announcement of regions was that we would revert to the Government in the first half of next year about the functioning and establishment of regions and real, integrated operational care between acute and primary care.  How we use primary care centres must be a key aspect of our next report.  The history of primary care centres is long, going back to the health board system and through the nine CHO settings.  We need to look at them as much more of an integrated service which is a very different way of looking at them.  It might mean a reassessment of priorities.</p><p> The second part of the question related to the staff and therapists in general.  If one stands back from the Deputy's point, it is absolutely correct.  Some 80% of our staffing, across the HSE, are women and approximately 35% of staff are on reduced working hours, maternity leave, or work part-time, etc.  It is a significant issue to manage and, much of the time, we have to manage it through agency because it would not be cost-effective to have all full-time replacements.  We meet certain pinch points when it comes to resourcing.  Maternity leave also affects some of the primary care centres.  We try to cover some of the vacancies through agency or by moving staff between primary care teams.  It is an issue that is difficult to manage.  That is why we use agency and move staff between some of the primary care teams.</p></speech>

Are there other strategies in place for workforce planning to cover maternity care?  It is unattractive for someone returning to work to face long lists and so on because no cover has been provided in her absence.  Taking somebody back on a part-time basis is better than not having them back at all, especially when the staff in question are experienced.</p></speech>

Our strategy, in terms of workforce planning for next year, involves putting an extra 1,000 staff into our primary care settings.  That will cost &euro;10 million, rising to &euro;60 million.  We should have an extra 1,000 staff in community settings by the end of next year which should give some relief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019120500002#VV00400"><p>The cost of agency cover, for example, is greater than direct employment of a member of staff.  It is difficult to have somebody roving and employed in different parts of the country.  Cost-effectiveness and retention should be central to the review.  Retention obviously gives rise to costs for training and experience and many other factors come into the equation when one looks at value for money and quality of service.  We want people to be shouting from the rooftops that this is the way to go and, in order for them to do that, they must have a good experience.  They also must have certainty regarding the provision of service when we invest in these primary care centres.</p></speech>

Historically, disciplines in the community and elsewhere have worked in their own professional silos so, when someone is gone, his or her list is not covered.  Multidisciplinary working changes that slightly.  It does not mean that we magic up capacity that we do not have but it does mean that families and children coming through primary care centres, whether attending the primary care team, children's disability teams or whatever, are familiar with the team and there is less of a gap when an individual member of staff is lost.  There is no doubt that we struggle to cover leave but at least by having teams that are co-located, we are able to work differently with people.</p></speech>

Is it the lifespan of a facility that has been developed through a PPP as opposed to a direct build?  Are there real options in the choices that are to be made?  Will funding be provided in the event that direct build is found to be more cost-effective way of dealing with the primary care centres?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the various models we have.  We have seen, in our review in the past, that the operating lease was the most cost-effective.  We will look at that again by the first half of next year.  There is funding for 30 primary care centres in our capital plan and we still expect those to progress, as they should.  Where we have our own sites and are extending an existing site, as I mentioned earlier, the best model is our own capital plan and infrastructure.  It is about balancing the risk of the investment.</p></speech>

As they are not part of the framework, these payments are clearly not compliant.  Mr. Reid has said the main ones are compliant.  I query whether they are compliant given that the roll-over period has concluded.  On 25 May 2017, the HSE advertised for tenders to replace the current framework.  This has gone on for a long time.  I have had correspondence from people who are very competent.  They might be subcontractors for some of the companies approved by the HSE.  They are legitimately trying to get on to the list.  The most recent letter I received as from the HSE's national director of procurement.  He skirts around the current competition but the letter states that, due to competing priorities in the past 12 months with planning for CervicalCheck and Brexit planning, the HSE did not have the resources to replace the existing framework agreement and it has not been processed.  However, it will examine the market position in early 2020 and will either progress the existing competition - it would be hard to resurrect because it is now three years old - or relaunch a procurement process with a view to establishing a new framework next year.  The HSE has been in the tendering process for three years and my reading of the letter is that it might be abandoned and a new one started.  What is going on?  I am not talking about &euro;1 million here or there but several million euro every year.  Part of this should be covered by the framework.  Having been two years in the process, the HSE is now putting its hands up and potentially abandoning the tendering process.  This is what it reads like to me.  Is Mr. Reid familiar with this?</p></speech>

That process starts around what the service level agreements should look like.  That process will be worked through with the sections 38 and 39 organisations.  A new group has been established by the Minister, which is made up of representatives from sections 38 and 39 organisations, the HSE and the Department, to look at the recommendations from the report produced by Dr. Catherine Day in terms of engagement with the sector, working in partnership and better communications with the sector.  This has started.  The group convened last week.  In parallel to this, service agreements are up for renewal in 2020.  This will also involve direct engagement with the organisations.  This may relate to the Acting Chairman's point on audits and oversight of the sector.</p></speech>

We have governance reviews ongoing.  The last time we appeared before the committee, 22 of X number of reviews has been completed.  The reviews are looking at the governance inside section 38 organisations predominantly.  They are not value-for-money reviews but look more at internal governance, for example, whether they have internal audit functions, rotating board memberships and so on.  We can give an update on that.</p> <p>  Ms O'Connor referred to an exercise that is looking at disability and mental health residential placements around the appropriateness, procurement, cost, effectiveness and value in placements.  That is also under way.  As Mr. Reid said, next year we will look at our standard contractual agreement with all the section 38 and 39 organisations.  That is also ongoing.  There is a lot going on in that space.  We need to clarify specifically how we can best address the question the Acting Chairman asked.</p></speech>

The committee is often informed by the experiences brought to members' attention.  One cannot get that kind of insight if one has not experienced it directly.  When several people start saying the same thing, it piques one's interest.</p><p>A range of different services, for example, for young people with autism or intellectual disabilities are outsourced.  They are not provided directly by the HSE but by a provider through a service level agreement.  People are reluctant to complain because they see the person on behalf of whom they are complaining as a vulnerable person.  It is all the more important that the questioning is one step removed from the individuals.  There have been questions about how much it is costing to do that, the effectiveness of the outsourcing, and whether there are better outcomes with different providers.  Is that part of this review?</p></speech>

We are looking at everybody who is in a private residential placement with either intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties.  It is interesting because one of the key components, particularly for younger people, is the distance from home and family.  That is a key component in what we are looking at as well.</p> <p>  On the value for money question, people are placed in what we call an emergency placement, if things break down at home, or whatever happens.  They are left in this placement that can often be very high cost and highly-supported.  We are bringing in a new system of reviewing all of these placements.  That is under way.  We have worked through many different placements to look at the appropriateness of the placement, its oversight, whether there is a different type of placement that would meet that person's needs in a better way, where it is in relation to local community and family, and all of that.  We are actively working through all of those at the moment.  Hopefully, this will address the concerns the acting chairman is raising.</p></speech>

The reality is that we often have people who have highly specialised needs.  We would not be able to keep those services going in respect of staffing, etc.  We rely on private providers who often specialise in a specific condition.  Our challenge is to ensure that we respond in a more agile way to people's needs.  Just because people go into a placement one day does not mean that they should have the same staffing and remain in the same place forever.  We must ensure we have a system of reviewing placements to meet their changing needs.  This is particularly the case if they go in when they are younger and grow older, or their condition changes, or whatever.  Many things can change.  The idea is that we look at getting the most appropriate care setting.</p> <p>  There is definitely a value for money component.  Sometimes we find that three or four CHOs may be dealing with one provider, unaware that the other CHOs are also talking to the provider.  This impacts on the cost and staffing levels.  We are trying to join all of that up nationally to make sure that when we are talking to a provider, particularly where there might be three or four people in a house funded by different areas, that we bring all of that together and look at its appropriateness.  The most important thing is we meet the person's needs in the most appropriate way.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that we are often challenged to get service providers who can provide the right level of care to people with very complex needs.  We received funding last year, however, to look at a specific autism initiative to improve services in one way but also to look at our approach to people with autism.  In reality, people with autism need to be able to access our whole range of services.  We have an extensive new initiative on autism, which is about to be launched in the relatively near future, and it will be similar to the Understand Together dementia campaign.  Much work has been done on autism and we are very happy with that in ensuring that our services and the public are aware of what autism is and what it means for people who have autism.  At the other end of the spectrum we need to ensure that we have the right providers to provide for a very complex need.  Sometimes people with autism have a range of other needs as well.  We are very focused on that at the moment.</p></speech>

I remind members and witnesses to please turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode because they interfere with the sound system and make it very difficult for parliamentary reporters; people who are listening in or web streaming would be adversely affected also.</p> <p>  No. 7 on the agenda is engagement with the Minister for Education and Skills to consider the motion on the Universities Act 1997 (section 54(3)) (University Authorisation) Order 2019.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills with special responsibility for Higher Education, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor to the meeting.  The Minister is accompanied by officials but, procedurally, they are not witnesses so will not be able to address the meeting.  </p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement, which will then be followed by engagement with members of the committee.  As the Minister will be aware the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.  Before we begin, I remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  It is an exciting day for the the RCSI; we are setting a precedent here at this committee meeting where, following the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Act 2019, this is the first time that the legal process can be enacted where an education provider that is not financially supported by the State may seek university status.  As members of the committee will know, for almost 250 years, the RCSI has played a very key role in Irish surgical and medical education and it is internationally recognised, with students coming from over 40 countries studying many different disciplines in the health and medical matters.  It is a very good day for them, we would hope.</p> <p>  I call on the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am pleased to present the draft Ministerial order entitled Universities Act 1997 (Section 54(3)) (University Authorisation) Order 2019, to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, with a view to its approval by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  This order will, if approved, authorise the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to use in respect of itself, the description "university" in the State and to style itself accordingly.  Having visited the RCSI on a number of occasions and engaged with the staff and students there, and having consulted with the Higher Education Authority and the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, I am aware of the RCSI&rsquo;s unique contribution to medical and health sciences education, across a wide number of disciplines, and its ongoing positive contributions to the higher education system, to the Irish health system, and indeed to wider Irish society.</p> <p>  For some 235 years now, the RCSI has played a key role in Irish surgical and medical education in this country.  It is a highly progressive institution incorporating state-of-the-art technology and employing teaching methods of the highest quality and excellence.  As well as its Irish undergraduates, students from over 40 countries receive their medical education at the RCSI, and in associated training hospitals in disciplines such as surgery, medicine, nursing, radiology, pharmacology, anaesthesiology, physiotherapy and dentistry.  </p> <p>  The RCSI is held in high international regard.  Nationally it is one of a limited number of higher Education Institutions, all of them universities, which hold designated awarding powers to a level 10 doctoral degree under the National Framework of Qualifications.  That said, the title of &ldquo;university&rdquo; is highly prized and rightly so.  Its integrity, in the context of safeguarding the reputation for excellence that attaches to the Irish higher education system, must be protected.  As such, this authorisation is neither easily obtained nor lightly granted.  In 2015 the RCSI obtained permission to describe itself as a university outside the State in certain prescribed circumstances.  The draft order before the committee today will, if passed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, enable the use of the university description in the State also.  </p> <p>  In July this year, with thanks to this committee's informed assistance and support, I piloted the then Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2019 through its legislative passage, including its amendment of the Universities Act 1997.  Now duly enacted this legislation provides for the first time a legal process whereby an education provider that does not derive their primary income from the Exchequer may seek authorisation from the Minister for Education and Skills to describe itself as a university.  This legislative process has provided an equitable pathway for eligible educational providers such as the RCSI to seek to so describe themselves - but only subject to compliance with an extensive set of rigorous conditions.  These conditions are modelled in large measure on those in the Technological Universities Act 2018.  They encompass requirements relating to an educational provider&rsquo;s research record, scope of programme provision and intensity, student access, staff qualifications, staff and student opportunities, governance and financial capability, as well as its wider collaborative international, professional, stakeholder and community links, and its contribution to the promotion of the economic, cultural, social and scientific development of the State.  </p> <p>  The RCSI is the first educational provider to apply under the new legislative provision and this application has been rigorously scrutinised and examined.  I have been advised by both the Higher Education Authority and Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland in considering this application.  I am satisfied that the RCSI complies with the conditions prescribed in the Universities Act 1997 as amended.  As such, I am proposing to grant the RCSI the first university authorisation order in the State.  I hereby commend the draft order to the committee seeking its approval.</p></speech>

It is something I have been discussing with her for a number of years, and I am  glad to see this coming to fruition in the Dail.  While the RCSI was founded by charter in 1784, we do not do royal charters in this country anymore.  We have a democratic process in the Houses of the Oireachtas, and that is something worth reflecting on.  We are here granting the status if that is what the Oireachtas wishes to do on the Minister of State's recommendation.  On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I fully support her proposal in this regard.</p><p> Like a number of members of this committee of all parties, I have visited the RCSI in the recent past.  It is a wonderful institution in the heart of Dublin, which operates, in a quiet manner in some respects, but in the same way in terms of mission, of fees, and of quality assurance as the other universities in this State.  On that basis and on the basis of the considerations of the Minister of State, it deserves its status.  The country is lucky to have an institution of the calibre of the RCSI serving our students, and international students, while also being at the cutting edge of medical technology, research and medical training.  </p><p> When we visited the RCSI, we saw what was on offer there in terms of medical training.  As someone who is not medically qualified, it was fabulous to see the facilities, and the thought and research that goes into providing the training for doctors.  One can only assume that through institutions such as the RCSI and other third level institutions, the country will be a better place for it.  The university designation is, in some respects, honorific, but, in others, it has status and, unquestionably the RCSI deserves, and is entitled, to have the status of university.  It is an honour for the country as well to have the RCSI.  </p><p> It is worth acknowledging that the physical location of the college played a very big part in the 1916 Rising.  Countess Markievicz was there.  Phillip Clarke, who was born eight miles from where I live was  killed on the steps of the college in 1916, and every year I remember him in Slane together with his relations.  The RCSI is doing its job now for its students and for the country, and it is welcome that this has happened.  It has taken time; as the Minister of State said, it is not a status that is easily granted, as this does not happen automatically.  Unlike in America, a university simply cannot be opened.  It is not the case here, as in the UK 20, 30 years ago that a raft of colleges can be instantly turned into universities without any consideration.  There is a process to go through, and that process has been gone through and I fully believe that RCSI has demonstrated that it is entitled to the designation of university and I certainly hope that members will support that.</p></speech>

Undoubtedly the RCSI is an excellent institution that is a university in all but name.  It offers a high standard of education and is of great value to all of its students.</p> <p>  Our issue with the RCSI is not its campus in Dublin; it is its campus in Bahrain.  This has been raised in these Houses on various occasions since 2011, and unfortunately the college has never responded satisfactorily.  There is a major issue, in which former students of the campus who have treated victims of the Bahraini regime's security service have been tortured, imprisoned, arrested and persecuted.  At no stage has the RCSI come out to condemn that or made a statement against that, and that is unacceptable.  The failure to condemn these human rights violations reflects poorly on the college, and particularly that campus in Bahrain.  If that campus is to gain further legitimacy by the granting of university status, there is an obligation on the RCSI's administrators to make it plain where they stand on these human rights abuses.  We in the Oireachtas have an obligation to encourage them, and to persuade them to try and take a stronger position on these human rights abuses.  </p> <p>  I believe the Government has in the past made statements condemning some of the human rights issues and it is aware of these problems.  This issue needs to be addressed and until it is. we are not satisfied to support the granting of university status, not for any educational reason in Ireland - it is a university in all but name - but for the college's failure to tackle the human rights abuse suffered by their own former students in Bahrain.</p></speech>

She stated:</p> <blockquote> 	That said, the title of &quot;university&quot; is highly prized and rightly so.  Its integrity, in the context of safeguarding the reputation for excellence that attaches to the Irish higher education system, must be protected. </blockquote> <p>I agree with her.  When it comes to integrity, we need to listen to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, but, more importantly, perhaps we need to listen to Ceartas, Irish Lawyers for Human Rights, who have called on the Irish Medical Council not to approve the RCSI's Bahrain campus re-accreditation because of the widespread abuses carried out by one of the most evil regimes in the world.</p><p>The Bahraini regime rules with an iron fist.  As my colleague said, many former medical students have been arrested, tortured, and imprisoned, for simply doing what was demanded of them through their hippocratic oath, yet Bahrain continues to violate their medical neutrality and the RCSI has refused to condemn the regime for this.  Ceartas have plainly stated that RCSI Bahrain has &quot;an education programme integrated with health systems connected to torture, discriminatory conduct in the provision of healthcare and employment of medical staff, and consistent violation of the rights to freedom of expression&quot;.  That is too serious to ignore.  I am glad the Minister of State mentioned that &quot;the application has been rigorously scrutinised and examined&quot;.  In that regard, perhaps she could tell us what the response from the RCSI has been to its silence to date, and its complicity through its silence in some of the most horrific human rights abuses happening in the world today.</p></speech>

It is an very historic and important day and, as the Minister of State said, this accolade is not easily handed out and a great deal of thought and consideration was given to it.  I congratulate all associated with the RCSI on the work that has gone into this, to bring us to where we are today.  I compliment them on that, and I am happy to support the Minister of State's proposal as outlined in the draft order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019120500002#D00800"><p>I apologise for being late; I was speaking in the Chamber on homelessness.</p> <p>  There is certainly an issue regarding Bahrain and human rights, but we are dealing with the status of the RCSI in Ireland, and I have no reason to object to the status being granted.  It has, rightly, gone through a rigorous examination, as the Minister of State said.  The granting of university status should not happen without that kind of rigorous examination.  We need to speak out on Bahrain, but that is primarily the duty of the Government and of those of us in Opposition parties.  I have worn many hats at this stage, but when I was in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I brought it up on a visit to the Middle East on behalf of the Government at the time.  That constantly needs to be raised by the Government and by other members of parliament here and in other countries because there no doubt that there are significant and very worrying violations of human rights, which involve medical personnel, including, I am sure, medical personnel associated with the RCSI.  It is serious, and I urge that the RCSI to take whatever opportunities it gets to raise these issues.  However, that it is not a reason to prevent the college from gaining the status of a university in Ireland, if it has been rigorously examined and reached that standard.  I am not inclined to stop that.  It is an important day for the college.  It has the right to be called a university outside Ireland, and this order will grant that right within the country.</p><p>We need to separate the two issues, although the human rights issue is serious and needs constantly to be brought to the attention of the authorities in Bahrain and of anybody else who influences what happens there.  Umbrella organisations in countries in the Middle East can exert significant influence but we also need to do that as a country.</p></speech>

We had a great deal of discussion in the Seanad about the future of the RCSI and its university status.  I will support the order because so many students from abroad and Irish students benefit from the standard of education at the RCSI.  Deputy O'Sullivan is correct that we must separate the two issues she outlined.</p></speech>

While I do not have a vote, I am sure my colleagues will support it.  The institution of the RCSI, as was pointed out, has given an education to men and women from Ireland and throughout the world.  In my time as Minister for Health, I was struck by the influence it has in so many places because of the goodwill for the college through its graduates spread throughout the world.</p><p>I trained at the RCSI and was never trained to be anything other than a caring doctor who sought to heal wounds, relieve pain and preserve pain.  As was noted by other speakers, that the RCSI is considered a university everywhere else outside this jurisdiction is a contradiction that strikes people, and it is damaging to the college in respect of its ability to influence countries that are not aware of its status.  China, in particular, wonders why it is considered a university everywhere else but Ireland.</p><p>The arguments raised by Sinn F&eacute;in regarding serious issues in Bahrain are somewhat skewed and do not bear relevance, given that the college already has university status outside of these shores.  The order is about conferring university status here in recognition of the college's tremendous work, including the <i>pro bono</i>work it has done throughout the world, in sub-Saharan Africa and various other places.  In my contribution in the Seanad, I itemised all such work and I have no intention of reiterating them now.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for showing the leadership she has on the matter, and the Department, the Chairman and the committee for their support.  It is a proud and good day for the RCSI and its graduates, who are spread throughout the world.  It is timely and appropriate.</p></speech>

I have always considered it bizarre that the RCSI could call itself a university abroad but not at home.  For almost a quarter of a millennium, the RCSI has been a leader in the field of medical education.  It is a fantastic organisation and today is an historic day.  I commend the Minister of State on her leadership in the matter.  She worked tirelessly to get us to where we are today, and I commend her on that.  In her work on technological universities, she has also done a great deal for higher education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019120500002#E00900"><p>It is clear the RCSI satisfies the criteria to become a university, as set out in the legislation.  It had tacit recognition as a college of the National University of Ireland, which, along with the wider public, I represent, and it was recognised abroad as a university.  In welcoming the fact that we are moving forward in the implementation of the legislation, I underscore the points made by the Minister of State to the effect that it is not to be done lightly and that it will come with responsibilities.  It is important that we are clear that to become a university is not simply a badge of honour but rather comes with additional responsibility, given that we, as a State, will give it the status of a university.</p> <p>  The concerns about international campuses and the campus re-accreditation in Bahrain are valid and need to be examined.  Such campuses already use the title of university.  In giving the title of university to the entire RCSI, we will not need to separate the two campuses but instead integrate them more closely.  In achieving the title of university and holding the title on its four campuses, I hope it will be an opportunity for an intensification of scrutiny and shared responsibility on the four campuses, with joined-up consideration.  The Minister of State might comment on those issues and how they will be addressed.</p> <p>  Another responsibility in the important step forward for the RCSI relates to matters such as the Athena SWAN, on which most recognised universities in Ireland are now stepping forward in the advancement of gender equality on their campuses, as a priority in all parts of the organisation of universities.  It might be useful to hear to what extent that will be considered.  I acknowledge that the RCSI has engaged with a couple of access programmes, including the Traveller access programme, as part of a new focus on research, which I applaud.  Nevertheless, I hope there will be a stepping up on the other aspect the Minister of State mentioned, namely, economic, social and cultural advancement.  The RCSI engaged on commemorative work on 1916 and in a new set of forums, including an interesting recent lecture on health equality.</p> <p>  The order is a step change, not simply a recognition of the work.  With that step change of becoming a university, there will come new opportunities and responsibilities for the RCSI.  I am not a voting member of the committee but attend as someone who has great interest in the matter.  As the Minister of State will recall, I debated the legislation at length with her.  I will not query that now because the legislation has been passed and I look forward to its application.  We are looking to the next stage of the debate.  We should avoid anomalies in the future.  I hope it will not be the case that a college will be considered a university abroad but not here.  Unfortunately, in certain parts of the world, including the US, there have been many cases of companies and so on that have presented themselves as universities or colleges, which has had a detrimental effect.  It is appropriate that we keep a strong oversight and control over those that are accredited as universities.  Given that the pressure point of funding does not apply in this case, the pressure point of standards must be used.</p> <p>  I am a witness to the process rather than a voting member of the committee.  I look forward to the RCSI's next chapter and hope it will address the concerns that were raised.  I also look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>

I would like to make a point as Chair of the committee.  It is always important to raise issues of human rights and abuse of human rights, and that got an airing here today, but I certainly would not conflate the two issues.  What the Minister is doing is the right thing to do, and the committee, the Oireachtas and the country should be very proud that today we are conferring university status on the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI.  I ask the Minister to respond to the comments.</p></speech>

In 2015, RCSI partnered with the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, LFHE, and committed to supporting female staff to join the leadership programme, and to date a significant number of staff members have completed an in-house leadership development programme.</p> <p>  In 2016, RCSI launched the Emily Winifred Dixon prize, which recognises women who have made an outstanding contribution to the field.  One of those people who has won that prize is Professor Louise Richardson, of whom many members will know.  She is the vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford.  Former President of Ireland, Dr. Mary Robinson, also received the Emily Winifred Dixon prize.  In October 2018, RCSI was awarded an Athena SWAN bronze award in recognition of positive gender practice, providing equal opportunities for success for all people.  I understand it is working towards that silver award.</p> <p>  As mentioned, it also participates in the higher education admissions route, supporting socio-economically disadvantaged students, and it provides a number of access scholarships for CAO school leaving applicants.  I had the great pleasure of meeting one family from the Traveller community, a family member who is a graduate of RCSI, with another brother training as a medical doctor and a sister training as a nurse.  These scholarships will provide reduced entry points, financial support, and opportunities for students who might otherwise be unable to attend third level.</p> <p>  Students from 30 countries study and train at RCSI, and this is evidence of the diversity of the institution.  The other point I wanted to make was that there will be university designation across all the campuses, and there will be a consistent approach, which I would expect from RCSI, of the highest educational and ethical standards across the universities.  I am going to leave that topic and turn to the piece on Bahrain, if the committee does not mind.</p> <p>  What I would like to highlight is that RCSI can already use the title university outside of the State for specified purposes under the existing 2015 legislation.  Therefore, the draft order before the committee today has no impact on RCSI using the university title outside the State.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said, higher educational institutions, HEIs, are independent, autonomous bodies with responsibilities to governing bodies, as well as to staff, students, and wider stakeholders.  This is also true in large measure to those HEIs which do not receive primary funding from the State, but which may receive university authorisation under this process.</p> <p>  RCSI has informed me about its Bahrain campus, and its work in that region.  RCSI has placed a strong emphasis on the ethos and the standards of its Bahrain campus, where it provides quality medical and nursing training in a non-sectarian environment, and where it instills high ethical standards of medical practice in its students and in its graduates.  RCSI advocates on behalf of medical personnel in treating all patients regardless of their backgrounds.  RCSI has publicly stressed that the well-being of its Bahrain staff and students, and their freedom to work and learn in safety, is paramount.  RCSI believes that by continuing to educate 1,400 students of all religious and cultural backgrounds, and socio-economic groups in Bahrain, as well as instilling adherence to the highest ethical standards of medical practice, it can most effectively contribute to just outcomes and to community reconciliation.  The RCSI medical programme has been validated by the Irish Medical Council, IMC, following an inspection visit to Bahrain.  A notable graduate of RCSI is Nada Haffadh, who became Bahrain's first female minister, after being appointed health minister in 2004.</p> <p>  I heard what was said today.  It was alleged that the hospitals in Bahrain, where RCSI Bahrain medical and nursing students have their clinical training, were connected to torture and discriminatory conduct in the provision of healthcare.  There is no evidence to back up this assertion.  The RCSI medical programme has been validated by the Irish Medical Council, following an inspection to Bahrain.  The Irish Medical Council accreditation report is a publicly available document.  I can read out some of its findings, if the committee would like to hear those, but the IMC accreditation team commended RCSI Bahrain, and the teaching hospital, which is the subject of the unproven allegations, for their attention to students and to their professional and ethical development.  In particular, the report noted that students at clinical sites, that is, associated teaching hospitals, understood that they could raise concerns regarding professionalism observed at clinical sites, knew who they should contact and were confident that their concerns would be treated seriously and appropriately.  Furthermore, a stand-alone module on human rights has been introduced to the curriculum, with assessment explicitly linked to student progress.  A range of external sources are explicitly identified as being referenced in teaching professionalism, in ethics and in human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights and the report of the Bahrain independent commission of inquiry.</p><p>I will leave it at that. </p></speech>

The other member of our team, our chief operations officer, Mr. Gerry Quinn, could not make it this morning.</p> <p>  I am now three months into my term as Governor.  In that period, I have prioritised listening to colleagues in the bank and stakeholders outside it to understand better the issues and challenges as they see them.  I have spent time outside Dublin &ndash; in Waterford and Dundalk, in Carlow at the National Ploughing Championships and in Frankfurt and Washington DC.  I have met members of the public, business owners and business representatives from a range of sectors, governors from other central banks and officials from the IMF and the European Commission, among others.  Last week, I hosted a round-table discussion at the Central Bank for 14 organisations representing civil society.</p> <p>  The committee's invitation asked that I address the current principal issues being dealt with by the Central Bank.  Therefore, in addition to outlining some of my reflections so far, in my remarks this morning I will outline some of the bank's recent activities, as well as what I see as challenges on the horizon.  Of course, it will not cover all the issues that will be of interest to the committee, so I look forward to a wider discussion.</p> <p>  The Central Bank's mandate is to serve the public interest by safeguarding monetary and financial stability and by working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.  Having spent my entire career in public service, across the areas of macro and microeconomics, public policy and service delivery, I recognise the importance of that mission.  To my mind, the wider economy is represented by the community across Ireland.</p> <p>  Over recent years, the Central Bank has grown as its mandate has increased, reflecting both the response to the global financial crisis and the changing world around us.  Our responsibilities are heavily intertwined.  The breadth of our mandate gives us both strength and insight, enabling the bank to harness its collective, wide-ranging and deep policy and technical expertise to tackle complex issues.  Most of the areas we are responsible for &ndash; whether consumer protection, prudential regulation, payments, settlements and currency or providing economic analysis and statistics &ndash; have complex interactions with one another.  I see our job, along with other members of the Central Bank Commission, as ensuring these are all brought together.</p> <p>  I also have personal responsibility to the Eurosystem in terms of our primary mandate of price stability, which, at its heart, is essential to intergenerational well-being, enabling governments, businesses and citizens to plan, invest and make provision for the future.  Aligned to that is the Eurosystem's secondary mandate of supporting "the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union".  The European and euro area post-crisis institutional architecture for economic policy and financial regulation and supervision has changed and continues to change.  The ongoing evolution will continue to require us to be closely engaged and influential in EU and international fora.</p> <p>  I have been struck by how committed the staff in the Central Bank are to working in the public interest.  This resonates with my own values and I am confident that we have a strong basis on which to deliver our mission.  As well as building on our strengths, however, we also need to maintain a sense of humility and openness to being challenged: the financial system is changing rapidly and future challenges and crises will be different to what went before.</p> <p>  From a delivery perspective, we must ensure we are using our resources effectively and efficiently.  As the world around us changes, we need to evolve and strengthen as an organisation, consistently seeking to be best in class.  That means regularly assessing and examining our policies, frameworks and approaches to ensure they are fit for purpose.  Diversity of thought is a critical component in this regard in order to give us the capacity for deeper insights and make us more resilient.</p> <p>  More generally, from my early engagements with various stakeholders, and in preparing for this hearing, I recognise a desire in some quarters for the Central Bank to move faster on certain issues.  I understand that.  I certainly want us to be on the front foot in our delivery &ndash; proactive, assertive and agile both in what we do and how we do it &ndash; but a rigorous evidence-based approach must continue to underpin the delivery of our mission.</p> <p>  As members know, the Central Bank's three-year strategic plan runs to 2021.  Its key themes, namely, resilience, consumer protection, engaging and influencing, organisational capability and Brexit, remain valid.  As with any strategic plan, however, it is sensible to undertake a mid-point review, and we will do so next year.</p> <p>  Let me now turn to a number of areas of recent activity.  Yesterday we published our financial stability review.</p><p>It outlines what we see as the main risks to financial stability, the resilience of the financial system to those risks and the Central Bank's policy actions in response.  The key risks on our horizon include the consequences of the current low interest rate environment across the globe, the potential for pro-cyclical risk-taking domestically in the context of an economy that is close to capacity, the impact on Ireland of changes in the international trading and tax environment, the lingering issue of high levels of sovereign debt in the euro area and a disorderly Brexit.  I mention Brexit because it is important to be clear that it has not gone away.  As I said in Waterford recently, if the withdrawal agreement it is ratified by the next UK Parliament, that will merely represent the end of the beginning.</p><p> Any form of Brexit will be damaging for Ireland.  A no-deal Brexit that involves no withdrawal agreement or no free trade agreement will be especially damaging.  We have focused on ensuring the risks to the Irish economy are understood and the risks to financial stability and consumer protection are identified and mitigated to the greatest possible extent.  Looking at the picture beyond Brexit, the Central Bank uses evidence-based macroprudential policies to promote financial stability in Ireland and to mitigate the impact of negative shocks on the real economy.  The existing mortgage measures are a central component of our macroprudential toolkit.  The annual review of these measures allows us to challenge ourselves to ensure they are set in a way that maintains and builds the resilience of borrowers and banks and prevents an unsustainable credit-fuelled housing boom from emerging once more.  These measures were first introduced in early 2015, at a time when house prices were still recovering from the financial crisis.  Since then, there have been several years in which house prices have grown faster than incomes due to supply constraints.</p><p> According to the evidence from the 2019 review, the mortgage measures have been effective in strengthening borrower and lender resilience and in limiting the potential for a pro-cyclical credit house price spiral to emerge.  Our models suggest that if the measures had not been introduced in 2015, all else being equal, it is likely that the level of house prices and the proportion of highly indebted mortgage borrowers would be significantly higher than they are at present.  While the objective of the mortgage measures is not to target house prices, our analysis suggests that affordability pressures for mortgage borrowers would be even more acute in their absence.  As I said yesterday, we see no reason to change the mortgage measures because they are working.  We recognise that significant challenges remain for people and families that are looking to purchase homes.  Demand continues to outstrip supply.  There are issues in the mortgage market, the rental market and the social housing market.  However, increasing household debt is not a substitute for increasing the supply of housing.</p><p> The decision on the mortgage measures was not the only macroprudential decision to be published yesterday.  We also announced further progress on, and plans around, the development of a number of buffers in the capital of banks.  Essentially, these buffers are cushions against different types of risk, including an economic downturn.  The mortgage measures are an important part of our consumer protection framework.  My first few months in this role have shown me that the protection of consumers is embedded in every area of the Central Bank's work.  Our statutory codes of conduct, redress powers and enforcement actions are essential to consumer and investor protection, as is our work to ensure firms are well managed and financially sound and to guard against instability in the system as a whole.  I have seen at first hand the scale of the work the bank undertook on the tracker mortgage examination, resulting in the payment of hundreds of millions of euro in redress and compensation to more than 40,000 consumers.  I have been briefed on our ongoing enforcement investigations.  We have had to remind certain lenders of the consequences of failing to co-operate.  As set out in our strategic plan, we must strengthen our approach to consumer protection by enhancing our approach to conduct risk, developing our approach to supervision and continuing to focus on the culture of firms and the individual accountability of the people who run them.</p><p> We need a financial system that fosters trust and ensures consumers and investors are protected, deposits are safe and insurance reserves are adequate to meet liabilities.  We work with the other parts of the State&rsquo;s consumer protection framework, including the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, to deliver this.  We also need a strong culture of compliance.  When it comes to issues like culture, responsibility rests first and foremost with the leadership of firms.  Organisations make their own cultures.  Boards are responsible for ensuring the development of the consumer-focused and compliance-focused cultures that the Irish public deserves.  If the sector wishes to regain trust, it must earn it by demonstrating trustworthiness.  That is no easy feat.  Rightfully, the public will be the ultimate adjudicators.  I welcome the creation of the Irish Banking Culture Board as a positive sign of intent.  The individual accountability framework that we have proposed should help to address some of the issues in the banking sector.</p><p> I want to speak about an ongoing challenge and an emerging risk.  The protection of borrowers in mortgage arrears continues to be a key priority for the Central Bank.  The regulatory framework provides a significant number of protections for borrowers in arrears.  This is important given the strain, stress and vulnerability of people who are at risk of losing their homes.  The Central Bank's approach to resolution has focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers and ensuring lenders have appropriate arrears resolution strategies in place.  Significant progress has been made in restructuring mortgage arrears.  The implementation of alternative repayment arrangements has been a critical factor in this regard.  It is also true to say that a sizeable arrears problem persists.  Engagement between lenders and borrowers remains essential if this is to be addressed successfully.  Arrangements should be appropriate and sustainable for the borrower, regardless of whether a bank or non-bank holds the loan.  It is important that any arrangement addresses the underlying problem for borrowers.  As part of our supervisory work, we will continue to focus on ensuring the long-term sustainability of alternative arrangements.  We will continue to press all firms to engage and work to find solutions for firms and borrowers which address the underlying issues.  We must recognise that there will be cases where this may not possible.</p><p> The emerging risk I want to mention is the growing size of the market-based finance sector in Ireland and across the world.  The relative size of the sector in Ireland to the domestic economy is among the largest globally.  It has a predominantly international focus and is dominated by investment funds and money market funds, which account for approximately two thirds of total assets.  Market-based finance provides a valuable alternative to bank financing for many businesses and households, thereby supporting economic activity.  These activities may give rise to financial vulnerabilities, which need to be understood, monitored and addressed.  For this reason, I announced yesterday that we will build on recent work in this area by conducting a deep dive on property funds to assess the resilience of this growing form of market-based finance.  We will consider whether there is a need for macroprudential policies to strengthen the resilience of this growing form of finance to the domestic economy.  We will continue to work on these issues with our colleagues in Europe and in global forums.</p><p> I have sought to give the committee a whistle-stop tour of the principal issues being dealt with by the Central Bank, together with some of my own reflections.  I would like to conclude by saying something about the risks that are currently faced by the global economy and how I believe Ireland should look to manage them.  In its latest forecasts, the IMF signalled a slowdown in global growth, driven by "Rising trade and geopolitical tensions [that] have increased uncertainty about the future of the global trading system and international cooperation more generally, taking a toll on business confidence, investment decisions, and global trade".  This uncertainty comes at a time when economies have started to enter significant transitions, driven by developments in technology, demography and the environment, to name just three factors.  A particular characteristic of these transitions is the pace of change.  We need to meet these challenges by building resilience across the economy, in the financial services sector and, most importantly, in households across the country.  We should continue to focus on the fundamentals.  We must manage the short term while planning for the medium term.  We should ensure our frameworks are fit for purpose.  We must learn the lessons of the past while preparing for the future.</p><p>Successful economies need stable and sustainable macroeconomic frameworks and sound monetary policy that delivers predictable prices.  They also need stable and well-regulated financial systems and well-functioning markets.  The Central Bank will continue to focus on its core mandate of price stability, a stable financial system and the protection of consumers.  We will also continue to challenge ourselves.  As I said earlier, as the world around us changes, we need to evolve and strengthen as an organisation, learning from experience and regularly assessing our policies and approaches.</p><p> Finally, our freedom to make independent decisions will not mean that we will be isolated.  We will be transparent in the exercise of our responsibilities, accountable for our activities and engaged and connected with those we serve.</p><p> I welcome the opportunity to appear before you today.</p></speech>

This is the Governor's first opportunity to come before the committee and I welcome it.  I know we have had an opportunity to meet prior, so I welcome that also.  I look forward to the engagement as we had with the Governor's predecessors, some of what may be robust and helpful and from the Governor's point of view may be not too helpful.  That is what it is all about.</p> <p>  Can I ask the Governor to pick up on the last point that he made in terms of the further research that he is going to do in relation to the investment funds, and particularly property investment funds.  I did engage with the Governor's predecessor on this issue.  I wrote to him at the time outlining my concerns in terms of the highly-leveraged nature of some of these funds and if they were to drop in the market the spillover effects that that would have.  The Central Bank on the back of that and some of its own concerns carried out an assessment which I think was published about this time last year and was very thorough.  It did identify some of the risks if there was a shock such as Brexit and that there could be spillover effects from these investment funds withdrawing and the impact in terms of property and commercial property in particular.  </p> <p>  Given that work had been done and those risks had been identified, why is the Governor - and I welcome the fact - carrying out further evaluation and research in relation to this?  Is the Governor more concerned now about these investment funds and property investment funds than he or the Central Bank was at that time?  Is there something that has led to more concerns within the banks?</p></speech>

From a global perspective, what we are seeing is a significant growth in the non-banking sector.  My own concern is shared by a number of my colleagues and peers around the world.  What we want to make sure, and what I am absolutely determined to make sure, is that we hit on the front foot of understanding the risks that the growth in the sector posed to us in Ireland but also to us in the euro system.</p> <p>  We have been doing more work to understand and map the non-banking sector, and we will be publishing some of that information next week.  What I announced yesterday just reflects in part my view that we need to deepen our understanding of what is going on, and we need to do a piece of work which at the moment is going to be focused on property funds, but depending on where we get to may actually also expand.  Perhaps Ms Donnery can tell Deputy Doherty a bit more.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty referred already to some of the work that we have been doing in this sector, and maybe I will make some general comments about the sector first before I talk a little bit about what exactly we are going to do.  As the Governor mentioned in his opening statement, there has been growth in this market-based financed or non-bank financed sector globally, particularly so in Ireland.  It is important to say that this type of financing does have many benefits, and there is a big debate in Europe about the heavy reliance of Europe on banks, for example, and that these types of funds and this type of non-banking sector allows a diversification of funding and investment.  That is part of the debate at European level on capital markets union.  We also recognise that these types of finance funds and so on offer diversification and therefore can diversify risk.</p> <p>  At the same time, a key issue for us is about resilience, so understanding if there were difficulties in a sector such as this, would risks be amplified or would the funds themselves, the wider sector and the economy be resilient to how those shocks would be handled.  That is really what we have been doing.  As was mentioned, a lot of the work up until now has been focused on data gathering and understanding what is here, the size of what is here and so on.  Some of those funds are very internationally-focused.  They do not really interconnect with the Irish economy at all and are really serving businesses outside of Europe and in the rest of the world.  In the case of the funds the Governor has mentioned in particular, they are investing in commercial real estate in Ireland, and about 35% of commercial real estate in Ireland is now held by these different types of investment funds.  We really want to look at that in more detail, so who are those investors and how would those funds react and behave in times of stress if that were to happen, and do we need to do anything to consider how that might be managed in a better way.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Donnery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019120500002#D00700"><p>It is across Ireland, but it is predominantly in Dublin and office blocks and so it is to understand that a little better.  As the Governor said, one of the key reasons we want to look at this in a bit more detail is it has been growing and it has become a more significant holder of commercial real estate.  It means that foreign investment in commercial real estate is a good thing compared with times in the past when the banks obviously were very heavily exposed to commercial real estate.  It does also mean that Ireland is more exposed to these kinds of cyclical events globally, if there were risks emerging around the world.</p></speech>

I was not aware of the 35% figure, so that is obviously an increase in terms of where we have been.  The idea that over one third of commercial real estate right across the State is held by funds should ring alarm bells, because a lot of this is out of our control.  The work the Central Bank has done and the work I have done shows that there is an issue in certain funds in terms of leverage and that we would be susceptible to a shock.  The concern I have - and I have made the point - is that I believe there is bubble in commercial property.  Is the Central Bank aware of any trend of disposal of commercial property or an increase of disposal of commercial property in recent times that are raising any concerns, which would indicate maybe that funds are withdrawing from the market?  Obviously, if there was a large-scale fire sale of assets, that would have an impact on property prices and also would spill over into residential and so forth.</p></speech>

The issue is more there is a risk for that to happen, and so it is to understand what could trigger those things to happen.  If there was a situation like that, for example, if there was some sort of form of global instability or global concern that led investors to leave Ireland or to leave commercial real estate more broadly, not just in Ireland but globally, how would that feed through.  For the funds that we have, for example - hypothetically now because this is what we are going to look at - would the level of leverage amplify that or are there things that need to be done to make sure that amplification would not happen.  That is exactly what we are looking at.  On the 35%, we published that number yesterday, so I am sure when Deputy Doherty has time, he can have a look at the report that we published yesterday.</p></speech>

I believe that house prices need to come down, but I do not think that changing the macroprudential rules is the way to solve the pressure that people are under.  I have spoken to the Governor about this myself.  He makes it clear that the rules have prevented house prices from increasing by 15% to 20%.  That is quite a significant amount of money if one was to translate that into hard cash for families.  There has been pressure in relation to loosening these rules.  The Governor has resisted that pressure from different quarters from certain areas in the political sphere and also within the banking sphere.</p><p>How convinced is the Governor that loosening the rules, if he were to do so, would automatically lead to an increase house prices?</p><p> One of the arguments I have been making for quite a while is that the banks need to use the exemptions that are available to them.  I refer to the 20% that allows people to be catered for when they do not reach either of the targets.  In other words, there is a certain flexibility.  There have been changes in how banks are dealing with that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but is the Governor satisfied that all banks are using the flexibility within the rules to the maximum in order to ensure that their customers' needs are met?</p></speech>

We are concerned, which is the main reason we decided to leave the rules unchanged.  As I stated yesterday, the rules are doing their job.  As a result, we do not propose to change them.  Right now, if we had changed them, the community would have taken on unnecessary risk.</p> <p>  On the question of whether the banks are using the allowances to their maximum potential, our analysis shows that the banks have a bit more flexibility which they have not been using.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Donnery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019120500002#E00300"><p>I will say a few more words in reply to the Deputy's first question on house prices.  As the Governor stated, it is exactly because of those concerns that we have not loosened the measures.  Yesterday, we published quite a lot of information on the scenario of what house prices would have looked like without those measures.</p> <p>  On the exemptions, we looked at them carefully as part of the review.  We looked at the operation in the individual banks.  We listened to all kinds of feedback on the exemptions, on how they are operating and on concerns about them being used up at particular points of the year.  On the latter point, if people go to their banks during a particular quarter, there are no exemptions left.  As the Governor stated, there is some scope for the banks to use the exemptions a bit more.  The banks are not using them fully.  At the same time, the Central Bank's rules are not the bank's own risk appetite.  We expect the banks to also consider their risk appetite and their lending practices in terms of how they are using the rules.  It may be the case that banks, for example, in the context of first-time buyers, do not necessarily want to lend over the 90% limit even though there is a small exemption above that.  The risk-appetite aspect is very much up to the banks.</p> <p>  On the other practical issues about how the exemptions are being used, their seasonality, etc., we have looked at all that and we do not see particular problems.  We would acknowledge that, two years ago, when we made amendments to the rules and they were phased in quickly, it was definitely challenging for the banks to implement those changes.  They found it quite difficult to manage the utilisation of the exemptions.</p> <p>  I appreciate that we only published some of the information on the operation of the allowances yesterday.</p></speech>

Are those same banks using the exemptions to the maximum extent?  There may be some banks that will not use them in the context of their risk appetite.  When, however, banks call for the Central Bank to change the rules but do not use the flexibilities within those rules to meet their customers' needs, it is questionable behaviour.</p></speech>

Some of them are closer to the limit, others are a little further away from it.  Some of the calls for change in the mortgage rules did not only relate to the exemptions; they were to do with the rules themselves, in terms of the multiples, etc.  As the Deputy will be aware, we did not change any of that yesterday.</p></speech>

There are many questions about the circumstances of individual borrowers, etc.  At the bank, we fully appreciate the challenge for individual borrowers in trying to get a mortgage but the exemptions are exactly designed to allow the banks to consider the circumstances of individuals.</p></speech>

Mr. Sibley stated that the Central Bank does not have a preference for loan sales, which we have heard previously.  He has stated that the banks are not giving enough prominence to the benefits of long-term restructuring in terms of their troubled customers.  Mr. Sibley raised questions about whether the banks truly value customer relationships and questioned the type of advertising and the slogans that banks are using compared to what is happening on the ground.  Can Mr. Sibley expand on the remarks to which I refer?</p> <p>  Along with many others, I would probably say that the Central Bank has come to this late in the day.  The Central Bank remained quiet as banks sold thousands upon thousands of family homes to the vultures and then, when most had been sold and when the figures for non-performing loans in banks are coming down closer to the European average, bank suddenly finds a conscience and starts to say some of what members in this committee have been saying for quite a while.  Consumers have been looking for the Central Bank, in the context of its consumer protection role, to protect them or to say something in clear terms, but it stayed out of the debate.  Much damage has been done.  I welcome Mr. Sibley's comments, but maybe he could expand further because what consumers are saying to me, particularly those who have had their loans sold on, is that they are finding it difficult to deal with vulture funds and wonder why the Central Bank did not say this two years ago.</p></speech>

To start with, in dealing with the mortgage arrears, first and foremost, being focused on mortgage arrears for many years and making sure that the challenges for borrowers and for the banks have been dealt with in a sustainable way, the approach the bank has consistently taken is to drive banks to engage with borrowers and to ensure that they have a full suite of options for dealing with borrowers, through forbearance, engagement, restructuring and using their balance sheets.  After that, the focus has been on ensuring that are engaged in terms of other parts of the safety net, such as the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  Nothing I said a couple of weeks ago that is inconsistent with what we have said or the approach we have taken previously.  What we have had to is continue to push banks, this happened from 2012 and 2013 all the way through, to ensure that they are thinking about the full suite of options and really trying to engage with all their customers to make sure that they are taking account of people's needs and addressing their problems so long as the they are willing to engage.  That approach has paid dividends.  There are a significant number of mortgages that have been restructured from the peak of the mortgage arrears crisis in 2013.  In terms of the level, there would be more than 100,000 mortgage accounts restructured, mostly in the banking system.</p> <p>  What I have also consistently said is that loan sales may be part of the solution in terms of the banks' resilience.  That does not stop the Central Bank's work in terms of the protections that are in place for borrowers and the work that we do in terms of engaging with the lender, regardless of whether it is a bank.</p> <p>  What I pushed in my remarks - and what I continue to push, privately as well as publicly - is the need to make sure that the loan sales are not seen as the only way to deal with these problems.  In a couple of instances, there are banks that have eased off a little in terms of looking at restructuring or that continue to try to engage and that are more prone to defaulting to thinking about loan sales.</p><p>It is wholly appropriate that we would continue to push banks to be engaged or for us to be looking to restructure as required, as well as potentially thinking about loan sales.  We will continue to engage on this point.  I am very happy to deal with the other points Deputy Doherty makes around the customer relationships and culture, if he wants, but I think the thrust was more on loan sales.</p></speech>

It was a reference just to beware of hubris.  There have been isolated instances, not just in banking, where it seems to be that the memories of the crisis, and how deep it has been and how hurtful it has been for people for Ireland, are starting to fade a little.  It was picked up as a relatively gentle reminder to make sure that we should beware of that, and we should make sure that we do remember the costs and damage of the crisis.</p></speech>

What is the Governor's response to the call from the CEO of KBC for him to turn the page, to move on and allow the banks to get on with their work?</p></speech>

One of the things I can tell Deputy Doherty is he may regret the fact that we may continue to be annoying.  The point which I think is important and upon which I want to build is what Mr. Sibley just said, which is certainly under my leadership I am absolutely determined to make sure that the practices and the culture, the behaviours of the past, are not repeated.  In the work that the Central Bank has done, which it should be extremely proud of, and the work that we are doing and the work that we will do, we are going to make sure that banks are held to account for their actions.  In particular, it is their responsibility - as I said earlier - to restore trust in themselves.  Banks are an important part of the financial system.  They are an important part of the community.  We want the community as a whole to trust them.</p> <p>  At the Central Bank, we are going to make sure that we continue to pursue this agenda, but I will also continue to call on the banks to show that they are taking it seriously and for them to prove to the community as a whole that they are changing.  That is why I welcomed the setting up of the culture board, and I look forward to the culture board.  I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  I like to see that as a statement of intent, that they want to change, and at the end of the day, it will be their actions that will determine the extent to which they are changing.  We are going to continue to do our job.  </p> <p>  We have proposed, as the committee will know, a senior accountability regime which will be an important part of the infrastructure and the framework that we need.  I look forward to the introduction of the legislation and I look forward to cross-party support for that legislation when it comes into place.  I can assure Deputy Doherty we are going to take this issue seriously.  It is important for the community.  Let me make a particular point, because the other day, when I was talking to a stakeholder from outside the bank, he said to me that I have to protect bank profits.  I could not let that statement just lie there.  My response to him was that my job and our job is not to protect bank profits.  Our job is to protect financial stability.  Obviously, the profitability of banks is related to financial stability.  We are absolutely focused on our mandate.  We are not in the business of promoting the financial services industry as may have been the case in the past.  That is not our job.  Our job is to protect the financial stability of the country, the wider economy, consumers' interests and the interests of citizens in Ireland.  That is the job we are going to focus on.</p></speech>

Before I ask this, I wish the Governor well.  With a new chief comes possibly a new direction.  Let me say this, banks need to fear the Central Bank.  The CEO does not fear the Central Bank, because he would not have made those recorded comments, and he would not have discussed openly the fine that the Central Bank is about to impose on them when its investigation is completed.  There needs to be an element of fear of the Central Bank that is not there at this point in time.  There also needs to be a working relationship, but there needs to be that element of fear.  I do not believe it is there.</p> <p>  On the insurance issue, we have discussed the dual pricing and welcome the investigation that is under way with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has written to the insurance companies in a "Dear CEO" letter a fortnight ago in relation to their consumer protection roles and price optimisation or dual pricing.  Did any of the insurance companies respond to the Central Bank, positively or negatively, either confirming that they are operating dual pricing or otherwise?  This next question has nothing to do with the personalities involved.  Is there any concern within the Central Bank of that kind of revolving door within the insurance sector of the Central Bank and the insurance industry?  I understand that a previous, very competent person who was the head of insurance within the Central Bank is now going onto the board of FBD.  It is not the first person from the Central Bank.  We have had a very senior person in the Central Bank who has taken up a very senior position in FBD.  It is a small country and one needs the knowledge, but are there concerns in relation to this head of insurance moving into the head of an insurance company?  They are under investigation.  There is an examination ongoing and so on and so forth.  Has the Governor any concerns or is there anything that can be done in relation to this issue?</p></speech>

We wrote the letter to be clear and specific about our high-level intent, and we have been told by some that they are not operating any price differentiation.  We have been told by others that they actually charge existing customers less than new customers, and we have been told by others that new customers get discounts.  That is only from our point of view the tip of the iceberg, because that is at a preliminary level.  Precisely because we need to establish in a great degree of granularity - because of the new innovations - what is going on, we are doing this deeper investigation as we discussed at the specific hearing addressing that.  I hope that answers Deputy Doherty's question.</p></speech>

Mr. Sibley made reference to it in terms of the Central Bank having issues with the banks and that they could deal with the loans in different ways from selling them on.  There has been a significant sale of loans.  An issue is manifesting itself whereby funds are coming in and buying large swathes of property.  I want to get a holistic view.  Has the Central Bank quantified the position in that regard?  That is where I see the main exposure.  They are coming in from abroad and buying commercial and residential real estate.  I see significant exposure in the level of loans.  Has the Central Bank looked at the type of investment vehicles that are purchasing these loans?  There is anecdotal evidence to the effect that many of them are 100% geared for that.  They are vehicles that purchased loans with borrowed moneys.  Has the Central Bank looked under the floorboards, so to speak, at that level?  If it is looking at the entire area, I would like it to expand that and examine the purchase of loans from the mainstream banks and the level of overall property, be it outright purchase or purchase of loans, the investment funds now control in Ireland.</p></speech>

If we think about it from a financial stability perspective, we are looking at interconnectedness and the risks, as we discussed with Deputy Pearse Doherty, relating to leverage, which the Senator is talking about, and other issues in terms of potential hard stops.  I would make the point that having diverse funding and investment into commercial real estate is a positive, relative to where we were in, say, 2007 and 2008 when it was primarily driven out of the banking system, and we know what happened with that.</p> <p>  The sale of mortgage loans is clearly relevant to our wider work when we think about financial stability but our focus in that area is to look at it from a consumer protection perspective.  It is relatively small, albeit we are talking about very large numbers, and it clearly matters to the people involved, but our focus is very much from a consumer protection lens.  It is about engaging with the credit servicing firms and the retail credit firms and asking about the approach they are taking to-----</p></speech>

It is whether many of these funds that are purchasing mortgages are structured in a way that they can deal with the long-term requirements of the mortgage holders whose loans they purchased or if they are effectively asset disposal agencies in a different form.  My concern is that they are 100% geared for this, as I said earlier.  There is a stability aspect to that.  Has the Central Bank looked to that area to ensure that the funds that are purchasing these mortgages are sufficiently resourced with expertise and long-term financial structures to be able to deal with the mortgages they have purchased?  Does that have any implications for financial stability, which is the primary remit of the Central Bank?</p></speech>

There is the finance stability angle but, importantly from our perspective in this area, what is happening for the borrowers.</p><p>Regardless of whether the firm is a bank or non-bank, we would expect it to have appropriate strategies in place for dealing with people in distress, the operational capability to deal with it and a range of solutions that are sufficiently tailored to the individuals.  Obviously, we take information from this committee as well but when we are in these firms, we see that they are maintaining the arrangements that are in play as they are sold - the restructuring that is in place - and that they are trying to stabilise the situation with their distressed borrowers for those who are not in arrangements.  We will continue to challenge them, as we do with the banks, to see whether they are doing enough in terms of providing long-term solutions and securing a long-term path for these loans.  As part of the relatively recent legislation in terms of loan owners, we are going through an authorisation process for all of these that will look to some of the points raised but Ms Rowland can talk more about that.  </p></speech>

There are no capital requirements in the regulatory framework.  That is not part of it.  We have developed and published regulatory requirements they must meet before they can get a full authorisation from the Central Bank.  These include fitness and probity of the individuals leading the organisations.  Very importantly from our point of view, they must demonstrate mind of management in this jurisdiction.  They must demonstrate a structure that we are capable of supervising.  It cannot be so complex that one cannot follow where decision making is happening and they must demonstrate the resources, governance and structures to be able to discharge the high standard of regulatory requirements we would expect of them.  As such, they must show us that they have a competent and well-developed compliance function that is embedded and have risk management frameworks in place.  There is a whole flotilla of regulatory frameworks they must demonstrate before they will get the authorisation.  They must show us that they can hit the ground running for the interaction and standards we expect when dealing with their customers.  We are conscious that many of these customers are in a vulnerable position and it is very important that the loan owners have the proper standards.  This is the close look at the regulatory framework in respect of the standards they must meet.</p></speech>

What is his view on the financial well-being of the mainstream banking system, that is, the pillar banks?  How does he see the Irish, European and world economies developing over the next short period?</p></speech>

This is a combination of the work the Central Bank and the individual banks have been doing and the fact that the world has looked to change rules and regulations to strengthen the financial system.  They are, therefore, in a better place.  On the other hand, it is absolutely the case that we need to build more resilience.  We were just talking about one particular issue.  Our banks are still holding greater levels of non-performing loans than many other banks internationally.  We want to build the buffers about which I spoke, namely, the counter-cyclical buffer about which I made an announcement yesterday, the other systemically important institution buffer and, in time, once the legislation is introduced and available, the systemic risk buffer.  We think all those buffers will be required to ensure that the banks have enough capital to be adequately capitalised and to be as resilient as possible.  We are in a much better place than we were but we need to do more to make sure that we are protected from future shocks.</p> <p>  In terms of the Irish, European and world economies, what I see over the next few years are risks - probably more risks than opportunities, if I can put it that way.  The Irish economy is operating at near full capacity.  We spoke about that yesterday.  The European economy is not operating at the level we would like it to operate.  The same applies to the world as a whole.  Ireland is operating better relatively speaking than the rest of Europe and the world.  We know that one of the reasons for the slowdown in global growth is the uncertainty created by the trade wars.  There is a big risk, which people have been talking about, that will start to manifest itself next week.  This is the gradual breakdown in the international rules-based order.  I am referring specifically to the fact that next week, the disputes resolution panel in the World Trade Organization will cease to be able to function because it will no longer have any judges to be able to make decisions.  This is a very unwelcome development.  Ireland and most countries in the world rely on a rules-based order to work so I see that as a big risk.  We are all hoping that the trade wars, particularly the one between China and the United States, are resolved.</p> <p>  The message I take from what is happening around the world is that we need to build resilience.  The important thing is that the world around us is changing all the time.  We are seeing it in demography, technology and in issues like climate change.  There are risks around.  From my perspective and that of the Central Bank, we need to look very carefully at managing that.</p></speech>

How would Mr. Makhlouf view an effort by the Government to ensure the Central Bank changed matters?

As I said, I have had lots of suggestions and advice on all sorts of issues and I am very happy to receive the widest set of views, comments and recommendations from people but, at the end of the day, we have to make our judgement based on delivering our mandate.

I want to hone in on interest rates.  We have a situation where mortgage interest rates for new customers are between 2.25% and 3% but for existing customers they are in the region of 4.5%.  We see all of the time that our mortgage interest rates, particularly for existing customers, are higher than anywhere else in Europe and they are certainly higher than what is needed to maintain the profitability of the banks.  What does the Central Bank intend to do about that and what scope does it have to try to address that problem?  That as being one of the greatest problems at the moment in respect of the affordability of mortgages.  I refer to the statistics in regard to mortgage holders aged over 60 who still owe more than &euro;150,000 and the 15,000 mortgage holders aged over 50 who are on interest-only mortgage rates.  The witnesses can see where the problem is in this regard.  In the context of the Central Bank's consumer protection role, what scope and intention does it have to address some of that?</p></speech>

I want to make a couple of points.  I have heard a number of people point out that mortgage rates are higher in Ireland than they are in Europe.  All I want to signal is a bit of caution that sometimes we are not comparing exactly like with like because the terms under which mortgages are provided in Europe can vary.  For example, in some countries borrowers need to pay up-front fees which may not exist here.  I would just signal a caution around that.  On the other hand, the reality is-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019120500002#J00700"><p>I was just going to address that question.  Mortgage rates in Ireland are higher than in some countries in the eurozone.  That reflects a number of factors.  It reflects the legacy of the crisis, the risk appetite of the banks and the different types of collateral and security arrangements that exist here compared to the ones that exist in Europe.  The issues of differential prices in mortgages, which the Senator mentioned, in our view, are different from the ones which we were talking about earlier in the insurance industry.  I will ask Mr. Sibley to comment on this.</p></speech>

Overall, with regard to mortgage interest rates in Ireland relative to the eurozone, as the Governor has touched on, lending in Ireland has been demonstrably riskier, from an average perspective - and we must be wary of averages - than in other parts of the eurozone.  Banks here have to hold more capital for the mortgage loans they are making than in most other jurisdictions, so that necessarily feeds through into pricing.  It is entirely understandable that mortgages are more expensive here than in the eurozone.</p></speech>

Four out of five mortgages that are in the system today were lent before the mortgage measures came into force, so the vast majority of mortgage books today were formed before those measures.  There are other issues within the Irish system that are not the same as other parts of the eurozone, for example, the use of insurance and how security works in other jurisdictions, and so on, so it is not just purely on loan to value and loan to income.  Clearly, there are improvements in the safety of mortgages.</p></speech>

I am trying to make sense of this in terms of being able to make proper comparisons.  Given the work the Central Bank has done with the banks since the crash on stability, and the growing profitability of these banks, should that not be reflected in the interest rates they charge their customers?</p></speech>

However, there is still a sizeable difference between what is happening in new lending rates and the eurozone average for the reasons I have outlined.  Some of the underlying issues are changing a little so the amount of capital that banks have to hold relative to loans is nudging down a little, and while it is relatively small at this stage, we expect that to continue to play out.  One of the things we have been very focused on for a number of years is how the mortgage market functions in terms of contract clarity and disclosures, and whether people understand what they are getting into.  I am thinking about some of the problems we have had in the market, including in respect of mortgage arrears and some of those issues related to switching and disclosure.  What we can see is that there has been some improvement in how the market is functioning but they are still pretty significant issues.  Overall, to come back to the Senator's first point, it is not inappropriate that mortgage rates in Ireland are higher than the eurozone average because of the underlying risk.  There is also-----</p></speech>

There is also a factor of competition.  Many other eurozone countries have a more competitive banking market, with more players in the market than is the case in Ireland.  What we can see, as some of those fundamentals have improved, is that the mortgage market is becoming more competitive in Ireland than it was two, three or four years ago.  There are positives in that we can see that mortgage rates for new loans are coming down and there is definitely more competition than there was two, three and four years ago, as the Senator will know.  However, to respond to her second point, there are also risks around that in that we are seeing differentiation for different products between the rates new borrowers are on for shortish-term fixed rate mortgages relative to existing customers who are typically on variable rate products.</p> <p>  That was one of the issues I was pointing out regarding the culture in banks.  We need to make sure they are not just doing what is legal but that they are also being consistent and trustworthy in how they are treating their customers over the long term.  I am not sure that is necessarily consistent with what they have been saying, so there is further work to be done in that area.</p><p>We have been pushing hard to improve and to make sure that people are aware as possible of the benefits that may accrue from switching from an old variable rate to a new product.  Clearly, a borrower has to decide that he or she wants to move from a variable rate to a fixed-rate product but thousands of people could make significant savings by switching.</p></speech>

At the same time, banks are making massive and ever-increasing profits.  It is very difficult for mortgage holders to understand why they are not feeling the benefits some of the banks which they bailed out are experiencing.  Is there scope for the Central Bank to do more to address the interest rates for existing mortgage holders?</p></speech>

Doing so may make the market somewhat more attractive to new entrants.  We will continue to reduce risks within the mortgage market itself.  I am wary of talking too much about bank profitability.  The net interest margin is higher in Ireland than the typical eurozone average but we still have a significantly higher cost-to-income ratio in Ireland than in many other jurisdictions.  In terms of cold hard cash, overall levels of profitability are significant but, from an investor profile perspective, they are less attractive.  That comes back to the Senator's earlier question about resilience.  We are very focused on addressing the fundamentals.  We see the functioning of the market improving but there is clearly still work to be done, including the work on culture I have mentioned.</p> <p>  The Senator touched on a couple of other issues with regard to older borrowers and interest-only borrowers.  They are subject to the same protections.  We have clearly articulated our expectations with regard to how lenders engage with borrowers on interest-only products.  We have very clear expectations and we will continue to push for sustainable solutions for those who are in arrears.  We see the problems there and we will continue to push on them.  Ms Rowland may wish to contribute on that point.</p></speech>

Right across our work, we seek to improve the context for consumers in the mortgage market.  Part of the work we did, based on consultations we undertook last year and the year before, was to bring really helpful information directly to the notice of customers so that they would have a very directional prompt to act.  We see that varying prices are being charged in the mortgage markets.  This occurs in many markets, not just those in financial services.  It is a feature of competition.  We can see that many customers could make savings for themselves if they were prompted to act so we strengthened the regulatory framework to ensure that people coming to the end of a fixed rate product are given more time and given information about cheaper products available to them from their own lenders.  That is a new strengthening of the framework which we hope will prompt people to move to cheaper products.  At least once a year, and whenever there is a change in a variable interest rate, information is sent directly to customers about cheaper products available to them.  That measure came into force at the beginning of 2019.  We hope to see dividends arising from that.  Even without switching between lenders, people can make savings by switching between products offered by their own lender.  We see that having an impact on the behaviour of lenders as well because they have to communicate this pricing to their customers directly.  We will be keeping a watch on that.</p> <p>  There is value on the table for people who take these steps.  We want to see them take these steps so that they can get cheaper prices.  Another part of that relates to people being able to get a cheaper product because the loan-to-value ratio changes.  We are demanding that lenders give customers that specific information.  All of those very directional prompts have been introduced to the system to help people make the changes open to them.  We have also strengthened measures related to switching.  We really want people to know this is possible and that there are significant savings to be made.  We have done a lot with regard to strengthening the regulatory framework.  We would like more people to utilise the switching process.  Mr. Sibley may be able to say something about the percentage savings that can be made.  These are things that have already been done this year.</p></speech>

I am glad to see that the Central Bank is taking its role seriously in this regard.  How is the effectiveness of the measures introduced to encourage switching measured?</p></speech>

One of them aims to examine the effect of information on customers with respect to switching.  It is a real study on the presentation of information.  We expect the results of this detailed piece of work next year.  We are also looking at the customer journey and mortgage experience from its inception.  That is real consumer work we are carrying out to determine the factors in people's mindset, the impacts on them, and their perceived barriers to the market.  It is very important that the effectiveness of the rules and the framework we have put in place is tested through these <i>in situ</i>methods to provide us with real feedback as to how best to help people take up the action points we want them to take up and to see if they are working.  Two very separate pieces of work are under way for next year.  We are also doing something in the area of insurance pricing, which I discussed at another hearing.  This aims to see what is happening with customers and will feed into the way we frame our work and inform any policy interventions we believe will be effective and how we might intervene.</p></speech>

It is not quite at the same level as before the crisis but it has increased from approximately 2% of mortgage drawdowns five or six years ago to approximately 12% in 2018.  I do not have the 2019 figures to hand.</p></speech>

We can try to find some information on that.  There are two different lenses through which to look at this.  One is the percentage of mortgage drawdowns, that is, how many people are drawing down mortgages and how many are switchers.  This percentage has increased significantly.  At its pre-crisis peak, it was in and around 19%.  There is also another way of looking at it which is to ask how many people could save by switching either product or provider.  Only a relatively small fraction of that number are doing so.  There are many opportunities for people to switch and save.  Tens of thousands of people could save money by moving product or provider.  I appreciate that it is not totally easy to do but it is perfectly possible.  We have had plenty of discussion on this topic in the past and a lot of discussion with Deputy Michael McGrath with regard to his Bill on mortgage rates.  We recognise that there are challenges here.  We are driving forward and trying to address the underlying fundamentals to make sure that the market will function better over the long term.  We see some improvements but there is clearly more to be done both.  We will continue to drive to improve the rate of switching but there is also the issue of culture and behaviour in some institutions.</p></speech>

I ask the Governor to continue to look at that in his new role and to see how it can be addressed to give a break to customers and mortgage holders.  I have several questions but one leads on from my earlier points.  With regard to those interest-only products and non-performing loans, I am concerned about the number of mortgages classed as non-performing loans that are sold on and then sold on again.</p><p>Apart from the criteria of the non-performing loans, does the Central Bank measure the journey of a loan in how many times loans are bundled and sold on from one vulture fund to another?</p></speech>

That is very much our focus.</p></speech>

Where there are changes in the market with regard to participants - there have been some and it may be that different service providers take over servicing different books - we have sight on who is in the market and their role at a certain level.

The funds get enormous discounts from the banks in the first place and the consumer is in the middle of all of this.  The loan is sold to one vulture fund that makes a certain amount and the loan is then sold on again and the new owner makes a certain amount.  Lots of money is being made on the back of the original mortgage holder.  On a macro-economic level I am also concerned about the impact this will have with regard to the loans being sold on.</p></speech>

I will start with questions on market-based finance, popularly referred to as shadow banking.  I welcome the Central Bank turning its attention to it.  Arguably this is late, but it is better than never.  I understand that Mr. Makhlouf is just commencing his work on this and that his answers might be provisional - or he might prefer to not answer - but I will ask the questions anyway.  In his opinion, what accounts for the very outsized nature of the sector in Ireland, which is reported as 13 times GDP and the fourth biggest shadow banking sector in the world?  Mr. Makhlouf may have read the paper by Professor Jim Stewart and Cillian Doyle that says a reason for the size of the shadow banking sector here is the nature of Ireland's corporate tax laws, which ensure the profits of special purpose entities are zero or close to zero.</p></speech>

The growth also reflects the fact that the banks are, in many ways, also recovering from the financial crisis.  The legacy of that is still playing out.  Other entrants are also entering the market.  Another reason for the growth is what we term "the search for yield".  In a low interest rate environment funds are looking for vehicles to identify new sources of yield.  Tax regime always plays a role, and not simply the tax regime in Ireland; it is also the tax regimes relative to each other.  It means the rate of tax but also the rules and compliance around those.  There is a whole series of factors that explain why the sector has grown.</p></speech>

The new entity is also called B&amp;N.  Shortly after the merger it had to have a massive bailout because MDM had significantly overstated its financial situation and had used the IFSC to do so.  Again, this is something that Professor Jim Stewart and Cillian Doyle have written about.  MDM had provided loans to off-balance sheet vehicles located in the IFSC, which then used the proceeds to purchase some of the bank stock of non-performing loans in order to improve the appearance of its balance sheet before the merger.  Is Mr. Makhlouf aware of that and does he believe it is an isolated case?  Is there at least the possibility of other financial entities, in Russia or elsewhere, using Ireland's shadow banking sector for such activities?</p></speech>

It is very important that we are clear that some of these entities are beyond the touch points of the Central Bank in terms of regulation.

It is something we look at but I do not want to be drawn specifically on particular matters.</p></speech>

We also play a very important part in the national framework.  We are part of the anti-money laundering, AML, steering committee chaired by the Department of Finance where we work with the national framework to participate in the national risk assessment in money laundering and where the integrity of the State's response to money laundering is solidified and comes together.  We work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Central Bank and all the relevant agencies.  The responsibilities at national level lie slightly elsewhere, but we are a contributor to the dialogue on making sure we play our part in contributing to a strong money laundering framework in this jurisdiction.</p><p>We have strengthened it significantly over time but every country needs to be very vigilant and needs to continue to make efforts at national level to co-ordinate well and to make sure we continue to strengthen the system.</p></speech>

We have seen that crystallise in some very large cases, including in some large banks.  I do not think it is limited to the banks themselves.  This is recognised at European level and there is a reasonably high degree of consensus at that level that something needs to be done to improve anti-money laundering throughout Europe from both regulation and supervision perspectives.  It is very important that this is thought about in an international way because of the nature of international monetary flows.  Earlier this week, I was at a meeting of the supervisory board of the ECB for banking union.  The Commissioner was there and we had a long discussion on money-laundering risk and the need for us not just to think about it in the banking system but to look at it throughout the financial services system.  There is absolutely a need for us to play our part locally and domestically, as Ms Rowland has outlined, and at European level to improve how the system works because there is undoubtedly a risk.</p></speech>

We have new things developing and regulations not keeping up with them.  Do the witnesses think there is a risk that shadow banking is one of those areas where regulations have not kept pace with the speed of the development of the sector in Ireland?  Is this something the Central Bank will be looking at?</p></speech>

Some of the work we will do will ask the question as to whether we need that type of system to be replicated in the non-bank sector.  More generally, it is the nature of regulation that it is always trying to catch up.  An enormous amount of work has been done throughout Europe and internationally that, in my view, has caught up but the industry is always developing and changing.  It is the challenge for all regulators everywhere to make sure they have the agility and ability to keep pace with developments.  Certainly within this Central Bank, I am keen that we keep up with those developments.  One of the reasons, as I said yesterday, we want to do this work on the non-bank sector is because I want to make sure we keep up.</p></speech>

There is now a public registry of beneficial ownership in Ireland.  It was set up some time this year.  However, I understand that only 12% of companies have registered who is their beneficial owner at this point in time.  Is this something that concerns the Central Bank?  Is it something on which action needs to be taken to ensure we know 100% where beneficial ownership resides?</p></speech>

The approach in Ireland is that the registration requirements are being set up in different entities and it will be of national level importance that the actual registrants comply with their obligation.  I am sure the relevant agencies will make sure that if there is a risk or if the standard required is not being adhered to, we will work together to make sure the registrants are brought up to standard.  For sure, it is a key way to address concerns about money laundering.</p></speech>

This is not the answer.  At the same time, there obviously is a huge problem in our housing sector.  If the answer is not to get the banks to throw money at people again, as we did before with the consequences we know, what is the answer to deal with the housing crisis?

If there were it would have been done.  It requires a range of things to be looked at.  Certainly from my experience elsewhere in the world, and from research we have done, some of which has been published, the issues that impact on the housing market and its effectiveness include planning regulations, incentives on the use of land, in particular taxation of land, the capacity of the industry to mobilise, the availability of underlying infrastructure to facilitate development, the productivity of the construction industry and the ability of the financial system to respond appropriately.  There is a range of issues, some of which depend on Government action and others absolutely depend on the private sector working well and having a competitive market that makes all of these things function properly.  I cannot tell the Deputy one thing that needs to happen.  I can tell him what I think are a number of things that should be looked at and thought carefully about.</p></speech>

All of these interact and interlock.  They are intertwined.  Describing one as being more important than another might lead people to come to the wrong conclusion.</p><p>However, everything we do is in the public interest.  The hierarchy of our responsibilities starts with delivering in the public interest and ends with delivering in the public interest.  That is sometimes reflected in the actions we take on consumer protection and sometimes it is reflected in the actions we take on prudential regulation but those actions are all centred on protecting the public interest.</p></speech>

It is important not to downplay the importance of monetary and financial stability, not to underplay our consumer protection role and not to underplay the fact that all these matters combine and have an impact on the wider economy, which, as I said in my opening statement, is represented by the wider community for me.</p></speech>

My view is the smaller the size of the country and economy, the stronger the case for coalescing those functions in a smaller number of entities.  Specifically in the case of Ireland and the Central Bank, my view is consumer protection is strengthened by bringing it alongside prudential regulation.  If one takes banks as an example, the leadership of a bank is responsible for maintaining the efficiency of the bank itself and making sure it is adequately capitalised etc.  That same leadership is responsible for setting the culture and behaviour in its interactions with its customers and with consumers in general.  The same leadership looks at both components.  It makes sense, therefore, for the Central Bank, which deals with that leadership, to also have both of those functions together because it enables us to deal with one group of people because we understand the way they work on their prudential regulation and we understand the way they think about consumers.  It is probably better for consumers in Ireland that these matters are brought together but I completely accept there are different models around the world.  Whether those models work or not is a question the Deputy can ask the-----</p></speech>

I want to make something clear.  I do not see a conflict between financial stability and consumer protection.  The reason we look to ensure financial stability is to protect consumers.

Our job is to safeguard financial stability and the reason that is our job is because safeguarding financial stability is ultimately in the public interest and ultimately protects consumers.  I do not see a conflict in that.  As I said, the different regimes exist in other parts of the world.  The country I have just come from and worked in, namely, New Zealand, had a different organisation that was responsible for consumer protection.  The governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, who is my opposite number there, was also focused on consumer protection even though it was not in his mandate.  Yesterday, similarly to us, he made an announcement about the macroprudential framework in New Zealand.  I read his statement and he spoke about protecting consumers.  There is no conflict in this.  The leadership of the Central Bank, as represented by the four of us here, does not see a conflict.  We put consumer protection at the heart of everything we do, whether we are responsible for prudential regulation, as Mr. Sibley is, or whether we are directly responsible for consumer protection, as Ms Rowland is.</p></speech>

Most banks have addressed that, although not all banks have.  Some continue to charge existing customers higher interest rates.  There is the continuation, for example, of the practice of providing cashback incentives for new customers that are not available for an existing mortgage customer.  It is blatant discrimination and dual pricing.  The Central Bank is investigating this in the insurance sector but it is presiding over it in the mortgage market and I do not see any action being taken to deal with that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019120500002#N01700"><p>For me, the reason the mortgage sector is different to the insurance sector is the mortgage sector has greater transparency and a greater ability for customers to switch providers.  To specifically pick up on the issue of cashback and to park our ability to intervene in pricing, the most important matter is to make sure the terms on which cashback is offered are clear and transparent because consumers rarely get anything for free.  That is important for me.  On insurance, the reason we are doing a study on dual pricing is we want to understand that issue because it is less clear.  There is less transparency and less ability to switch so we want to understand exactly what is happening in the industry to satisfy ourselves the industry is in compliance with the code.  The challenge with mortgages that we discussed earlier with Senator Conway-Walsh is the question of how we can facilitate and encourage a greater take up of the option of switching mortgages because there are products and opportunities out there for people to take out cheaper mortgages.  That is the challenge.</p></speech>

Equally, the Central Bank tolerates certain banks charging their existing, loyal customers more than they charge a new customer.  One might say that is common in business, as it is in the case of electricity and other utility services, but it is the largest transaction that most people will ever enter into.  While one can blame the consumer's inertia, we have to regulate in the round for the public good.  Consumers are being exploited and taken advantage of.  It is not something that the Central Bank, as the regulator and the consumer protection watchdog in the current architecture, should preside over.  Do our guests wish to comment on that?  I have repeated this view time and again.</p></speech>

In short, I do not disagree with much of what he stated.  In respect of providing decent customer service and long-term sustainability for the business models and strategy of the banks, it is problematic that they rely on inertia to offer different products to new and existing customers.  Our view is that it is not against the regulations.  It is a question of whether the firms look beyond mere compliance with regulation and think about the longer-term engagement and relationship they have with their customers, whether they are consistent with what they say they aspire to and whether they are trustworthy.  We will continue to push them hard and seek to improve the fundamentals I spoke about earlier.  There is differential pricing in many markets, as the Deputy described, including the mortgage market and other jurisdictions with other regulatory arrangements.</p></speech>

Is there ongoing engagement between the Central Bank and the SSM on the detail of the regulations and on whether they are proportional?  The amount of capital that must be put aside for a mortgage issued today has been heavily influenced by what happened ten years ago, when there were not macroprudential rules and much more risky lending was happening in the market.  It seems current home buyers and mortgage holders pay the price for that to a large extent.</p> <p>  To what degree will that eventually wash its way through the system?  Our guests mentioned earlier that it is slowly coming through the system.  The issue is an important influencer of mortgage pricing, although it is not widely understood because it is technical in nature.  How quickly will it wash through?  What engagement has the Central Bank with the SSM to ensure that the amount of capital that has to be put aside now is commensurate with the risk of mortgages currently being written?</p></speech>

Central Bank staff are involved in, or have led, the reviews in the Irish banks and elsewhere.  I am entirely comfortable that the approach taken throughout Europe is consistent, and much more so than it was before the creation of the SSM.  Although it is small, in decimal points in overall percentages, the modelled risk weights have started to tick down a little, as the risk profile of the mortgage books has improved.  Fundamentally, it is driven by loss given default and the probability of default.  There is an historical element to that.  It is clear there have been significant historical losses and that arrears remain in the system.  There is still a higher probability of default for performing mortgages in the system in Ireland today than there is from a eurozone average perspective.  Tangibly and concretely, mortgage lending in Ireland is riskier than in most other European jurisdictions, which is reflected in the risk weights.  Nevertheless, as I stated, we will continue examining what is within our gift to address and improve the fundamentals.</p></speech>

There have been a number of outages or glitches in bank systems in recent months, and they have happened frequently in recent years.  It causes severe disruption to the system and to individual consumers, and there can be reputational damage to the banks and the system.  It can also have an economic impact, depending on how long it lasts.  Do the banks invest enough money in their systems and technology to prevent such scenarios from recurring?</p></speech>

Operational resilience, including in ICT, continues to increase in importance.  It is probably the area I worry about most because of its nature.  It can happen quickly and, suddenly, there can be problems with the payment system, as happened recently.  We focus on it in a number of ways.  From a consumer-user perspective, we ensure that anybody involved in the payment system, not least the banks, will work on resilience and invest in and address problems where they exist.  Problems are inevitable-----</p></speech>

We then ensure that the root causes will be addressed.  The banks have had to catch up because there was a period of underinvestment.  A great deal of money is being spent, especially by the larger banks, on ICT, partly to improve their infrastructure but also to improve functionality and meet their customers' expectations in that regard.  On whether it is enough, we examine the wider European system and how much of their revenue base banks spend on ICT, and the Irish banks are approximately in the middle of the pack, although that might be not enough to catch up.</p> <p>  We are heavily focused on the issue and undertake numerous inspections as part of our ongoing engagement with firms.  We have an auditor-assurance power, which we have used to give us assurance in the area, and have brought in skilled persons.  We have done an enormous amount of work, representative of the risk, and will continue to do more because it is a growing issue.</p></speech>

What is the work out from them, that is, the end product and sanctions?  Such firms can cause great harm to the consumer if they are not regulated or do not conduct their business properly.  I have struggled to learn, either through the Courts Service or the Central Bank, the outcome of these warnings.  Are the firms shut down?  What sanctions are issued and what powers has the Central Bank to issue them against such firms?</p></speech>

The growth of the Internet has made websites that, in effect, scam customers more prevalent.  There has been an increase in reports to us of websites that can clone or nearly clone the identity of regulated firms, and we have a duty to take action against what we call unauthorised providers.  We call it our work on policing the perimeter.</p><p>These are firms that are pretending to be authorised when they are not.

The normal course of action is to warn consumers about the firms, publish the warning notices and require that the websites be taken down where we can act on them.  The other thing we do very effectively, and which we have done a lot this year, is work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are talking about fraud whereby people are asked to pay money for things that are not going to happen.  There is an uptake in advance-fee fraud whereby people are told that if, for example, they pay &euro;250 now, they will be pre-approved for a loan and get a loan of a much larger amount.  Where we see such activity, which is fraud, we report it.</p></speech>

We supported the Garda earlier this year in an action.  The Garda led out at national level.  It is the right agency to lead on fraud.  We have worked with, and supported, the Garda in that regard.  It has been talking about this area.  Members will have seen the Garda do a Black Friday scam-smart promotion to warn consumers about being scammed on the Internet.  We have done significant work with the Garda on the matters that fall within its remit and jurisdiction.</p> <p>  When we find that people are abusing the regulatory perimeter, we have the power to go to court in Ireland for an enforcement order if they do not obey our direction to cease and desist from what they are doing.  We have had cause to do that in the past.  There is a variety of big sticks.  The serious issue of pure fraud is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I refer to funds that specialise in mortgage-to-rent arrangements that would allow the current homeowner to stay in the home as a tenant as opposed to a mortgage holder.  What is the Central Bank's view on loans being sold to such funds as opposed to so-called vulture funds?</p> <p>  On vulture funds, as we call them, what handle does the Central Bank have on the suite of options available?  This was raised earlier by Senator Conway-Walsh.  Under the CCMA, there is a requirement to consider the forbearance measures offered, not the full suite.  For each fund that has bought these loans and is continuing to buy them, does the Central Bank have a list of the forbearance measures it considers?  I refer to Cerberus and Lone Star.  Do the officials know precisely what they are offering consumers by way of restructuring and forbearance options ?</p></speech>

We are neutral as to the nature of the funds as long as they are fit and proper.  All funds will have slightly different characteristics.  We are neutral on them in the detail of what they are offering.</p></speech>

For those who are willing and able to engage with the lender, there is not necessarily a path to curing their loans as they may be so deep under water.  Solutions such as mortgage-to-rent arrangements and the insolvency service are critical in that context.  To date, the take-up of mortgage-to-rent arrangements, relative to the initial aspirations and certainly in terms of the need, has been relatively low.  We would certainly welcome anything that would enhance the take-up and use of mortgage-to-rent arrangements in those circumstances.</p> <p>  On the options or offerings, we have details not only on the suite but also on the reality on the ground in terms of the treatments borrowers are on.  This was touched on earlier.  With a sale from a bank to a non-bank, or even from a non-bank to a non-bank, as the Senator touched on, the arrangements in place and agreed are being maintained for their lifetime.  We are also seeing that the firms, the non-banks, are trying to stabilise the situation somewhat, essentially with some short-term measures.  We want to see more in terms of sustainably looking for the path to cure and more use of options that would drive the curing of the underlying problem.  I pushed the banks on this.  More needs to be done on this area in both the banks and non-banks.</p></speech>

We have seen some data but they do not distinguish between arrangements that have been inherited by the funds, or entered into by the bank before the loan was sold.  I am most interested in what happens when those arrangements expire.  Is there any data on new arrangements entered into by the funds that own the loans?  If so, could that be shared with the committee?</p></speech>

I touched on this a little earlier.  There are a couple of instances where we were dissatisfied with the strategy that was being pursued or articulated, in that it was overly focused on sales and did not include continuing to try to work these things out within the banks.  An enormous amount of work has been done within the banking system by the banks, by borrowers, by us and by other entities, including this committee to try to ensure, as much as possible, that the mortgage arrears crisis is being addressed through keeping people in their homes.  There is a lot of work that has been done.</p></speech>

I refer to a loan portfolio that is being sold.  It was out there and has probably been sold by now.  In addition, 69% of the loans being offered were at an advanced stage of litigation.  In other words, the next step was court.  In terms of analysing a portfolio being sold, I will outline the actual figures.  In terms of borrowers of just under &euro;250,000, and I mean various levels of loans under that figure, there were 2,098 of them and these loans have gone for sale.  If one were to relate that to every bank because they are all doing the same thing, it would appear that the banks are stockpiling these loans to save money on their legal fees and leaving it to the vulture funds to do as they wish with that number of loans relative to homes.  I would take from that that the banks are not using their full suite of options to assist the borrower and have made a conscious decision to dump these loans on the market.  That would seem to be the case for all of the borrowers and that brings me back to the question asked by Deputy McGrath.  Due to the fact that the banks are so willing, and connive so much with their figures relative to bad debt, there is a need to prioritise the not-for-profits and encourage the banks to use them.  I mean that if the banks are conniving so much with the figures to at least give a not-for-profit the option to save some of these individuals and families and keep them in their own homes.  Definitely, from this portfolio, the figures in the banks are being manipulated.</p></speech>

As I have touched on, for those who are willing and able to engage we are and will continue to push for solutions to be there for them.  There is still a large number, and according to the half-year, 27,000 owner-occupier accounts that are greater than two years past due.  So there is still a large number of accounts in the system that are very significantly behind on payments.  Some of those will be engaged, some of those will be making some payments and some of them will not.  Just over half of those are with the banks currently and the rest are in the non-bank retail credit firms and credit servicing firms.</p> <p>  We will continue to push, regardless of who owns the loan and who the lender is, that those entities are continuing to strive to engage.  We would also encourage borrowers who are in distress to engage with the lender or use the supports that are available to them.</p> <p>  Some banks are selling loans that are in the legal process, and the legal process takes a long time in Ireland.  We are continuing to drive the banks to try to fix the things on their books as well as not being overly-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1691" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019120500002#Q02100"><p>We are going to have to face this.  They are not doing that.  The banks are pulling the wool over the eyes of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  This committee has asked the Central Bank about repossessions and the attitude of banks.  The evidence that is contained in the various loan portfolio sales proves that the banks must have obviously stockpiled the bad loans, not spent money on their legal fees, not offered the full suite of options and been willing to go to the sale and allow the vultures to deal with it.  I want to follow through on this matter.  I am quite annoyed by the Central Bank because I do not believe it has done half enough against the banks and it certainly is not doing enough against the vulture funds.  Let us say a loan goes to a vulture fund.  I cannot get in touch with a vulture fund on behalf of a client who might come to me for help; it is impossible to speak to one person and it is impossible to get them to focus on the actual loan that one is representing because they just do not care.</p><p>We are constantly told about the legal framework and whatever protection travels with the loan.  As I have stated on many occasions, the Central Bank should be on the other side of this.  I can name names, but they are all the same.  The Central Bank cannot deal with them because they do not have an interest.  Having said that, the Central Bank has all the information because it gets it from the relevant bank before it sells to a vulture fund.  The Central Bank is aware of a bank's activity in the context of what it offers its customers.  Where is its consumer protection hat in this regard?  When does the consumer protection aspect within the Central Bank kick in?  When does it tell the banks that, on the basis of the information it has, they do not seem to be doing enough for their customers?  When does it start protecting customers, families and individuals?</p></speech>

An enormous amount of work has been done to restructure loans within the banking system.  More than 100,000 loans have been restructured relative to the level currently in the system, although that is decreasing a little as they refinance.  There is a track record over a period of time regarding the approach we and the banks have taken to restructuring, as well as the hard decisions borrowers have made.</p> <p>  On the specific points the Chairman made about our engagement on sales, we engage very heavily with the banks when they consider selling.  We look at it both from a potential and a consumer protection perspective, in order to understand the risk to the consumer associated with the sale, the characteristics of the loans being sold, and what more could be done with them.  In many cases, the number of loans being sold has been reduced because of that interaction.  We continue to work with both banks and non-banks to make sure solutions are being put in place.  As I touched on earlier, we think more could be done, and needs to be done, by both the banks and non-banks to find longer-term sustainable solutions to address the underlying issues.  Borrowers also need to engage.  In cases where the hardship is severe and the loan is underwater, other solutions such as mortgage to rent must be considered.</p></speech>

Commentators, some of whom are poorly informed, claim they are easier to deal with than the banks and that they offer solutions.  Yet there is no evidence to suggest that vulture funds are nice and cuddly and will do deals with people.  They are a vicious financial set-up with nothing in mind except profitability and they do not give a tuppenny damn about the families or individuals concerned.  That is why Senator Conway-Walsh and Deputy Michael McGrath asked about proof that vultures are good for Ireland and for the consumer.</p></speech>

We want to ensure solutions are in place and that they are stabilising the situation while moving towards a path to a cure.  More needs to be done to solve the underlying problem, as I have said previously.  We are working on that and pushing lenders to do so as well.  Based on the information we have, there is no evidence that non-banks are more aggressive than banks from a repossession perspective.</p></speech>

That is our core expectation.  We expect proactive engagement and we want customers to get the message that if they are in arrears or at risk of it, the fundamental first step in addressing this very serious problem is actual engagement.  That is our message to lenders, loan owners, and families. The only hope for putting in place a sustainable alternative arrangement is through that effective dialogue.  That is a core focus for us, and as Mr. Sibley said, our priority is making sure that all that can be done will be done.  While significant progress has been made, this remains an important priority for us to pursue in both the banking and non-banking areas because it is very important for the families who find themselves in these positions.</p></speech>

There is an address at Victoria Buildings on Haddington Road in Dublin which over 150 vulture funds have registered as their address with the Companies Registration Office.  When one turns up to these vulture fund offices, one is meant to be able to access information on the shares register.  Some Members of these Houses visited this location at which these 155 vulture funds are registered.</p><p>To this day, they have not had sight of the shares register for the companies involved, even though it is meant to be available under company law.  How are they operating here with secretarial services and the same directors nominated here and there, yet there is nothing but a nameplate?  From a consumer or customer point of view, one will not get a meeting there.  One might meet them in the canteen, the local pub or in a hotel, but the point is that they are operating in this country and there is not much transparency in terms of what is happening.  I was shocked when Deputies Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and Nolan told me what was going on there.  I just do not think we have a handle on it.</p></speech>

There are in or around 90,000 owner-occupier loans where the lender is a retail credit firm or credit servicing firm, as at the half-year point this year.  They are serviced in a number of different ways, but potentially by a smaller number than the 35 firms that were mentioned there.  What Ms Rowland was describing is the work that we have done in terms of being on site where those loans are being serviced.  It relates to in the region of 70% of that 90,000 where they are being serviced.</p></speech>

The question I wish to ask relates to the information that came out yesterday concerning the mortgage lending rules.  By and large, I think they represent the right approach.  That is not everybody's understanding but it is important that they protect the resilience of consumers and of the system generally in terms of the need for society to have a functioning banking system that does not end up costing the State billions and billions, as it did on the previous occasion.  However, there is this trap where not everybody has access to funds for a deposit from what is now being called the bank of mum and dad, and people are finding it very difficult to get deposits together.  That is especially the case if individuals are not in a position to live at home because they are from the country and are working in Dublin, for example.  They are probably paying far more in rent per month than they would be paying in a mortgage for a similar property, but they are not able to get their 10% deposit.  Has the Central Bank explored any kind of mechanism that allows people to prove that they have been paying rent every month for however many years of &euro;2,500 per month in many parts of south Dublin, the area with which I am most familiar.  The mortgage repayment might be &euro;1,500.  Such people could be given some credit against that if the banks could see they are sensible people who have an earning capacity and an ability to pay their rent on time every month and they are able to satisfy a mortgage.  At the moment it is very difficult for people to build a deposit.  Ten per cent of a house in south Dublin is &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000.  For most people, that is an awful lot of money to try to build up while simultaneously paying rent.</p></speech>

As I said yesterday, we are very conscious that the rules impact on individuals and on families.  The issue relating to renters is one that has been raised with me by a number of people.  We did look at it, but we could not find a way that dealt with the precise issue Senator Horkan mentioned but also protected the integrity of what the rules are trying to do.  There are three interrelated things here.  Fundamentally, we are still dealing with a problem of housing supply.  Ultimately, until we fix that problem, I am not sure that tinkering with the rules will get us anywhere.</p> <p>  The second point is that it is worth remembering that apart from a two or three-year period in the run-up to the financial crisis, a 10% deposit was an expectation from all banks.  It is the biggest investment decision that people make.  The third point I would make is that banks do take into account an individual's track record in terms of paying their rent.  That is a factor that banks take into account in their decision.  However, in terms of the mortgage rules themselves, we could not find a way to relax the rules and keep the integrity of the rules.  That is ultimately where we ended up.</p> <p>  In terms of public banking models, I am not absolutely sure what Senator Conway-Walsh means when she refers to public banking.</p></speech>

I will send him a number of questions regarding the information he has on the minimum bid rate and how it was applied in terms of contracts in the banks.  I presume that he will have numbers on that type of contract, for example, how many were issued by each bank.  I will provide the detail.  I do not expect him to answer the question now.</p> <p>  I also wish to get a written response on two other matters.  I met with Jonathan Sugarman, as did Governor Lane, during his tenure at the Central Bank.  There are still outstanding questions in the context of how he was dealt with.  It is a bad reflection on the Central Bank that he was treated in the way he was.</p> <p>  The last issue concerns the EBS tied agents, which is something that will not go away.  I want to explore some questions with Mr. Makhlouf on that.  I will provide him with all of that information and then I might seek a meeting with him.  I was pleased to meet him this morning before this meeting.  We will visit the Central Bank and chat to him there.  That will give the other members of the committee who have not been there the opportunity to chat with him as well.  We want to see where he stores all the cash.</p></speech>

The proposed regulations are aimed at amending provisions in the principal Planning and Development Regulations 2001 concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Under the planning Acts, each House of the Oireachtas is required to approve draft planning regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by me, as Minister.  The consideration of the draft regulations by the committee here today is part of that approval process.</p> <p>  The draft regulations, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2019, relate to the provision of a number of exemptions for development works undertaken by the Office of Public Works, OPW, for the provision of infrastructural facilities at ports.  This involves the insertion of a dedicated new class of exempted development, namely, class 59, in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the principal regulations.  These proposed exemptions will permit the OPW to undertake works or have works undertaken on its behalf relating to the provision of necessary temporary or permanent port infrastructure.  The proposed exemptions are broadly similar to those provided for airports.  The exemptions proposed will essentially enable the OPW to undertake development, within a port, without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby helping to ensure the efficient delivery of essential services that may be required as a result of Brexit.  Such developments include the extension of a port operational building, subject to conditions and limitations, including a spatial limit of 500 sq m to an existing building; the provision of visual navigation aids; the extension of loading or unloading areas, or vehicle queuing or parking areas, subject to conditions and limitations; the provision of security fencing and gates, security cameras and signage, subject to conditions and limitations; the provision of directional, locational or warning signs; the provision of roads and related signage and ancillary safety barriers used for the movement of vehicles and equipment.</p> <p>  In particular, I point out that these draft regulations do not propose to provide blanket exemptions for development works by the OPW at ports.  The exemptions provided are subject to a number of conditions and limitations, including that the proposed development does not require an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment, AA.  Any works proposed by the OPW that are not specifically exempted by these exempted development regulations will still require planning permission in the normal course.</p> <p>  The regulations were proposed in the memorandum for Government on Brexit Requirements at Dublin and Rosslare Ports - Planning Related Legislative Issues, which was brought to the Government in February 2019.  The regulations would enable any future port related works covered by the proposed exemption to be carried out without the need for further emergency orders.  It is considered that the proposed exemptions for ports are reasonable and appropriate to the essential services that may be required as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>  I commend these draft regulations to the committee.  They are very important and, if required, I believe they have the potential to have a real and positive impact on Ireland's response to Brexit.  They will facilitate efficient delivery of customs, sanitary, phytosanitary and health checks and controls in Dublin and Rosslare ports arising from Brexit.  I look forward to what I know will be an engaging discussion with committee members.  I welcome Mr. Eamonn Kelly from the Department who is here to assist.  If the draft regulations are approved by positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, they will come into force as soon as they are signed by me, as Minister.  In that regard, it is my intention to sign the regulations into law at the earliest possible date.</p></speech>

As there are no members indicating, I will ask a few questions myself to clarify matters.  Do the regulations relate to Dublin and Rosslare ports only?  Who determines if an EIA or AA is required, and what is the process in that regard?  Do the powers in the draft regulations relate only to the OPW?  There are other ports around the country, some of which are controlled by local authorities.  I am not too sure which ones.  They also deal with imports and exports.  Is it the case that the powers outlined in the draft regulations will not be given to them and are purely for the two ports mentioned here today and confined to the OPW?</p></speech>

The decision on an EIA or AA is for the usual planning authorities and the normal process would be followed in that regard.  Naturally, we would encourage the OPW or whoever else to consult on these matters if queries arise.  Yes, the draft regulations are only for the two ports mentioned because the measure is Brexit related.</p><p>Many changes have been made at both of those ports over the past year.  They were ready in March but have been updated since.  This is only to come into effect if additional parking bays are required.  What will be needed will not become apparent until Brexit happens.  I do not know if members have had a chance to visit the ports yet.  I have visited myself and the works that have been carried out can be seen.  There is additional space and capacity.  The outcome of Brexit will affect the requirements for space or capacity.  Changes may need to be made quickly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1768" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019120500002#D01200"><p>I thank the Chair for having us here.  I welcome Ms Mary Hurley, Ms Ann Gill and Ms Rosemarie Tobin from my Department.  With the permission of the Chair, and if it is okay with everybody, my officials would be happy to engage in questions and answers along with myself.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair and members for the opportunity to appear again before the committee to give an update on the Traveller accommodation expert review report and the progress made towards considering and implementing the recommendations contained within.  This report has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Addressing the issue of Traveller accommodation is a priority for me, for the Government and for my Department.  I am very conscious that it is also a priority of members present.  We have had a great deal of conversation and ongoing discussion on this subject over the past 12 months as we awaited this report.  I thank members for their interest and efforts in this area.  I look forward to having a positive working relationship in the months ahead as we implement the recommendations.  I have had a chance to discuss these recommendations with some members.  Perhaps the Department will also be able to engage on the subject of the recommendations and the proposed changes over the next month or two as we formalise and finalise our decisions.  If members are happy to do so, we are happy to have these discussions in an informal setting in our Department as we finish our work.</p> <p>  The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides that local authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes in their areas.  My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p> <p>  The challenges encountered in the delivery of Traveller accommodation have been widely acknowledged by Traveller representatives, local authorities, Departments, the EU and the UN.  I am conscious that this committee has also done significant work in this area.  The completion of this review and the delivery of this report is a significant step in identifying the best ways to address these challenges.   </p> <p>   I express my sincere thanks to Mr. David Joyce, Professor Michelle Norris, and Dr. Conor Norton for their participation in the Traveller accommodation expert group and acknowledge the time, expertise and commitment they dedicated to the review.  I also thank them for delivering the subsequent report and recommendations and for their engagement with the committee and with the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, NTACC.  The group has done a lot of good work.  Mr. David Joyce has moved on and could not attend for some of the presentations but his work was invaluable, as was that of Professor Norris and Dr. Norton.</p> <p>  A dedicated capital budget is in place to fund the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing and halting sites for Traveller families.  The budget also provides funding for renovation and refurbishment work to improve the standard of existing accommodation.  The budget available for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2019 is &euro;13 million.  This will be increased to &euro;14.5 million for 2020.  My priority is to ensure that full use is made of the increasing level of funding available for investment in Traveller accommodation.  Although the increase for 2020 is not a lot in the context of what we need to spend over the coming years, it is still an additional &euro;1.5 million.  Until these recommendations are implemented and until we can prove that this money can be spent, it is difficult to argue for increased resources.  My officials and I are prepared and happy to source the extra money required when we can prove that we can make progress in this regard and start spending money in the many areas in which it is needed.  I hope members will understand that our aim is to achieve good planning and construction outcomes and to get resources drawn down and spent because there is a serious need for resources to be invested in Traveller-specific accommodation.</p> <p>  It is important to note that accommodation for Traveller households is provided across a range of housing options, including standard local authority housing, private housing assisted by local authority or voluntary bodies, and private rented accommodation, as well as Traveller-specific accommodation.  Travellers may express a preference across the range of accommodation types at any stage when applying for social housing supports through the social housing needs assessment process.  This process provides additional accommodation options to Traveller families to meet their culturally appropriate needs such as halting site bays and Traveller group housing.  There is little doubt that delivery on capital programmes in recent years has been disappointing and I am determined to address the reasons for this and implement those solutions on which we can agree. </p> <p>  The 32 recommendations made by the expert group to accelerate the delivery of Traveller accommodation are comprehensive and wide ranging and include proposals aimed at addressing research deficiencies, including in how information is gathered and used; removing any potential delays and obstacles in the planning system with regard to delivery; increasing resources and delivery capacity; and strengthening governance arrangements.  In the context of the 32 recommendations, my Department is now liaising with key stakeholders on issues arising.  Both Ms Gill and Ms Tobin have been quite busy over recent months trying to engage with all the different stakeholders and staff in different sections of our own Department to try to get a sense of everyone's position so that we can build consensus on these recommendations and move them on as quickly as we possibly can.  </p> <p>  It should be noted that the expert group&rsquo;s report has also been shared with the NTACC and members of the committee are considering the report.  Members of the NTACC have provided submissions to my Department, which are also being considered.  Some of these are preliminary submissions.  All further submissions from the NTACC and other interested parties including other Departments will be considered.  We have asked that such submissions be made quite quickly.  We do not need to wait too long.  Groups have given their initial thoughts but we have asked them to go a little bit deeper.  I am prepared to meet them if we need to tease through different bits and pieces in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>  My Department has been able to progress a small number of short-term recommendations.  For example, a review has been concluded of the arrangements for disbursing funding for the provision and refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation and a new process is proposed which we aim to have in place by the start of next year.  This comes under capacity recommendation 2.  However, due to the number of stakeholders, the input required and the wide-ranging impacts of most of the recommendations in the report, my Department will set up a programme of projects to progress agreed recommendations.</p><p>In order to determine how each item will be progressed, we have adopted the following phased approach to the implementation, starting with phase 1, the information gathering phase.  My Department is currently in this phase and, as stated, Ms Gill and Ms Tobin have done a fair bit of work on this.  Stakeholders have been given the opportunity to provide their comments on the report and input has been requested from other Departments.  So far, submissions have been received from: the County and City Management Association, CCMA; the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG; CENA, which is the Traveller approved housing body, AHB; Wexford County Council and; the Department of Justice and Equality.  There is ongoing engagement with the planning team in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as well.  There is a mix of views there so we hope to bring that to conclusion in the weeks ahead.  A brief joint submission was also received from the three Traveller organisations represented on the NTACC, namely; the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM; Pavee Point and; the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum. NTWFM.  These groups have indicated they will provide a more detailed joint submission shortly.  Ms Gill said that has been requested for as soon as possible.  The recommendations have been subdivided to allow my Department to form subject matter expert groups and to group by actions required.  These working groups have been set up to carefully consider all submissions and determine how best to progress the recommendations.  For example, a number of recommendations involve the review and amendment of the social housing needs assessment and I am conscious that matter was raised in this committee a few weeks ago.</p><p> Officials from the policy division and the Traveller accommodation support unit in the Department met to discuss this matter and will shortly be providing me with a submission on this and on how best to progress it.  Separately, groups have been set up to consider the planning recommendations.  The Department has grouped the first three planning recommendations together because they all involve changes to how a proposal for Traveller accommodation moves through the approval process or, in some cases, how such proposals have not moved through the approval process.  A separate group has been set up to look at aligning the Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, with the local area development plans and seeing how best to manage and work that.  As I said earlier, there are ongoing meetings with our planning team.  They met again yesterday to go through this.  I hope to sit down them as well next week to try to finalise some of their thoughts on this.  We have to take on their advice but naturally they will be working with us to implement these changes throughout the local authority system as well.</p><p>  Phase 2 is the pre-project phase.  The Department will shortly begin work on the pre-project phase which will enable the project to move forward to the implementation phase.  In this phase, a programme board will be set up and will have responsibility for agreeing which projects to take forward, the scope and timeframe of the projects and for overseeing the programme as the projects progress.  The aim here to have one person in charge of the programme to drive it on and ensure that progress is being made because it is important to have somebody who is accountable, to manage it on a day-to-day basis and to have a mini board feeding into that decision-making process to make sure all the areas are covered because there are a lot of recommendations here.  I will sit on the programme board, as will the NTACC and a senior official from my Department.  In this phase, a programme manager will also be assigned.  The programme manager will be responsible for centrally tracking the progress on all projects and reporting back to the programme board.  I probably was not fair to it in my references to it in the D&aacute;il.  It is like a mini action plan.  People might not always want to hear about more action plans but it is basically an effort to make sure we are tracking every decision we are making, that those decisions are not sitting on the shelf in some place but that we are implementing them and moving on.  It is important someone is in charge of that job on a permanent basis.  High-level project briefs will also be prepared in this phase, which my Department will then act on.  This goes to show we are taking this seriously and we are bringing all the information together, with a view to moving projects along.</p><p> Phase 3 is the project initiation phase.  Project teams will be formed, including the selection of project managers.  The project initiation documents, including the detailed project plans, will be completed.  This phase will take place early in 2020, hopefully January.  The committee can be assured this Government is committed to accelerating and increasing the delivery of much-needed Traveller accommodation and the funding is in place to support this delivery.  The recommendations in this report provide valuable guidance on how this may be achieved.</p><p> There are many recommendations in the report and I hope that we can work with the committee to agree on a consensus and bring them forward.  In some of the submissions that have come in, there are different views on the recommendations and it is part of my job to try to work with the different stakeholders to get agreement and to get around the main recommendations so we can move forward because all of us agree we have to change how we are doing our business in this area.  That is the aim of this report.  By having the implementation board in place, every action and requirement will be assigned to somebody, we will track it and follow it and we will be able to answer to the committee on an ongoing basis, if that is okay with members.  We will also keep other stakeholders who are interested updated.  I thank the Chairman for his initial comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1770" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019120500002#E00200"><p>The Minister of State is welcome.  I do not have any doubt about his personal determination with this issue but Traveller accommodation is probably the poorest relation when it comes to accommodation in general.  I know there is a regular debate on the issue of asylum seekers and direct provision centres and while there are many challenges there, the single biggest challenge this country has is to provide appropriate and proper accommodation to Travellers because over the years, Governments negated their responsibilities towards the Traveller community.  It was not just Governments; local authorities were allowed to abdicate their responsibilities as well.  To be frank about it, every local authority in this country has an appalling record when it comes to accommodating Travellers.  They have been let away with it by successive Governments and by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Government is starting from a low base but this is an emergency situation.</p> <p>  I welcome the recommendations of the committee and the plans to try to escalate the implementation of same.  It annoys me to see Government approving money for Traveller accommodation and local authorities not drawing it down year in, year out.  Some local authorities are better than others but by and large, local authorities do not draw down the money they have been allocated.  I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on his thoughts on this.  Some &euro;13 million was allocated this year for TAPs.  Of that, by the end of 2019, I contend that most local authorities will not have gone anywhere near drawing down what they have been allocated for Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  On CEOs of local authorities using emergency powers to provide accommodation for Travellers, how often have those powers been used?  I know of one example in County Clare where a CEO correctly used emergency powers for this in 2004.  I have not seen any example of that since.  Why are local authority CEOs not being pressurised by the Department to use the emergency powers under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 to provide the necessary accommodation under their Traveller accommodation programmes?  I find it astonishing.  It is an emergency and we do not have time.  Travellers are living in appalling conditions and they are becoming extraordinarily frustrated.  Children are growing up in diabolical conditions.  An increase of &euro;1.5 million is welcome but the Minister of State must be frustrated that local authorities not living up to their responsibilities in providing accommodation and drawing down the funding provided by Government year in, year out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1771" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019120500002#E00300"><p>I thank the Senator for his comments.  That clarifies why we are here and why this has to be done.  It is frustrating that money is not being spent.  We can all see where the failings are happening across the country and where accommodation is of a poor standard or where there is no Traveller-specific accommodation.  There have been plenty of ideas, plans and TAPs but they have not been followed through upon.  That is what we are trying to change.  We have raised this issue with all the local authorities at the various housing summits and I have even done so in my weekly meetings with them.  I try to encourage them to do what they are meant to do, to live up to their responsibilities and to ensure that the resources are spent.  We are still facing a situation this year where we will see resources go unspent.</p> <p>  The social housing task force has been set up in Galway as well.  Its job is to try to tackle some of the specific issues in Galway but there are other counties that also have urgent priorities.  Some local authorities have worked OK but the majority have not done so and they have not delivered for a combination of reasons.  When I go from site to site and meet the various stakeholders, be they the local authorities, the Traveller representative families or groups, I learn that it has not happened for a combination of reasons.  In any event, we need to move on from that, ensure that it happens in the future and deal with matters as best as we possibly can.  There are some cases where the housing delivery office will have a role in the short-term to try to drive the spend in these areas and to make sure the money that has been allocated will be spent in the short-term while we look at setting up some of the new areas.  We will ask the housing delivery office to do that as well.</p> <p>  The question of how to deal with some of the blockages is the key.  The Senator asked me if emergency powers have been used.  From what we can see, they have only been used three times in the past ten years.  The Senator mentioned Clare but the examples I have are that CEOs have used emergency powers, twice in the case of Limerick City and County Council and once in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p><p>The Part 8 process has been used just 24 times across 11 local authorities.  That speaks for itself.  It has been recommended that we should encourage CEOs to make greater use of their emergency powers.  It has been suggested that we should pressurise CEOs to do so.  It is natural that CEOs do not want to have to do this.  They would rather not do it because it goes against their own members.  There is no reason we cannot encourage it, but we cannot make anyone do it.  However, the use of this facility is nearly a failing in itself.  We need to find a better way to proceed.  That is what we are trying to do here.  I accept the Senator's point that this is one of the recommendations.  Ideally, we should find a way of dealing with this matter.  The committee has discussed it.  I will be happy to engage with the committee on the matter.</p><p> There are a couple of recommendations that we are discussing as we make plans.  We are trying to decide how best to do this.  Which way should we go?  We have asked for legal advice to help us to understand which of the recommendations we can use.  There have been some conversations about the desire within local authorities for them to keep their powers.  Local democracy means that all decisions should be made as locally as possible.  It has been recommended that we should make changes to cover cases in which that is not happening.  That is what we are considering.  We want to see which of these recommendations represents the best way to proceed.  Is there some sort of compromise?  Perhaps I should not use the word "compromise".  Should we consider some sort of use-it-or-lose-it approach?  If so, how best should that be done?  We have to make these decisions in the next couple of weeks.  We have to decide on the implementation of a new route.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister of State's frustration.  He is just one person.  I know that he can drive change when he wants to do so.  I accept that he wants to do so on this occasion.  I appeal to public representatives not to object to social housing.  There is a structure in place at local authority level.  If that structure does not work or people are not satisfied with it, they can appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  For good or bad, these structures are in place to facilitate the provision of social housing in this country.  When Members of the Oireachtas and county councillors object to social housing, it does not help anyone.  The concerns of residents can be articulated appropriately by making submissions and observations.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the role of the social housing agencies in providing accommodation to members of the Traveller community.  These bodies receive hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money and supports.  By and large, they do a good job.  They are necessary because the State has not done this job over the years.  I am a traditionalist and I am of the view that local authorities should be building tens of thousands of social houses.  We are not in that space, however.  The social housing agency model is being pursued at the moment.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the social housing agencies are living up to their responsibility to provide houses to members of the Traveller community?</p></speech>

It is a shame when there are objections to social housing, including Traveller-specific social housing projects.  In my view, this should not happen.  The objections of residents, regardless of whether they relate to an environmental issue or to social housing, are generally based on a perception of what might happen or a fear of a planning outcome.  We have a duty to deal with the perception that exists with regard to Traveller-specific accommodation.  I contend that the quality of initial design, of construction and of the management of these facilities is a key factor in this regard.  We need to get buy-in from communities and bring them on board with us.  There should not be any objections.  There is no need for them.  We need to deal in a positive way with the perception that has built up.  This might involve bringing on board local authority members whose views might differ from mine and those of the Senator.  If we can improve what we build in the first place and how we manage it, we will see that appropriate accommodation, which is built properly and includes all the services that are needed, is a key factor.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1780" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019120500002#F00900"><p>I acknowledge the work that has been done on this issue by the Minister of State and his officials.  We disagree with the Government in many respects and we criticise it when we feel the need to do so.  However, it has the full and enthusiastic support of Sinn F&eacute;in in this instance.  We fully support all 32 recommendations.  We do so with a degree of discomfort in some cases.  We cannot come up with a better way to address these issues than the way that has been recommended by the experts.  Even though some of the recommendations go against the grain of our general policy thrust - I am thinking in particular of the issues of planning and land disposal, to which I will come in a moment - we will give the Government our full support in this case.  In the absence of someone having a better set of proposals, these recommendations are all that are on the table.  I assure the Minister of State of our support in respect of them.</p> <p>  I would like to express a certain degree of frustration because two and a half years have passed since the Housing Agency published the Michelle Norris report.  This process has taken much longer than we all hoped.  It is important to get into implementation quickly.  While I respect the need for the Minister of State to listen to what people have to say about the best way to implement the report, I emphasise that we need to get on with implementing it.  Most of the key players in this area will accept that point.  Some previous Government action plans have not been that good.  If we have a good action plan with clear timelines in this case, that would be welcome.  This committee would like an opportunity to monitor such an action plan and to engage with the Minister of State and his officials on it on a regular basis.  That would enable us to ascertain how much progress is being made and to give the Minister of State any support we can.</p> <p>  Many Opposition Deputies and Senators are not members of this committee and have not participated in our lengthy debates on this issue.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about the need for him to engage directly with other Opposition parties to bring them through the dialogue we have had.  I urge him to provide for such engagement as a way of ensuring their decisions on this matter are made with as much information as possible.</p> <p>  I would like to mention something else about which I am deeply concerned.  As of October, 70% of this year's Traveller accommodation budget had not been spent.  Fourteen local authorities had spent nothing and four local authorities had requested nothing.  One of the local authorities in the latter category was D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which covers the area where the Carrickmines tragedy took place.  I cannot understand how any local authority, particularly a large local authority with a large Traveller community, can fail to request money or fail to spend money.  It is beyond belief.  I want to make a clear link between the failure of these local authorities to spend money and the growth in the number of Traveller families in unauthorised developments.  Over the three years between 2016 and 2018, there was a significant increase in such developments.  The Minister of State is familiar with this problem because we have discussed an illegal or unauthorised site in my local authority area.  These living arrangements are bad for Traveller families and their children and for neighbouring settled communities.  It is particularly bad to think that many of these cases are caused by local authorities sending back large sums of unspent money.  The general public needs to understand that the root cause of unauthorised encampments is the failure of local authorities to spend the money they are given.  It would be useful if people started putting pressure on local authorities to spend that money as a way of resolving this problem.</p> <p>  I have three specific questions about the matters at the heart of the report.  First, even though all of the recommendations are good, the things that will make or break this initiative are the interaction between the proposed changes to the Part 8 planning permissions and the section 183 land disposals, the strengthened role of the national Traveller accommodation committee and the ability of that committee to have recourse to the regulator to force managers to act if they do not use these changed powers.  The Minister of State can do everything else with all the data and all the governance - and that will be really helpful - but if the changes I have listed are not made, none of this will work and accommodation needs will not be addressed.  I would like to hear the thinking of the Minister of State and his officials on these issues.  At what point will the Minister of State be able to give us a timeline in this regard?  The closer we get to the election, the more difficult matters will become.  We need to move on that.</p> <p>  Second, the Minister of State has given us a great deal of detail about teams and all the rest of it.  Will a single dedicated person in the Department be overseeing this process?  If so, what level of seniority will that official have?  That will be a key aspect of this work.  As Ms Hurley very well knows, when someone is being sent in to butt heads with a county or city manager, it makes a difference if he or she is a principal officer or is at another grade.  What level of seniority will this official have?  Will this be his or her only job?  Will he or she work on nothing but this for the initial period of implementation?  Such a person would be able to drive this process.  I accept that the Department is very busy with all of its other activities.</p><p>The third thing, which I have said to Ms Hurley before and referred to in some parliamentary questions, is that in addition to a quarterly report, the separate and very useful social housing construction pipeline report must include the Traveller new builds.  Too much money has been spent on the refurbishments and not enough on new accommodation.  The only way we can track that is if the social housing construction pipeline has a subsection in it every quarter that tells us what projects are in the pipeline and where they are at in the process.  I cannot recommend that enough.</p></speech>

I want to put on record and appreciate the support of Deputy &Oacute; Broin, as spokesperson, and of his party for our efforts here, and from many others on the committee.  I recognise that some of the recommendations do go against the grain of what many of us believe in respect of local decision-making and democracy.  That is why there is not a final answer on it today for the Deputy because we want to spend the next number of weeks with our own planners.  Apart from local authority elected members and their roles, local authority CEOs and so on, our own planning department has issues because the people there share the same belief as the Deputy about local decision-making when it comes to planning.  We have national, local and regional plans and it is about getting that balance right.</p> <p>  The Deputy is asking when.  I hope to be able to finalise our thinking on that in January.  There are to be a number of meetings with our planning teams and there are different views in there, just as there are different views in this committee.  It is a case of people being given the time to talk it through, work it out and come back with the changes in it and recommendations.</p> <p>  I said that we have asked the Attorney General for some legal advice on this also.  My own view and sense of this is that there has to some game changer here on the whole planning end of it.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  I would have to see, apart from recommendations, legally what powers we would have and what can be done.  I am of the belief that if we could try to work with local authorities to do this at as local a decision-making level as possible, that would be better, but that has been shown not to have worked so far.  Our thinking is some blend of one more year, or something like that, to put plans in place and a certain timeframe to implement them, and if it does not happen, then a different decision-making approach has to be taken.  Some committee members may have a view for or against that but we have to find some way.  This has to change.  There is no point in denying that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State might consider, rather than having a year lead-in, perhaps having an option whereby he introduces the changes immediately and some local authorities could have an early exit if they are able to demonstrate that they have a better record.  My worry is that if we give everybody another year-----</p></speech>

I meant to say at the start that I would be happy to engage with the committee much more over the next couple of weeks, if needs be.  We hope to bring forward the action plan.  It is a process that I totally believe in, having been involved in An Action Plan for Jobs and a housing plan, which the Deputy may have different views on.  I would say that they are working, but apart from that, they work from point of view of being able to track them and see who is doing what.  That is why the action plan approach will work for this too.  I will be happy to have the committee members involved in formalising and agreeing the final actions.  I believe it should be a cross-party action plan.  That will work better.  We will need the support of party members throughout the country to implement this and we may as well try to have people on board with us.  I will be happy to do that together over the next month or two to try to finalise it.  I was asked when it would be finalised.  I do not see why we cannot have everything finalised in January and get that finished as well.  That is the conversation in that regard.</p> <p>  Those planning conversations, exactly as the Deputy said, are the little bits we are trying to decide, as well as with the legal advice.  Some counties will lead off on this and some will not.  Whether we can have different powers for different scenarios in different counties is the kind of stuff we are going to tease out and look at as well.</p> <p>  On the question of the who, it will probably be Ms Gill here with me.  There will be one person in charge and one person only.  It will be that person's full job to do this, to implement this, and to feed back to the board.</p> <p>  Will that person have a particular grade?  I am not great on people's titles and positions to be honest.  It is fine if the person can do the job, regardless of what the title is.  The fact that Ms Hurley, who is the money woman, is here with me means that we are real about this.  The assistant secretary is here with me, as Minister of State, along with Ms Tobin and Ms Gill who have been working on this for the past couple of months.  This is serious and this will happen, and that is very clear in our Department.  It will not be left to one side or left unfunded.  It is going to happen.  It is just a question of getting it right.  Delaying anything is not in my nature.  As most people know, I asked that this report be published a long time ago.  It is there.  It was not done as quickly as I wanted it to be, but we have it and I will do it.  We are not going to sit back on it, but it will still take a little bit of time to bring everyone on board and to make the right decisions, together with arriving at the timeline of each recommendation.  That is where it is at.</p> <p>  I am conscious that there is discomfort for some members here in taking away powers or changing anyone's powers, but we may have to do that to try to get this moved on once and for all.</p> <p>  I agree with the tracking of Traveller accommodation new builds.  Refurbishment has to happen, and certainly with some of the ones I have seen, major refurbishment has to happen-----</p></speech>

We are happy to track that.</p> <p>  When it comes to this, and in general with housing issues, we are an open book as a Department and I am too as a Minister of State.  I think the Minister, Deputy Murphy, is as well.  We are not hiding anything.  It is put out fully on display.  We might not always like what it tells us but it is on display we are not going to hide it.  Likewise, when it comes to Traveller accommodation, we are not going to hide this.  It will be clear who is doing what and who is not.  The Deputy is right about that link, that where there is an underspend of resources or where there is not even a request for money, there are consequences.  That means that we have unauthorised accommodation.  That does not work for anybody, and that probably needs to be highlighted much more.  The Deputy is right.  It is not simply a case of doing nothing and hoping it does not affect anybody.  It absolutely does.  First of all, it affects the families themselves and their children, for a start, but then it also affects communities.  That is when we get these negative consequences, which is a whole chicken-and-egg situation.</p> <p>  Does Ms Tobin wish to come in on some bits of this?  I am rabbiting on a bit.</p></speech>

On the point that was made about an authority being in a make-or-break position and the monitoring and targeting piece of it, we recognise that that is an important piece but it is one that it is going to be difficult to get consensus on and will take some time to set up.  We are looking at what can be done in the very short term with the structures that we have now to make sure that we get immediate impact on delivery while we are teasing out the more difficult question about the authority.</p></speech>

I acknowledge David Joyce, Professor Michelle Norris and Conor Norton, but I really want to acknowledge the Minister of State because he has taken up this with great seriousness and sincerity.  We all see that and recognise it.  I also welcome the additional moneys being allocated to Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  In many ways, as a campaigner that is the box is ticked.  Once the extra money goes in, that is one's campaigning goal achieved.  With Traveller accommodation, of course, that is not the case.  It is really depressing and disgraceful that only 70% of the allocation for 2019 has been spent.  There is an enormous urgency because there is a homelessness crisis, as the Minister of State knows better than anyone else.  The fact is that the homelessness crisis affects Travellers more than any other single group.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said and the Minister of State agreed with it, there is an absolutely inevitable connection between unauthorised sites, unspent moneys and the growing homelessness crisis.</p> <p>  My first question for the Minister of State is whether he has accepted all of the 32 recommendations and if he will be implementing them all.  Is he dropping or changing any?  If so, which ones, and why?</p> <p>  I repeat the request for an indication of timelines, particularly how quickly we will get to phase 3, the project initiation.  Every day that passes, where there is a lack of progress, a lack of drawdown, and the housing crisis grows, is a misery for people.</p><p>Will all the submissions made in the information-gathering phase be shared with the Traveller representative organisations?  They would be of interest to them and it is important that they are shared.  Moreover, I hope that this information-gathering phase is not an opportunity for watering down, slowing down or rowing back in any way.  The 32 recommendations contained in the report are what we need.  There is consensus in respect of them and I would hate for us to row back on them in any way.</p><p> I have some questions about the governance recommendations.  What are the Minister of State's thoughts on strengthening the NTACC?  That was one clear recommendation.  As it stands, how will that committee interact with the programme board?  Will the board have an independent executive function?  How will the NTACC evolve into the national Traveller accommodation authority, a step which was clearly recommended in the governance section of the report?</p><p> I also want to ask about the legislation relating to trespass.  Will that be repealed, as recommended?  I refer also to the issues of unauthorised sites and evictions.  Will the current eviction procedures be reviewed and an appeal procedure included?  The issue of evictions came up in Geneva this week in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  I understand that there is no national data collection on evictions.  There is also no access to justice because there is no free legal aid for those facing evictions.</p><p> Will the caravan loan scheme be included in the arrangements for the disbursal of funding for the provision or refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation?  The Minister of State mentioned that in his opening statement.  What actions are being taken around the ethnic identifier?  Are any obstacles likely to emerge?  The old red herring of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is often used as a block, but that is not a reasonable interpretation of that measure.</p><p> Finally, have all Traveller accommodation plans been signed off?  Are there any outstanding Traveller accommodation plans?  The Minister of State is aware of the existence of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  That committee, of which I am Chair, has been looking at mental health, health and education and we are now looking at employment.  We will discuss accommodation in January.  I would like to invite the Minister of State to come before the committee.  It is not about duplicating the work of this committee.  However, all of those issues are relevant.  If someone is not living in decent surroundings or healthy conditions or lives in damp or cold surroundings, his or her children are more likely to be sick.  The life expectancy of Travellers is affected by their accommodation.  School attendance is also affected by accommodation, as is employment; someone's address affects their ability to get a job.  We will be looking at accommodation and it would be very positive if the Minister could attend that committee.  We will be extending an invitation.</p></speech>

If I miss any of her questions, she will remind me.  Scrutiny starts here.  I am happy to engage with the committee and we will do that as best we can.  We are certainly open to any suggestions or ideas.  That is what we have to do.  The Senator is right about the importance of housing.  That is why we take the housing first approach to helping rough sleepers.  That is a proven concept.  Housing should be attended to first and then other services can be attached.  The same logic will apply to anybody who is in a poor housing situation.</p> <p>  There were a couple of questions there.  The Senator asked me if the recommendations have actually been accepted.  We have accepted the recommendations and the general principles they are trying to achieve.  Each individual recommendation must still be finalised to determine how best to implement it.  We are open to tweaking them if need be.</p></speech>

The Traveller associations have asked for more time to come back with submissions and comments.  I want to be fair to everybody.  However, they have been accepted in principle.  As I detailed earlier, we have been determining how to implement some recommendations, which ones it is best to proceed with and how to approach the task.  It comes down to mechanisms, and tweaking them if need be, but we are not trying to avoid or drop any of them.  None of them will be dropped.  They are being worked on and considered.  I can go through each one if the Senator wishes.</p> <p>  We are in talks with the Department of Justice and Equality on the legislation relating to trespass.

The Senator asked when they will be introduced.  The plan is to implement our full plan from the first quarter of next year, starting in January.</p></speech>

I do not see why we could not share those of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I will try to meet each group and sit down with the Traveller organisations in the next couple of weeks.  They are all represented on the NTACC but I will try to meet with each group individually.  We have recommendations, but all the different players have different views.  We will talk to all of them and see how to bring people with us on this journey, because implementation will be easier if everyone is on board.</p> <p>  I will now turn to some of the specific questions.  The NTACC will be represented on the programme board.  The membership of the board will include me, as Minister of State, the programme manager of the NTACC and a third person Ms Tobin will mention.</p></speech>

I met the chairman two weeks ago to get his views on how we can do that.  He agrees that it will take time to adjust.  We have sought input from several stakeholders on the recommended structure, that is, the national Traveller accommodation authority.  We have asked Traveller organisations and local authorities for their views.  I have met the chairman.  There is not yet consensus on the best way to structure that to ensure that it works and is effective.  The concept is fine but the question is how best to do it without unnecessarily complicating or duplicating any processes.  The project team will explore that with all the players involved.  In the short-term, as Ms Tobin touched on, we will see what we can do to monitor and track delivery.  We will make some short-term changes as we form a long-term view.  That will be done in conjunction with the NTACC and its members.  The implementation phase will begin in January.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

There is no specific recommendation in the report in respect of the scheme, but it is something we have been working on and we have a proposal ready to go.  It is not linked to this.  We met with Ms Rose Wall from the Legal Aid Board.  The Senator has probably seen that body's report.  We have met with its representatives to agree on a way forward.  The Senator mentioned the red herring of the ethnic identifier and the GDPR.  We were working on this before the expert group report came out.  We are getting some GDPR-related pushback but we are looking for legal advice to deal with that.  We are working with other Departments.  The Departments of Justice and Equality, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Education and Skills have overcome some GDPR issues.</p></speech>

This was because of the recommendation to include an ethnic identifier in the social housing needs assessment.  The rule under the GDPR is that we can only ask a question if the answer is relevant to the service provided.  We wanted to ask the same question that is on the census, which is a general question.  It is not Traveller-specific; respondents can tick a box.  We were told that this was irrelevant for anybody except Travellers, so we had to ask a Traveller-specific question.  That in itself brings up other problems.  Another argument held that it was not relevant because there is already a box to tick for Traveller-specific accommodation.</p><p>We understand the reasons this is relevant so we are making those arguments and have sought advice.    </p></speech>

Most of my questions have been answered.</p> <p>  The biggest issue is the lack of emergency accommodation for Traveller families and no point of contact.  When one approaches a local authority one does not know who to contact.  I welcome the expert group's 32 recommendations.  Every local authority must provide somebody who can be contacted at any time.  I make that suggestion because I have found that over weekends or in the middle of the week people will meet various housing officers so the current system does not work.  Even though I deal with my own local authority I do not have a port of call.  I urge the Minister to appoint someone who will give information.  The biggest issue for Traveller families is the lack of information and, therefore, they do not know their entitlements.</p> <p>  Another area that has not been addressed is the refurbishment work or home improvement grants.  Traveller families do not know their entitlements so we must remedy that situation.  Unless we, as public representatives and Oireachtas Members, give information then it will not be given.  If we address these issues it would be a huge help to Traveller families.</p> <p>  I welcome the allocation of an extra &euro;1.5 million in budget 2020.  The Carlow local authority was one of the 31 local authorities that drew down funding.  What happens to the money that is not drawn down?  Let us say the &euro;14.5 million in budget 2020 is not drawn and the local authority does not get the funding.  What happens to the funding?  Will the Government use it for something else?  I strongly suggest that whatever money is allocated for Traveller accommodation is kept separate and not lost even though the local authorities do not draw it down.  The Department should consult the local authorities and ask them why they have not drawn down the moneys.  I understand that this is all about enforcement.  Perhaps we should have someone in every local authority to give information for a few years or as long as we have an emergency housing crisis.  I deal with the emergency housing crisis on a regular basis and would appreciate if the Minister addressed this matter.  The 32 recommendations are excellent.  Once they are enforced and all of the agencies work together, I firmly believe there will be a huge improvement.  Therefore, I give this initiative my full support.</p></speech>

We intend that there will be huge improvement.  At this stage we have plenty of reports, research and evidence.  All we must do is finish the report and implement it, which is what we will do.  I am quite confident with the support of all of the parties that we will see change.  Moneys should not be left unspent when there is a serious need in every country.  In fairness, Carlow probably overspent.</p></speech>

The money is not ring-fenced for the following year.  Sometimes approval for a project could carry on over a couple of years.  If we have committed to funding a project in Carlow then if it does not happen this year it will happen the following year.  The commitment would remain but the money would be spent.  Ms Hurley will spend the money this year on other housing projects because, naturally, we do not send any money back when it comes to housing budgets because we have a difficult situation.</p> <p>  Before 2015, some of the moneys that were ring-fenced for Traveller-specific accommodation would have been used to purchase suitable housing, if need be.  That did not happen in the last couple of years because it was not a successful approach.  Sometimes, there would be complications in terms of getting the house over the line and then, all of a sudden, the money would be sent back or there would be a change of plans, so we have stopped doing it.  In the last couple of months, we have encouraged local authorities to go out, due to an underspend, and source properties that would be suitable for families of a Traveller background or people living in emergency accommodation.  </p></speech>

We are doing that to spend the money.  It is not an ideal solution because the money is meant to be for Traveller-specific accommodation.  If the housing is appropriate and suits the needs of someone from a Traveller family on the list then we have asked local authorities to do that and for the moneys to be ring-fenced, and reported as that as well.</p> <p>  There should be a point of contact and I am surprised by what the Senator has said.  Most of the local authorities that I deal with have somebody available and they have a homeless app.</p></speech>

I understand that there are a few places to go such as the place finder service, the housing assistance payment unit, and all of the positions that we fund.  Over the past couple of years, an extra 800 staff has been allocated to local authorities to deal with housing.  Certainly, we will talk to the local authorities to make sure there is someone available.  I will be disappointed if there is not but I will check.</p> <p>  Naturally, communication is important.  It is not referenced in the recommendations but certainly improving the communication of information is an obvious measure.  People talk about having choice-based letting in some counties but the process does not suit many Traveller families.  We must ensure that the right channels of communication are available. </p></speech>

Some local authorities had a Traveller accommodation unit and the staff were specifically dedicated to dealing with Traveller accommodation difficulties.  Some of those local authorities have stood down the Traveller accommodation unit and integrated it into the housing directorate because they believed that social workers should provide support for Traveller accommodation applicants in the same way as other social housing applicants and that the allocations, maintenance and so on should all be integrated.  Does the Minister or his officials think that local authorities should revert to having Traveller-specific accommodation units within the housing section to drive Traveller-specific accommodation?</p></speech>

As for who does it or what way it is done locally, it is not our job to dictate to local authorities.  The local authorities will ask us for staff for certain teams, allocations and so on, and they need to manage that process.  Through this, we will fix the planning and delivery elements and tracking it to confirm that it happens.  On the question of who or which committee in the council, I am not going into that detail.

Back in 2008, the Traveller accommodation budget was in the region of &euro;40 million and it is nowhere close to that now.  To meet the level of need in terms of new units and refurbishment and new household formation, we are going to have to get back to a budget close to where we were in 2008.  If we cannot spend &euro;12 million or &euro;13 million and we need to increase the budget, that will be a challenge.  In all of that monitoring, there must be included some more robust way of tracking what has been spent, what the delays are and so on.  From everything I am hearing, that is part of the plan.  We must also identify where additional capacity is.  Going by the figures, a local authority could have a 100% spend but that is based on what it requested and it could request a fraction of what is required.  That is why those needs assessments are so important.  We could then see if the request was proportionate to the need.</p> <p>  I appreciate that there is work involved in getting any reform to Part 8, section 183 and the regulator right.  It is not as simple as saying we will implement the recommendation; I get that.  My worry is that it might take too long to get that in place.  Bar the few local authorities that have yet to approve the TAPs everyone else has done so.  One would like to think that this new regime will come in as early as possible in the lifetime of those programmes.  I am pretty clear on the Part 8 proposition, which is that we still have a formal Part 8 process, we still have public consultation and elected members are still consulted, but the final Part 8 decision is the manager's.  I am likewise clear on section 183.  If we have an AHB and the land has to transferred, it is a similar process.  I am a little bit more concerned about whether the regulator will have sufficient force on foot of a complaint from the NTACC or authority to intervene and to force or request that the Minister force a manager to act where he or she is not acting in line with the TAP.  That is the key.  Without telling us what the decision is, because I appreciate he is working through it, can the Minister of State give us more information about how that could work in practice, in terms of his understanding of the regulator as it is currently working?  Has he been discussing the matter with the regulator?  We do not want to make what are pretty difficult legislative changes, albeit for the right reasons, and then be scratching our heads in a year because although the regulator can take a complaint and make a report to a Minister, it cannot take further actions.  We were not fully cognisant of this when we were dealing with the planning regulator in legislation.  I would just like to tease that out a little.</p> <p>  To elaborate on the suggestion I was making, and I might come back to the Minister of State in writing, provision should be made for an early opt-out or exit as an incentive to local authorities.  Councillors lose the Part 8 and section 183 powers.  It is a three-year period but I suggest some mechanism for a local authority to apply to exit after year one under certain conditions or in certain ways, if it is able to convince the Department.  That is then tracked and if the local authority does not do it, it reverts.  That might be a way.  Deputy Casey and I had an exchange at the previous meeting and I completely understand where he is coming from but if we try to incentivise good behaviour without facilitating bad behaviour, we might end up with a compromise with which even those who are not yet over the line on this might be able to live, come the legislative changes.  I might think more about that and come back to the Minister of State with a formal note.</p></speech>

It is about how we can incentivise good behaviour.  On those conversations, that is what we are trying to tease out and the Deputy has just put it clearly as to why I am saying to him that it is not completed yet.  He understands that it will take a little bit more time.  Those conversations will involve our own planning team and the regulator but also we will look for legal advice to tease it out.  It is probably not appropriate for me to go through it all with the Deputy here but I am happy to discuss it with those interested in the Department when we are further on in the weeks ahead.  Our planning teams are looking at it as well to see how it can work  and how legally sound is it.  We have been talking to the regulator and will meet him to finalise everything.  Naturally, there is no point in implementing something if it cannot deliver a positive outcome.  That is the what we are at.  I will be straight with the Deputy.  It is not finalised.  He had some observations and some good thinking on it as well.  Others have as well.  I am happy to involve them in the next couple of weeks and months as we finalise it.</p> <p>  The Deputy is asking when that will be.  It is not a case of saying we will spend a year on this.  That is not what it is about.  We want to have all this completed in January if we can.  We are still waiting for the legal advice we need but we will get that clarity and then we can move on most of this quite quickly but they are the little nitty-gritty bits that have to be teased out.  To be fair to our planning team, there are different views there and I have to respect that, hear all their views and tease it through with them.  That is the kind of work we are doing.  Ms Tobin and Ms Gill have been doing the same as well.</p></speech>

The organisation outlines what it is going to do but it is not saying at what point over that five-year period it is going to do it.  That means stuff can be delayed for legitimate or illegitimate reasons.  As far as I understand it, there is no requirement under the current statutory framework for the TAPs to include a timeline for the delivery of that programme.  That might be something to think about if there is going to be amending legislation.  We could provide for a statutory addition to the new TAPs requiring local authorities to put in a timeline as an amendment to the TAP.  That would create a clear basis both for the NTACC and for the regulator.  The local authorities are going to say what they notionally are going to do each year in terms of the output of new units and refurbishments.  If we have that statutory timeframe - I am only thinking about this on the hoof - it would provide a tool whereby if the regulator is to make a recommendation to the Minister of intervention for failure to implement the plan, the Minister can say the local authority is in breach of the timeframe and in breach of its statutory obligations.  If there is no statutory timeframe attached to the TAP and the regulator is making a recommendation to the Minister, a local authority could turn around and say it is in the programme but it just has not got to it yet.  Small things like that would not be legally complicated but might be very useful in terms of assisting the functioning of the new planning arrangement.</p></speech>

Ms Hurley sits down with the local authorities, either in their offices or in ours, on a weekly or monthly basis and teases through their plans, their targets and their pipelines.  We look at whatever is left up to 2021, but we also ask where we are on this year's figures, so it is broken down.  The same approach will work quite well.

The local authorities are requesting this funding initially, and yet they are not drawing it down, so clearly there is some fault here.  I am willing to try anything, and I am not here to be a stumbling block in this process, but I got the feeling that the local authority members were being blamed for a lot of the delays.  A question I asked on the last day, which no one was able to answer, was on how many Part 8 processes have been voted down by local authority members.  I believe that equally part of the blame is with the administration of the local authorities, and the willingness to drive the Traveller accommodation process.  It does not all rely on the local authority members.</p> <p>  The process that is proposed to be put in place, whereby the Part 8 process goes through all the way and the chief executive makes the final decision for a trial period, is quite a good compromise and I would be fully supportive of that.  However, when I hear the Office of the Planning Regulator, and Deputy &Oacute; Broin has mentioned this, getting involved, I wonder whether we are just going to add more layers of bureaucracy to a process.  When we are engaging with the Office of the Planning Regulator, we are now talking about the officials of the local authorities not performing their function in processing Traveller accommodation needs or provisions through to the Part 8 process.  Why do we have to go to the Office of the Planning Regulator to get the staff of local authorities to do the jobs that they are employed to do?  I am concerned that all we are doing is adding a layer of bureaucracy.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has proposed putting it on a statute footing where there is a statutory timeframe within the Traveller accommodation programme.  Maybe that is a solution.  I am afraid that the Office of the Planning Regulator would be swamped and would not be able to deal with this.  Then one would have to wait for a report from the Office of the Planning Regulator and nothing would be progressed.</p> <p>  I am not trying to put an obstacle in the way.  Something has to happen, and it has to be radical.  However, I do not want us to add more layers of bureaucracy into what is already a bureaucratic process.  Equally, each local authority's officials have to take responsibility for their actions.  It is not just about the local authority members; it is  about the local authority officials as well.</p></speech>

The Office of the Planning Regulator has just been set up and is no longer one person.  There are 20-odd staff and there will be more.  In assembling the team, I would argue that he has taken away too many good people from my Department.  In any case, the regulator's job is to implement the national planning framework, to bring an independence to planning, and to track that all planning has been implemented - local, regional, and national planning.  The Vice Chairman is right that we do not want to overburden the regulator.  There is the independence element of it, but more so from a planning point of view.  I refer to the TAPs, the development plan, and the process there.  What we decided around that will dictate the regulator's role.  There has been engagement and toing and froing with the regulator.  I will update the committee on that in our meetings as well.  This is not intended to overburden the regulator.  The regulator's job is to be independent, certainly in respect of his planning function.  That means that the Minister of the day - it is me at the moment - cannot get carried away with themselves and local authority members have to make planning decisions.  We have had a lot of good workshops with the regulator and with local authority members, teasing through that new relationship and what all our roles are.  People understanding a lot more, and the local authority members are very keen to do it right.  It is about watching over all of us when it comes to planning and making sure we are doing our jobs.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman is right that we have to be careful we do not overburden the regulator with nitty-gritty detail or something else that he should not have to do.  It is not the regulator's job to track whether a county manager is doing his or her job when it comes to spending money on Traveller accommodation.  The regulator's jobs relates to the planning element.</p> <p>  On the targets, at the moment it involves a request for funding, and we try to match the request.  Disappointingly, it does not always happen.  I will come back to the reasons for that in a minute.  What we are doing now is more similar to the housing allocation process.  We are sitting down with local authorities to see what the needs and the demands are, to see whether we corresponding with them and to see what kind of funding is required over a couple of years to make that happen.  It is more of a conversation.  Ms Tobin is involved in that at the moment, even in respect of next year.  It is about moving away from that allocation process.</p> <p>  I have never gotten involved in the blame game, because I am not interested in it.  I have repeatedly stayed away from it.  There is plenty of research and evidence out there.  Everybody has responsibilities here but I want to move on to what we do to make sure it happens.  From what I can see, site by site, it simply got too complicated and people got bogged down with challenges and difficulties and things were not completed or finished.  Rather than coming back a week later, amending it and moving on, all of a sudden three or four years were gone.  There are sites which have been in need of refurbishment and work for 20 years, but it just never happened.  It got too difficult to sort out.  Even with all the stakeholders, it just did not happen for whatever reason.  That is putting it in very simple terms, and everybody has a role in that and everybody is responsible.  However, I am not going there because it is wrong to blame local authority members and that should not be the approach.  We need to change that and make sure that it happens.  If there are difficult sites and complications, we need to deal with them and not shy away from them.  We must move on.  It is a matter of rights and responsibilities for everybody here, and I keep stressing that.  However, we need to move it on as well.</p> <p>  Just because something is challenging does not mean we walk away from it.  I go back to what I said earlier that good quality design and good quality construction, with all the services and the bits and pieces that are needed, will certainly help and will make a big difference.  We should be high quality here and not what we had in the past.</p> <p>  There was one other question on Part 8.  We could find that 24 Part 8s were put through - I must get the figure on how many were refused - but to be honest with the committee, they are not getting to a Part 8 stage-----</p></speech>

One does not bring in a string of Part 8s that are going to fail, because it does not work for anybody and it is a waste of resources.  Generally, a lot of work is done before one gets to Part 8 stage but it seems it is not getting to that stage.  A record of Part 8s will not give us a true picture of what is going on.  The records for every county will show the demands and unmet demands and that it was we have to address through all the different mechanisms as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

Part of the difficulty - I want to emphasise the Minister of State's point - is that it is either at the informal discussions between managers and councillors, or at the area or municipal district, which managers, as the committee knows, use as a kind of filter before they go to formal process, that things are dying, for whatever reason.  That is the difficulty.</p> <p>  RT&Eacute; was looking to do a programme some time ago and asked this very question.  It had a researcher going around the country trying to track the number of stalled processes.  It is really difficult.  We all know how managers work on any Part 8s, no matter what they are for.  They talk to the local councillors first, they get a read of the political temperature and they try to sense whether something will progress or not.  Most of the time those things are not even minuted or recorded.  That is important.</p> <p>  To go back to the issue of the regulator, I do not care who perform the role - this is the really important thing - but there has to be a mechanism whereby if there are changes to the Part 8 and section 183 powers, and if a manager is not using those powers, there has to be statutory enforceability because somebody has to be able to intervene on foot of a complaint from the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee or this committee as it tracks this issue and require that something be done.</p><p>There has to be statutory enforceability because somebody has to be able to intervene on foot of a complaint from the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee or this committee as it tracks this issue and require that something be done.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Casey's point, if I understand it correctly, and the Minister and his officials will correct me if I am wrong, the difficulty is that we know the local authorities are not spending the money they have but nobody has the statutory authority to step in and force them to spend it.  That is the problem.  If the regulator is the right mechanism to do it, as has been recommended, that will be brilliant.  However, the Minister can also come back and say he has found a more efficient and effective way to do this, provided some entity is able to step in when a local authority does not deliver X number of units, as promised under its Traveller plan, within, say, the first 12 months and tell it how it must do so.  There should be proper consultation and members of the public and elected Members should have an opportunity to give their views, as is the case with any Part 8 development.  Deputy Casey is absolutely right.  In some instances, the issue is elected Members, while in others it is managers or someone else.  We have to make sure that whatever package of interventions we put together, it can address all of those elements.  That is not an impossible task, even in the short space of time available.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned county managers and officials, but there is also a need to have a genuine and realistic conversation about what can be achieved on each site.  There are many more people involved in this conversation.  As I said, when a site becomes too complicated or challenging because there is disagreement, the conversation is often parked and nothing happens.  Different people want different outcomes so it is probably a case of having evidence-based decision making on a site by site basis.  We have had the conversation about doing more prototypes and blueprints for good quality designs and what can be achieved on sites.  Having those decisions made in advance means no one must try to do the impossible because sometimes one ends up doing nothing in such cases.</p></speech>

There are multiple issues with regard to Travellers in Cork.  Welcome measures were included in the plan, which has not been approved, for example, with regard to Spring Lane where there are major issues for the people living on the site.  There is a kind of desire and an anxiousness to get the plan presented by the officials over the line.  Traveller organisations locally were very happy with the plan.  It is important that it is approved.  The clarification on timelines and the leeway of one month is helpful.  Cork City Council may be the only council that has not adopted a plan.  I do not know if that is the case, which is why I asked for clarification.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1917" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Duggan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019120500002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to appear today.</p> <p>  The scope section of the Department makes decisions or determinations on respect of a range of PRSI-related matters for which our deciding officers have a number of powers and functions under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended.  One of the determinations our deciding officers can make is on a person&rsquo;s employment status.  We can decide whether a worker, or former worker, is or was an employee or is or was self-employed.  From that decision flows the appropriate categorisation for PRSI purposes.  The most common is class A for an employee and class S for a self-employed person. </p> <p>  Cases that involve decisions on employment status may arise from requests from employers, employees, employer representative groups, employee representative groups, the Department's own social welfare inspectors, departmental officials working in central social welfare scheme areas, or even, on occasion, from the Revenue Commissioners.   </p> <p>  Of the cases scope section deals with each year, those involving the employment status of workers constitute a small proportion.  For example, of the 1,000 or so decisions made by the section so far this year, approximately 5% related to employment status. </p> <p>  When a request for a determination on employment status is received, the scope officials will do some checks to see if there are any prior, relevant records.  Then the relevant parties will be contacted.  The case is typically referred to one of the Department&rsquo;s social welfare inspectors in the relevant geographical region who will conduct further in-depth and, usually, in-person checks.  When the relevant factual information or evidence is returned, our deciding officers then make a determination based on the law. </p> <p>  In every case, the decision is an individual one and in every case, the decision may be appealed to the social welfare appeals office.  As the chief appeals officer may outline, there are further avenues of recourse after that.  I assure the committee that no individual worker who seeks a decision from scope section is turned away and that there are no group decision but only individual decisions.  Each case turns on its own facts and the law is applied without fear or favour to those facts. </p> <p>  Our deciding officers are guided by their own statutory powers and the case law that has evolved in the courts over many decades.  An important guide for them is the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals, which was originally developed in the early 2000s and has been amended since.  It is being updated again by an interdepartmental working group comprising our Department, the Revenue, and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The new guidance on determining employment status, as it will be called, does not create new law; it only reflects the up-to-date position as it has emerged in the courts and in legislation.  It sets out the key tests or factors that have been found by the courts to determine whether a person is employed or self-employed.  In this regard, the courts have found that the determination as to the appropriate insurability classification must be arrived at by looking at what a person does, the way in which it is done and the terms and conditions under which the person is engaged, be they written, verbal or implied.  It is also clear from the relevant case law that no one factor may be taken as determinative of either state.  A next-to-final draft of the updated guidance is ready to go to the social partners for their observations.  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, has highlighted how she intends to put this revised guidance on a statutory footing next year once it is completed.</p> <p>  We are acutely aware of the allegedly increasing prevalence of false self-employment in the economy.  However, the numbers relating to this are, frankly, not compelling.  Figures from the CSO show that the number of self-employed workers as a proportion of all workers in Ireland has remained largely stable for more than 20 years.  In fact, the most recent figures from the labour force survey show a slight drop in the number of self-employed persons, as well as a slight decrease in the number of self-employed people with no paid employees.  These self-employed people with no paid employees are the most obvious candidates for the false self-employment label.  However, we know this figure is not increasing, as some have suggested. </p> <p>  Nevertheless, regardless of these facts and figures, it is the case that concrete examples of false self-employment have been found and it does exist.  Additionally, in the view of the Department, it is a worthwhile and important enterprise to reduce the number of persons who are incorrectly or fraudulently categorised as being self-employed when they are, in fact, operating as employees.  The Department takes this very seriously.  As a consequence, we are engaged in an intensive nationwide inspection and compliance campaign to better understand the prevalence of this issue, to identify sectors where it may be a particular problem, and to tackle and reduce any instances of it.   </p> <p>  In that regard, we have first increased resources in the scope section.  Second, we have set up a new inspection unit called the employment status inspection unit, which is dedicated to inspecting employer PRSI and the classification of workers.  Third, our inspectors nationwide are conducting employer inspections at an increasing rate, some of which are done jointly with Revenue and the WRC.  Fourth, legislative provisions are being developed to encourage workers to apply to scope section for clarity about their employment status.  These are anti-victimisation measures that will allow workers to make a complaint to the WRC if they are victimised by employers because they sought a determination from scope section.  Fifth, the Minister is seeking to introduce a specific new criminal offence of the deliberate and knowing misclassification of a worker as being self-employed, which will carry appropriate penalties.</p><p>While it is unlikely to be possible ever to eradicate false self-employment, the Department is committed to minimising its potential and to detecting and dealing with it wherever it does occur.  This is critically important because it has a twofold benefit.  First, it reduces leakage on the Social Insurance Fund, which pays for a wide range of social protection schemes.  Second, it gives workers access to our robust employment rights legislation.  I hope the steps I have set out demonstrate the Department&rsquo;s determination in this regard.  Ms Dowling and I will endeavour to answer any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-05a.1920" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan Gordon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019120500002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to address them today.  By way of background, the appeals office was established in 1990, is headed by a chief appeals officer and has its own appeals officers who are independent in their decision-making.  The role of the office is to determine appeals against decisions of deciding officers.  The legislation governing the appeals process is contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and regulations made thereunder.<br/><br/>While the legislation provides that a decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive, a number of routes for review and revision including references and appeals to the courts are also provided for in the legislation.  All decisions of appeals officers and revised decisions of the chief appeals officer are subject to judicial review and the Ombudsman can examine complaints about everyday administrative activities carried out by the office.  The appeals process is quasi-judicial with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a <i>de novo</i>basis.  While the issues that are dealt with on appeal are based on the provisions of the 2005 Act and the regulations, the office is not a court but must observe the principles of natural justice and fair procedures.  Appeals may be disposed of by way of summary decision or by means of an oral hearing.  It is a matter for the appeals officer to decide if a case can properly be determined without an oral hearing.  Decisions of appeals officers are made on the facts pertaining to the individual case.  While the decisions do not create precedents, the office strives to achieve consistency in its decision making.<br/><br/>Turning to the specific issue of determining the status of a worker for social insurance purposes, section 300(2) of the 2005 Act gives statutory power to deciding officers of the Department to determine questions relating to the insurability of employment for social insurance purposes.  All such decisions can be appealed under the provisions of section 311 of the 2005 Act.  Appeals relating to employment status cover a range of issues including directors of companies, family employments, partnerships and public sector employments.  The number of cases involving the determination as to whether a person was employed under a contract of service or a contract for services is relatively small.  No legislative provision provides for appeals officers to make decisions on the employment status of groups or classes of workers who are engaged or operate on the same terms and conditions.  However, it is also the case that the legislation does not preclude such an approach.<br/><br/>I have occasionally, and usually where a number of workers engaged by the same employer are concerned and have individually submitted an appeal, been asked to make decisions on a sample number of cases.  I have agreed to this approach in limited circumstances and only with the agreement of both the employer and the workers concerned.  However, I emphasise that each worker is entitled to an individual decision on their appeal.  The approach can be an efficient way of dealing with issues that are common in appeal cases and where there are a number of workers attached to an appeal.  However, the approach cannot compromise the integrity of the appeal process or deny an interested party the opportunity of having any evidence particular to their appeal being considered by an appeals officer.  I can also advise that this approach has not been adopted during my time as chief appeals officer since 2015, in the case of an appeal where the classification of a worker as an employee or a self-employed person is the issue under appeal.  However, I am aware that an appeals officer proposed this approach in a case where a number of workers engaged by a specific employer was concerned.  The parties to that appeal were not happy to proceed on that basis and the appeals officer proceeded to determine the appeals in each individual case.<br/><br/>I have outlined that all appeals are determined on a case-by-case basis and on the particular facts of each appeal.  While appeal decisions do not themselves create precedents, the office endeavours to be consistent in its decision-making and strives to ensure that the same conclusion is reached in cases that are based on the same or similar factual circumstances.  In the case of appeals on the insurability of employment, consistency is achieved by applying the precedents emerging from the case law of the courts and by reference to the code of practice for determining employment and self-employment status of individuals.  The office does not categorise cases as &quot;bogus self-employment&quot; or &quot;false self-employment&quot; and the office is only concerned with determining if a worker is correctly classified as an employee or a self-employed person.  It is also the case that appeals officers cannot be concerned about the implications arising from their decisions, and the Supreme Court has said that appeals officers are required to be &quot;free and unrestricted in discharging their functions&quot;.<br/><br/>Where an appeal against the decision of a deciding officer on a worker's status is received, notification of that appeal and the grounds of appeal are provided to the other interested parties.  Those interested parties are invariably the worker, the company or companies that engaged the worker and the scope section of the Department.  All parties are afforded full opportunity to make submissions on the appeal contentions, and if an oral hearing is convened all parties are notified and requested to attend.  The appeal decision is issued to all these interested parties.  Any party to the appeal including the appellant, and in addition to recourse to the courts or the Ombudsman's office, can invoke the provisions of the 2005 Act providing for revision of the appeals officer&rsquo;s decision based on new facts or evidence and-or error of fact or law.<br/><br/>Turning to some statistics, the Department processes approximately 2 million new claims each year, with approximately 85% successful.  By comparison, 19,000 appeals had been made to the social welfare appeals office to the end of October this year.  The figure in 2018 for the full year was 18,854.  Of this number in 2019, 57 relate to appeals against decisions made by deciding officers in the scope section of the Department covering a range of issues - 26 of these 57 appeals relate specifically to the question of whether a person was employed under a contract of service or a contract for services.  A total of 41 appeals were determined by the office between 1 January 2018 and the end of October 2019 relating to the question of whether a person was employed under a contract of service or a contract for services.  Mr. Duff and I will be pleased to take any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

Mr. Duggan said the Department has engaged in an intensive nationwide inspection and compliance campaign and that it has this year increased resources in scope section and set up a new unit called the employment status inspection unit.  That is all positive and to be welcomed.  I would like him to give the committee an understanding of the numbers of people involved.  How many staff are assigned to either the new unit or the scope section?  How many cases have been determined this year compared to last year?  Since the Department has increased resources, what are we seeing?</p></speech>

The new employment status investigation unit, which did not exist at all at the beginning of the year, has four inspectors right now.  We are hoping to increase that to six before the end of the year.  I have management board approval to extend it to 12 and perhaps 15 if the demand warrant that over the next while.  There is quite a bit of work in setting it up because we need to train people in quite a complicated area of law.  It takes a while to get somebody from being assigned to being productive in a unit like that but we are working on that.  We are also leveraging the 350 social welfare inspectors who are deployed nationwide as part of this effort.  Quite a lot of training and refamiliarisation with this area of law has been done during the year.  More attention is being paid by social welfare inspectors on the ground to employer and PRSI inspections specifically.</p><p>It is fair to acknowledge that, over the course of the economic recession, social welfare inspection was concentrated on scheme-related issues rather than on this matter.  We are now trying to restore balance.  There were just over 2,000 employer investigations in 2018.  Up to the end of October of this year, 2,745 were completed.  Almost 1,000 others are under way.  A few more will probably be initiated between October and the end of December.  It will not quite be a doubling of the number of inspections but it will be close enough when we do the final figures after the end of the year.</p></speech>

We have dealt with 60 cases specifically related to individuals' employment status this year.  Of those 60 cases, 40 were determined to be employees and 20 to be self-employed, so there was a 2:1 split.  As the chief appeals officer has said, 26 of these cases have gone to appeal.  One of the features of this area of law is that decisions are often appealed, which is not the case in most other scheme areas of the Department.</p></speech>

Of those 60 cases, how many resulted from the Department's investigations and inspections and how many resulted from people contacting the scope section?</p></speech>

We get referrals from various sources, for example, Revenue, our inspectors, including our new inspectors, employers, employees and representative groups on both sides.  It is fairly evenly split.

The Department has increased resources and has been proactive.  We support and acknowledge that but we are trying to determine what it has yielded.

We would like to see where things are going following the establishment of the new unit, the allocation of additional staff to the scope section and so forth.  I fully understand that the new unit was only set up during the summer and that training takes time but we should track what has happened year on year.  It would give us a good idea of the situation.  I fully accept that this is the first year of the unit and that it will not have a full year of operations completed but we need to monitor outcomes.</p></speech>

With the permission of the Chair, I will ask a number of questions and engage in a dialogue.  That would be more productive.

Will the witnesses comment on the quantum and proportion of cases that are overturned and the balance of outcomes in the first instance?</p></speech>

That is the breakdown of 41 appeals brought.  In the period from January 2019 to October 2019, 19 decisions were determined by appeals officers.  Some 14 of these appeals were brought by companies and five by workers.  In 16 of these cases the deciding officer of the Department had determined that the employment status was class A.  I will use the terms "class A" and "class S" for ease of reference.  In three cases the decision was that the employment status was class S.  In all 14 cases appealed by companies, the deciding officer had determined that the employment status was class A.  The appeals officer determined that eight cases came under class A and six under class S.  In the five cases appealed by workers, the deciding officer determined that the employment status was class A in two cases and class S in three cases.  The appeals officer determined that class A applied in three cases and that class S applied in two cases.  In that latter example, the appeals officer had changed the two class A decisions to class S and the three class S decisions to class A.</p> <p>  In 2018, a total of 22 decisions were determined by appeals officers, of which 15 were appeals brought by companies and seven by workers.  In 18 of these cases the deciding officer had determined that the employment status was class A and in four cases the decision was that the employment status was class S.  In all 15 cases appealed by companies, the deciding officer determined that the employment status was class A.  The appeals officer determined class A in 11 cases and class S in four.  In the seven cases appealed by workers, the deciding officer determined that the employment status was class A in three cases and class S in four cases.  The appeals officer determined that class A applied in four cases and class S applied in three cases.  Therefore, the appeals officer changed one decision from class S to class A and upheld the deciding officers' decisions in the six other cases.</p> <p>  Whether these appeals are successful or unsuccessful depends on whether one takes the perspective of the company or the worker but over the period from 2018 to 2019, companies were successful in ten out of 29 appeals brought by them, which is approximately one third.  Workers were successful in six of the 12 appeals they brought in the same period.</p></speech>

It would be useful for comparative purposes.  Are there any particular economic categories and sectors in which the Department would find a high proportion of appeals?  Is there a particularly high proportion in construction or among couriers or IT workers or is it a mixed bag?</p></speech>

The sectors involved in appeals, which largely tend to be one-person appeals, include media, journalism, construction, IT consultancy, project management, lecturing, catering, research and development, bookkeeping, retail, driving, car repairs and maintenance, aviation, and tourism services.  That is not an exhaustive list.  Many of these cases are single-person appeals.  We do not have many appeals to which a number or workers are attached in any particular sector.  With regard to earlier years, we do not have appeal-specific files.  The file belongs to the Department and is returned once the appeal is determined.</p><p>It is quite difficult to obtain the data without having all the files returned to us and reading them again from scratch to see what was at issue.

We know that is a matter of contention for the Department.  The Department has consistently expressed the view that no such test cases or precedential cases exist.  Both Ms Gordon and Mr. Duggan have claimed that every case is considered on its merits, with no reference to a series of cases considered in 1995.  Instead, everything is considered on a <i>de novo</i>basis.  However, the Department also endeavours to be consistent in terms of the determinations it makes, as well as those decisions made in the appeals process.</p><p>Ms Gordon will be aware that evidence was presented to the then Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the late Jim Mitchell, in 2000 when the Comptroller and Auditor General was examining the phenomenon of false self-employment and the consequences for the Exchequer.  A senior official in the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs made a reference to test cases.  Ms Gordon is unequivocal that no such test cases or precedential cases exist for couriers.  That is at odds with what Mr. Martin McMahon, who has considerable experience on the front line of this sector, has told this committee.</p><p>I made the request that representatives from the Department appear before the committee today in order that we might look under the bonnet in respect of this issue and to understand how it works.  We need to address these issues.  A serious claim has been made and the Department appears to be challenging that.  I want to give Ms Gordon the opportunity to reflect on that and to put on record her perspective and that of the Department on this.  This is a view that has been out there for a considerable time.  It is a serious issue.  A view was expressed at a previous meeting that clearly the social welfare appeals office, under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, cannot make law.  I draw Ms Gordon&rsquo;s attention to the case involving John Grace Fried Chicken Ltd., which gave rise to the destruction of the then joint labour committee system.  The courts were clear that there is one lawmaking body in the Republic, namely, the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>An allegation has been made that, in essence, the social welfare appeals office is making law and using precedential cases to inform the consideration of cases are brought to its attention.  I want to give Ms Gordon the opportunity to address this a serious allegation.  It is important that she does so.  With the Chair's permission, I will ask Mr. Duggan some broad questions on the process.</p></speech>

The Senator will appreciate that I cannot speak about individual cases for reasons of confidentiality and data protection.  What I can say, however, is that our office does not use test cases.  In the particular case referred to, I was not even aware that this case existed and had to go to find it.  From the research I did for this meeting, it is my understanding that the precedential case referred to dates back to 1995 and an appeals officer&rsquo;s decision sometime in June of that year.  We do not use this or any other case for decisions.</p></speech>

I did not have this particular letter but I made it my business to find it.  It is the case that the then Secretary General of the Department, in correspondence with the then Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, in October 2000 referred to a number of representative test cases which were selected in 1993 and 1994 for investigation and formal decision.  I assume that was a decision by deciding officers and one or two made their way to the appeals process.  That process resulted in a decision by an appeals officer in June 1995.  The latter decided, I presume among other things, that a worker in a particular sector was self-employed if he or she provided his or her own vehicle and equipment, was responsible for expenses, including taxes, insurance and maintenance, while payment was made on the basis of rate per job.  The Secretary General at the time also outlined that the appeals officer's decision to establish the criteria was generally accepted to be the employment status of workers in that sector.  However, the Secretary General also referred to subsequent discussions with trade union representatives on the insurability of workers in that sector in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.  It is my understanding that the outcome of these discussions was the establishment of the employment status group which developed the code of practice for determining employment and self-employment which was drawn up in 2001.</p> <p>  That code was prepared, on a tripartite basis, by the group set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in response to concerns that some individuals were categorised as self-employed when the indicators were that employee status might be more appropriate.  The objective of the code was to eliminate misconceptions and provide clarity.  The code postdated the 1995 decision.  Our decisions in the appeals office on the insurability of workers are made by reference to the code and the abundance of legal principles emerging from the case law of the courts.  They are not made with reference to that test case or any other test case.  Obviously, we strive to be consistent.  However, consistency is achieved in this area by reference to using the code and principles emerging from the court.  What I have set out is my understanding.  I cannot obviously speak for the Department.  We do not use the secret precedential cases or this specific 1995 decision.</p></speech>

If a courier has a concern about their insurability and their employment status, they can take the case the normal way for determination.  If they are unsatisfied with that, they can appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This is treated on a <i>de novo</i>basis and the matters are considered on their own merits, as well as the application of case law and experience.  Is Ms Gordon categorically stating for the record that no precedential test cases are used to inform these decisions?</p></speech>

Should anybody in any sector appeal a decision, that decision is absolutely based on the facts of the relevant case.  Sometimes cases may be similar.  However, when one starts applying the principles and taking evidence, they can be different.  That is why it is important that each case is determined on the facts pertaining.  In this particular instance, all decisions are made by reference to the code and to the case law of the courts.</p></speech>

They were very helpfully produced in the report on social welfare, PRSI and tax implications.  That report was published in early 2018 if my memory serves me.  Mr. Duggan is on record as saying the figures around self-employment remain broadly similar over an extended period.  We all know those who are at risk and those who would attract our attention in terms of false self-employment status or miscategorisation of their status are those who are self-employed with no employees.  I absolutely understand that.  I understand and appreciate that the figures from the CSO are stable but I do not think there should ever be an acceptable number of people who are falsely self-employed.  By their actions and because they are encouraged or in some cases forced to be self-employed, there is a fraud being perpetrated against the State.  Workers are being deprived of the benefits they would otherwise be entitled to and they are also being deprived of their rights as workers.  Just because numbers appear to be stable does not mean that we do not act.  I am pleased that action is taking place but I will not be satisfied until we see some clear legislative action.  As the system has essentially acknowledged, the code of practice that is in place at the moment is not fit for purpose and has not kept pace with developments in recent years.  I do not believe the system will change or workers and the State will be protected until such time as we include in future legislation the updated statutory code.  I will be interested when the time is right to establish precisely what that wants to do.  I understand that the Minister may be interested in drawing some provisions from legislation I published myself which was unfortunately defeated on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  She may be introducing some elements of that into proposed legislation.  For the life of me I find it difficult to ascertain how with the best will in the world we can protect those who take cases to the scope section against victimisation from their employer.  It is very difficult to protect somebody who is self-employed from victimisation because they do not have the status of an employee.  I have had these discussions with people in the sector and would appreciate if Mr. Duggan could elaborate on precisely how the Department is going to do that.  My understanding is that when an individual takes a case to the scope section in terms of their insurability or determination of their status, the presumption is that they are self-employed until otherwise determined.  It is very difficult to protect somebody's interests or protect them against victimisation if they are not an employee from the perspective of the Department.  That would be an important feature of the process going forward.</p></speech>

I specifically referred to that in my opening statement by saying that regardless of what the figures are showing us, we are going after this.  It is important.  I am not sure I fully agree with the Senator that the code of practice is not fit for purpose.  We are updating it to make sure it is as modern and as up-to-date as possible in reflecting the case law that has emerged since it was last done in 2007, and to ensure that it incorporates significant advances that have been made through that case law in the intervening dozen or so years.  For instance, mutuality of obligation has become the critical determining factor as a result of that case law.  Consequently, the new guidance will reflect that largely.</p></speech>

When that new guidance is put on a statutory footing, it will be done on the basis that deciding officers will have to have regard to it.  It will be very clear to all employers and employees that when deciding officers in the scope section are examining cases that are referred to them, they will be doing it in the context of that guidance and consequently to ignore that guidance and what is specifically sets out would not be prudent.  The Senator is right that there is a difficulty about defining an employee when somebody is categorised as self-employed.  We are currently teasing through precisely how we will frame that anti-victimisation legislation with the Office of the Attorney General.  It will have to incorporate something around when an individual or a worker is engaged with the scope section in seeking a determination of their status.  That is still being worked out.  Once we have it worked out it will be obvious how we think we can address that specific issue.  It is not easy, I accept that, but we are definitively going to try to do that.</p></speech>

I would have a small disagreement with Senator Nash.  The Department has not actually been consistent because we do have that statement of 2000 from the Secretary General at the time.  I am interested to hear about the change in policy that Mr. Duggan is telling us came about in 2001.  The fact is that we have extensive correspondence from the then Secretary General in which it is very clear that they are using test cases.  He refers to them as test cases.  He sets in place three specific measures, namely, providing one's own vehicle and equipment, responsibility for all expenses, and payment made on the basis of rate per job plus mileage allowance.  It is a very specific group ruling.  Mr. Duggan is telling us that in 2001, a different approach came into place.  I am curious about what was done in terms of redressing the concerns of those who had been impacted.</p><p>Many of the cases and concerns we have been discussing go back into the 1990s.  While we were offered figures from 2018 and 2019, it would be very useful if we could get figures going back as far as possible.  This is not recently arising.  In 2018 and 2019 there was already considerable public scrutiny on the area.  We have in 2001 this change in policy where these new guidelines came in.  I would be interested in what happened in terms of redressing concerns around the inappropriate use of test cases in the years prior to that.  I am also seeing a kind of contradiction in the presentations.  We have had this very heartfelt reassurance that every case is looked at individually and so on but Ms Gordon also said:</p> <blockquote> 	There is no legislative provision which provides for appeals officers to make decisions on [...] groups or classes of workers who are engaged or operate on the same terms and conditions.  However, it is also the case that the legislation does not preclude such an approach. </blockquote> <p>My understanding is that the legislation does preclude such an approach.  We have the Denny case and other cases.  We have been hearing that every case is dealt with individually.  I am just curious about the contradiction within Ms Gordon's own presentation where she suggests the legislation would allow the office to look at the employment status of groups or classes of workers.  I note that she mentioned that during her time as chief appeals officer in 2015, the classification of a worker as an employee or self-employed has not been the approach adopted.  However, as I know and as Ms Gordon mentioned, an appeals officer proposed this approach.</p><p>Ms Gordon is referring to the 2016 case where a group case was proposed by an appeals officer.  It has quite recently been the practice.  I understand that in that case the employees objected.</p></speech>

We have had many references to case law and case precedent.  In 1992, we moved from a situation where someone appealing a scope section decision would take it to the courts whereas now it is appealed to the appeals office.  Does that deprive us of some good case law in this area?  It was an area where we were developing case law where people would be tested and suddenly it went to a somewhat more opaque process where decisions were located in the appeals office in the Department.</p></speech>

I cannot speak for the Department.  I have only gleaned these documents in the past two or three weeks.  I do not know what happened in 1993 and 1994 on the test cases.  It may have been done in consultation with trade union representatives but I cannot be certain about that as I was not there then.</p> <p>  From the letter that the Secretary General wrote to the Committee on Public Accounts, it seems that the outcome of the later discussions some time between 1995 and 2000 was the establishment of the employment status group under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, and that the product of that was the code.  It reflects the three very small factors that were highlighted.  If one reads the code it has more factors and indicators.  These would feature in the code in some way or another.  I am open to correction, but from what I can see, the change was the establishment of the group in 2001, which itself drew up the code on a tripartite basis.  It was originally drawn up in 2001 under PPF.  I cannot be any clearer than that as I do not know.</p> <p>  On groups, there is no specific provision in the legislation that says one cannot.  I would not propose it but I was asked, not in the area of contract law or contract for services, where there were some 40 workers involved.  It was the exact same issue.  The only issue that was to be determined on appeal was the same in all cases.  The approach was that is would be something of a waste of time to hear all 40 when it related to that issue.  I would only do that with the agreement of the workers and the companies concerned.  If, however, any person or worker said that they did not want their appeal to be done in that way and that he or she wanted his or her appeal to be done separately, he or she would certainly have the appeal determined individually.</p> <p>  The case that the Senator referred to was a 2016 case involving 16 workers.  When it is the exact same appeal contention across 20 or 30 people, it can be an efficient way of dealing with the issue.  I must stress, however, that each individual is entitled to an individual decision and can still invoke all the other provisions in the Act in terms of review under section 317 in light of new facts or evidence or review by me under section 318 in error of fact or law.  The other avenues of redress are not closed to the person.</p></speech>

The office was set up in 1990 and appeals officers were given statutory functions, although I cannot remember the Act.  Each person can still appeal an appeals officer's decision or the revised decision of the chief appeals officer to the High Court on a question of law.  Some of our cases have ended up in the High Court or the Supreme Court, for example, Denny, Barry and Neenan.  There is a plethora of case law.  However, I am not aware of ones where the scope unit decision went directly to the courts.</p></speech>

First I turn to Mr. Duggan and refer to the principles on which decisions are being made.  He mentioned the principle of mutual obligation.  There is a lot of clarity around how the scope unit makes decisions and there is transparency.  Mr. Duggan suggested the figures were not compelling but there was very interesting testimony from within the Department on why so few cases are being put forward.  The scope unit specifically noted that when it did an appeal, it would get eight queries a day with very few turning into cases because, it said, of fear of repercussions.  That is the reality identified in a presentation to this committee as one the scope unit's key findings.  I quote "evidence that people want anonymity and fear repercussions" as a key obstacle to this issue being tackled.  When we say it is not compelling, it is if we have workers in a climate of fear in Ireland who cannot take cases forward.</p> <p>  Mr. Duggan mentioned mutuality of obligation as something he was considering introducing.  In November 2018, however, more than a year ago, mutuality of obligation was already a principle on which the scope unit was making its decisions.  Is it the case that the appeals office is considering bringing in mutuality of obligation?  The suggestion seems to be that it might be in the new code, based on some new case law.</p></speech>

It is not that we are considering bringing it in, it is that mutuality of obligation has been determined by the courts to be the primary determining factor in employment status.  I said that we were updating that guidance to ensure that that is covered comprehensively.  In the previous version that was issued in 2007 it was not.  That does not mean that scope section and the appeals office have not been operating on the basis of the case law that has been handed down over the past decades.  They have.  Mutuality of obligation has been a feature for some considerable time in the determination of employment status by scope deciding officers and by appeals officers.  I was referring to an updating of the guidance to ensure that it was covered comprehensively.</p></speech>

Will that statutory basis also address the corporate structures such as, for example, the aviation industry?  We heard very strong testimony in the course of the hearings of this committee of the use of what were effectively false company structures to hide the fact of people being self-employed.  In correspondence, Revenue have also identified this as an area where legislative action would be required to address this.  At the moment, there is no capacity in any code for investigating any such company or corporate structures.  Is that something Mr. Duggan anticipates will be addressed at the time when a new code will be put on a statutory basis?</p></speech>

Such widespread practices are a huge loss to the State.</p> <p>  As an example of that, I want to correct Ms Gordon's suggestion that it was perhaps the unions who pushed for those test cases at the time.  We can definitely clarify.  It was part of the 2000 correspondence to the Committee of Public Accounts at that time where representatives of the couriers industry - not of one company but the industry - were in correspondence and engagement with Revenue, which has confirmed that.  It would certainly seem that this was an industry-led push for categorisation because they were engaged in the same process with Revenue.</p></speech>

At least one if not more made their way to the appeals system.   Subsequently, the employment status group was set up under the programme for prosperity and fairness where the development of the code probably overtook or superseded anything that had happened before that.  In reviewing those decisions, a person can request a review of an appeal officer's decision under section 317 of the Social Welfare Act in the light of new facts or evidence, or under section 318 a person can write to the chief appeals officer and ask for a review if the person considers that an error of fact or law has occurred.</p></speech>

There is something of a misunderstanding of test cases.  We do not use that phrase any more.  Essentially these were sample cases at the time when a particular sector was being looked at and efforts were made to try to streamline the process to get greater administrative efficiency in the making of decisions for people.  That does not change any of the things that we said about principles.  All decisions are individual.  Anybody at any time can seek a review or an appeal of such a decision, and can use the various mechanisms that the chief appeals officer has set out for that appeal, namely, sections 317 and 318.  They can subsequently move on to the courts, if they so wish.  There is no precedential value at all to the sample cases that were examined in the 1990s, in the sense that anyone look for their case to be dealt with individually.</p><p>What happened in 2001 was not a change of policy, because the policy was exactly what I have just said, all along.  What happened from 2001 on was that a greater rigour was put into how people would know about these things.  The working group's negotiations resulted ultimately in the first version of the code of practice, which subsequently was revised following further consideration in 2007 and is now being further revised, as we speak, because of developments in the case law since 2007.</p></speech>

Mr. Duggan has been consistent with the narrative previously but that is inconsistent.  The Secretary General said in October 2000 that some couriers consider that they are self-employed while others regard themselves as employees.  In order to resolve the matter, a number of representative test cases were selected in 1993 and 1994 for detailed investigation and a formal insurability decision under social welfare legislation.  The process resulted in the decision that a courier was self-employed if he provided his own vehicle and equipment, was responsible for all expenses, including tax and insurance, and payment was made based on a rate per hour.  That is clearly not individual decision-making; it is literally saying there are different kinds of cases and different opinions.  We want to resolve the fact of there being different opinions and different individual cases and here is how we have decided to resolve it through these test cases.  It is great to move on but let us not retrospectively recreate the process.</p></speech>

The particular circumstances of that person's working environment would be the consideration in conjunction with the guidance and the case law that has emerged.</p></speech>

They found that the determination as to the appropriate insurability classification must be arrived at by looking at what a person actually does, the way in which it is done and the terms and conditions under which the person is engaged, be they written, verbal or implied.  It is clear from the relevant case law that there is no one factor which may be taken as determinate of either a contract of or a contract for services, but I understand the neutrality of obligation test has been given precedence in some recent jurisprudence.  Reflecting the precedence from the court, the code of practice places an emphasis also on the need to look at the job as a whole, including the working conditions and the reality of the working relationship when considering the nature of the employment relationship.  The existing code states that the overriding test will always be whether the person performing the work does so as a person in business on their own account.</p> <p>  I was asked for five, but the four main tests for establishing the difference between a contract of service and a contract for services that have evolved from the case law of the courts can be summarised as being the following.  The first is the control test, that is, is the person under the control of another person who directs as to how, when and where the work is to be carried out?  The second is the integration test, that is, has the worker become part and parcel of the organisation?  The third is the test of mutuality of obligation, that is, is there a mutual obligation between the parties to provide and accept the work offered?  The fourth test is the test of economic reality.  This test in my view probably incorporates all of the above to establish whether the worker is in business on his or her own account.</p></speech>

There is a high degree of judgment in these cases.  The courts have seen in these cases, inevitably, there will be elements of contract of and contract for services.  Sometimes it can be finely balanced and there is a high degree of judgment to be made in determining whether it is contract of or a contract for services.  The same criteria-----</p></speech>

There is quite a high degree in terms of successful appeals in this area.  That is why I am surprised that it is exactly the same criteria.</p> <p>  I do not wish to ask for the individual sector but we have looked at two areas and Ms Gordon mentioned one of them.  I refer to aviation and the courier industry.  They are two areas in which there has been a sectoral concern.  Have there been determinations of persons being found to be employees through both the scope process and the appeals process in each of those industries?</p></speech>

I do not necessarily see all of the cases as we get 20,000 appeals registered each year, but I am not aware of any in recent years.  I hazard a guess that there are not any decisions in that sector.  There is one case ongoing in the aviation sector but it is not finalised.</p></speech>

It is on the role of the courts.  Does Ms Gordon see a key role for the courts?  One of the proposals that was put to the committee is that there may, potentially, be a better role for the courts.  What does Ms Gordon think of that as an alternative route?</p></speech>

There are routes within the current legislation where a person can appeal on a point of law to the High Court.  There is provision under section 306 whereby I can refer a question to the High Court but I have not found that to be necessary to use.  Above any other area, both deciding officers and appeals officers are so much guided by precedents that have come from the courts.  There is probably no other area in the social welfare code that has such an abundance of case law surrounding it, so it is probably not necessary to refer to the courts.  I would probably expect that the court would send a case back to me, as it has sometimes done, and say the case should be resubmitted to an appeals officer to make the decision.</p></speech>

We intend to progress that.  There are some small difficulties with it, as the Senator highlighted earlier, but we are seeking to address them.  That is definitively on the roadmap to progress that early in the new year.  We hope that will be immensely helpful for anyone who is in fear of making a request for a determination to the scope section.</p> <p>  We have also done some communications exercises in the past and we intend to repeat those.  We will specifically be highlighting that particular aspect and trying to give people assurance that they will be protected through these new legislative measures that we intend to bring in.  We hope the combination of the two of those will help people to feel more assured that they will be protected in the event that they seek a determination.</p></speech>

No, they are happy enough.  As an observation, I noticed that the original presentation to this committee was in November of last year.  It is interesting that the presentation today has moved forward more positively.  The Department has increased the staff of the scope section.  It has established a new unit and is talking about introducing legislation to protect people who take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission and so on.  It is a different presentation to the one we received a year ago and there have been positive steps forward.  It would be remiss of the committee not to acknowledge that.  There are issues which we have heard raised today but, in my view, very clear steps have been taken to improve this and to address a problem the Department sometimes was reluctant to address or of which it perhaps did not see the scale.  I know we might disagree on that but I acknowledge that the Department has taken positive steps.  I thank our witnesses, Ms Dowling, Mr. Duggan, Ms Gordon and Mr. Duff for their presentation and for the direct and forthright manner in which they answered questions.</p></speech>
