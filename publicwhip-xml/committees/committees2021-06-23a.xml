    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#A00200"><p>I thank members and the witnesses for participating in today's committee meeting in line with the exceptional circumstances and measures we must take with Covid-19.  Apart from me and the members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely.  All members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senators Garvey and Gavan.</p> <p>  Today, we will give consideration to facilitating the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  The committee will be assisted by representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  Members will recall that last week the committee considered a similar issue with representatives from Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, ISME, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.</p> <p>  From the County and City Management Association, I am pleased to welcome Ms AnnMarie Farrelly, chief executive of Fingal County Council and chair of the CCMA business, enterprise, innovation and urban-town economic renewal committee.  I also welcome Dr. Pat Daly, who I know well, chief executive of Limerick City and County Council; Ms Anna Marie Delaney, chief executive of Offaly County Council; Mr. Richard Shakespeare, assistant chief executive of Dublin City Council; and Mr. Padraic McElwee, chair of the local enterprise office, LEO, network and head of LEO from Clare County Council.</p> <p>  Before we proceed, I must outline some issues around parliamentary privilege.  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Evidence given by witnesses physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a witness's statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  To commence our consideration of the matter before us, I invite Ms Farrelly to make her opening remarks on behalf of the County and City Management Association.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms AnnMarie Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#A00300"><p>On behalf of the CCMA, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present on the role of local government in the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  I am the chief executive of Fingal County Council and chair of the CCMA business, enterprise, innovation and urban-town economic renewal committee.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Dr. Pat Daly, Ms Anna Marie Delaney, Mr. Richard Shakespeare and Mr. Padraic McElwee.</p> <p>  Local authorities provided a range of social and economic supports throughout the pandemic appropriate to the level of restriction in place for the economic sectors and across our communities.  The roll-out of supports was implemented with pace, agility and efficiency with the aim of maintaining as much business confidence as possible during this time of unprecedented economic and societal change.</p> <p>  The following supports are managed directly by local authorities: 107 urban regeneration and development projects approved to a value of &euro;1.6 billion; 164 rural regeneration development projects approved to a value of &euro;338 million; &euro;633 million paid to 108,000 businesses through the restart and restart plus grants in 2020; &euro;1.2 billion of rates waivers processed, with the waiver continuing for quarter 3; &euro;85 million in direct funding to local businesses, including &euro;38 million for online trading to 16,000 businesses; &euro;60 million in funding provided for the small business assistance scheme; more than 22,000 businesses supported with one-to-one mentoring through the local enterprise offices: and the participation of almost 110,000 people in upskilling training events organised by the local enterprise offices.  There are now 35,000 jobs in 7,500 LEO-supported client companies.  In excess of 20,000 outdoor dining spaces have been facilitated for the hospitality sector on the public realm.  This includes local authority provision of more than 1,000 parklets and caf&eacute;-style options for business.  More than 1,000 hospitality businesses have also benefited from in excess of &euro;4 million in outdoor dining grants so far.  Almost 3,000 new benches and public seats have been provided.  Greatly enhanced litter prevention and cleansing regimes are in place.</p> <p>  As has been demonstrated, local authorities play a key role in the democratic, social, economic and cultural development of local areas.  City and county councils across Ireland provide infrastructure, amenities and services designed to improve local areas as places to live, visit and invest.  From an economic perspective, local authorities play a critical role in putting in place initiatives to stimulate the local economy and to support business in creating employment.  Never has this role been more critical than in the past 16 months.  Local authorities work closely and in partnership with Departments and key State agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Arts Council, and on a local level with chambers of commerce and business representative bodies.  This collaborative and partnership approach has been essential to navigating the challenges faced by business due to the impact of Covid-19.</p> <p>  The community call was one such action-led programme to provide services to vulnerable individuals during the Covid-19 lockdown.  Co-ordination at local level by the local authorities was critical and the sector immediately responded to the call to mobilise community networks across the State over the space of a single weekend.  At a local level, local authorities established a local authority response forum, which co-ordinated the work of the community call.</p><p>This involved frequent engagement through the national oversight group which included CCMA representation in its membership. <br/><br/>The local enterprise offices play a key role and are an integral part of each local authority, supporting start-up businesses, entrepreneurs and in general assisting businesses to scale up, innovate and develop their market potential.  Local enterprise offices, LEOs, are recognised as a one-stop shop, providing enterprise advice, coaching, management development and expertise.  The financial supports available through the LEO network have proven to be a critical contributory factor in the success story of many of Ireland&rsquo;s high performing start-ups.  It has been widely recognised that in the face of unprecedented challenge, the LEOs managed to pivot and adapt quickly to assist businesses to endure the crisis of the pandemic. <br/><br/>In addition, local authorities play a pivotal role in supporting tourism and the development of destinations and attractions throughout the country.  Working in collaboration and partnership with the national tourism authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, tourism task forces have been established across the sector.  The tourism industry has been one of the most affected industries by the pandemic.  The impact on a national, regional and local level has decimated the industry.  However, throughout this time, local authorities have been active and responsive in ensuring tourism on a local, regional and national level will survive and build back stronger. <br/><br/>Local authorities have also been instrumental in the provision of enterprise hubs.  A national digital hub network<b></b>of 400<b></b>digital hubs is now established, providing 15,000 workspaces and 270 broadband connection points.  Wifi4EU schemes are also being rolled out nationally.  All of these services are integral to future remote workings strategies.  The Look for Local and staycation tourism campaigns had significant success in 2020.  Further campaigns for summer 2021 are under way.  More than 4,500 local companies have participated in the Look for Local campaign which covered every business sector throughout the country. <br/><br/>Local authorities continue to lead, deliver and finance city and town centre rejuvenation projects, economic activations and other direct business supports in line with the following Government initiatives: the urban regeneration and development fund; the rural regeneration development fund; the town and village renewal scheme 2021; the walking and cycling infrastructure programme; the rural active travel investment programme; the Creative Ireland programme; the reimagining outdoor spaces fund; the outdoor seating and accessories fund; the outdoor dining enhancement scheme; the local live performance scheme; the local authorities urban animation capital infrastructure scheme; the creative climate action fund; the enhanced litter prevention and cleaning programmes to support outdoor summer 2021; and the community enhancement programme.<br/><br/>The projects include large-scale urban regeneration investments and town centre public realm improvements and revitalisation projects.  Town and city recovery task forces have been established to work in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Licensed Vintners Association, Retail Excellence, chambers of commerce, local business improvement district, BID, companies and other relevant stakeholders.  Dublin, Cork and Limerick city councils, along with most other local authorities, have been very active in this regard and further information is provided in our submission.<br/><br/>The restrictions on travel and the reduction in the capacity of public transport accentuated the necessity to accelerate active travel initiatives in cities, towns and local areas throughout Ireland.  Local authorities implemented and continue to implement a series of measures to support walking and cycling.  Active travel measures being delivered by local authorities primarily involve the improvement and expansion of cycling and walking infrastructure.  These measures were supplemented by a suite of supports designed to enhance the safety, security and comfort of cyclists and pedestrians, such as the pedestrianisation of streets, installation of benches and parklets to accommodate rest, segregation of cycle lanes and roadways, provision of quiet spaces and installation of temporary and permanent toilets.<br/><br/>In addition to facilitating mobility, these active travel measures play an important role in supporting the physical and mental well-being of people through the pandemic.  These measures also helped foster a greater appreciation of the natural and built heritage of local areas, while connecting local communities.  The CCMA acknowledges the considerable support of the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority which have committed &euro;393 million investment for multi-annual active travel plans, with more anticipated.  The roll-out of this is supported by creation of 248 active travel posts.  Local authorities will play a key role in achieving the Government&rsquo;s objective of delivering 1,000 km of cycling and walking infrastructure by 2025.<br/><br/>Local government economic plans for the coming months will build on our efforts over the past 16 months.  In November 2020, a framework for development of local economic sustainability initiatives was developed by the local government sector.  The framework was centred on significant measures and activities that were under way across the sector to support businesses at this critical time.  Over the coming weeks and months, a robust suite of initiatives will underpin economic growth at local level and provide confidence for communities, as we move forward into a period of rebuilding.  Local authorities are committed to supporting and facilitating an agile and appropriate response to business and community needs, working collaboratively with business communities and representative groups throughout the country.  New regional enterprise plans are now being developed to encourage development of new and existing businesses and to increase employment in every region.  Local authorities are a key partner in this process. <br/><br/>The CCMA and the local government sector acknowledge the extensive and far-reaching support provided by Government during the pandemic crisis and on a continuing basis.  Local authorities have and will continue to respond to the needs of their local areas, assist business recovery and help get people back to work.</p></speech>

I invite the members to discuss this issue with the witnesses.  Members should raise their hands on the Teams function and, more importantly, when they have finished speaking, take their hands down.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#B00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning and the important information they have shared with us.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that Ms Farrelly from my area is here.  I thank her for being here and for all of the work she and her team have done throughout Covid-19.  I have written to her about this as well.  It has been outstanding.  Notwithstanding the challenges faced at every turn, the staff of Fingal County Council have been first-class in terms of the service provision, etc.  I would be grateful if Ms Farrelly would pass that on to the staff.</p> <p>  We cannot ignore the elephant in the room which is the recent issue raised by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, some members of local authorities and myself last night on the floor of the D&aacute;il, with regard to consumption of alcohol outdoors.  I do not believe any person in government, when he or she said we would have an outdoor summer, meant we would solely and only be consuming alcohol outdoors, but I also do not believe any person who said it could be ignorant of the fact consumption of alcohol will form part of the summer outdoors for some people.</p> <p>  I will be straight with Ms Farrelly.  It does not seem sufficient preparation was put in place.  I say that because last night, when I was on my feet in the D&aacute;il Chamber, the Minister of State read out a script on behalf of the Minister for Justice that was contradicted by a statement issued previously to the media.  The Minister for Justice has now indicated she will be drafting primary legislation to ensure people can stay within the confines of the rules and use the outdoor seating, whether that be for eating or consumption of alcohol.</p> <p>  That is regrettable.  It sends a poor message to businesses that are struggling.  Many of them in my area are counting the days until indoor dining reopens.  In the meantime, all they have is takeaway and outdoor dining and this has thrown a spanner in the works.  If you talk to local businesses, which I know Ms Farrelly does, they will tell you this is the last thing they need.  If you talk to the workers who are working in these local businesses, they will tell you that uncertainty over their employment is the last thing they need.</p> <p>  My questions are fairly simple.  Can Ms Farrelly say, with confidence, to those businesses that are operating outdoor seating for eating, drinking or both that they can continue?</p><p>Does she believe the primary legislation is necessary?  Can she detail what consultation took place because for my part, it does not seem like there was sufficient consultation?  If there had been, these issues would not have arisen.  What level of consultation was there with the Government in establishing what the legal position was locally?  That does not seem to have been done and it seems to be different from area to area.  It is really disappointing.</p><p> Can Ms Farrelly provide her views on the primary legislation and on the level of consultation?  If I were to have a pint next Friday in one of the many parklets provided by Fingal County Council outside one of the many lovely establishments in Skerries, where I live, would I be within the confines of the law?  Does she think the primary legislation is necessary or does she believe businesses can continue to trade?  Advising members of the Garda to use their discretion is not a good policy.  The Garda does not want to do that as it puts its members in a poor position.  Business owners and workers are concerned that it puts them in an unstable and precarious position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms AnnMarie Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#C00200"><p>I might ask some of my colleagues to supplement anything I say here.  I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her compliments with regard to the county of Fingal.  Great efforts have been made across the country in every local authority to make sure we could get ready for the congregation that has happened as a result of the lack of indoor space.  Much of what has happened in our counties is because of the need for people to congregate outdoors.  We have been getting ready for the outdoor summer, including the provision of parklets, as referred to by Deputy O'Reilly, and outdoor space.</p> <p>  I can speak for most local authorities insofar as saying that usually, the local authority by-laws apply and prohibit drinking in public places.  However, where licences have been provided under section 254 of the Planning and Development Act, the alcohol by-laws do not apply to those areas.  Deputy O'Reilly is correct in saying that when I mentioned 20,000 outdoor spaces, a substantial majority of those areas have been provided to coffee shops and other dining areas where alcohol is not an issue and that should be taken into account.  Many restaurants and public houses are using their own private space for the outdoor summer.  Some have been supplemented by the outdoor parklets.</p> <p>  There was a lot of consultation in relation to the grants for outdoor dining, to help businesses purchase furniture for their private space and the public areas.  It is clear that local authorities are responsible for the public realm and policing of people is a matter for the Garda.  At a local level, in Fingal, there have been many conversations with the local garda&iacute;, and we worked together.  There is no doubt that the provision and the reopening of businesses, albeit with outdoor space, has greatly assisted the issue of people congregating.  As an example, in Deputy O'Reilly's own town, it was mentioned to me recently that there are as many as 2,000 seats available in the private outdoor spaces of local bars and restaurants.  Those 2,000 people were more than likely in the public area up until the bank holiday weekend in June.  That has, therefore, greatly helped maintain the safety of our towns and villages.</p> <p>  The discretion seems to be necessary.  Insofar as a precise interpretation of the legislation is concerned, none of our public space provision ameliorates against provisions in the licence for the public house or restaurant and that needs to be taken into account.  I understand the point of sale of alcohol is a consideration as well.  Ultimately, however, I am in members' hands as to whether further legal provision needs to be made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#C00300"><p>That is the point I take issue with.  The Minister has now said she will bring forward primary legislation.  Let us bear in mind, shortly before said she was going to bring forward primary legislation, she was tweeting that it was not necessary.  This kind of shambolic carry-on is driving business owners and workers up the wall.  My time is limited so I want to be very clear.  Is Ms Farrelly confident that without primary legislation, people can serve alcohol, not in their own private spaces because I know that is covered by section 254, but in the public realm?  Is she confident that without having to exercise discretion, members of the Garda can leave people alone so long as there are no public order incidents and that the people in Skerries, Balbriggan, Swords, Rush, Lusk or wherever they happen to be can have a glass of wine with their pizza or a pint or whatever in the public spaces specifically?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms AnnMarie Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#C00400"><p>I am not in a position to advise Deputy O'Reilly on the individual licence criteria of businesses.  That is a matter for the businesses and only they can determine that.  I have no sight of the licences.  It seems to be working well in Fingal, insofar as the section 254 licence provides for the serving of alcohol.  There is, therefore, no issue from that perspective.  However, I cannot advise the Deputy on the licensing issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#C00500"><p>That is fine and I thank Ms. Farrelly.  I have a question for Mr. Shakespeare on the pedestrianisation of streets.  I will use South William Street as an example because it was only partially pedestrianised.  As Mr. Shakespeare will know, that causes some issues because cars parks are located at either end of the street.  The impression that has gone out is that the people who control the car parks control the pedestrianisation, which is bonkers because the people who control the car parks clearly have an interest that is entirely at odds with the goal of pedestrianisation.  I would appreciate it were Mr. Shakespeare, particularly because he is here representing Dublin City Council, to respond to that.  It seems that the partial pedestrianisation has worked.  Is there an intention to expand this to facilitate more on-street dining etc. or is he content to facilitate the car park owners and confine the pedestrians into a small space?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Shakespeare" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#C00600"><p>We have to balance everything out.  The people who use those car parks are also people who participate in city life, be they fully abled, partially abled or somewhat disabled.  This requires balancing between all the various people.  We have 25 pedestrianised areas throughout the city and we hope to expand those.  As Deputy O'Reilly will be aware, we are piloting different areas at different times of the day and night to see what works best.  It is a delicate balance because the car park owners have rights and the car parks are needed to facilitate business and people coming into the city.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#C00700"><p>I am not sure how many people were in the car parks on South William Street on Friday night, but I know that anyone who was there as a pedestrian was squashed into a much smaller space.  It appears that was done to facilitate car park owners.  I am not saying that people do not have a need to drive into the city sometimes but it strikes me as being a bit odd that the car park owners appear to hold sway over this.  If there are no plans to expand the pedestrianisation in South William Street, that would be regrettable.  I was on the street and talked to people who were there.  For the vast majority of people there, notwithstanding some messing, it was a very enjoyable experience.  People say that it is great and that it would be great if it were bigger.  Is there an intention to expand the part of the road where it is working well, on the small area that is pedestrianised, on either side?</p> <p>  While I have the floor - I am conscious my time is short - does Mr. Shakespeare agree with his colleague, Mr. Coil&iacute;n O'Reilly, in his assessment that providing bins and facilities will only encourage people to come into town or does he believe it would be a good thing to put in additional facilities?  I think his colleague sent out a poor message to people in that there is no point in putting in facilities because that will only encourage people to come into town.  Business owners want people to come into town.  Retail workers want their jobs to be secure and people need to come into our towns and villages to do that.</p></speech>

The comments of my colleague, Mr. Coil&iacute;n O&rsquo;Reilly, came at a particular point in time when there was no outdoor dining.  We took a cautious approach and in response to calls from various sectors, we deployed 150 extra toilets.  All public buildings that had toilets were opened.  We deployed an extra 134 bins of varying sizes throughout the city where we believed they were needed.  Things were said at particular points in time in the environment we live in and where we were with the reopening of the city and of premises.</p></speech>

I am in the happy position that both Ms Farrelly and Mr. Shakespeare cover my constituency.  I have a couple of questions.  I am interested in the council officials' view of town centre reinvention following the impact of the pandemic.  One certainly gets the impression the shift away from retail to online has dramatically accelerated.  I wonder what will be the permanent impact on town centres.  As a group, are the officials changing their strategy with respect to town centres, particularly regarding residential living within towns?  I saw data on the use of the local authority scheme for reviving derelict properties.  Waterford, which is just one city, was using 45%.  There appear to be opportunities on that front.  Is there a new approach in this regard?  The officials are now recasting both enterprise plans and development plans.  Will we see a new approach to town centre reinvention?  Ms Farrelly rightly quoted many schemes out there including, creative, public realm, cycling renewal and community schemes.  There is a need to inject within individual selected towns some methodology for pulling people together to frame a comprehensive plan and I am interested in that.</p> <p>  As for the long-term impact of the pandemic, the second item I am interested in is the development of remote working outside the major cities.  To what extent are local authorities looking at the potential of hubs to copper-fasten that development?  Alternatively, do the officials think this is likely to be a fairly temporary phenomenon that will not call for very significant change in infrastructure?</p> <p>  Obviously housing is on the minds of most people and while the building of social homes was allowed to continue through the pandemic, I am sure it was considerably interfered with, and private housebuilding came to a standstill.  How are local authorities approaching the issue of getting that back on track as quickly as possible, because there is such pressure in the housing area?</p> <p>  As we exit this pandemic, there are bound to be many businesses under considerable pressure.  Have the councils been looking at how they are going to look at outstanding rates bills - although I am aware they did not apply during the Covid period - or how they might manage the problems of essentially viable businesses with short-term problems?  In some cases, those businesses may be tenants of the local authorities.</p> <p>  Finally, I have a question for Ms Delaney of Offaly County Council.  What perception does she have at this point of the progress on just transition?  Covid has no doubt dealt a blow to many of the projects that were hopefully coming on stream.  I would be interested to hear her view on where we stand with that and whether it can be accelerated in its impact.</p></speech>

I will come in quickly on the town centre approach and how we might reinvent some of our town centres.  Certainly the town centres first initiative coming from Government is something on which we are working very closely with it.  It is about living and working in town centres.  The remote working opportunities may help reinvigorate some town centres and bring back more employment.  Local authorities are looking at that quite closely.  There is no doubt we need to work with all the stakeholders in towns.  The principle of town teams is well accepted by ourselves and is in place in many towns across the country.  I take the Deputy's point on dereliction.  A combination of penalisation and incentives will get more activity into our town centres.  We are worried about retail.  However, some towns which are remote from city areas have done quite well during Covid and some of those areas have reinvented themselves.  This has not perhaps been the case with city centres across the country.  I will allow my colleagues from Limerick and Dublin city to come in on that.  On remote working, I mentioned the 400 digital hubs already established and the need for more.  It is not necessarily a rural issue alone.  The likes of the towns in north County Dublin would benefit greatly from remote working hubs.  Those towns have thrived somewhat during Covid as more people lived and worked in their local time as they were working from home.  I would like to capture some of that benefit and ensure we can keep it into the future.</p> <p>  There is no doubt housing was delayed by the Covid restrictions earlier this year.  We are doing everything we can to get that impetus going again and it certainly started off quite quickly when the restrictions lifted.  We are all working to an agenda of activating more sites and getting more construction on the ground.  It is going to be a challenging year but we are all working to the one agenda and driving through progress where we can.  On the current rates waiver, I can only give the Fingal County Council experience but 40% of businesses benefit from the rates waiver at the moment in Fingal, so we are working quite closely with the other 60% on where they stand this year and whether they are in a position to pay the rates liability due.  The communication is open and as we work very closely with businesses and try to address any challenges they face, that communication is already established.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Shakespeare and Mr. Daly to address the city centre issue.</p></speech>

There was a 45% shift to online trading but we are focusing on the experience of city centre shopping and town centre shopping.  In the long term, it is all about creating a more liveable city and people are talking about the 15-minute city.  We have seven of the eight national cultural institutions within Dublin and that is an area on which we will need to focus.  The question of what does city shopping offer people might be asked.  The retailers have been preparing for this online shift and all we can do is try to facilitate it by improving the experience in the public realm and how people experience their city.  In Dublin we have the living city initiative, which is encouraging people to live over the shop.  That is based a particular area in the city.  It relies on tax relief for individuals who own such properties to get them to build over the shop, as you might say, and get them to create those living spaces.  We have had limited success in that but to try to attract people into that, it might be more help for it to be more about grants than tax relief.</p></speech>

The take-up seems very low, including by local authorities.</p></speech>

I am not very familiar with this area, but Deputy Bruton is right.  We have had limited success.  We have promoted it online through normal channels and letter drops to relevant properties.  In terms of the rates in Dublin city, we have just over 20,000 accounts.  Last year we applied 18,000-odd rates waivers to a value of approximately &euro;160 million.  Approximately 45% of the charge was waived.  This year, because of the changes, approximately 9,000 accounts have some form of waiver to the value of &euro;84 million, and that is approximately 23%.</p> <p>  The Deputy had a query on commercial tenants of local authorities.  We have approximately 750 commercial tenants.  We invited people to write to seek waivers.  Depending on the type of business, we have given waivers ranging from 12% to 85% in rent relief on properties in our ownership.  I hope that this answers the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pat Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#E00300"><p>I would like to add to what Mr. Shakespeare and Ms Farrelly said.  Our experience in Limerick city centre is similar to Dublin.  The market is changing and people&rsquo;s needs and wants from the city centre are changing, particularly around retail.  We are all aware that.  The experiential approach will to feature more.  We have been looking at this as part of the development plan process in Limerick.  We have looked at the retail strategy for the metro area.   That is common across authority areas in the country as they prepare the development plans.  It is about looking at how to animate that space much more, as well as at how it can trip into the night-time economy, so that there would not be two distinct phases of an experience in Limerick from the business side in the daytime, switching not very effectively into the night economy.  We have been asked to look deeply at that.</p> <p>  Revitalisation will be the carrot and stick approach, as Ms Farrelly mentioned.  We are using all our legislative bases to challenge people who are moving on or developing properties.  At the same time, we are gaining some success in Limerick on taking those back into ownership, changing them,  and offering them back to the market.  The owners are also stepping up to the plate and doing things.  The Living City Initiative was mentioned.  We are having some success in Limerick, which is a Georgian city.  The scheme is dedicated to older buildings.  Georgian buildings, in particular, are costly.  The grant level may need to change or to be looked at.  Broadly, it has the potential to be successful, but it may need some tweaking.  We will probably engage with the committee on that later.  However, it has potential and it would give people an impetus to develop, if either the grant or the percentage level on a tax base, were tweaked. </p> <p>  When people could only walk within a 3 km, 5 km, or 10 km limit, they engaged with their places.  Place-making, as well as where retail animation is within that place-making, will feature heavily.  I found it interesting - colleagues might share my view - that the engagement with trade and stakeholders has been active.  People have taken much more interest in what they are trying to achieve, and in what they want from their cities and counties.  That will feature heavily and the dialogue has been enriched.  It should feature heavily in the development plan process going forward.  I hope that answers some of the questions.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Bruton for his question and for his support previously at the commencement of the regional transition team process and its activation.  On the just transition process itself, progress has been slow.  That would be the perception of progress, both locally and throughout the region.  However, there have been significant activities around the just transition process.  We got engagement with the start team at EU level.  It engaged with communities locally.  There have been a number of recommendations and an action plan going forward to address some of those communities that are most impacted.  With regard to the just transition fund, it supports projects across three specific priority areas, namely, enterprise and employment; training and upskilling; and community transitioning.  There are Strand 1 and Strand 2 projects.  Strand 1 is for those under &euro;100,000.  Of those projects, 16 are currently in contract.  They are delivering.  The total value of those is &euro;1.2 million.  As reported under those 16 project plans, they will create 28 direct jobs and 175 indirect jobs.</p> <p>  Provisional offers were then made to 47 Strand 2 projects, which are those up to &euro;1 million.  All have undergone state aid assessment, etc.  It is a significant verification process.  There many hurdles for those projects to get over in that verification process.  However, at this stage, approximately 30% of those applications are in contract.  Work is ongoing with Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to get the rest of them over the line.  They are at varying stages of that process.  Some &euro;27 million was committed overall.  We do not know if all that will be drawn down.  We are seeking assurances on that and on what will happen to funds that are not drawn down.</p> <p>  The EU territorial plan is being prepared by the Department for submission.  That will go to Brussels for ratification.  There is &euro;77 million in that just transition fund allocated to Ireland.  With match funding and national funding, I think that brings it up &euro;150 million.  We ask that that will go to those communities that are most impacted.  We look forward to working with the Department further on that.</p> <p>  We are looking at the administration of funds in Offaly.  We are working with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to see if Offaly County Council can administer those funds to enable them to be rolled-out to those communities more quickly.  It has been approximately 12 months since applications were made.  It has been six months since the announcement of the successful projects.  This is a obviously significant issue for communities that have made applications, particularly in getting their match funding.  They have not been able to do local fundraising due to Covid-19.  There is, therefore, a match funding issue for a number of those.   We have been asking our Deputies and MEPs to look at that.  We have had a couple of meetings with MEPs in relation to the NUTS 3 region and the EU territorial plan.  These are progressing, but progress is slow.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for Mr. Shakespeare and Dr. Daly.  I will start with Mr. Shakespeare.  Obviously, I welcome the commitment to a liveable city, with its emphasis on outdoor spaces, outdoor living, and public spaces.  All of that is important in the context of Covid-19 and also post-Covid-19.  How does that commitment square with the plan of Dublin City Council to sell off Tolka Park to fund the redevelopment of Dalymount?  This a regulated, controlled environment where young people, in particular, go to spend time on a Friday or Saturday night.  It is a community facility, it is open-air, and so on.  How does it make sense to get rid of a facility like that, and to replace it with private housing?  This cannot be reversed in a few years' time, or certainly it would be difficult to reverse it in a few years' time.</p><p>If we lose a space like that, it is likely lost for good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Shakespeare" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#F00200"><p>It has been no secret for quite some time that when the redevelopment of Dalymount Park was first mooted it would need to be funded by both Dublin City Council and the Exchequer and that the city council's funding would be raised by way of levies and the sale of Tolka Park.  For all intents and purposes, Tolka Park is private and it is not used day to day or week to week.  People have to pay to access it.  It is a run-down football stadium, as is Dalymount Park.  One well-equipped and well-functioning 6,000-seat, multipurpose stadium would probably be of more benefit to the community than two poor stadiums.  I know there is a "Save Tolka Park" movement but the land could be sold to an approved housing body.  At no point have I said that it will be sold to private developers.  The better outcome for everybody and for every football fan in the city would be a fully functioning Dalymount Park.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#F00300"><p>Is that the choice?  Do we have to choose between one of the two or is it a question of finances?  For example, Mr. Shakespeare indicated the refurbishment of Dalymount Park is to be funded by the Exchequer and Dublin City Council.  He stated Dublin City Council does not have enough money from rates, etc., and must, therefore, sell off Tolka Park to raise the money.  If the Exchequer was to make the funds available, would Mr. Shakespeare see the benefit of the "Save Tolka Park" campaign?  The campaign calls for investment in Tolka Park in order for it to be a fully public facility.  It has a good and detailed proposal that is costed at &euro;10 million.  This might be a question for the politicians on Dublin City Council but the ruling group has made a commitment not to sell off public land and to keep public land for public use.  Would that rule out the sale of the land to private developers?  Mr. Shakespeare denied saying the land would be sold to private developers but he is not ruling that out either.</p></speech>

We have only just engaged with the design team for Dalymount Park after a hiatus.  That will work its way through a process which will lead to a fully designed and specified stadium for which we can go out to tender.  As a lifelong League of Ireland head, my preference would be to have one good municipal stadium with a community library and various community facilities approximately 1.5 km away from Tolka Park and to reuse Tolka Park for other purposes that would be of wider benefit to the community at large.</p></speech>

If Dublin City Council did not have to choose between the two and could choose to have both options provided in a quality manner, would that then become Mr. Shakespeare's choice?</p></speech>

There is no point in having two stadiums servicing the area in question because the fan base is not there.  We are trying to build atmosphere within stadiums so my preference is for a one-stadium solution for the northside of the city.</p></speech>

There is a big discussion taking place internationally on the changing nature of work.  There is a question of where people will work and there is an emphasis in the opening statement on digital hubs.  We could have a scenario whereby people work partly from home and partly from digital hubs.  With that, the traditional office space becomes less dominant as the mode of working for a lot of people.  Does that cause Limerick City and County Council to alter any of its existing plans?  For example, I am thinking in particular about the opera site, which was to be developed primarily to accommodate what were described as gold standard offices.  With this shift in emphasis, does Dr. Daly agree that there is a case to review that?  The real pressure point in Limerick is the lack of affordable and quality accommodation and there is a need to increase the number of people living in the city centre.  In the context of this discussion about digital hubs and all of that, is that something Limerick City and County Council will look at again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pat Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#F00800"><p>On the question regarding the nature of work, Limerick is unusual in its history of development in that a lot of developers and entities built offices or units to order for clients.  Limerick did not have a lot of speculation and the speculation it had did fill.  It has been well managed in that regard.  We have kept in close contact with both the indigenous and the foreign direct investment markets to see what the trends were.  Their view is that the office market will maintain and that there is a role for the market and the office.  They believe that people may do transactional work at home and that where people are transacting or processing work, they may do part of that at remote locations.  However, for creativity, teamwork and strategising, people will still need spaces and offices.  The inside of the office may reconfigure but the pattern of office development or the need for offices will not change.  We are seeing that there is still a healthy pipeline in Limerick and we are still getting a lot of interest because the cost base is right.</p> <p>  We are benefiting from remote working in the sense that, through technology, people are beginning to relocate to Limerick or the mid-west to work.  We have been working on remote locations.  We have an innovation arm, Innovate Limerick, that has spent a lot of time putting digital packages together for Limerick, through community centres and new hubs, and with colleagues in the mid-west.  That has been successful and our pipeline for offices is still strong.</p> <p>  On the opera site, much of that project is at advance negotiation with some client entities.  That big landmark site is moving well and we are on-site carrying out ground works.  We are having advance discussions on that.  There is space for both public and private on the site, including a new library centre, new innovation offices and maybe an aparthotel.  The Deputy is correct that we will still need affordable and social housing in the city centre, including new types of same.  We are working on that project as well.  It is not a question of one or the other; we need both to happen if we are to reach the target set for us in the national development plan, which is at draft stage.  We will see a lot more investment.  We have to make sure the city centre gets both commercial and residential investments.  We would see everything working together.</p></speech>

I am particularly glad to see Mr. Shakespeare from my area in Dublin City Council here.  I pay tribute to the council officials on the ground, particularly for the enormous efforts they made when the pandemic kicked off last year.  It was an incredible response and it has continued in the months since.  I acknowledge the enormous effort that was made and the challenging circumstances in which officials had to work.</p> <p>  The appointment of an office of city recovery is an important development.  Every local authority should have such an office.  It should not be confined to a small number of local authorities.</p><p>It is an important development that should be in every local authority, not just confined to a number of them.  I am delighted to see C&oacute;il&iacute;n O'Reilly in that role.  I have disagreed with some of his recent comments but it is good to see him in the role.</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Shakespeare about the planning taking place at the moment regarding certain parts of the city and the concerns about footfall, certain multinationals not renewing leases on buildings and the knock-on effect that is playing out, which will play out further if more people are working from home and there is not demand for local coffee shops, shops and whatever else.  What planning is taking place in Dublin City Council with regard to the IFSC and the Docklands to prepare for a change in how people are working and will work in the future?</p></speech>

That narrative is starting to change.  We are hearing about a move towards hybrid working from the commercial sector.  There has been a reduction of footfall in the city centre and it is at approximately 70% of the normal rate now.  That is without tourists and quite a lot of offices.  We are doing our research through the economic development unit and we have the Dublin Economic Monitor, which tracks trends and sentiments.  We will continue to do that and see how it plays out but we are aware of what is going on.  We are keeping an eye on how we can work with other State agencies to ensure that these multinationals stay and help to generate the business that will sustain the coffee shops, newsagents or whatever else.  We have all the metrics from the past four years from the Dublin Economic Monitor, which is well worth reading.  It is published four times a year.</p></speech>

I am conscious that my time to ask questions is limited.  I have three specific questions for him and a broader question for the other county managers.</p> <p>  We are in the middle of imagining a different city for ourselves.  What steps have been taken regarding arts and cultural space in Dublin city?  We know there has been a hollowing out over the past 12 months.  What steps have been taken by the city council to dramatically improve the number of cultural and arts spaces in the city, especially with the large number of vacant sites?</p> <p>  Has any work been done on air quality?  We had a quiet city last year and for the first half of this year.  Has there been an escalation of the monitoring of air quality in this city for that period when people were not travelling compared with now?</p> <p>  There are obstacles to Dublin City Council retaining Tolka Park.  It is owned by the council.  I believe that we need to have juvenile pitches, community amenities and some housing on the 3 acres.  I want to hear from a local authority perspective why the council has to sell that site.</p> <p>  This question is for Mr. McElwee, Dr. Daly and Ms Delaney.  In their counties, there is concern about certain towns that are doing okay, which took a hit during the pandemic but will recover, and that we will see a widening of the gap between those and other towns that have been in decline for many years.  That is what I am picking up from Mayo, Limerick and other counties.  Is it borne out by the witnesses' experience that some towns will continue into decline and that recovery will not happen?</p></speech>

There will hopefully be good news about two sites on Bridgefoot Street and Merchant's Quay.  I do not have any specifics about air quality but we are looking to deploy air quality monitors in some of the smart bins we have to get the on-street air quality.  The obstacles to retaining Tolka Park are more than just that.  There are many underutilised spaces in that area.  There is a need for space but there is also a need to fund capital projects, whether it is Dalymount Park or other capital projects.  These types of development are not generally overly funded by the State.  Coming back to Deputy Murphy's point, funding in that space could be enhanced but I do not think it is the key driver for removing Tolka Park.</p></speech>

There are almost 300 projects under way and most are probably in towns with particular weaknesses, which need more jobs to be created and to be better places to live.  It is a fair point.  We have to monitor and make sure that we prepare for it.  Those types of funds will try to redevelop those town centres and make them good quality places.</p></speech>

It relates to just transition.  I was pleased that she referred to some of the issues that groups are having with trying to draw down their strand 2 funding.  It is frustrating for them.  An additional issue is the escalation in construction costs.  Some project managers are saying that their costs have increased by as much as 30% and it poses a problem.  The region is disappointed that the ESB plans to proceed with its demolition plans at both Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, County Longford.  Ms Farrelly said that they have plans for energy hubs there.  Does she have any more information about what those energy hubs entail?  Are they purely storage facilities for energy?  Is there any dividend to the local community?  Are there any job opportunities?  There is a sense that there will not be.</p> <p>  Is there an onus on us as a Government to go to the ESB and an onus on the ESB to come forward to say that the &euro;5 million it has committed to the just transition is not sufficient?  The midlands have been the energy centre of the country for 60 years.  If that &euro;5 million is broken down, it would be the equivalent of &euro;1,600 a week over those 60 years.  It is derisory in that context.  There is a growing sense of frustration in communities that what they have got under strand 2 will simply not make the numbers add up.  Has Ms Farrelly any more information on the energy hubs?  Is there a potential local upside?  What is the view at senior management level of local authorities about going back to the ESB to ask it to man up and put more money in the pot?</p></speech>

I do not have any further detail on the energy hub proposal.  I saw the press release that the ESB issued late last week.  Kieran Mulvey, the just transition commissioner, has engaged with the company on our behalf.  He facilitated a meeting with it about a community gain fund for Longford and Offaly, specifically Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.</p><p>We do not have any agreement on that yet.  Negotiation is ongoing and I understand that any agreement at local level also has to be agreed with the ESB board in due course, if there is community gain fund availability.  As the Deputy said, &euro;5 million was provided by the ESB.  In some of the discussions we are having with the company, there are buildings on both sites that may be given for community use.  We are working through those proposals with the ESB at the moment, particularly those for Shannonbridge.  The Dalton Centre is the building in Shannonbridge that has been mentioned and the local community group has also been liaising with the ESB in that regard.  We are trying to facilitate that at the moment.  However, the community gain fund would be very welcome in trying to get those communities that are impacted at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough some matched funding for the just transition projects and applications they have in the system at the moment.</p><p> We are getting commentary on the construction cost increases.  The just transition fund was available over a three-year period.  Due to delays in the system, it is now a two-year period with a closing date of 31 December 2022.  We have asked the Department to look at that to allow a three-year period for those projects to get off the ground and to utilise the funding available to them.  We are aware of the escalation of construction costs.  We have also made that point to the Department.  That is the full picture we have at the moment.  Negotiations are ongoing with the ESB regarding any additional community gain funding that might be available for Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.</p></speech>

Is there any opportunity for communities, and those projects that will struggle with their matched funding, to utilise the community gain fund?  Will it come on stream quickly enough and will it be of enough significant value to assist those strand 2 projects?</p></speech>

However, there is no agreement on it as yet.  I cannot give the Deputy any further detail on it because the negotiations are as they are.  I could not be any more positive that we will get that funding at the moment.  I honestly do not know.  Our elected members have also raised concerns, as the Deputy will be aware.  I am sure it is the same in Longford.  At Monday's meeting, Longford County Council passed a resolution to invite the ESB to a meeting with it.</p></speech>

I will speak about the living city initiative.  I am interested in hearing comments from Mr. Shakespeare but not about Dublin, which has been well covered this morning.  I am thinking more about my city of Waterford.  We are probably following the same narrative as other cities at the moment in trying to develop remote working opportunities, seeking to expand digital hubs and, hopefully, retain some of the outdoor amenity space we are developing, as well as developing public transport, access and all of that.  I agree with what Ms Farrelly said.  Much of this is predicated on jobs.  It is basically a chicken and egg situation.  If a place is not invested in, how can economic activity be created to drive job creation within it?</p> <p>  The living city initiative is not working in Waterford.  The reason for this is largely economic but we also have many old, listed buildings.  There is no benefit in giving property owners a tax break because there is no money to be made out of it in terms of a rental yield.  The question is how we get these properties back into use.  There are two hotels in Waterford at the moment, both of which are derelict.  The property owners are sitting on them and waiting for a market bounce.  In one case in particular, the economic tide has turned and one would imagine the owners would get going but the properties are sitting there despite dereliction notices and so on, which are not having the desired effect.  Does Mr. Shakespeare have any strategies for moving that type of situation on?</p></speech>

Given the age of the stock he talked about, there is a need for investment.  Various grant schemes are available but they could do with beefing up in terms of quantum, heritage buildings and the repurposing of those into usable spaces.  These properties need some investment from the State by way of a grant.  It is a difficult issue.  As I said, we have had limited success but we prefer to move away from tax breaks and more towards direct subvention to the building owner to develop a property.</p></speech>

Mr. Shakespeare mentioned direct subvention.  How does the local authority achieve that with an owner?</p></speech>

There should be a pure, simple application that is assessed.  We have a multidisciplinary team, including architects, conservation architects, planners and engineers to facilitate anybody who wants to engage in that.  That is where we can be helpful in terms of what will work and what will not.  From that side of things, it is that type of approach.  A grant scheme would need to be specifically put in place.  I do not know what my colleague, Dr. Daly, from Limerick, has to say.  Limerick seems to be having a little more success than we are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pat Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#H00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Limerick is akin to Waterford in size and scale.  To add to what Mr. Shakespeare said, we could look to the blending of a conversion to a grant or a raise, or look at the time period of the building and the percentage of the tax allowance.  We have had good dialogue and have gone door-to-door with our conservation and architectural teams, and talked and walked with the owners to challenge them to do more.  It has resulted in 20 or 25 buildings coming back into the market, either being redeveloped or being brought for sale to the market.  I can understand there is a great fear of using the scheme among some owners, developers, potential investors and even homeowners, which is that when they get into conservation of these old Georgian buildings, it will just be an open-ended bill.  We have been able to guide it very heavily, as Mr. Shakespeare has said.  We have been able to talk to property owners and, hopefully, give them some assurances.  We have given them design templates to help them.</p> <p>  When we started that process and dialogue it helped things along.  We were not the big, scary place where people felt they would just end up with a lot of costs, bills and regulation.  We turned it on its head and said to property owners that these are very important buildings that are part of our urban architecture and history and we wanted to work with them on it.  That kind of carrot approach has been better than the stick in this instance.  If we could do that, and I know colleagues in Waterford are doing that, to try to make it happen, in addition to looking at some of the schemes' limits and potentials, it would help us all greatly.  There is still great potential in the programme.</p></speech>

Can he outline any activity the LEOs are doing in terms of entrepreneurship around the living city initiative besides new coffee shops, eateries and all of that?  There is an awful lot of that happening in all our towns at this stage.  What other direct activities is he involved in when trying to get other small businesses in the service sector into that space?</p></speech>

The pandemic has probably highlighted that many businesses were, possibly, under-resourced in their management capability.  We have been working closely with them by putting in expert mentors to help and guide them.  This also feeds into the green economy and sustainability.  It is also about attracting people into shops and creating an experience in shops and retail.</p><p>It is also about attracting town workers to come back into those town centres with hubs.  That is very important for rural towns.  Much of the LEO client base is small businesses employing three and four people in local communities.  They are fundamental to keeping our small towns and villages going.</p></speech>

I will direct my questions to Dr. Daly.  I compliment him and his team for how they have worked diligently to help transform our city centre.  They do a lot of work to encourage businesses to survive and prosper and to get people into the cities.</p> <p>  I know Dr. Daly has worked very closely with Limerick Chamber of Commerce.  Its excellent report, The Future Development of Limerick City, painted a really positive picture of transforming Limerick into an urban environment where significantly higher numbers of individuals live in the city and others are attracted to visit and to participate in cultural, hospitality, educational and other activities.  It estimated that we would need 1,100 additional homes in the city each year.  I want to revisit the issue of the Opera Centre in that context.  The word "balance" has been mentioned.  I think we all agree that we have to get the balance right.  Given the aim of revitalising our city by getting more people to live in the city centre and in light of the urgent need for affordable housing, should we not revisit the balance in the Opera Centre and perhaps look at increasing the housing element?</p></speech>

I will pass them on to my colleagues.  The chamber of commerce report, which was prepared by Indecon Consultants, was very useful as an insight into how they see the world, as an analysis of how Limerick might emerge and develop and as an input into the draft development plan for Limerick.  It identified that urban living, particularly in the city centre, needs to come up a level at pace.  We would agree with that and we are working through it.</p> <p>  For the benefit of other members of the committee, the Opera Centre site is a large 4-hectare site in the middle of the city that we are bringing forward.  We have a development company in Limerick called Limerick 2030 DAC.  It is probably Ireland's only public interest development company.  It is taking forward key sites that we felt would anchor the redevelopment and revitalisation of Limerick city centre.  We are now looking at other locations around the county as well.  The site will be mixed use.  It will primarily have public spaces.  In addition to a new building for Revenue, which is expanding in Limerick, there will be a new library centre, an innovation office block, an aparthotel, some retail, a neighbourhood centre and some limited residential development, involving the conversion of a Georgian area.</p> <p>  That is only one site and there are many others we are working through.  A great deal of attention has been paid to the mixed-use aspect of the Opera Centre site.  Much of it is under negotiation which I probably cannot get into.  We have nearly all the blocks in dialogue with possible investors and owners.  Work is continuing on other key sites around the city centre, some of which are in our ownership and some of which we are working on with the private sector, to bring forward apartment living and social, affordable and student schemes.  I acknowledge that we have lacked such schemes in Limerick.  Our planning has not been confined to the Indecon report, on which we worked very closely with the chamber of commerce, with which we have a strong relationship as a stakeholder.  We have also worked with KPMG Future Analytics on our own reporting as part of the development plan process.</p> <p>  On an economic and spatial basis, we are asking what else is needed and how the mix works.  We probably need seven or eight new sites that would have social and affordable aspects along with more commercial and residential aspects.  That is where the next phase of the plan will be.  We spoke earlier about animating the city centre, what the change in the mix of retail and living will be, and where the night economy meets that.  I think that will be the next phase for Limerick.  It is quite an exciting phase.  I think there is a lot of interest in the public consultation around the draft development plan.  That came through very clearly.  It is very interesting that both reports we have been working with have come up with that as a finding.  While I agree with what the Senator has said, it will be not be confined to the Opera Centre.  We are a long way down the road in the Opera Centre - on-site works are taking place and development agreements have almost been finalised on several of the key buildings.  There are plenty of opportunities to drive this agenda forward in and around the city centre.</p></speech>

There has been quite a development of infrastructure, particularly things like cycling lanes.  A core comment I get from people on the cycling side of things is that they are encouraged by what has happened but they really want to see an integrated network.  How much of the infrastructure development is permanent?  How close are we to getting to an integrated network where we can travel across the city on bicycles without interruption?  On a separate but perhaps related matter, are there plans to have more public toilets and bins and to hold more events in the city centre, such as concerts in Arthur's Quay, to revitalise our city?</p></speech>

They will be going back out to consultation as part of the transport strategy that is coming forward.  There was so much interest in it and so much ambition that people wanted to see in the plan that the NTA, the Department and ourselves have gone back out for another bite of consultation to facilitate this.  Adaptive travel is supported by the Government and the Department.  We have a team of 29 coming forward that will take these initiatives forward for the council.  We are delighted that many of the pilot projects in mobility, and particularly cycling, have worked very well.  They have been integrated well.  I believe they will become a permanent feature as we go through the draft plan.  As we want people to be more animated in the city centre and to come to the city, we will have to look at the provision of public toilets and facilities.  The pandemic has taught us that if we want people to be able to move freely and have spaces to work, rest and play, the public facilities and infrastructure have to follow.  We are committed to making that happen as are colleagues across the country.</p></speech>

For example, there are only three buses from Castleconnell to Limerick city centre on Saturdays.  Are there any plans to revisit that?  I know it falls to Bus &Eacute;ireann to extend the service but it is something that needs to be addressed, particularly for younger people who want to get into the city centre.</p></speech>

We have lacked frequency.  We have been talking to our stakeholder groups both in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann about increased frequency.  A lot of that is coming back in through the transport strategy for Limerick.  Orbital routes that would allow people to get around Limerick if they want, while also enabling them to park and ride into the city and back out, have been lacking but we are pushing hard for them in the strategy.  I can see that villages like Castleconnell will be served both with better bus frequency and times and better rail frequencies.  I know Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is very committed to that.  That would be a new feature where we would have proper and strong park and ride facilities, better frequencies and better rail line offers for people.  That has come through very strong in the consultation in the transport strategy and it will be a feature of the new plan.  We are committed to that.</p></speech>

Cycle lanes were just mentioned.  I want to compliment all the councils on the work they have done and the funding that has come through in the last year.  So many schemes have come through the county councils.  They have tried to get them out to businesses and communities as quickly as possible.  I am sure it has not been easy but it has been done very well.  Many rural towns in my own county of Tipperary, such as Cahir and Cashel, and around the country have been enhanced on the back of the outdoor dining scheme.  I compliment the work the councils have done throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>  I have four topics on which I seek some insight.</p><p>I ask our guests to comment on their involvement in housing.  Is there more local authorities can give in terms of playing a role in building more houses?  What is their view with regard to the Land Development Agency and what it will do?</p><p> Many people are discussing rural development and county development plans.  I refer to the relationship of local authorities with Irish Water.  It seems to me that the priorities of many local authorities within their county do not align with the priorities of Irish Water for the county.  Is that difficult to align?  Where do our guests see that going?   It seems to me that the priorities of local authorities relate to economic growth whereas those of Irish Water relate to environmental aspects.  We cannot attract people into rural Ireland, to counties such as Tipperary and elsewhere, unless Irish Water and local authorities are aligned.  What is the view of the witnesses in respect of staffing issues and the ambitious targets that have been set out with regard to agreeing a way forward with Irish Water?  What are their views in that regard internally going forward?  Those targets set down in the White Paper are quite ambitious.</p><p> Reference was made to remote working hubs.  It is really positive and very welcome.  I am a huge supporter of such hubs in County Tipperary.  It is all well and good to have remote working hubs in place, but there is a need for them to be managed.  What role can be played by local authorities in the management of remote working hubs?</p><p> Several speakers touched on rural regeneration and the amount of funding that has come through the rural regeneration and urban regeneration funds.  Obviously, costs have gone up in the past year but it seems to me that there is a difficulty in respect of the rural regeneration projects, rather than the urban regeneration projects.  Is that the experience of county councils in terms of getting extra funding because of increased costs?  I know Ms Farrelly stated that most projects are up and running but it seems that they are progressing more slowly than was hoped.  Obviously, we are in the pandemic but, leaving that aside, do our guests believe there is a requirement for extra staff to get these projects moving?  We are getting to a stage where groups are applying for money for phase 2 of projects but phase 1 has not necessarily been started.  Is there a staffing requirement in that regard?</p></speech>

My colleagues may also wish to respond.</p> <p>  As regards housing, there are ongoing discussions with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding what the new targets may be under the new plan for housing which I understand will be launched in the coming month.  As to whether there is more we can do, we are trying to utilise every avenue for housing delivery, including direct build by the council, working with approved housing bodies, AHBs, and pursuing public private partnerships where they are a smart solution in certain circumstances.  The Senator asked about the LDA.  I do not think there can be too many actors involved in housing provision at this time in terms of ramping up housing supply.  The LDA will play its part in that regard.  It certainly has a big part to play in the provision of affordable rental and affordable housing.  We are all mobilising to do more.  Housing supply can be difficult to get off the ground but we in Fingal, for example, have sites on which we can deliver 3,000 units in the coming years.  These are sites on which we are actively involved in planning or design and hope to get to site on most of them very quickly.  We are already on site in some of the developments.  </p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right with regard to the alignment of priorities across all infrastructure providers.  Land activation requires everybody to be working to the same programme and delivering on time in order to get development happening, whether that is commercial or housing.  There is no doubt that active engagement with the likes of Irish Water to ensure it is doing the right projects in one's area at the right time is the only way we can get sites active.  There is a significant amount of work ongoing in that area.  I am not sure it is as difficult as the Senator suggested.  More probably needs to be done with regard to communication to make sure priorities line up on time, but it has happened quite well in recent years.</p> <p>  I am not sure I will comment on the staffing issue relating to Irish Water.  It is the subject of ongoing discussion and we might let that take its course in terms of the White Paper.</p> <p>  We are engaged in the management of remote working hubs but it is not our wish to staff them ourselves.  Some of my colleagues may wish to come in on this issue.  Ms Delaney may have further information on it.  Most of the hubs will work to a business plan that allows the doors to be open, so to speak, but we assist and are very often involved in the overall management structure for the hubs to ensure they run efficiently.</p> <p>  As regards the rural regeneration and development fund and the urban regeneration and development fund, the most frustrating part of any project is design, planning and procurement.  There is no avoiding it in respect of all these projects but it can be frustrating not to see work happening on the ground.  We are working through that for many of the projects.  Obviously, increased costs are a concern and something we will have to keep under review.  The increase in cost happened quite quickly and we do not know where it will bottom out.  Most projects are currently in the design phase, which can be slow.  We use our Part 8 processes within local authorities to look after that.  </p> <p>  I will ask my colleagues to come in on any issues they wish to address.</p></speech>

That is more to do with forward planning and how we look at the development of development land.  It is not necessarily traditional Irish Water staff or water services staff; it is more to do with that forward planning piece and knowing what infrastructure is needed in order to service one's land.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

Offaly County Council has accessed Enterprise Ireland funding through local enterprise offices for hubs, but other funding streams are becoming available under the Our Rural Future policy document and strategy which will allow for some funding of the hubs.  I note there is a new national network of hubs which will assist with their co-ordination and running.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#K00800"><p>I have a general question for the local authority managers in respect of the escalation in build costs and the affordability of housing development.  It is somewhat similar to a question asked by Senator Ahearn.  Are local authorities again considering trying to keep some type of in-house build team rather than just project management?  I refer to the retention of skills in terms of tradespeople.   I have been speaking to several developers and smaller builders in recent months.  It is becoming quite apparent that the current costs in the building sector are very unlikely to unwind because of planning regulations and specifications.  It is going to make housing unaffordable, particularly outside Dublin.  As I stated previously, in Waterford we do not have high-quality jobs like those available in Dublin and affordability is already a very significant issue despite the fact that the housing market has moved on.  Affordability is the central problem.  We are trying to get houses built under the affordability scheme.  A significant amount of social housing is being planned but not a lot of private housing is being done, apart from one-off builds.  What can local authorities do to ensure they have capacity in that regard?  We are hearing that local authorities should be building.  We know there is no capacity within local authorities currently to take on build projects.</p><p>It is all done by tender through third parties.  Secondly, if we have an affordability problem, will we be building houses in the future under the local authority or is everything going to turn into tower blocks?  Is that where the national development plan is going to end up?</p></speech>

It is probably unrealistic to think we will staff up completely to be in a position to build each and every home ourselves.  The engagement with private builders and the tendering piece is probably the reality of where we are going.</p> <p>  On speed and making the procurement process more efficient, the construction industry is aware exactly of what our level of activity is going to be in the coming years.  I expect it to scale up and to be in a position to assist us.  I might ask my colleagues to comment on some of the other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pat Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#L00300"><p>I will follow up on Ms Farrelly's points.  Due to Brexit and distribution issues, we are currently having problems sourcing product, which is impacting on some contracts.  However, the feeling is that as Brexit and distribution issues are addressed, as deliveries ease and product gets easier to find, some of the cost will come back in.  That should alleviate some of the pressures.  In time, as we emerge from the Covid pandemic and come through Brexit, the hope is that we will get the cost back in a relatively straight line and there will be more manageable inflation on some of the contracts.  That is what we are hoping for.  There are some good examples of that.  We have a development arm in Limerick in terms of the public interest works.  Even if councils want to get back into the building game directly, it is very difficult because the staffing is not there.  We will see a lot more special purpose vehicles or joint venture type arrangements that will accelerate the delivery of housing in the future, but it will need to be properly thought out.</p> <p>  Certainly, in the case of the Limerick development draft plan, and it may be common to other development plans in trying to address and even get round the issues Senator Ahearn mentioned in respect of Irish Water, where service sites or small clusters emerge, a lot of that is ready-made for small builders and procurement through smaller framework contracts.  We will seek to make some schemes available so that smaller builders can come in.  They will be the right fit for such projects.  The larger density projects will be built by the larger commercial interests.</p> <p>  There will probably be a blended approach.  A one-size-fits-all approach will not be the solution.  There will be individual solutions, not just in different locations but in different areas within locations.  For example, county towns will have a different approach from a city or metropolitan area.  It will be a matter of how we structure or organise around that rather than getting involved in building directly.  There may might be a different organisation of the process.</p></speech>

According to a model used in Germany, small builders can come in and piggyback on projects.  Is such a model being considered?  I do not get the sense from the local authorities that that is happening in public procurement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Pat Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021062300002#L00500"><p>It is being considered.  It will be a feature moving forward.  In Limerick we have a regeneration programme where we are trying to bring forward such a model.  It is not just about making space for small builders.  It all has to be managed through public procurement, the tender process and the EU directive.  If it can be constructed in such a way that there is a proper framework that can be used and is fair and transparent to people who wish to apply, then it makes sense.  Even within that, we are trying include a social clause in procurement contracts whereby the builders or successful tenderers employ local people on projects.  We are trying to address a few areas within those schemes.  We always try to look at international best practice and bring that to bear where appropriate.</p></speech>

I will return to the point.  He is from a neighbouring county so he might be familiar with some of the issues that I have raised.  The reason I have talked about Irish Water is because many of the outcomes we are trying to deliver over the next ten or 20 years are based on financial support in water infrastructure.</p> <p>  Dr. Daly will be aware there are around 900 estates that have legacy issues in respect of water supports, waste water treatment and infrastructure.  There are estates with such issues, for example, in the Glen of Aherlow on the border with County Limerick.  Negotiations between Irish Water and the county council are ongoing at the moment.  Is it Dr. Daly's view and that of county councils that responsibility for all of those legacy issues and the estates should be transferred to Irish Water?</p></speech>

There is a process within councils around taking charge and where responsibility lies or does not lie.  The Senator's suggestion is one way of dealing with the issues.  Many of the issues are going to be bound up in the negotiations generally between the Department, local authorities and Irish Water.  As Ms Farrelly outlined, those negotiations are still ongoing.  There will be space for them to be addressed but it will be an ongoing issue.</p></speech>

If some of the services are still being controlled by local authorities, who will provide the services if all staff move to Irish Water?  That seems obvious me, but I am not sure it necessarily does to Irish Water.  I know Dr. Daly is constrained in some form in what he can say, but it needs to be said.  Are we going to tell roads people they have to provide water services now?  I do not think that would go down well.  If services are going to be retained in local authorities, there must be a serious conversation about ensuring there are water experts in local authorities to deal with that.  I appreciate Dr. Daly's response.</p></speech>

First, I commend Dr. Daly and the staff in Limerick City and County Council.  They have done the best they can in the past year, which has been very difficult for everyone.  They have done a really good job.  Limerick itself is looking well at the moment.  I was there at the weekend.  It is buzzing again for the first time in a long time.  It is great to see.</p> <p>  I have a few queries on the living city initiative.  Obviously, there is a huge Georgian centre in Limerick and a medieval centre around the Nicholas Street area.  What could the Government do to make it easier to bring many of those properties back into use?  I know Dr. Daly said quite a few properties have been brought back into use.  I believe the total is 25.  I have seen some of them myself.  The quality is excellent and the properties have been finished very well.  How do we make it easier for those properties to be brought back into use?  As Dr. Daly will be aware, there is a lot of dereliction, particularly in the Georgian area and Nicholas Street.  Although many of the properties on Nicholas Street have been addressed, there is a lot more to do there.</p> <p>  My second question concerns Arthur's Quay.  Is there any specific plan to do something with Arthur's Quay?  We need to reimagine the city in light of the Covid pandemic and the fact we are emerging from it.</p> <p>  On the issue of the Cleeve's site, would the local authority consider putting social and affordable housing on the Cleeve's site?  To be honest, I do not see any other potential development for that area.</p> <p>  My final question concerns infrastructure and the very welcome redevelopment of O'Connell Street.  Has the council had any significant discussions or does it plan to change the initial development plan?  Obviously, the plan was agreed before the Covid-19 pandemic and things have changed during the pandemic.  Will there be any changes to the outcome of the redevelopment of O'Connell Street and the surrounding area?</p></speech>

We are happy to pass them on to colleagues.  In respect of the living city initiative there are two aspects to consider.  We could look at the time bands within it, what buildings fall into it and what buildings could be included.  A study of the impact across the sites and the city may be beneficial in that respect.  We could also look at the tax treatment within the scheme, specifically a potential increase in allowances or, as Mr. Shakespeare and Ms Farrelly mentioned previously, a possible conversion to a grant mechanism.  There is an opportunity in the scheme.  To get it to the scale people are talking about, it would need a rethink and a part overhaul.  However, it could withstand that.  It is probably the last of that particular type of urban regeneration programme that could benefit from a rethink or a tweak.  It is perhaps something to look at as we go into the budget cycle towards the end of the year.  With some changes, strong communication and perhaps some local management, it could work very well.</p><p>Arthur's Quay is a sister site adjacent to the Opera site in Limerick.  We are working with a number of partners at the site regarding how it could be developed.  That work is ongoing.  I believe there are opportunities.  Abutting that site is the site for the university campus in the city centre.  There is a ring of development emerging.  Arthur's Quay will be redeveloped as part of that programme, which is exciting because one can see where the city centre is nearly shifting down to that riverside area and the waterfront, which was supported under the urban regeneration and development fund and the Government's schemes.  Limerick received some &euro;116 million to make that happen.  It will be a significant project.</p><p> The Cleeves' site is in master planning and the consultants are looking at that.  I imagine they will look at all options around residential, mixed use and commercial, and how that mix will be.  It will most definitely be looked at for social and affordable.</p><p> On the infrastructure of O'Connell Street, we are on-site and we are disrupting Limerick city centre a little bit at the moment.  I am sure our traders are hopeful.  They have been very patient so far and with a little bit more patience we will get the benefit.  There have not been many changes because we are working to the panning permission on it and we must be careful of it.  The revitalisation project was designed to cater for more pedestrianisation, a reduced thoroughfare, a specific public transport lane, a reduction to one motor lane from the current two lanes and a lot more paving animation on the public side.  Once we get through the works and people begin to see each phase emerge, hopefully they will be very impressed and happy with it.  It will really future-proof the main street in Limerick.  It will be quite exciting.  I hope I have answered the members' questions.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Patrick Farrell, our retail banking director, and Kevin Hewston, interim chief operations officer.  This is my first appearance before the committee since being appointed chief executive of the bank in June of last year.</p> <p>  Firstly, I assure the committee that I will always listen to the committee members and give them whatever assistance I can, and that I want Permanent TSB to bring vigorous competition, better service, better products and better value to Irish customers and small businesses in communities across Ireland.  I want to build a sustainable bank for the future and at the centre of any sustainable business is the responsibility it has to its customers.</p> <p>  As soon as I took up my position I set out a new purpose for Permanent TSB.  This is centred on building trust with our customers and connecting with the bank&rsquo;s community heritage, which has evolved over the past 200 years from our unique roots in communities throughout Ireland as the former Irish Permanent Building Society and the former First Trustee Savings Banks.  I set out this purpose because I want Permanent TSB to be known for having a strong sense of social purpose and one that plays a broader role in Irish society.  I strongly believe that maximising the return for customers leads to maximising the return for shareholders over the long term.  At the heart of growing a truly sustainable business is the fair treatment of and good returns for customers, acknowledging the requirement for any bank to make a return on capital so as to be financially sustainable.</p> <p>  While we still have more work to do to further build trust with customers, and I acknowledge there are legacy issues from the past, we are taking steps in the right direction and over the last year we have put our purpose into action with a number of measures.  We have kept all 76 of our branches open throughout the pandemic and committed to maintaining our existing branch network.  In addition to the &euro;30 million investment over the last five years, we have committed to investing a further &euro;5 million over the coming year in refurbishing and maintaining branches to make sure they remain an attractive place for our customers to do business.  We made significant cuts to our mortgage interest rates, both for new and existing customers, with greater fairness in our mortgage pricing and a shift towards offering the same rates to both new and existing customers.  We have supported our customers who were affected by the pandemic with more than 13,000 payment breaks to give these customers valuable breathing space at a time of significant upheaval.  We continue to work closely with some 1,000 customers who require ongoing support.  We supported the provision of affordable and social housing with a partnership between the bank and the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, in which the bank provides financial and operational support to the &Oacute; Cualann group.  We achieved the Business Working Responsibly Mark, which is the leading standard for corporate social responsibility and sustainability certification in Ireland.  We have also announced plans to hire more than 180 new staff with a particular focus on IT skills, to complement a &euro;150 million investment in our IT systems and digital banking capabilities.  We have announced a major initiative to grow our presence in the SME lending market, which included teaming up with the State&rsquo;s Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, to provide more than &euro;50 million in new low-cost lending to small businesses.</p> <p>  Perhaps the single biggest example of our commitment to making things better for customers, our communities and the wider economy is our announcement in February that we are in discussions with the NatWest Group to acquire certain elements of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s retail and SME banking business.  This shows our ambition to become Ireland&rsquo;s best personal and small business bank, a bank with deep roots in Irish communities that can bring even greater competition to customers at a time when customers need competition more than ever.  If we are successful in agreeing commercial terms, Permanent TSB will be a bank with more customers, a larger footprint, greater reach and a greater ability to bring new and better products and services to retail and SME customers.</p> <p>  Before I conclude my opening remarks I must offer the committee an apology with regard to the level of detail I can go into at this stage about our discussions with the NatWest Group.  I hope members will appreciate that both sides have agreed to conduct these negotiations in the strictest of confidentiality and I must also respect our disclosure obligations as a company that is quoted on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  I can say that I have been greatly encouraged at how constructively both sides are approaching these discussions.  It is my aim that we will reach an agreement that will benefit customers and create value for the State through its shareholding in the bank.</p> <p>  I reaffirm our commitment to continuing to support customers as we exit the Covid-19 pandemic and in demonstrating our purpose of building trust with customers.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Is it expected that the bank will be in the position to take up and fill the void or vacancies left when Ulster Bank moves on?  To what extent will the Permanent TSB be in a position to replace the Ulster Bank's services countrywide?  That is my first question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021062300002#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  I cannot go into detail but I can provide some guidance on why we are talking to the NatWest Group and why we are engaging on the Ulster Bank operation.  Permanent TSB has long and deep roots across Ireland in the provision of accounts services and mortgages to customers.  It is our ambition to expand also into small business banking to provide competition, an area that we know is dominated by the two larger banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  We believe there is an opportunity for us to increase our footprint by way of our branch locations, and with the breadth of our product through the Ulster Bank discussions.</p><p>It is our ambition to be in the communities in which we operate, serving the customers we have.  We welcome customers from Ulster Bank and other banks and welcome providing the competition that is needed, particularly in the business banking area.</p></speech>

I ask given other lending institutions are reducing their branch footprint across the country.</p></speech>

When one looks at the Ulster Bank network and ours, we have many branches which are close to each other but there are other locations where we do not have a branch network.  We are making a commitment to our branch network.  We see our branches as being a core part of how to do business and see them as being core to the communities in which we operate.  We see that customers appreciate that but they also understand the types of services we offer in branches are changing.  Naturally, more transactions are going online but there is an added benefit for customers to come into a branch or indeed for our branch staff to go and visit customers in their home in the locality in order to assist them with mortgage applications, business applications or business banking.  We therefore see the absolute importance of the branch network as part of what we offer and where we are today.</p></speech>

Does PTSB have any overhang of debt arising from the economic crash that is not resolved or is not provided for?  Does the bank have a way charted for the future in that respect?</p></speech>

We have about 1,000 customers who have required additional support post the Covid payment break and we are working closely with those customers; in fact we are in contact every three months.  We provided all those customers with a nine-month additional support to see how they would actually progress through the opening of the economy.  On the business side of our support we have a number of customers but it is actually at a very low level given our exposure to the business side is not that great.  That gives the Deputy the numbers and indeed our approach to supporting those customers.</p></speech>

We are aware this relates to a couple of key sectoral areas which the committee will be well aware of also.</p> <p>  On solutions for customers whose issues arose from the financial crash, this is an area on which we as a bank have engaged extensively with the committee in the past, particularly around the whole area of non-performing loans, NPL, classification and the requirement for banks to reduce NPLs.  We have reached solutions with customers and we continue to reach them, for instance in the mortgage to rent area where we have customers who continue to take up that opportunity to resolve their situation.  It is an ongoing engagement with customers.</p></speech>

In some cases, for instance, we have to go through a full court process with customers in order for them to then realise the mortgage to rent is the right option for them.  That is unfortunately part of the way things can operate, in that some customers want to go through that court process before they get to a mortgage to rent solution.  In other cases we have reached agreements with customers around long-term arrangements for payment and that is a continuing discussion.  All banks still have residual issues arising from the global financial crisis of 2008.  The number of customers in our bank has reduced in recent years due to deleveraging and other solutions we have adopted.</p></speech>

When Mr. Crowley says the number of customers has reduced does he mean the number of customers overall or the number in difficulty?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021062300002#B01100"><p>I am sorry.  It is the number of customers in difficulty.  Our actual customer number has increased and continues to do so.  Our number of customers who have difficulty or require further support has reduced over recent years.  As I mentioned, the most recent group of customers we are dealing with on a very careful basis are those coming out of the Covid pandemic.  I mentioned there are about 1,000 mortgage customers in that category.  If I can add something, 80% of those customers are making some payment and are engaging with the bank in a very proactive way.  We in turn are engaging with them in a proactive manner.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his commitment to retaining the existing branch network and indeed I think he committed to expanding it.  However, I want to ask about the form that will take.  I am conscious that in a number of its branches PTSB is withdrawing the cash desk service and moving to automated machines.  I believe the number of such branches is 44 and Mr. Crowley might confirm that.  We saw those actions taking place in April and then again this month.  On the future plans for the network, how many more branches is PTSB intending to move to automated machines only?  I ask because there is a sense, which I share, that it is a lesser service or a lesser presence in the community when compared with a branch that has a number of staff, as opposed to perhaps one or two, actually operating in the branch.</p></speech>

I will say a few words and then pass over to Mr. Farrell.  There is no doubt we must all accept the world is changing with regard to all retail operations and we are a retail operation at heart, be that in a shopping area or indeed in the banking area.  Part of our commitment to ensuring each branch is sustainable and will continue to exist is how we think about the services in those branches and how we think about changing them.  In order to give the Senator more detail about our approach and where our thoughts are on that I will hand over to Mr. Farrell, if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021062300002#B01400"><p>I thank the Senator.  As Mr. Crowley has said, the branches are a core part of our business.  They have been a core part of our community bank for over 200 years and we see them as a core part of our business going forward.  During that period the network evolved and it is evolving today.  The Senator is correct that 44 of our branches are moving to automated cash services but I will explain what that allows us to do.  Our focus in those branches is to ensure we can stop doing the administrative tasks behind the counter and get our staff out front of house so when one comes into our branches one is met by a person.  We acknowledge consumer behaviour has changed drastically, particularly in the last 15 months, towards more mobile and online banking.  Our customers also really want to meet a person and the core of our bank at a community level has always been about people.  We are still able to do 98% of the in-branch transactions that a person could have done when there was a cash desk but by using state-of-the-art automated machines we are able to get our staff out front of house to engage with our customers to help and assist them.</p><p>We also have a 100-strong external workforce in the community.  Not all customers can come in to us.  We have to bring our branch service into every home and business in the country.  Covid has restricted that a little bit in the past while.  We want to get that workforce back out again so they can engage with and look after our customers.  </p><p> We have invested &euro;30 million in the past number of years.  As Mr. Crowley said, we are investing &euro;5 million this year.  We are also considering other brand formats.  We use pop-up stores, particularly in shopping centres.  We want to bring our services to the customer to make sure that we stay relevant and viable.  We see our branches as a core part of our franchise and business, and people are at the heart of that.</p></speech>

What will be the loss of service by moving to an automated machine service within a branch?  Did the 98% figure refer to transactions or services?  I was not sure which will continue to be provided.  What comprises the 2%?</p> <p>  I have a second question relating to what he said.  Am I to understand that the bank is moving to a model of staff physically going out into the community to people's homes or will it be a telephone-based service?  I would like to a clear picture of what exactly he is describing when he refers to going out into the community.</p> <p>  I share his view that people want to meet a person.  He described it as an administrative task.  People using cash desks meet members of staff.  Whether people are standing in the foyer or behind a desk, customers are meeting a person.  Our concern is that they will meet fewer people and will instead be pointed in the direction of a machine.  To me, that equates to a lesser or reduced service.</p></speech>

The 2% refers to coin.  In our branch model where we have automated cash services people cannot lodge or withdraw coin.  That is the key difference in transactions.  We have about three branches in each territory, and a community branch can accept coins.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's second question, it is not about telephones.  We are building up our direct bank with a phone and mobile banking service.  I am talking about people on the ground.  Prior to Covid, we had moved to getting our people out into the community.  As I mentioned, we have a 100-strong workforce that can deal with customers, which involves current and deposit accounts, mortgages, consumer finance, etc.  Covid has put paid to people visiting homes and businesses before now, but now that we are coming out of the pandemic it is about mobilising that workforce again to get back into the community.  It is very much person-to-person, supported by our very strong investment in digital capability. </p> <p>  We can see a massive shift in customer behaviour and an appetite for digital banking capability.  We are going to match that with investment in, and training of, our people to provide the human interaction our customers need.</p></speech>

My last question relates to mortgage competition.  We have a particular issue in this country with regard to competition in the mortgage market.  PTSB launched a new product in February or March that allows customers to fix their mortgage for a term of four years at 2.25%.  However, this is only available to new customers rather than the existing customer base.  Some might call that a form of dual pricing.  I am sure PTSB has watched and observed the criticism and initiatives taken by this committee and legislators to try to outlaw dual pricing.  Is it fair that PTSB is only offering this new product to new customers and excluding its existing customer base?</p></speech>

To reaffirm what Mr. Crowley said earlier, we have put a lot of effort into making our new fixed rates available for new and existing customers along with making significant reductions in our variable loan book.  The market today is 80% fixed and 20% variable.  We have also gone to great lengths to make sure we have a fair and competitive offering for our variable book and make our new fixed rates available to new and existing customers.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that the four-year product is for new business only.  That is the product that we want to be competitive on.  We want to grow our business.  We want to introduce something to the market from time to time that helps to grow that business.  Our long-term aim is to make sure that we have fairness for all customers we have and are offering, as best we can, all of our products to our new and existing customers.  From time to time, we will introduce targeted incentive-type products to try to grow our business, and drive competition in the market for consumers and create an overall better market for them.</p></speech>

His questions are quite specific.  I am happy to come back afterwards with information on the financial aspects.</p> <p>  With regard to the tracker mortgage examination, we substantially completed it in 2017.  We completed the investigation with the Central Bank in May 2019 and paid the fine at that stage.  We admitted to misdemeanours with respect to publication.  That was more than two years ago. </p> <p>  We continue to engage with the FSPO with regard to tracker cases where customers have, in some cases, raised those cases directly with it.  They do not necessarily have to come to the bank to raise those issues, and can instead go directly to the ombudsman.  In the region of 200 cases are with the ombudsman at this moment in time.  We also have some cases of tracker customers, which are in a legal process through the court system.</p><p>There are approximately 80 cases at present.  With regard to the number of impacted accounts, there are more than 2,000 and we have redressed and compensated these customers.</p><p> With respect to the comment on the 18 findings from the FSPO, naturally this is something on which we engaged with the ombudsman directly.  Some of the findings were partial findings and others were full findings against the bank, depending on the nature of the engagement.  It is fair to say the bank was probably one of the first, if not the first, bank in the tracker mortgage examination.  Hence, the engagement with the ombudsman is more mature and we had more cases earlier than other banks.  This is what may give rise to these numbers.  We absolutely accept that engagement not only with the ombudsman but also with customers is very important to resolve this issue.</p><p> With regard to the number of properties that were at issue, I do not have the exact number in front of me but it was in the region of 40.  I apologise, it is one of the items I just do not have to hand but it is something I will come back to.  With regard to provisioning, naturally I mentioned the fact there are still in the region of 80 cases involved in the legal process.  We have provisions in our accounts to cover legal costs and ongoing costs related to this engagement in the court process.</p></speech>

This is something many committee members have been dealing with in different banks over a long period of time.  This ruling resulted in one bank doubling its provisions for redress and compensation.  Will Mr. Crowley clarify whether the ruling affected Permanent TSB customers?  Of the 200 cases before the FSPO, how many types of groups are there?  Are there specific groupings?  For example, 40 could be to do with a prevailing rate issue.  Does Mr. Crowley have any detail on this?</p> <p>  More generally, this is the first time the bank has come before the committee since the fine was handed down on 30 May.  The bank was fined &euro;21 million for serious failings across 2,007 tracker mortgage customers' accounts.  This happened until October 2018, including during the tracker mortgage examination, which is shocking and damning.  It calls into question the statements that representatives of the bank previously made to the public through this committee.  In the words of the Central Bank, the fine reflected an unacceptable harm that Permanent TSB caused to its tracker mortgage customers for an extended period of significant overcharging, to the loss of 12 family homes and 19 buy-to-let properties.  We know the fine was reduced from &euro;30 million to &euro;21 million under the settlement discounted scheme.  What are Mr. Crowley's views on the fine and the reasons for it?  More importantly, what is his message to those customers who were harmed?  What does he say specifically to the Central Bank's finding that this harm continued during the course of the tracker mortgage examination?</p></speech>

With regard to his earlier questions, the prevailing rate decision did not impact Permanent TSB.  With regard to the groupings, I have mentioned there are more than 200 cases with the FSPO rather than 200 itself.  I do not have specific groupings at present but I will happily engage subsequently with the committee on this aspect.</p> <p>  With regard to the point the Deputy made on the finding and the fine, clearly the bank has apologised for what has happened.  Indeed, it has apologised over an extended period of time.  Unfortunately, it is a very difficult and bad history that not only Permanent TSB has had but the wider banking sector has had through the tracker engagement, through the financial crisis and as we approached the mid-2010s, with regard to how banks interacted.  As an organisation this is something we have taken on board.  We have paid our fine, which was significant, and we accepted the misdemeanours put forward in the settlement agreement.  We have learned from it and we are trying to move forward.  As we engage with the FSPO, we are trying to resolve cases on an ongoing basis with customers in this area.  I can only reiterate the apology and the fact this should not have happened.  We are trying to learn from these lessons and move forward with regard to how we develop our bank.</p></speech>

Knowing the impact the bank had on those families and the financial situation, not only those who lost their homes but those who were burdened by the threat of repossession and the overcharging the bank was involved in, which I have described as theft in the past and will continue to do so, I am sure that when they hear commentary such as "misdemeanours" it will be a red rag.  The problem here is that Mr. Crowley's predecessor apologised through the committee but now we have learned from the Central Bank that at the time of those apologies, when Mr. Crowley's predecessor was saying the bank had learned a lesson and was apologising for what was happening, the bank was continuing to inflict harm on some of its customers through this process, right up until 2018.  This is very hard to stomach.  We need to see real action in terms of a customer focused proposal or view from the bank.</p> <p>  To look forward, I am on the record as looking to see Permanent TSB emerge as a third force in the market.  It has stated its interests in acquiring a portion of Ulster Bank's loan book.  It has been reported this could include up to &euro;9 billion, or 60% of the loan book from non-tracker mortgages, small businesses and consumer loans.  Given that the State owns 75% of the bank on behalf of the taxpayer, the State and taxpayer have an interest in any inquisition, as Mr. Crowley will understand.  Will he clarify the portion of the loan book in which Permanent TSB is interested?  We understand a memorandum of understanding has yet to be agreed between Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank.  Will Mr. Crowley update the committee on the status of the negotiations, insofar as it is possible for him to do?  What cost range would he give for the acquisition of the portion of the loan book I have mentioned?  Previously it was estimated at just over &euro;500 million.  What would be the total capital reserves at Permanent TSB's disposal to fund such an acquisition?  Will he confirm the TUPE regulations will apply to any transfer of loans from Ulster Bank to Permanent TSB?  Will he confirm that Permanent TSB is in talks with Ulster Bank to acquire a portion of its branch networks?</p> <p>  I have asked a number of questions in which the committee and the public will be interested.  We learned this morning that shares in Bank of Ireland are being sold.  People will be questioning the timing of this because it is not good value for money at present.  We will be interested to see whether this is the first act in a two-act scenario that includes Permanent TSB at a later stage this year.</p></speech>

As I mentioned in my opening statement, I cannot go into a lot of detail on the negotiations we are in with NatWest on Ulster Bank.  I cannot comment on the size because it is subject to negotiation.  With regard to the memorandum of understanding, the negotiations are constructive and they are progressing.  Until we have a memorandum of understanding, I cannot make a comment on aspects of it, including the cost range.  However, the cost range, in effect, is related to the amount of capital that would be required to support any loan book originated on a day-to-day basis through our own mortgage origination or acquired by way of acquisition.  It is primarily related to the capital associated with it.  It is governed by the size.</p> <p>  With regard to capital reserves, the bank-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Crowley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021062300002#E00200"><p>We have a common equity tier 1 ratio of 15.6%.  That is a capital ratio which has increased during the crisis last year because of our management of our balance sheet, ensuring that we are keeping the bank in a safe place, and because of the management of the capital in recent years.  We have some headroom in our capital base but that is subject to discussion with the Central Bank because it sets the capital requirements for the organisation on an annual basis.  We have some headroom in that number and we are at a safe place today.  The acquisition of any book would require some additional capital and that can come in lots of different formats, not just by way of capital injection.  It can also come by way of discount on loan purchases and there are other ways it can be created but I cannot go into any detail.  Therefore, any speculation on requiring support from shareholders includes all shareholders, not just our 75% of shareholders.  We have 25% external minority shareholders who have also expressed interest in our transaction and expressed support for it.  If we needed capital, we would have to access it from all shareholders, not just from our main shareholder but we are not at that level yet.</p> <p>  On transfer of business, it is fair to say that the acquisition of or transfer of a loan book would have TUPE legislation attaching to it.  That is clear in our discussions.</p> <p>  On branches, I said publicly when I announced our interest in the Ulster Bank franchise that this included our interest in branches that Ulster Bank has, particularly in areas where we do not have the same level of coverage.  We believe that those branches will complement our 76 branches across the country.  There is a complementary aspect to the Ulster Bank franchise, which we believe will add to our bank, our scale size and our branch locations.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; an pl&eacute; an-suimi&uacute;il.  Can the witnesses reflect on their expectation and anticipation of the movement of share prices, both for PTSB and the broader banking sector, given the broader economic environment from post-pandemic recovery and upward movement in interest rates?</p></speech>

Also, banking business models in Europe are somewhat under threat because of negative interest rates and excess liquidity.  That is the case in Ireland more so than other European countries.  Credit formation has been low in recent years arising from the crisis and the difficulties that gave.  Also, saving rates have increased significantly.  Savings among Irish households are up &euro;30 billion in the last three years, with over &euro;15 billion of that in the last year alone.  There is an excess of liquidity over lending.  That excess liquidity attracts a negative rate and is having an impact on the profitability of banks and the return we make as organisations.</p> <p>  To come back to the core point, if I take Irish share prices in their own right, they were much impacted by Covid and the uncertainty of Brexit.  We saw that once there was some positive news on Brexit, together with a lifting of Covid restrictions or at least a visibility of that, Irish share prices have recently increased.  Our share price has gone up significantly but I would also suggest that it is based on speculation around our previous discussion relating to the Ulster Bank franchise.  In more recent weeks, the share prices have come down slightly but they are at a higher level versus where they were in recent years.  I would suggest that there is an anticipated increase in commercial activity among wider society post pandemic.  I appreciate that there is an element of society that may not benefit from that but generally there is an anticipation of extra spending.  Banks, in the main, should be the beneficiary of that, including by way of our mortgage demand as we can see, which is significantly higher.</p></speech>

We can see that Mr. Crowley is anticipating that the share price will increase in the coming years.  It is interesting in the context of the announcement today by the Minister for Finance and that is why I was asking the question on share prices.</p> <p>  I have another question on mica.  We saw the protests on mica and the consternation around it.  Can Mr. Crowley confirm whether PTSB had any mortgage accounts for properties affected by the mica defective blocks and if so, how many?</p></speech>

We are dealing with customers through our Letterkenny branch, which is a region of the country that is much affected by this issue, and that engagement goes on.  At an industry level, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, is engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the scheme.  That may change in due course.  We recognise that we have to play our part in a solution to the mica issue for our customers.  We have experience of this with the pyrite issue and we had customers affected by this in the past.  We assisted some customers who had to move out of their homes in order to get them repaired with their position.  We also dealt with some customers who could not have the issue rectified.  We have some experience from the pyrite issue and we recognise the part we have to play in the mica issue.</p></speech>

That is part of the scheme of arrangement.  There is a recognition by Permanent TSB that we would have to play our part in that by dealing with and helping customers in a sympathetic way, understanding that their position is not of their own fault and that it is a wider issue in that respect.  We want to deal sympathetically.  As I mentioned, we have some experience from the pyrite issue, where there was a mixture of different impacts, some not as difficult and others being extremely difficult by way of the position of the customer's primary home and dwelling.  We understand that we have to play our part.</p></speech>

I would like to question the witnesses on the banking market in Ireland, which looks to be broken.  What I mean by saying it looks to be broken is that there are two major players with 85% of the market at this stage.  It is an oligopoly for all intents and purposes.  Massive supplier power can determine all aspects of the market for themselves.  What is the experience of the witnesses of this in how it affects Permanent TSB, given that it is a much smaller player?</p></speech>

There is the business banking market, which is dominated by the two main banks.</p><p>It is an area where we are trying to provide alternative funding and targeted financing for business.  I cannot go into the specific detail, but an element of our negotiations with Ulster Bank concerns aspects of its business book.  We want to provide more competition in that area.</p><p> Turning to the mortgage side, I believe there is plenty of competition in this area.  The market shares of the two main banks have been staying stable, or falling in some cases, in recent years.  Our market share, for instance, has been increasing, as has that of others, such as the non-bank lenders.  Therefore, it is quite a competitive market and there is a lot of information for customers.  We must compete like everybody else in that respect.  Naturally, there has been some comment, particularly arising from the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, report in February, regarding the level of capital required by banks to support mortgage lending.  It highlights the competitive nature of how interest rates and costs are driven in respect of banks making a return.  I believe there will be more debate on this aspect in due course.  However, the retail area of banking is very competitive, no company has it its own way and market shares in recent years show that it is not a one-way bet.  It is necessary to work hard for every mortgage and work with all customers in a proactive way to get them from application to draw down and, ultimately, to get them keys to their own homes.  We have been doing that for many years, and we want to continue to do that to provide competition.</p></speech>

We are looking at a shrinking market and a further concentration of the market into fewer hands.  Situations like that never bode well for customers.  Mention was made of capital requirements as a possible reason for banks to leave the market.  What other reasons are there for banks to be leaving the market now?</p></speech>

I talked to the previous Deputy about the impact of the financial models of banks across Europe and levels of profitability.  It means it is more challenging for a bank to remain profitable.  It is necessary for banks to be more efficient and to spread their costs over income which has tended to fall in recent years.  Naturally, we are coming at this topic from a slightly different place because we are somewhat smaller as an institution.  We believe we have the capability to grow and provide more competition.  Indeed, we believe we can grow our income over the coming years.  However, it is an equation which involves factors such as scale, size and the amount of mortgage business, for instance, undertaken as a core product in the country.</p></speech>

I read the paper produced by the Financial Services Union, FSU, which addressed this area and I met representatives of the union to discuss that paper in detail.  We will take part in any forum which is established.  It would be important for such a forum to represent all stakeholders in the banking sector, and there are many of them.  It should also be chaired and managed in an effective way to ensure the forum considers all aspects of banking.  In that regard, we have competitors that are not banks operating in the area of banking.  It is important, therefore, that we have a level playing field when we come to think about banking services and approaches to how we offer such services to our customers.  I reiterate that the banking sector is at the core of any properly performing economy and is an important part of it.  Therefore, we must ensure that our banking system survives and thrives.  I do not mean thrive in the sense of shareholders benefiting, but thriving in a way which will mean that we will continue to be able to offer services to our customers in a way that makes sense to them.  We must make a return on those services, because doing so will enable us to lend more.  If we build more capital, we can lend more money.  That is the way it works.</p></speech>

The bank's non-performing loans, NPLs, stood at 30% four years ago.  We had reached long-term arrangements with customers regarding a significant portion of those NPLs, but those loans continued to be classified as NPLs.  As a bank, after interaction with all our stakeholders, we had a requirement to reduce those NPLs.

It was a performing portfolio and, therefore, slightly different to prior sales.  It was a portfolio created before the crisis.  Interest-only loans do not exist as products today, and the sale was connected with that situation.  It was more suitable for those customers to be in a long-term securitisation vehicle rather than, in effect, being with us as a bank, given the requirements we have regarding the risk profile of an interest-only portfolio.</p></speech>

Turning to the utilisation of the &euro;155 million, that provision in itself is for a long-term situation, including the impact of Covid-19.  I mentioned in my opening comments that we provided 13,000 payment breaks.  Approximately 1,000 customers from that total of 13,000 continue to require forbearance.  Our view of, and thought process underpinning, that provisioning was that the numbers could have been higher than the 1,000 customers who have availed of this mechanism.  I suggest, therefore, that we are adequately provisioned regarding any potential losses in future.  However, such losses may not occur for several years as we continue to work with customers in respect of the resolution of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We took a careful and prudent approach concerning our provisioning.  Moving on to the business-----</p></speech>

We are very positive regarding the SME market.  It is a relatively new area of business for us, but it is one that we are growing in significantly.  To give some context in that regard, the half-yearly figures will show that we have drawn &euro;50 million for small businesses across the country and that is the same amount as we provided in the whole of last year.  Although in the market overall lending has fallen by about 23%, we will have doubled our lending.  We hope to have done many times what we have done thus far by the end of the year, as we continue to grow our team, our products and services and our support for those customers.</p> <p>  A major part of that undertaking has been the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, fund.  We have engaged with the SBCI and rolled out a &euro;50 million fund as part of its future growth loan scheme.</p><p>That was twice oversubscribed.  We see a huge opportunity in this market for us to step in and become a significant player in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in Ireland.  We look forward to that opportunity of supporting those customers in all the communities in which we operate right across the country.  Although the market has fallen this year, we see our business growing strongly.  We are continuing to invest in our people, technology and products.  It is a good opportunity for us to step up and support local small economies right across the country.</p></speech>

In other words, the credit structure does not suit their building model and as a result international investment funds come in and soak up that market to a certain extent.  What is the witnesses' experience of that?  Why is there a problem with the credit facilitation of small builders?</p></speech>

Our main sectors are agriculture, retail, wholesale, transport and manufacturing as opposed to building and construction.  We would have some construction on our books and are looking for businesses to support, particularly small builders and small construction businesses, but that is a very small part of our business because we are relatively new to the market.  The key sectors we support are in agriculture, retail, wholesale, transport and manufacturing.  We have been actively involved in those areas so far and construction has been a minor part of that heretofore.</p></speech>

We have ongoing engagement with the market with regard to putting forward our strategy and approach.

Ultimately, the front-line staff in the bank are the lenders but there are credit underwriting decisions around that.  The credit underwriting is centralised but the lenders at the front line assist the customer.  They are professional, qualified people and we have processes through which we bring the customer, whether that is for a new business or a customer in difficulty.  The front-line staff play a key role in advising customers, getting them ready and helping them.  We are supported by central colleagues, particularly in credit underwriting from a central perspective.</p></speech>

We understand the customer, we know the business and we understand the operators of those premises.  We make the decision on whether we lend, but then our credit underwriting team assesses that decision centrally from a credit risk perspective.  It is very important that lenders on the front line understand their customers and businesses with which they are dealing.  From a credit risk perspective, we get support centrally to manage that at a portfolio level.</p></speech>

That is centred around upgrading our app and providing more opportunities for customers to self-serve by undertaking more day-to-day or routine transactions.  That is something we will be bringing to the market next year so we will be at market standard in that respect.  With regard to services like Revolut or N26, there have been discussions at BPFI level around creating a payment platform that would provide functionality like that of Revolut, for example.  That is something on which we are working at an industry level.

On the Central Bank's lending rules, there is flexibility in the loan-to-income limits.  We understand that banks have withdrawn the flexibility of moving 20% above the thresholds.  Is PTSB still operating under the guidance of the Central Bank?  Is it still facilitating customers who are outside the strict loan-to-income limits and is it using the flexibility that the Central Bank allows?</p></speech>

It has been in the public domain in recent weeks that we announced we could not provide any more exemptions at the moment.  This highlights that we have been supporting customers in this area by providing exemptions.  There has been demand for us to provide support for customers in this area.  We announced that we are in the process of using up our exemptions, particularly in the loan-to-income area, of those rules.  The situation is that we are out of those exemptions for the next number of months until we see how things go.  I will hand over to Mr. Farrell to provide some additional detail on that.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have to take a breather and see how volumes will go in the next number of months to see whether we get more capacity.  That shows that we are supporting customers through those exemptions and using them for what they should be to supply customers with support.</p></speech>

On the question the Chairperson asked - Mr. Crowley responded to it - about the platform that the Irish Banking and Payments Federation is looking at, which has already been struck down because of competition laws, I do not understand why PTSB and other banks are designing this new platform between the banks here when there is a European platform that the banks could opt into.  Why are the banks not opting into the European platform that is already there, that is, the single euro payments area, SEPA, instant credit transfer?  It has already been built and is across Europe.  It does not have to be done again.  People could transfer money, as is done through Revolut, if banks sign up to this.  Why are the banks creating their own platform and running into all these difficulties with the competition authority as a result?</p></speech>

It is just a theory, at the minute, that was struck down by the competition authority.  Can Mr. Farrell explain the differences between what PTSB and other banks are planning and the European system.  Do not tell me that it can do person-to-person payments, because that already exists in Europe, which all banks in Europe can opt into. It allows money to be sent from Germany to France, or wherever.  The banks here are creating one system for Irish banking, which is not good because we want new competitors and there is already the issue with Insurance Ireland in terms of the commission's findings about cartel-like activities.  What is the difference?  Why do we not sign up to SEPA instant instead of creating something different?  What is it that SEPA instant does not provide, which PTSB and the other banks want to provide to customers here?</p></speech>

The platform and service are to be provided by a company called Sia, which is an Italian company.  The intention is that when the European system is at a level that we can plug into, this would become part of the European-wide system.  We want to get it off the ground.  The functionality that is available to customers in this system is significant and it is something that we want to develop in an Irish market.  The intention - going back to Deputy Doherty's point - is to plug into a European-wide system at a time when it is ready.</p></speech>

My final question refers to the issue Deputy Farrell raised about mica.  Can Mr. Crowley elaborate on his comments?  Being helpful to customers can mean ten different things.  It can mean low interest rates.  It can mean forbearance in terms of mortgages.  The core issue here is what was expected by my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, and I when we wrote to the banks, and by the MICA Action Group at the time.  We were looking for PTSB and other banks to support the redress scheme by contributing to it, but they refused to do so.  Does Mr. Crowley foresee a scenario whereby there would be a contribution from the bank as a result of the mica redress scheme?</p> <p>  Can Mr. Crowley explain how a loan for a mica affected property is classified on the books of PTSB?  Let us be clear on this.  We have seen that one third of homes that applied for the scheme in Donegal need to be demolished, therefore, their asset value is zero.  Some of those assets are secured by PTSB loans.  How are those loans classified on the books of PTSB?</p><p>Has the fact that the assets are now valueless triggered an impairment review?  How is PTSB dealing with those assets and what are its obligations with regard to reporting?  There are clear obligations for impairment of loans.  One of those obligations relates to cases where the value of the assets that are secured on the loan drops, and in these cases the value has, unfortunately, dropped significantly.</p></speech>

He mentioned that he heard my response to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  That response centred around the fact that at an industry level, there is an engagement through the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, BPFI, with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage around the scheme that will be put in place.  We understand that scheme may change but, as I understand it from the BPFI, we are not aware of the details.  There is absolute acceptance that PTSB must play its part by supporting customers who, for reasons beyond their own control and creation, have been affected by this issue.  We have experience of cases where customers were partially or fully impacted by the pyrite issue.  We moved to support those customers directly.</p> <p>  I also mentioned that we are engaging with some customers on their position, particularly through our Letterkenny branch.  I am not aware of any customers who have been exposed to mica by way of their classification but I can come back to the Deputy on that point.  If he wants, I can engage directly with him on any impacted customers in his constituency or elsewhere.  I would be happy to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021062300002#J00300"><p>The classification of those loans would be important.  The reason I make that point is the State is about to ensure, through a significant amount of spending, that those assets are restored to their original value.  That is of considerable benefit to PTSB and other banks.  Unfortunately, what I am hearing from Mr. Crowley is that the support the bank will provide, if we look at the pyrite scheme, relates only to forbearance, dealing with interest-only at a time when the work is being done, or soft loans in terms of rental accommodation and other things.  It is not about contributing to the cost of restoring assets on the bank's balance sheets.  As the CEO of PTSB, does Mr. Crowley believe the bank has a role in that domain?  Has it a role in making a financial contribution to assist the overall amount that is to be spent on this scheme to assist these homeowners?</p></speech>

Take a hypothetical example where we have loaned &euro;100,000.  A contribution could be around discussing that liability and what that debt should be, given the underlying collateral value, the value of the house or the fact that the house itself must be demolished.  I assume from what the Deputy has said that he would then be looking for a further contribution from the bank to the customer, above and beyond the liability a customer may have as a mortgage.  That would have to be discussed at an industry and wider level to ensure a common approach across all banks.  I would happily discuss it.</p></speech>

With regard to a contribution, that deserves a wider discussion and debate.  I cannot answer for PTSB alone in that respect.  I must think about the wider industry and the connection we have with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The engagement should revolve around any mortgage debt that exists now.</p></speech>

It would give us some insight as to where that is going, what is happening and what the plan is.</p> <p>  Tracker mortgages are another issue.

From our interaction, it is clear that the Synch Payments programme needs to be explained to the committee in greater detail.

That is the nature of the interaction we have with regard to the tracker mortgage product.  We have some occasional interaction with customers who contact us directly but it is primarily in those two areas.</p></speech>

It severely disabled a number of systems and necessitated the complete shutdown of the HSE's network.  We have been working to recover systems ever since.  The HSE response contains four stages.  First, the containment phase, which is now completed.  Second, the inform phase, which is also complete, but the task is ongoing.  Daily and weekly briefings are being provided to multiple stakeholders.  Third, the assess phase, which involves the restoration of services and eradication of ransomware from the network.  That phase is continuing.  Finally, the remedy phase, which involves strengthening our network against future cyber threats.  That phase is continuing.</p> <p>  The restoration process and the accompanying due diligence exercise is necessarily taking some time.  Although we can effectively decrypt data, that is only one element of it.  The malware must also be eradicated.  Decryption takes much longer than the original encryption, and eradication involves additional tasks to ensure that the perpetrators have no access route back into our systems.  We have worked with specialist cybersecurity firms and our application vendors to develop solutions to improve the efficiency of the decryption and eradication process, and it is showing dividends.  So far, 75% of our server estate has been decrypted and 70% of our end-user devices are now available.</p> <p>  While the architecture of our network dictates a certain initial sequence to the restoration of services, the majority of our sequencing decisions are clinically informed.  We are focusing our efforts on restoring the systems most critical to patient care in the first instance.  From a technical standpoint, many systems are now operational again, but restoring interoperability between systems and sites is ongoing.  That continues to impact on service delivery.  Characteristically, our staff across the country have worked extremely hard to keep services going in the face of the enormous challenges presented by the cyberattack and ensuing shutdown.  They are doing this at a time when our health system is experiencing very high demand for services.  I want to particularly thank staff for their hard work and commitment to the delivery of services to the public at this time.  Our IT staff, supported by the Defence Forces and contracted IT experts, have maintained a relentless schedule.  This continues seven days a week.</p> <p>  There is no underestimating the damage that this cyberattack has caused.  There are financial costs, certainly, but there will, unfortunately, also be human costs.  I assure members and the public that we are doing everything possible to restore the systems.  I must also caution that it will likely take months before systems are fully restored.  Accordingly, I must ask the public for continued forbearance and understanding.</p> <p>  I am pleased to say that the Covid-19 vaccination programme is making really good progress.  We administered 340,000 vaccinations last week and GPs have administered close to 1.5 million vaccines.  Our other vaccination channels, namely, community-based vaccination teams, acute hospitals, ambulance and community pharmacies, are also functioning very effectively indeed.</p> <p>  We have 39 vaccination centres in place.  Over 3.7 million vaccines have been administered.  Over 2.3 million people have now received a first dose, or single dose, of the vaccine and over 1.3 million have received a second dose, or single dose.</p><p>Our key objective in prioritising vaccine cohorts is to protect the most vulnerable.  It is apparent, given the major drop in hospitalisations and mortality, that we are achieving this.</p><p> It is probably accepted by everyone that the health and well-being of mothers and babies has been at the heart of maternity visit restrictions, which I accept are a significant burden.  Hospitals must apply infection prevention and control measures in a manner appropriate to the physical infrastructure that they have.  We have provided guidance on partner access as I will outline.  Maternity services should facilitate a minimum of a 30 minute visit daily.  The partner should be facilitated during labour while the woman is in the labour ward.  It may not be possible to facilitate women in multi-occupancy antenatal wards before they go to the labour ward.  Partners should be facilitated at the anomaly scan and any other visit that may involve communications of emotional significance.  Parents should be facilitated in the national neonatal intensive care unit, NICU.  Given the improved Covid-19 situation, we recently asked all maternity hospitals and units to review their approach again.  This week, the national women and infants health programme is meeting with the clinical leads of the six maternity networks.  Subject to infrastructure limitations, I am confident that the least restrictive approach possible will be adopted.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the great work that they are doing with the cyberattack, which had not been planned for.  The vaccination roll-out programme is going well.  I acknowledge the work of Mr. Damien McCallion in leading the vaccination programme.  It has gone well.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Reid estimate the cost of the cyberattack to date and what it will be in the future?  I suspect it might be as much as &euro;500 million.  What is the cost for the companies engaged?  Did the HSE use a particular country's expertise with regard to this attack when getting support from other countries?</p> <p>  Is any interruption to supply for the vaccination programme envisaged in the next couple of weeks?  Will the supply that has been committed to be honoured?  What target will the HSE achieve by the end of July?  Are difficulties with supply envisaged?  Is Mr. Reid confident that the supply lines that have been agreed will be honoured?</p></speech>

Regarding the cyberattack and cost, there are a few aspects for now and the future, as the Senator said.  We will incur a number of costs in the short and medium term.  As the Senator described, much technical work will have to be carried out on the network and infrastructure.  There are capital costs to replace a number of devices across our networks which we believe it would not be best practice to leave on the network with the new controls that we will put in place.  There are also capital costs where we will need to and will take the opportunity to upgrade some of our key systems, such as national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS, our radiology system, to bring them up to a higher standard.  Third party costs, as the Senator mentioned, relate to technical expertise that we have engaged including some of the best technical experts from a range of specialist providers that we have engaged in the country.  As the Senator rightly said, we have also engaged international expertise, primarily the international organisation in the USA, Mandiant, which is working on the decryption process.  It is a world leader in malware and ransomware recovery.  It has been working with us since the cyberattack.  There are costs across a range of providers.</p> <p>  We will have to incur costs in the future, considering the scale and size of our networks.  I worked on networks previously in different organisations.  Many organisations have a 24-hour monitoring centre, sometimes called a service operation centre or network operation centre.  Due to the scale of the network, we will need to put in place a security operation centre to monitor our network much more comprehensively for 24 hours.  We will take the opportunity to update many of our Microsoft applications to Microsoft 365 and a significant cost will be associated with that.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct.  We do not have figures for some of the clinical costs, service recovery, better local IT security, and strengthened resources, capacity and capability across our organisation.  In the short to medium term, it will cost significantly over &euro;100 million to get through this process and we are working on the medium and longer-term impacts.  It is clear, if one looks back at the previous three years, that we invested approximately &euro;82 million in malware and security protection, and a number of associated actions.  We have an old legacy network in the HSE.  It needs investment for security and protection of data in the future.  We will learn many lessons from this, from reports that we will get through this process, but ultimately it is a legacy network.</p></speech>

The Senators may be familiar with the actions we have taken.  Just a few days after the attack, we secured the strongest High Court order that can be achieved, which applies to any persons known or unknown who would share or provide information to a platform.  Social media platforms are working well with us and have since the start.  We became aware of one publication, which had set out some redacted data.  We secured those data through the order and the co-operation of that publication.  Those data included details of 520 patients and some corporate information related to procurement contracts.  We have worked with the Data Protection Commissioner and have engaged in a process with all the patients concerned.  We are not aware of any further publication or sharing of information but we can never be certain because of the nature of the ransomware attack that we were subject to.</p></speech>

Last week, more than 340,000 vaccines were administered.  We have a good supply line for the next two weeks from Pfizer and a committed supply from Moderna.  There will be two more weeks of more than 300,000.  In July, based on the national immunisation advisory committee's, NIAC, recommendations on what vaccines we can utilise with which age cohorts, we are down to just Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines, unless and until there is a change regarding the use of Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines.  It would mean that our supply for July would revert back to what had been the projected levels of approximately 190,000 from Pfizer and some from Moderna, coming to just over 200,000 per week and approximately 840,000 for July.</p><p>The latter is what was projected and committed to.  We had extra supplies for these three weeks because of a process engaged in by the EU to accelerate some of the deliveries from Pfizer from quarter 3 into quarter 2.  We did benefit from that.  Ultimately, we revert to the projected supply lines in July from the two mRNA vaccines.</p></speech>

I commend the HSE and Mr. Reid and staff across all of our health services on their work in what has been an horrendous year and a half, from Covid to the cyberattack.  Staff have gone above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that people get the best services that can be provided.  It is a very difficult time, but Mr. Reid will understand the frustration of Members of the Oireachtas regarding access to information.  There is an understanding that the cyberattack interrupted access to information.  That is accepted.  I welcome that Mr. Reid is here and that parliamentary questions to the Department of Health have resumed.  A lot of work remains to done in the context of repairing the damage caused by the cyberattack.</p> <p>  I welcome the lifting of restrictions in respect of maternity visits and people accompanying their expectant partners.  That is a huge relief to many.  I am taking Mr. Reid and the HSE at their word in terms of the direction that has been given to maternity hospitals.  We very much hope those restrictions will be eased and we will see consistency across all maternity hospitals.  That is good news.</p> <p>  I first want to pick up on the cost of the cyberattack.  I accept that Mr. Reid may not yet know the full cost in this regard because it is a moving feast and there are many different parts to it, including the medical cost, the human cost and the financial cost.  In terms of the financial cost, Mr. Reid mentioned &euro;100 million.  Does that relate to 2021?</p></speech>

I welcome that budget 2021 contains a commitment to increase acute bed capacity by 1,152 and to put in place an additional 66 ICU beds, 1,200 community and, I think, 1,600 additional staff but not all of that has been delivered.  Can I take it that the commitment to capacity was baselined and that whatever funding is needed for the cyberattack will not come from those sources?</p></speech>

We are focused on doing all of that.  We have been impacted in terms of some of the services and capacity enhancements we wanted to make, but we have to operate within the 2021 service plan.  There is no rolling over of budgets.  It is a process in which we will engage again under the Estimates process in 2022.  Ultimately, from a HSE perspective, we are very committed to ensuring that the additional funding is committed to the areas referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid spoke about a security operations centre.  Does he envisage that it will up and running this year and is that cost built into the &euro;100 million or will it be separate?</p></speech>

Our intention is to put something in place on an interim basis and to then go to full procurement later this year.  We will probably have two service operation centres initially, one from Mandiant and another from our existing antivirus supplier, and we will then go to tender for a proper security operations centre during the year.  It is our intention to do that this year.  All of the costs will probably not incur until next year but there will some cost for it this year.</p></speech>

If this centre is up and running it will add another dimension to cybersecurity.  We would all welcome that.  Mr. Reid stated, in the context of the cyberattack, that health staff are experiencing enormous challenges at a time when our health system is experiencing very high demand.  We heard from the INMO at the end of last weekend that overcrowding has become a feature again in our hospitals, particularly Letterkenny, Limerick and Cork hospitals, and some in some other hospitals as well.  A number of years ago the emergency department task force was established.  The INMO is represented on that task force.  I understand Mr. Reid also sits on that task force.  My understanding is that it has not met since January 2020.  Given the serious overcrowding being experienced in our emergency departments again, why has it been so long since the task force met?  Is Covid the reason for that?  Will Mr. Reid give a commitment that the task force will meet as soon as possible in order to put the focus back on what is happening in emergency departments again?</p></speech>

I first have to acknowledge that HSE staff are particularly exhausted.  It has been a horrendous 16 months for them.  On 13 May, we all felt we were seeing brighter days ahead and we were in a much better place, but a few hours later, on 14 May, we experienced a cyberattack.  I want to acknowledge what the staff have done.  It has been remarkable.  I have worked in private organisations for 30 years and I know that one would never see the commitment there that we have seen from the public and health services on this one.</p> <p>  On emergency departments, I will ask my colleague, Ms O'Connor, to make a few comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#D01600"><p>In the past number of weeks, emergency departments have experienced a significant increase in demand but we are relating that pretty much directly to the cyberattack.  As GPs do not have access to diagnostics, people are either presenting themselves or are being referred.  We have noted a much higher rate of ambulatory care in that people are being discharged home from the emergency department.  While attendances have gone up, the admission rate has not changed hugely in many sites.  Prior to the cyberattack, the patient flow was much improved.  We had seen an increase, but because of the some of the capacity the Deputy referenced earlier in terms of our hospital avoidance measures and egress options, we have seen the lowest ever rate of delayed discharges.  There are number of things that were working very well that have been impacted by the cyberattack.  We are seeing longer lengths of stay in hospitals and greater numbers of attendances.  As we improve the flow again and things settle down post the cyberattack, we would envisage going back to those lower levels.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Reid's point that health services staff have been through a very difficult time and have gone above and beyond the call of duty.  It is unbelievable what those on the front line and elsewhere in the health service have done over the past while.  It would be wise if the emergency department task force met as soon as is possible notwithstanding all of the other challenges.  If there is a particular problem in some hospitals, whatever the reason, it would be useful if the task force were to meet.</p> <p>  I have two more questions for Mr. Reid.  The first is in regard to student nurses and midwives in placements.  There was a commitment to pay them &euro;100 and that was to be backdated.  My understanding, having engaged with the INMO, is that not all students have been paid.  I do not know if that is down to the cyberattack or if there is some other reason for it.  Whatever the reason, voluntary hospitals appear to be more on top of making the payments than is the case with acute hospitals run by the HSE.</p><p>I ask Mr. Reid to respond to that.</p><p> Mr. Reid gave figures earlier for the vaccine roll-out.  We all welcome that more people are getting vaccinated, which is really good news.  The harm associated with Covid is significantly reducing because of the vaccine roll-out, which is something we should all celebrate.  Mr. Reid spoke about the supply of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines over the coming months.  I ask him to give us the figures for the Janssen vaccine.  The last time Mr. Reid appeared before the committee, the Minister had said that the worst-case scenario for June was about 60,000 doses of the Janssen vaccine, with the best-case scenario being 230,000.  My understanding is we might have got about 70,000.  We were expecting very significant amounts of the Janssen vaccine in July.  Again, my understanding is that will be at the lower end of the expectation.  We know the Janssen vaccine is also being made available to pharmacists.  I ask Mr. Reid to give us the breakdown on the Janssen vaccine and to outline the status of payments to student nurses and midwives.</p></speech>

I am not aware we have had particular issues with payments.  It certainly has not been escalated, but we will take that away because we are committed to those payments.</p> <p>  I will shortly ask Mr. McCallion to come in.  I think the Deputy outlined it correctly.  The range was a potential 470,000 where the best case was 235,000 from Janssen for June and the worst case was 60,000.  Realistically, we will get fewer than 80,000 doses delivered in June.  There will be much smaller deliveries in July, probably in excess of 70,000.  I will ask Mr. McCallion to confirm those.</p></speech>

The balance is with pharmacies now for the over-50s.  About 60,000 doses have gone out.  We have received one delivery.  As Mr. Reid said, the original forecast in June was for approximately 470,000.  Because of manufacturing problems in the US, that was revised down to a best case of 235,000 and a worst case of 60,000.  I would anticipate it being closer to the worst-case scenario based on the recent feedback from Janssen.  We will see how the usage of it works out in pharmacies.  We will have some more deliveries to assist the pharmacies if needs be and if they have additional demand in June.  As Mr. Reid mentioned earlier, based on the current guidance, the Janssen vaccine would not be available to us for use within the programme beyond that period.</p></speech>

I can only imagine that the domestic version of what the HSE has been through is the equivalent of losing electricity and Wi-Fi.  From an Oireachtas point of view, I appreciate all the efforts it has made to maintain contact.  Time is too short to go into it here, but it is really appreciated.</p> <p>  When will the app be operational again and carrying contemporary data?</p></speech>

People like me log into the app every day.</p> <p>  Whom are the pharmacists vaccinating?  I have heard locally in my constituency of instances where they have a stockpile and the over-50s seemed to have already been dealt with.  Who, typically, would contact a pharmacist?</p></speech>

As Mr. McCallion has said, the Janssen supply has gone out to those.  They are specifically focused on people aged over 50 who have not at this stage taken up the offer of the vaccine.  We estimate approximately 150,000 people aged 50 and over have not.  That vaccine is specifically for those people.  The process in the pharmacies is such that they need to book a few people together before opening a vial.  They need to arrange appointments for about five people at a time.  We have early indications of a reasonable uptake.  We do not have full numbers just yet.  To answer the Deputy's question specifically, it is for the over-50s who have not availed of the vaccine to date and who have not registered on the portal.</p></speech>

In the past 24 hours we have been inundated with contacts from constituents who knew the HSE officials were due to appear before the committee today.  This is a further chapter in the kinds of emails we have been getting for months from expectant mothers and their husbands and partners.  The email states:</p> <blockquote> 	Dear John, <br /><br />I'm emailing while lying in a hospital bed in a maternity hospital, not at all where I want to be, but unfortunately, I'm experiencing some pregnancy complications and require hospital care and monitoring.  I'm alone.  I'm lonely.  I'm scared.  I'm vulnerable.  I'm anxious.  I'm angry.  I'm confused.  I'm not hopeful...<br /><br />I sat in there corridor today and watched people come and go alone.  Partners carry bags to the door and kiss you good-bye.  It is really hard and unfair...<br /><br />Today I watched someone deliver devastating news to their family in a car park, family members standing around crying and going through the worst moment while right beside them delivery trucks were coming and going, builders coming and going and new parents were loading their babies into cars. </blockquote> <p>While I appreciate Mr. Reid responding to us in his opening statement, I do not think it is strong enough to say that the HSE has recently asked all maternity hospitals and units to review their approach again.  Aside from the obvious issues he replied to, the CMO has said there is no good reason partners cannot accompany pregnant women either to prenatal appointments or in labour.  How many hospitals are not complying with this?  The Minister is getting all the flak for this.  Much of the content of the emails is directed personally at him.  Based on what I have heard at our parliamentary party meetings, I know neither the Minister nor the Taoiseach could do anything more than they are doing.  How many maternity hospitals are affected?  How many are complying and how many are not?  How long will the review take?  What are the obstacles?</p></speech>

Nobody is more aware and conscious about providing compassionate care for mothers and babies than the HSE along with our medical and clinical teams.  The HSE has a great history of doing that.  We need to do things very differently to ensure infection prevention and control.  Many of our 19 maternity hospitals are very old, with old hallways and antenatal rooms.  They are not built for dealing with infection prevention and control measures in a pandemic.  It is important to acknowledge that the infrastructure we have can expose people to risk.</p> <p>  We gave direction for four areas where we wanted to see consistency.  As they are listed in the opening statement, I will not go through them.  On those four areas, there are 19 maternity hospitals and as of last Thursday, 16 were fully working through and compliant with those measures.  Three were not, which we-----</p></speech>

They have put in place workarounds to try to support that based on the infrastructure they have.  I will make one final comment and then pass over to Dr. Henry.  Separately, there are emergency situations, aside from the four areas I referred to, where a woman might be getting difficult news and we need to ensure those situations are treated compassionately.</p><p>Dr. Henry is leading that dialogue with consultants.  I ask him to make a few comments.</p></speech>

There was emerging evidence, as we know, that Covid-19 had a particularly serious impact on those women in later pregnancy who were hospitalised.  We know this from the information that came through from our healthcare system and those abroad concerning stillbirths and placentitis.  These are exactly the kinds of risks we were trying to avoid with these measures.  Thanks to the collapse in community incidence and the vaccination programme generally, we have a much safer society and much safer hospitals than we had in January when these measures were in full force.</p> <p>  In addition to compliance with the four areas listed in the opening statement, we will amend the guidance this week to look at attendance in early pregnancy assessment units, which women with early pregnancy problems attend for scanning.  Sometimes difficult news must be conveyed in these units so in recognition of that, we are looking at re-introducing visiting rights.</p> <p>  If I may, I will address two other areas.</p></speech>

One is to provide a buffer.  With the Moderna mRNA vaccine, for those vaccines that have been administered, we must keep an equivalent second dose but also second doses that are due for the following week.  We administer well over 90% of vaccines that we get in any given week, including last week, within that week.  The figure has been running at about 96% and that is tracked regularly.  We do not keep a stockpile.  The only vaccines we keep are specifically set out in the guidelines for Moderna and those tools that are due for each week.</p></speech>

To address one other factor, on the timing of deliveries, the numbers have been in the mid-90s in percentage terms every week in terms of distribution and administration within seven days.</p></speech>

The Chief Medical Officer has said that anybody under 25 years who has not been vaccinated cannot travel.  That is a big blow for the cohort of 18 to 25-year-olds.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is beavering away on a pilot antigen programme for universities and third level colleges.  Given that universities and third level institutions will return roughly on 1 October, that means in August and September we could expect a total of 2 million vaccines to be administered.  When can third level students expect to be vaccinated the first time if delivery goes as expected?</p></speech>

The first dose will be administered in June-July and the second dose will be administered in July-August, broadly speaking and based on supply.  For people in their 20s, it will be August, into September.  Those aged between 18 and 20 years would follow on from that.  Again, that will be the end of August, early September and maybe the end of September nudging into early October but again that depends on supply.</p></speech>

In every week of the vaccination programme since 26 December, we have had interruptions in deliveries.  In fairness to Pfizer and Moderna, they have been the firmest and strongest throughout.  All our forecasts must have big qualifiers.</p></speech>

The indications are relatively good with regard to fighting this terrible pandemic in Ireland.  The virus seems to be retreating but we cannot let our guard down.</p> <p>  The vaccine roll-out has been a huge logistical challenge but it has gone very well.  The vaccination programme is age orientated.  Does Mr. Reid, in hindsight, think it was a mistake to leave the cohort of 60 to 69-year-olds vulnerable through the roll-out of the AstraZenica vaccine?  I ask because people in their mid-40s will be vaccinated well before people who are 69 years old.  Was that a mistake?</p></speech>

I will make a brief comment on his opening comments about vaccines.  We certainly are in a much stronger position than we could have expected in terms of the benefits we are seeing from the vaccination programme, both in reduced hospitalisations and visits to ICU.  As of last night, we had 39 hospitalisations, of whom 13 were in ICU.  Contrast that with the dark days of January when there were 2,020 in hospital and 212 people in ICU.  We are seeing the benefits, including in the public mood.</p> <p>  Our experience and that of the public is that every time we think we are ahead of the virus, whether that was last summer or Christmas, it has a tendency to bite back.  The immediate concern is the Delta variant.  We are seeing in the percentage rise in cases, not just in Ireland but in European countries and cities, a very prevalent surge in the Delta variant.  There is no reason to expect that Ireland will be any different or that we will not see a surge in Delta variant cases.  That is a trend we are beginning to see and it is a concern.  Notwithstanding that, we are in a much stronger position than we might have expected.</p> <p>  On vaccines for the 60 to 69 years cohort, we take all of our administration of vaccines guidance from the national immunisation advisory committee.  It gives guidance to the CMO who makes recommendations to the Government and we comply with all of that.  In fairness to NIAC, it takes the best world evidence and monitors that carefully daily and weekly.  It continues to do that.  The guidance and advice at that stage was that AstraZenica was suitable to be administered to people above the ages of 50.  The risks that were prevalent at that stage were to population ages below that.  That was the process then.</p> <p>  In terms of the timeframe, it had been, if the Deputy recalls, the administration of a second dose was moved from 12 weeks to 16 weeks.  That interval has now moved back to eight weeks.  We have a programme in place whereby last week alone, almost 100,000 people were given their second dose of AstraZenica.  This applies to about 450,000 people in total.  The process will be accelerated and instead of a nine-week programme, it will be a five-week programme.  Everybody in all the age groups that received AstraZenica should have received the second dose by the week commencing 19 July.  That accelerates the process and we will increasingly see people in the 60 to 69 years cohort.  We are vaccinating by age so the vast majority of the people who received the second dose last week should have been in that age cohort.</p></speech>

The Delta variant is a cause for concern, particularly in Britain where the government has delayed easing restrictions.</p><p>How concerned is Mr. Reid by the fact that many young workers will not be vaccinated in any way when the economy, and particularly the hospitality industry, is opening?  What is his opinion in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#G00200"><p>I have two things to say on that.  The way the process works is that the guidance to the Government as to potential impacts, concerns or recommendations regarding the opening the economy will come through the CMO and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  That is the process.  From the HSE's perspective, we are obviously keenly focused on the impacts on hospitalisation and ICU admissions and the impacts on our hospital service in general.  After every wave of this virus, we have suffered significant impacts not only on Covid care, but on the care services we provide more widely.  Our concerns relate to sickness, illness, hospitalisations and their impact.  There is certainly evidence emerging from Public Health England demonstrating the impact of the variant, particularly on those people who have not been vaccinated or who have not been fully vaccinated.  The HSE has two key messages.  The first is that we want to monitor things closely because we cannot let what happened in January happen again, where hospitalisations reached over 2,000 and when more than 200 people were in our ICUs.  This had an impact on an already exhausted healthcare staff.  That is what we in the HSE will be watching.  NPHET will provide advice with regard to opening up and the Government will make the ultimate decision.</p></speech>

Like other Deputies, I have received a plethora of quite distressing emails from people in difficult situations.  The guidelines are welcome but it seems to be arbitrary as to whether certain hospitals have adopted them.  Surely we have reached a stage at which the adoption of these guidelines facilitating people visiting their loved ones in maternity hospitals should not be so arbitrary.  Judging by some of the emails we are getting, that seems to be the case.  I would like to hear Mr. Reid's comments as to the arbitrary nature of the adoption of the guidance which the HSE is supporting, as it does not seem to have been implemented by particular hospitals.  People are having different experiences.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Lahart earlier, nobody is more compassionate than the members of our healthcare teams all across the country, particularly those involved in the care of women, infants and babies.  While we can give direction, every risk has to be managed and assessed locally.  The ultimate focus of our clinical medical teams is on protecting women and babies during a pandemic.  We have to realise that we are not dealing with the same situation as in 2019.  We are dealing with matters in the context of a pandemic.  I will ask Dr. Henry to give some wider context.</p></speech>

As I was saying earlier, we are now expanding attendance based on increased confidence as to safety from the perspective of Covid-19 compared with confidence when these measures were introduced in January.  The areas at which we are particularly looking are those other areas in which distress is caused, including early pregnancy assessment units, the routine visits of those with high-risk pregnancies and emergency presentations at later stages of gestation.  We are planning to alter our visiting guidance this week to implement changes in these areas and to roll these out to all 19 units over the next week or two.</p></speech>

They remain steadfast in their objectives regardless of what happens and that kind of consistency is greatly appreciated.  I have a couple of questions.  How many minutes do I have?  I have some anyway.  With regard to the various age cohorts, vaccination has obviously not yet started in some, while the vaccination of others began some time ago.  Have any gaps become obvious in, for example, the cohort over 60 or the cohort over 70?  Are there any patches that might be vulnerable in the event of an upsurge in the Delta variant?</p></speech>

It is leading by any European or world standards.  The level of take-up in those over 80 is practically 100%.  It is approximately 97% in the cohort aged 70 and older.  As one walks down the age groups, including the cohort over 50, the take-up level is higher than 87%.  The take-up has been really strong.  Our campaign continues.  Those in the cohorts to which we have administered vaccines can still register on the portal and people from those age groups are still doing so.  As of today, the portal is open to those aged 36.  We still see people in the over-50 group and other age groups registering on the portal.  We encourage people to do that.  As my colleague, Mr. McCallion, said earlier, vaccination for those aged over 50 who have not had a vaccine administered is now available through the pharmacies.  Overall, the uptake to date has been extremely strong across all age cohorts.  We are also seeing strong numbers of registrations among the cohort aged 35 and older every day.</p> <p>  Nobody will be left behind.  We do not want anybody to be left behind and we will continue with our communications to encourage everybody to come through.  With regard to the Delta variant, we will be calling people for their second vaccination and we really encourage everyone to ensure they come forward for it.  The highest levels of protection against the Delta variant are reached after the second dose across all vaccine types.</p></speech>

For example, the approach right now focuses on our testing centres, which are still available on the basis of referrals from GPs, which have been impacted during the Covid pandemic, but which are also now available for walk-in testing.  As will have been seen in the last few days, we have also put in place pop-up centres in areas where prevalence of the virus is high.  That continues.  The increased capacity in our testing, swabbing and laboratory facilities continues.  We have retained our resourcing in respect of contact tracing, should another surge emerge.  Our surge processes in respect of hospitals have been maintained.  There are high levels of demand right now.  This is not a time at which we would welcome another surge but the process our IT consultants worked through during January and throughout every wave has been exemplary.  They have been able to surge extra capacity and extra resourcing.  It is certainly not a process through which we would like to go again.</p></speech>

From our perspective, we have mobilised whatever level of vaccine we have been able to get our hands on.  Last week alone, we administered more than 52,000 doses on four of the seven days.  Last Thursday, we administered almost 60,000 vaccines.  Yesterday alone, we administered 54,000.</p><p>We will mobilise to whatever the level of supplies, that will be possible to get, may be.  That will include a combination of our vaccination centres, our GPs, pharmacies, National Ambulance Service, and our community vaccination teams across the country.  We will mobilise to whatever the level of supplies may be and that has always been our commitment.  In fact, it has been more than that.  It has been to mobilise and deliver them efficiently to the percentage levels that have been seen, the high 90s in percentage terms in any given week.  We now have vaccination centres with significant levels of capacity should further supplies become available.</p></speech>

Have we learned sufficiently from this attack to be in a position to prevent a repetition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#H00300"><p>I will say a few things on that, and I will call on my colleague Mr. Thompson, from what we have seen of the restoration process.  If one stands back from this, it is fair to say that there were obvious vulnerabilities because the ransomware attack happened.  What we are seeing across many organisations, not just health providers but private financial providers, is the increasing occurrence of these attacks.  We had this on our risk register going back, in terms of potential impacts, and we had taken a number of actions to protect against it.  I have no doubt that from this process, and the reports we will get on the assessment of the impact, there will be significant learnings about further protections we and, in fact, the whole of Government and no doubt, Departments, can put in place.  Suffice to say, we and the world are dealing with highly complex, highly sophisticated, highly skilled criminal organisations that have the capacity and due to increased investments from various sources, including ransoms paid, to increase their capacity and capabilities.  That is what we are up against and the whole world needs to raise its game around cyber controls.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Thompson, to give an example of an immediate learning on this.</p></speech>

Hardening means that if people attempt to get in the system, we take the approach that they are already in and we consider how to stop them from moving around and how to deal with.  We are adding the security operation centre, as I said, and we have added additional network tools to monitor and manage the network.  We will look at all the e-risk points - the points where people can leave our network - to make sure they are as secure as we can make them.  We are taking the learnings and embed them as we go through our recovery phase.</p></speech>

It is looking at any data or information we have access to.  That is in the hands of the intelligence agency.  To be straight, to my knowledge, there have been no prosecutions, but that is in the hands of the State's intelligence agency.</p></speech>

I have questions on three areas, namely, third level students, children with cancer, and maternity restrictions, which I am sure the witnesses will receive further questions on after I conclude.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the vaccination of third level students in August and September.  I have been contacted by a number of students who are going abroad either on the Erasmus programme or for international studies.  Some of the institutions they are going to have said that the students cannot attend unless they can prove they have been vaccinated, otherwise they will not be able to attend on-campus.  Are there plans for those students?  It is not an enormous cohort but there will be a number of students who, having paid and are ready, will not be able to go abroad or will have to delay going because they will not be vaccinated in time.  Has any thought been given to that situation?</p> <p>  I have a second question for Mr. McCallion in relation to children with cancer.  Children with cancer and their parents are still waiting to hear when vaccines will be made available to children aged 12 to 15.  I know the Pfizer vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, but there has been no word yet from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on this.  We are waiting on NIAC to give the go ahead.  Has the HSE given any consideration on how it will prioritise these high-risk patients in that age group, because they have been isolating for a long time and, obviously, the parents are extremely concerned about their children.  I will throw all my questions out and the witnesses can do as they will with them.</p> <p>  On the maternity restrictions, why are the risk assessments not publicly accessible despite the calls from Dr. Peter McKenna in April, and the HSE in May, to make them public?  Is there any further information as to why these risk assessments are not available?  On 10 May, Dr. Tony Holohan said that there should be a return to pre-pandemic partner access.  There still seems to be mixed messages on when that will happen.  Do the witnesses know when that is going to happen, whether it will be in the coming months or weeks?</p> <p>  The vaccination levels among maternity unit staff, and pregnant people and partners will affect restrictions.  Obviously, vaccination levels are extremely high among maternity staff and levels are climbing among pregnant people and their partners.  What is the current position of the HSE on the risk associated with partner attendance in maternity units, where other public health guidelines, such as social distancing and the wearing of personal protective equipment, are taken into account?  There was reference made in the guidelines that partners could not be allowed in for privacy reasons, I am sure the witnesses are aware of this.  That was never a reason in pre-pandemic times.  Therefore, why has privacy suddenly started to be referred to as a reason that pregnant peoples' partners need to be kept away from certain things, when that was not the case before the pandemic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.301" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#H00800"><p>I will make a few comments and they pass to my colleagues, Mr. McCallion and Dr. Henry.  On the first issue of third level students and their vaccination, it is worth reminding members of the committee and ourselves that the whole approach, in terms of the vaccination programme, has been to vaccinate those who are most vulnerable first, and it is working.  We started to programme based on NIAC advice, which was starting with residents and staff in long-term care facilities, moving on to healthcare workers, then people over the higher age groups and, indeed, medically vulnerable groups.  We should remain confident that this was the correct approach, that is what is working for Ireland and working for our vaccination programme.  There have been many calls throughout the programme to date, at the very early stages, the middle stages and now, to look to different groups at different stages.  We take our absolute advice, guidance and direction from NIAC and through the Chief Medical Officer and Government policy.  I reiterate that is has worked, it is working, and we should continue with it based on the process of working through the age groups.  It is based on limited supply and if we had a full supply, we would love to vaccinate all age cohorts together, but we must stick with what is working, and that is my very strong message to the committee.  I will pass to my colleague, Dr. Henry, on the visits question, and then to Mr. McCallion, if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.302" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#H00900"><p>We want to restore to the pre-pandemic levels but, as I said earlier, we are mindful of the particular risks in pregnancy and the evolving data, including that from the UK obstetric surveillance system, in March 2021, which looked at stillbirth rates.  The measures were brought in with significant reluctance during a time when there were high levels of community transmission and multiple outbreaks in hospitals.  We are in the happy position where we can release those incrementally.</p> <p>  Senator Hoey referred to the privacy issue.  Generally speaking, when women were in labour pre-pandemic, they had partners with them on the labour ward, but it was not always the case for a woman who may have been in suspect early-labour and was returned to a multi-occupancy antenatal ward, to have their partners in there, to give respect to other patients on the ward.  There is some degree of misunderstanding of what prevailed before the pandemic began.  As I said earlier, in response to one of the Senator's colleagues' question, we are now moving beyond those four areas.  We are trying to restore attendances to the areas of greatest need and that includes, pregnancy assessment units, high-risk pregnancy routine visits, and emergency presentation of late gestation.  We have changed the visiting guidelines this week accordingly and they will be implemented in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Senator Hoey mentioned it in terms of younger people from 12 to 15 years old.  We are not waiting for that.  We are anticipating something will come along which will be offered to that age group.</p> <p>  The factors we are looking at in terms of that age group are the best model for their vaccination - they are school-based children in the main - and factors such as subgroups within that.  If we can vaccinate a large group quickly, we have found that to be nearly as effective as trying to isolate numbers and then trying to extract those.  We look at all of those factors before we come up with a plan.  We are doing that planning through our planning team and national immunisation office, in parallel with the work going with NIAC on looking at the evidence and so on in terms of vaccinating, so that if a recommendation comes from NIAC, we have assessed the options and looked at the best way to do it.  That would include factors such as those Senator Hoey mentioned, such as young children who have particular medical conditions and have had to isolate for lengthy periods.  That would be part of the solution in terms of how we do it.</p> <p>  Ultimately, it could come down to the speed at which we can roll this out.  We have found if we can do it very quickly, it is often as quick to do that and to try to bring those people through, depending on the numbers, in specific ways.  That will be part of what we consider in any deployment plan for that 12 to 15 age group.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Reid, his colleagues and the entire HSE organisation for their colossal work over the past 15 months.  The vaccination programme has put it up to all critics.  It is very successful and ahead of schedule.  I congratulate them very much on where it is going.  It is a roaring success.</p> <p>  I will get into a number of questions.  In terms of partners accompanying expectant mothers at maternity hospitals, and I know the witnesses have been mentioning this in their contributions, but I understand from today onwards there will be some kind of uniformity guideline.  We believed something similar would happen five weeks ago and yet maternity hospitals, individually, decided how they would apply those guidelines in their contexts.  Will Dr. Henry outline to us how this will progress from here on?  What level of autonomy do they have and in what timeframe does he expect people to start changing their guidelines and becoming compliant with this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#J00600"><p>It is not from here on, in case there is a misunderstanding.  There have been several iterations of visiting policy corresponding to different levels of the pandemic.  The high levels of community transmission and the outbreak obviously led to severe restrictions.  Cases falling, hospitals becoming safer and the vaccination programme taking hold have allowed us to ease visiting restrictions.  It is under constant review.  I mentioned to Deputy Crowe's colleagues earlier that the most recent review this week is expanding beyond those four areas which are listed in the opening statement to additional areas.</p> <p>  We issued guidance.  We contacted all the hospitals.  There is, as has been mentioned, some variation based on infrastructure, which is understandable.  Some of these maternity units are quite old, with infrastructure which corresponds to another age when it comes to ideal infection prevention control measures.  Our principal aim is to keep women, babies and pregnancies safe.  That is of great importance to us given the risk we are now aware of, not just from Ireland but from abroad, to both women and pregnancies from Covid-19.</p> <p>  The most recent advice, which we will be altering this week, goes into those additional areas.  I will not repeat them again because I have stated them to the Deputy's colleagues.  We then follow up through our operations, working with Ms O'Connor and her colleagues through all those 19 maternity units and marking them against compliance with the latest iteration of our visiting guidance.  What we are trying to do is balance the sometimes competing requirements for the needs and rights of partners to attend with our similarly important need to protect women and pregnancies from Covid-19.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#J00700"><p>I respect everything Dr. Henry has said and it is good there is new guidance coming out today.  It is morally cruel to deny someone the opportunity to have a partner with them for those key appointments.  A medical doctor recently said on radio, which I thought was well put, that pregnancy and labour are medical conditions.  In most cases, but not all, the person is good health, and that needs to be stressed.</p> <p>  There are situations in which a maternity hospital is co-located with a medical hospital and there are complexities with that.  However, there needs to be uniformity here because there are so many expectant mothers - you would want to see the trail of emails which came in overnight - who are very stressed and worried, many of whom will even give birth today not knowing if their partners can be there for all parts of it or if their partners can attend key appointments if they are at a different stage of pregnancy.  It is morally cruel they are denied.  I hope the guidelines being issued will be taken up by all hospitals, because there is no political barrier to this.  There is no HSE barrier to this but, when it is broken down to management level at each hospital, there seems to have been different implementation and that has been regrettable so far.</p> <p>  This week, 99 years ago, signalled the burning of the Four Courts during the height of the Civil War and, with it, thousand of records were lost, burnt and are irretrievable forever.  I am delighted to see in the witness statement today approximately 70% of the records of the HSE files targeted in the malware attack have been decrypted and are again useable.  However, are there any files which have been damaged or encrypted which come under the Four Courts category, in that they will be lost, gone forever and irretrievable?  Do Mr. Reid and his cybersecurity analysts believe any files are in that bracket?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#J00800"><p>I will answer that and my colleague, Mr. Thompson, may want to add to it.  The 75% figure referenced by Deputy Crowe relates to the servers which have been restored.  He is correct in that they would include the data on those and 70% of the end-user laptops have been decrypted.  There is no doubt data were impacted throughout this whole process and across a range of our networks, which we have had to restore to the levels they were at.</p> <p>  We did have our backup data which we were able to restore in terms of further protection.  With regard to data which were extracted, which I touched on earlier on with one of the Deputies, we have one known incident of that in which records were published through an online publication.  Following a High Court order, we secured the recovery of those data.  The agency which published them redacted the data.  When we recovered the data, we were able to get the whole set of data.  There were 520 patient records in that, along with some other contractual corporate documents we had relating to contracts.  They have been recovered.  We feel we have secured the data, but we can never be certain if any of it is extracted.</p></speech>

If Mr. Reid will forgive me, I want to get one final question in.  HIQA stipulates all elderly residents in care centres should have a personal space of 7.4 sq. m around their bed.  This has me worried about St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis, that we will have a major loss of beds and the capacity to care.  It is a fabulous hospital with great staff and wonderful care.  My grandmother was there in her final days before she passed away.  Is there anything Mr. Reid can say on that?  We are in a more manageable phase of Covid-19.  That personal space stipulation came from HIQA and the HSE.  Is there anything more Mr. Reid can say on that, in terms of giving a bit of hope to the people who go to that hospital?</p></speech>

HIQA has set out certain conditions in terms of community nursing units and general elderly care places, with which we aim to comply.  It is challenging and in many cases it ends up in reduced bed capacity.  We have a capital investment programme for our community nursing units which sets out to strengthen the capacity or support in terms of being compliant, but in many cases it does mean reduced capacity.  I cannot comment specifically on the residential care unit Deputy Crowe has just mentioned.  I am happy if my colleague, Ms O'Connor, wants to add any further comments.</p></speech>

I will touch briefly on the maternity issue because confusing messages are going out to people.  Mr. Reid said 16 of the 19 units were following the guidelines on admission or the attendance of partners.  Is it possible for those 16 units to set that out in writing individually rather than it coming as a general statement from the HSE or Mr. Reid?</p><p>Can they be asked to set out the procedures in writing?  I am getting feedback from different units around the country that different sets of rules are being applied compared with what we are being told publicly.  I spoke to a medical person in recent days who had seen four patients where their respective partners are already vaccinated so there should not be any reason they could not be admitted.  Can that issue be clarified?  Can the 16 units which are following the overall guidelines issue a statement to that effect individually?</p><p> The cyberattack has resulted in a huge build-up of waiting lists for surgery and for many procedures.  Is it possible to expand the treatment purchase fund to deal with the backlog?  For instance, yesterday I heard of someone being advised to go to Northern Ireland for a hip operation although the same facilities are available in a private hospital in Cork within 30 miles of where they live.  It may not be available in a public hospital because of the priorities that they are giving.  What is being proposed to deal with that waiting list and trying to reduce the numbers waiting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#K00200"><p>I will make a brief comment on maternity first.  I will restate that we fully understand the stress that maternity visit restrictions has had on women and their partners and families.  We are doing everything possible to be as compassionate as we can while protecting young women and their babies as well.  That is the key driver for us and for all our clinical and medical teams across the country.</p> <p>  Dr. Henry will answer on specifics but we get returns from the 19 individual maternity hospitals on the implementation of the guidance document that Dr. Henry sent out nationally.  In fairness, I mentioned earlier that 16 of the 19 were fully compliant last Thursday.  The three that were not put in measures to be fully compliant for this week.  When I say a hospital is not compliant, it is not that those concerned are mischievously going out to be non-compliant.  They have certain conditions in their hospital where they find it difficult to find the risk balance between access and visits and infection prevention and control.  That is the rationale and the reason this happens.  </p> <p>  As for the waiting lists for surgery, with every wave we have, our waiting lists for people for various forms of surgery and elective care are affected.  The national service plan for this year has two funds, namely, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, of &euro;125 million and the access to care fund, which is about &euro;210 million.  We are working collaboratively with our colleagues in the Department of Health and with the Minister about an approach for the best use of those funds to address some of the waiting lists.  To be frank, it has been significantly impactful for us, particularly with the recent cyberattack.  It will involve a combination of using private capacity, using the NTPF, strengthening further capacity through the recruitment of consultants and other teams in our public hospitals and new ways of working that my colleague Ms Anne O'Connor has implemented during Covid, which involve many outpatient departments getting waiting lists in a very different way.  That will be the overall strategy we will agree with the Department.</p></speech>

We report nationally on the compliance.  In the four areas which were subject to the first revision, all 19 are now compliant.  There is no reason why we cannot ask hospitals to report as we did when we did the survey for the current visiting areas and report by hospital in the coming weeks, as we change the visiting guidance today.</p></speech>

That is why I want each hospital to issue its own statement.</p> <p>  Returning to the treatment purchase fund, I find it disturbing that someone can come in under the treatment abroad fund and get treatment.  While I acknowledge they have to pay in advance and are refunded, the same opening is not there for someone to go on the treatment purchase fund.  As a result, people are going out of the country although the treatment is available in this country.  It is something that needs to be looked at.</p></speech>

We are using about 800 bed days a week in private hospitals to support our system since the cyberattack.  That is predominantly related to things such as radiotherapy, cancer treatment and diagnostics, given the impact across our system.  We are looking at how we can maximise the use of both our public and private capacity, as Mr. Reid said.  We cannot stop people travelling if they want and clearly we have significant waiting lists, although prior to the cyberattack the waiting lists had started to come down both for inpatient day cases and for our scopes, but the outpatient list continued to grow.  We will not know until the data since the cyberattack come back what the impact of these five weeks has been.  We are working closely with private providers and are looking at how we can do this differently with the access to care fund for the rest of the year and into next year.</p></speech>

I compliment the staff members of the HSE on their work during the pandemic, particularly on the success of the vaccination programme which was always dependent on supply, as has been proven with the increased delivery of vaccines and the increase in patients who have been seen.</p> <p>  I am also going to touch on maternity services.  As others have said, we have been inundated with testimonies, which were sometimes heartbreaking, from expectant mothers, mothers who gave birth last year and some who have suffered heartbreaking situations where news around scans and anomalies was delivered in a very cold fashion because of Covid.  I will briefly read some testimony.  A lady called Stacey contacted me to say that partners are not visitors, fathers are not visitors and that she needs her husband to be there during labour and the post-natal period.  She asked that these restrictions be lifted, as this uncertainty is crippling.  Another lady, who lost a baby to stillbirth, wrote that not one more woman should ever have to walk the road she had walked alone.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#K00900"><p>This woman went on to give a two-page testimony of giving birth, stillbirth, and all that went with it.  It was heartbreaking.  Another lady wrote how women and their partners are looking for a return to pre-pandemic levels of access through the pregnancy journey.  She queried the distinction between full labour and active labour and stated that women in labour need support and advocacy whether they are 1 cm, 4 cm or 10 cm dilated.  This is the whole point.  I have spoken to officials in Galway on this point of how you define labour.  Once a woman goes into a maternity hospital and presents to give birth, her partner should be there with them at all stages, as well as for 12-week and 20-week scans in particular.  They do not know what news they are going to get.  Where they get difficult news, they need to have their partner present, no ifs or buts.</p><p> I know that at times doctors can become immune to problems because they see so many of them, and I understand that, but women and their partners need to be together for these heartbreaking situations they have to go through where they receive bad news - and even where they do not receive bad news and the woman is just delivery a baby.  Even the normal, successful delivery of a child is an emotional roller coaster for women and their partners, and the latter need to be present.  We need to see that in place in all our maternity hospitals - no exceptions, no ifs and no buts.  Whatever has to be done to ensure that this happens needs to be done.  That is not a question; those are just comments based on testimony.  There has been enough uncertainty.  We have seen the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  As I said, the women need to have their partners present and need the support and love of a partner, whatever about good news, certainly in the case of bad news.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.323" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021062300002#L00200"><p>I will go through the Senator's points.  I absolutely agree with him.  Our staff in the 19 maternity units want to be able to go back to a situation whereby partners can be full partners in every sense of the word during the whole process of childbirth, which, as the Senator says, is a difficult and anxious time.  It is mostly a happy time but sometimes, of course, as the Senator outlined, there are difficulties and bad news.  That is precisely why we are looking at this latest visitor guidance this week.  We are amending it to look at exactly those areas where there may be difficult news and particular anxiety, that is, those early pregnancy assessment units, people with high-risk pregnancies and people presenting in emergency situations in later pregnancy.  I mentioned earlier that nobody wanted to put in these restrictions but we were faced with overwhelming Covid disease and threat in January.  It threatened to destabilise our hospital system and, in fact, it did destabilise it.  There were multiple outbreaks in various settings.  Fifteen of those 19 units are co-located with general hospitals.  Those measures were put in place, as were the general visiting restriction measures, which also caused great distress to relatives and sick people in general hospitals and in nursing homes.  The measures were put in place in order to try to protect people as much as possible from the worst effects of this virus.  It is exactly those areas the Senator outlines that we are trying to focus on now as we return to some kind of normality.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned labour.  The practice has been, and the advice is very clear, that partners should be present in labour wards.  Sometimes women go back to antenatal wards after initial assessment.  Many of our units, which are not modern by any stretch of the imagination, are multiple occupancy wards and, as such, it was not the practice pre pandemic to have partners there constantly when other women occupy the wards.  What we are trying to standardise and to bring into practice, and what we have in those 19 units, is that a partner have every right to be present in the labour ward during labour.  What we are not able to commit to, however, based on the varying infrastructure of hospitals, is that people be present in the antenatal ward where it is a multiple occupancy ward because of the rights and privacy requirements of other women on that ward.</p> <p>  These are heartbreaking stories.  As I said, our staff, our working nurses and doctors, want to see pre-pandemic visiting practices return but they have had a very difficult few months themselves trying to keep women safe, to protect pregnancies and to protect women during what was certainly the worst surge of Covid-19 in January and February, during which we learned Covid is not without danger and risk to pregnancies and to women.</p></speech>

I accept the situation we were in post Christmas but we are in a much different situation now.  As I said, the heartbreaking testimonies we have seen over recent months cut to the core of life and death and expectant mothers' worry.  We therefore need to get back to whatever operated pre pandemic for expectant mothers.  They need to have that love and support of a partner for delivery and for scans.  Positive scans are fine, but you just do not know when you go in there what news you will get.  Again, reading the testimonies, where there is an anomaly, news may be delivered to women on their own, with no support.  They may be told to wait in a room or have to deliver news to their families in a car park.  It is unacceptable that that would be the way in which things operate in a hospital in this day and age.  I appreciate that Covid is the reason the restrictions are there, but for something as personal and as heartbreaking as this there needs to be a better system.  Cognisance needs to be taken of the delivery of the news and having partners there with the expectant mothers to provide that love and support and comfort.</p></speech>

I am listening to what the witnesses are saying about the risk balance and the argument that you can be as compassionate as you wish but it is down to the layout of the hospitals.  The simple question is whether the hospitals are looking at their layouts.  Can anything be done to rearrange wards?  I am told this has happened in some hospitals.  I suppose what many members are looking for is possibly a more imaginative approach if at all possible, even if the partner were to use PPE or something coming in for that visit, that news or whatever else.  Could we send out even that message, that we are looking at all areas, that we are listening to the stories people have to tell about their difficulties and that the approach will be as imaginative as possible?  Could we give even that advice this morning?  Would the witnesses like to comment on that?</p></speech>

I totally agree with what the Chairman says.  It is not enough for us to accept matters at face value.  We did not do so when we did our first survey and found that a number of hospitals were not compliant.  Our response to them was this: what do you need to do to become compliant?  This was notwithstanding concerns they had about infection prevention and control and their infrastructure.  It is because of that ongoing questioning and interrogation and the direct advocacy and concerns of the women and partners involved that we are pushing hospitals to do whatever they can to comply with the guidance we have given out, which, as I said, is about recovering as quickly as we can to that pre-pandemic level.  I do not mean to labour the point but, as I said, and as the Chairman echoed, we are constantly balancing the risk.  We have found that Covid-19 is a very volatile virus in its impact on the population in healthcare settings.  The vaccination programme brings great additional protection to people and certainly has allowed us much greater freedom and has opened up choice for us in respect of visiting and other hospital services.  I totally support what the Chairman says.  We need our hospitals to be innovative to acknowledge the importance of partners, particularly in difficult situations, as Senator Kyne outlined.  That is what our staff want and what we are working towards.</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan talked about gaps in the vaccine roll-out.  The last time the witnesses were before the committee one gap was people who are housebound.  I think the figure given was that about 200 people were housebound at that time.  We were told the ambulance service was handling call-outs and vaccinations but there were logistical difficulties.  Is that resolved at this stage, do the witnesses know?</p></speech>

The national ambulance service, in fairness, increased its fleet that was available to provide that service.  More than 2,700 people have been vaccinated with a first dose and second doses are continuing.  This is not a static service, so we continue to get referrals from time to time.  The bulk of referrals for dose one are completed and second doses are continuing in line with the defined criteria for each vaccine.  There is a small number, less than 100, of referrals over recent weeks remaining and they are being scheduled.  Where there has been difficulty we have also identified that in the case of some of the referrals, people might have been vaccinated through other channels, some people may have ultimately changed their mind, some may be in hospital and so on.  We have worked extensively through all those referrals, thanks to general practice and in particular the ambulance service.  That service is continuing, it is now dealing with smaller numbers, we are now primarily focusing on second doses and any additional referrals are still being dealt with.</p></speech>

If there is an inordinate delay, someone can approach a GP and have the issue escalated.  We have a team that analyses that process regularly.  If a housebound case has not been in touch with a GP, he or she can contact a GP and we will still take a referral if anyone is concerned.  We would hope that the majority of such cases are dealt with, but there are still people who need access to that service.  Since we are also continuing with the second doses, people are getting in touch about the timing of those for them.  We respond to them on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid mentioned more than 150,000 over-50s in that regard.  A number of them might have religious or moral grounds for not taking the vaccine.  Within the HSE and some of its service providers, will there be a campaign in respect of those who feel that they still do not have sufficient evidence about vaccination?  I have encountered a number of cases where people were reluctant for health reasons or just concerns about getting a vaccine.  Will there be a campaign to try to get that cohort vaccinated?  We are discussing booster shots and so on, so we want to maximise as much as possible the number of people who have been vaccinated.  Some people are concerned about alcohol, foetuses and so on supposedly being used in the vaccines.  Will there be a specific campaign to try to bring them on board with the vaccine roll-out?</p></speech>

We should acknowledge that the uptake in Ireland is strong, but we should work on who has not taken up a vaccine.  We run significant campaigns across each of the cohort age groups.  They have been adapted as we have moved through each group.  As we move into the groups comprising people in their 30s and 20s, that work continues through various media platforms, advocacy groups, influencers and sporting groups that work with us on communicating about the roll-out.  We engage collectively across a range of organisations to support the continued promotion of the roll-out.  That is key.</p> <p>  In support of Dr. Henry, I wish to comment on the Chairman's final suggestions, which were good, on how to encourage innovation in facilitating partner visits.  That is the direction that Dr. Henry has given to the 19 maternity hospitals.  Undoubtedly, many of the maternity hospitals not too far away from where we are sitting in Dublin city are not suited to dealing with a pandemic.  Extra and rigid measures have been put in place.  I understand the distress and stress this has caused.  The chief clinical officer, the chief operations officer and myself are relentlessly focused on ensuring that we get the best visitations with the best protections for hospitals, women and children.  They deserve it and they have our fullest commitment in that regard.</p></speech>

The committee has been seeking information on the digital green certificate.  What input and role will the HSE have in that process?  For those who may be thinking of travelling abroad, would the HSE recommend it for those who have received two jabs?  What would it recommend in respect of those who have only had one jab or even no jabs?  Many people watch these meetings.  Does the HSE have advice for them?  Would it tell them to stay at home and stay safe, in particular those who have not received a vaccine yet?</p></speech>

We have publicly stated this week that Government policy will ultimately determine the approach to travel for all age groups.  However, there is no doubt that people are at their fullest level of protection when they are fully vaccinated, as in, they have received two doses.  Travel policy will be advised by the Government.  Speaking from the HSE's perspective, everyone needs to make a personal risk assessment of travel, particularly in the context of the prevalence of the Delta variant.  It is a concerning factor for us, not just because we are seeing the early rise of it in Ireland, but because it is in many European countries that many Irish people visit.  That is the caution we would give.</p> <p>  Mr. McCallion can give more details about the travel certificate.  It is a central government-led process across a number of Departments.  The role of the HSE is to submit our data on the vaccination programme.  The process of the production of the certificate or additional information that people may need is progressed through Departments.  The HSE's sole role is to provide data and information.</p></speech>

We are part of a cross-government group.  This process involves multiple Departments and agencies.  Essentially, our role is in providing the data and trying to support the process from a range of perspectives.  There are three mechanisms in the digital travel certificate - vaccination, people testing positive in the preceding nine months and the private testing side, which is a separate process to the public health system.  We are working on ensuring that we have the data available to support the overall process.  We are working with Departments as part of that cross-government approach to the project.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>This meeting has been convened to hear from the European Commission Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager - I hope I pronounced that well - who has responsibility for the Making Europe Fit for the Digital Age strategy.  It is my sincere honour and privilege to extend a very warm welcome to the Commissioner, who will be joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the Commissioner to make her opening statement, and questions will then be posed by members of our committee.  As the witness is already aware, the committee may publish her opening statement on its website following today&rsquo;s meeting.</p><p>Before I invite the Commissioner to deliver her opening statement, which will be limited to five minutes, I advise the witness of the following with regard to parliamentary privilege and I hope the Commissioner and the members will bear with me while I go through these housekeeping rules.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they may be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how that may apply to the evidence they may give.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to participate in the public meeting.  I will not permit members to attend unless they are adhering to that constitutional requirement and, therefore, any member not so present will be asked to leave the meeting.  I also ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit today of the Commissioner and of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report.  I also ask that microphones be muted when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask our guest and members to use the raise hand function on their screen if they want to contribute.  We have speaking slots and it would be wonderful if we could adhere to them.  I remind everyone as well to turn off their mobile phones, if at all possible.</p><p>Without further ado, we are privileged and delighted to have the Commissioner with us today.  I feel a little bit of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu </i>because I had the pleasure of attending the Conference on the Future of Europe in Strasbourg at the weekend.  It is wonderful to see the European flag flying in the background again today and it feels very apt after the weekend I spent in Strasbourg and in the context of the important work to be undertaken in the months ahead.  I invite the Commissioner to make her official statement to the committee.</p></speech>

I am glad this meeting is possible since travel is still restricted.  Our discussions, however, should not be restricted because there is an urgent need for our democracies to catch up and get ahead of the curve of technological development to serve our people in the best possible manner.</p> <p>  One lesson of the pandemic is that digital technologies can enable many things which otherwise would not be possible.  Equally, digital technologies can also facilitate travel and enable us to come together.  This is best exemplified by the European Union digital Covid-19 certificates, which will come into effect and be available on 1 July.  On the other hand, though, digital technologies can also increase differences.  Those who can fully benefit from an enriched and secure digital space with a full range of services are in a very different position from those who cannot benefit in the same way.  That disparity in access might derive from a lack of connectivity, skills, hardware and-or access to different services.</p> <p>  It is important we consider this digital divide as something we should work on, and this is why the deployment of fibre and 5G is very important.</p><p>I welcome the ongoing roll-out of the national broadband plan that aims to deliver high-speed broadband services to all premises in Ireland.  The expansion of the digital sector, however, should not come at the expense of a second transition, which is to being a climate-neutral continent.  It is important that data centres, for example, minimise their CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, as they now account for many of these CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.  While we roll out digital, we must really be much more effective in minimising CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.<br/><br/>There will be no green transition without the digital transition.  They come together but only if we are successful in co-ordinating policies between the two.  Being successful in that respect also takes in the enabling of our European values to come to life with the help of digital technologies.  It is why we in the Commission have adopted our digital compass, the European way for the &quot;digital decade&quot; that sets out what we want to achieve by 2030.<br/><br/>Like a compass, this strategy has four cardinal points.  The first, of course, is about humans and how we can get the basic and expert skills to shape digitisation.  The second is about secure infrastructure to help us to get connected.  The third is the digital transformation of businesses and reinterpretation of business models and ideas with the use of digital technologies.  Last but not least is the digitisation of public services and egovernance, enabling public services to be delivered in a digital way.<br/><br/>It is not enough just to set targets and we need resources to enable us to reach those targets.  We have both the multi-annual financial framework and the NextGenerationEU recovery and resilience facility to help us to do this.  Members know a minimum of 20% of the recovery and resilience funds have the objective of achieving digital transition in a sustainable way.  The in-depth assessment of the Irish plan is ongoing, following which I hope to confirm that Ireland meets the digital targets.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>Cybersecurity, and particularly in the Irish context, is very topical because of the hideous ransomware attack on the health system of Ireland just last month, forcing Ireland to shut down most of the healthcare IT systems.  I really want to express my solidarity with the people affected by this and firmly condemn such a malicious act.  This is aggressive interference in a very sensitive and strategic area, as health services all over the world have suffered an increase in attacks during the pandemic.  This is pathetic behaviour from the people who are responsible.<br/><br/>Everyone is deeply concerned about these attacks.  The more we use digital technology, the more vulnerable we can be if we do not protect ourselves in the best possible way.  This is why we have launched a revision of the network and information systems directive in order to have broader scope and bring more sectors on board.  It is also about increasing coverage of the healthcare sector, meaning many more hospitals and health-related facilities will need to take legally required cybersecurity measures and report cyber incidents.<br/><br/>Just today, we launched a proposal for a new joint cyber unit to improve cross-border co-operation in preventing cyberattacks and assistance so that member states can help each other if there is an attack.<br/><br/>I have some comments on the Digital Services and Digital Markets Acts that have been proposed, both focusing on the market or services to be delivered with more security with products sold online and in the handling of illegal content.  This also involves securing freedom of speech and, with the proposed Digital Markets Act, ensuring the market is open and competitive for the many amazing and innovative European companies with interesting products to present to us.  There is an artificial intelligence proposal focusing on the use cases and where there is a risk of fundamental values not being upheld while embracing artificial intelligence in all its many other forms.<br/><br/>There is a review of the broadband cost reduction directive in order to ensure we have a sustainable, quick and more efficient roll-out of high-capacity networks, including fibre and 5G.  We have much legislation in the pipeline, focusing on two fundamental elements.  We must be able to trust technology in order to see its full benefits and we must ensure our democracy is not only catching up with technology but getting ahead of the curve in order to be able to shape our future societies.</p></speech>

I am sure the sentiments she expressed this afternoon will be very much reflected in our members' thoughts and questions.  The members are aware of the speaking slots and I will turn first to Deputy Imelda Munster.</p></speech>

Does she have a timeline for implementation of the Digital Services Act?</p></speech>

It is really advanced.  There is much interest in the European Parliament and many committees are contributing to it.  We hope we can pass it next summer during the French Presidency.  It is a regulation that could come into effect quite fast and perhaps by the end of next year if everything goes well.  I need to knock on wood in order to ensure I do not jinx it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#B00500"><p>Okay.  It is possibly by the end of next year.  It may have some crossover or even conflicts with Ireland's online safety and media regulation Bill.  We hope to have that Bill enacted by the end of this year.  Is the witness in any way familiar with that legislation?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#B00700"><p>That is fair enough.  The Bill, in particular, would treat harmful and illegal content in much the same way.</p><p>I understand the European Commission has stated they should not be treated in the same way because they are not the same, more or less.  I am interested to hear Ms Vestager's comments on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margrethe Vestager" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#C00200"><p>The idea of the Digital Services Act is to make sure we have processes that ensure illegal content is taken down and that legal content - even though sometimes it may hurt to see it - can stay up.  It is not a proposal on substance.  What is legal and what is illegal is for the member states to decide.  The Digital Services Act will provide an obligation to do a horizontal risk assessment on the digital services to determine whether there is a risk they can be misused, for instance, to undermine elections.  We have seen examples of that.  If so, those risks must be mitigated by the service provider.</p> <p>  Also, in the case of individuals, if something is taken down, they should be told and have the option to complain about it.  That, in parallel with the work on the strengthened code of conduct, will get us to a situation where there is room for a national debate on what is legal and what is illegal while we establish processes that enable the conclusions of the offline world to be valleys in the online world.</p></speech>

Will she talk us through the plans she has for closing the digital divide between urban and rural areas?  There is a major problem here in Ireland which is mainly due to poor broadband in rural areas, but it is also a problem in socioeconomic terms.  During the pandemic, every child had to be schooled from home online.  That was okay for some families, but others were not in a position to do that.  Will Ms Vestager talk us through the plans she has for closing the divide between urban and rural areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margrethe Vestager" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#C00400"><p>I thank Deputy Munster for raising this because we have made exactly the same observation in that there is a social toll here.  For some kids, who have good connectivity, the correct gadgets, and whose parents can help out, the pandemic has been one thing.  However, for kids with very poor connectivity and whose parents have not been able to help out, this may have been a year that was more or less wasted.  In a child's life, a year of schooling counts for something.</p> <p>  There are two things from this.  Obviously, we have varying subcompetence when it comes to education, yet we have made a digital education action plan to see what we have learned in this.  The second thing is to focus on connectivity.  A minimum of 20% of the recovery and resilience facility is for digital technologies, and much of that goes to connections, in particular, where there is no business case.  If a private business does not roll out services because it does not believe there is a business case, a state can come in and make sure there is sufficient support for the roll-out to happen.  At the same time, it should work on other forms of technology so that the very remote areas can also be connected with broadband or fibre and, if not, via satellite.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster raised the point that of families living door to door in an urban environment, some have the resources to connect and others do not.  That is an important point for the local authorities.  In my letter box, when I came home the other day, there was an invitation to an open house youth centre, where young people were invited to come and write their CVs and learn how to deal with online job searches.  It is an important thing for local authorities to provide that because they are well placed, they know the families involved, and they are probably trusted to do something rather than someone sitting thousands of kilometres away.</p></speech>

I thank her for giving us her time.  I want to talk about the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act because they are, as Deputy Munster just said, related to legislation we are considering here.  I will specifically talk about some of the issues we need to address domestically and at European level.</p> <p>  My first question is about online advertising targeting children.  Does Ms Vestager believe there should be a Europe-wide ban on such advertising?  Second, does she believe there should be a ban on surveillance-based advertising?  My third question is about algorithmic decision-making.  Algorithms can do lots of wonderful things, but if we do not guard against algorithmic bias, it will create many problems.  We are looking to develop a number of codes here, but is it an approach that should be adopted at European level?</p> <p>  My final question comes down to the issue of European values and the importance of data.  Does Ms Vestager view the right to data privacy as a European value?  I speak in the context of China, which is increasingly using data for surveillance purposes, and the challenges we know of in the US around security and commercial purposes.  How should Europe approach this?  One must be conscious of the Schrems decisions and the implication of that in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margrethe Vestager" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#C00800"><p>The Deputy is correct.  Tonight, many Danes will be singing around bonfires to celebrate midsummer.  Luckily, we have stopped burning women on the stake, which was a bad idea.  Now it is a much more peaceful thing.</p> <p>  I think it is a European value for a person to have the right to privacy.  It is important we make this a right that people know they can enforce.  By now, after the introduction of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, many people know they have rights but they find it difficult to know they are able to enforce those rights.  We still have some way to go.  We are trying to reflect that in new pieces of legislation, such as on artificial intelligence.  We use a metaphor of a pyramid.  At the bottom of the pyramid, where there is a lot of space, there are kinds of artificial intelligence we do not touch at all.  However, at the tip of the pyramid we find cases that we would completely prohibit.  There is no place in the European Union that a government would put in place a social scoring mechanism that puts citizens under surveillance and that, based on whether they pay their rent, jaywalk or are due a dental appointment - whatever it may be - they are allowed certain privileges or not.  We want that to be prohibited.</p> <p>  The second thing we want prohibited, as a matter of principle, is general biometric surveillance in public spaces.</p><p>Basically, someone would know where you were at all times.  The one exception would be that you could go to a judge and ask to be allowed to use it for a limited period of time, for example, in the search for a missing child or in the case of terrorist or other serious crimes.</p><p> Last but not least, we would also want to prohibit the use of subliminal techniques that would make people do something that could be harmful to them or to others.  We also try to take this value of privacy into other pieces of legislation so people can see that this is for real.</p><p> On the question of algorithms, we have quite a number of initiatives on algorithmic transparency.  One of the things would be an obligation for the providers to explain how their algorithm works.  We would not necessarily ask for the code itself but we would ask the developer to be able to say how this was actually working because, without that level of explainability, how can we trust that it works without a bias?  That is exactly how we would do it because there is a risk of bias if there is no transparency or no explainability with the algorithms being used.</p><p> On the question of online advertising, both targeting vulnerable people and also targeting the rest of us, this is where there have been some very heated discussions.  One of the areas where we have been a little careful is in the case of smaller businesses with a limited advertising budget because, for them, it can be a good thing to be able to reach potential customers.  Businesses with large advertising budgets do not mind so much, and although every business minds about its costs, they can afford to have much broader advertising practices.  I am more than willing to discuss how we can, for instance, protect children against targeted advertising, going further than the transparency we are suggesting right now.  People should know why they see an ad but I think it is important to be mindful of businesses which have very small advertising budgets because, for them, targeted advertising really makes the difference.</p></speech>

I have four questions.  How important is rural proofing to all of these ideas to make sure we do not leave anybody behind?  Young people use the most data and they are prominent users of social media.  How are the voices and perspectives of young people included in the regulatory work of the European Commission?  The Commissioner mentioned there are significant resources but what does she see as the key areas for funding?  The Commissioner spoke about data centres, which account for the biggest share of carbon emissions.  How can we reduce these emissions in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.358" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margrethe Vestager" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#D00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The idea of rural proofing is to see how proposals work outside of an urban area because there is a difference between people living closer together and people living much more spread out.  These are different communities and there is a different dynamic, but that does not change the fact that we should be sensitive to these differences between urban and rural.  We are working to be better at doing that kind of analysis in order to see how legislation will work for everyone.</p> <p>  Second, on the question on how young people are being heard, that is a really good question because we do not necessarily have specific youth panels.  What we see is that there are a lot of young people worrying about having the right competences and whether we learn what we need to learn at school in order to be qualified for the jobs to come.  This is one of the reasons we treat digital skills as a very hard strategic priority, not with education as a side thing or by treating it as if we can always put education here or there, but that it is a central thing and, without education, it will not work.  I will take the inspiration and think about how more young people can be included.</p> <p>  It is also a point that goes for older people.  For those aged 70 years today, in the next 20 years digitisation will only increase and more and more public services will come in digital formats.  Therefore, it is never too late to get the digital skills in order for people to fully feel they are part of their society and they can benefit from the different services being delivered.  People who are 70 today may well be here for the next 20 or 30 years.  It is very important that we take the different generations on board in that respect.</p> <p>  On the key areas for investment, as I said earlier, I really think connectivity must be a key area and the second must be skills.  We cannot leave anyone to say that digital society is not for them and that it is not important whether they feel empowered or not.  The citizen&rsquo;s empowerment to deal with this is of the essence because, otherwise, there is a risk that we get societies where people do not feel they belong, and I think that is the worst thing that can happen.  They may be fired from a job but if they feel they are being fired from their country or their society, where do they go then?  Skills are of the essence.</p> <p>  When it comes to the data centres, with regard to the technology to get the next generation of semiconductors to use less electricity and less power, we have what we call an important project of common European interest that is working exactly on semiconductors to bring that down.  The second thing is to organise the data centres so they can run on renewables, like everything else, but also that excess heating can be used.  I know it is a quirky example but in Paris they have organised a pool next to a data centre, so the excess heat actually heats the pool for the people living around the data centre.  I think that is quite a sweet example.</p></speech>

It is an honour to have her at our meeting.  She mentioned the draft Digital Markets Act which is being worked on by the EU, along with the Digital Services Act.  It sets out some rigid and non-negotiable rules for a lot of tech businesses, regardless of circumstances.  Is there any concern in the EU that it is a bit over-specific and inflexible and might lead to unintended consequences?  When I say &ldquo;unintended consequences&rdquo;, I am talking about the whole issue of sideloading.  There are concerns that this could allow incidents such as software holding user data to ransom and letting children bypass parental controls and, indeed, that it could lead to potential piracy.  Given the proposed draft, does the Commissioner have any concerns with what is there as this is seen to be non-negotiable at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margrethe Vestager" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#E00100"><p>When we were developing the Digital Markets Act, we took our experience from competition law enforcement and focused on what we were seeing.  One of our main challenges was to make procedures more efficient.  Even when we move quite quickly, it takes time to bring a competition case, for obvious reasons.  First, we have to prove dominance and then we have to prove that there has been wrongdoing through an illegal behaviour.  The mechanism of using a Digital Markets Act is a bit different.  Beforehand, parties are designated as gatekeepers according qualitative and quantitative objective criteria.  The gatekeepers, and there will not be too many of them - maybe ten to 15, or something like that, have a number of obligations and a number of things they cannot do.  What they must do and cannot do is based on our experience from competition law enforcement and the experience of seeing unfair trading practices.  We are being quite specific, because otherwise, we would revert back to competition law enforcement.  The regulation is supposed to complement competition law enforcement.  There will still be competition cases, but not in the same way as before.</p> <p>  The question of data protection and security is a valid one.  However, it is far-reaching to suggest, for instance, that an app store other than the one you already have on your phone would be an irresponsible app store that would allow any kind of crap to be pushed onto you.  For all other providers, the same GDPR and privacy rules apply as for everyone else.  One of the things I find thought-provoking is that if I am not happy with the prices or the choice of my supermarket, I go to another one.  When it comes to app stores, once I buy my phone, there is a monopoly.  I cannot use another app store to download the apps I want on my phone.</p></speech>

We, the Commission, draft the regulation using our best efforts.  Of course we wold like the co-legislator to accept the draft regulation and vote it straight through, but that is not the case.  The co-legislator will discuss it and deal with it.  It has been said that Council is quite advanced in its considerations.  The Parliament is also getting there, with many committees interested in it .  Once it is passed, since it is a regulation, the same rules apply to everyone.</p></speech>

I watched the Commissioner's presentation.  First, I congratulate the Danish football team on how well they have performed in the Euros and how well they have represented their country at a particularly difficult time, given the events of last Saturday week.  The team were a credit to everyone in Denmark and to the football community.  I wish the team all the best in the round of the last 16.</p> <p>  The Commissioner touched on the issue of cybersecurity earlier.  As she will be aware and as she mentioned, we suffered a serious cyberattack here recently.  Does she feel that a pan-European approach needs to be taken to cybersecurity?  There have been calls for heavy investment in our own cybersecurity.  Is it something that needs to be done at European level, covering the whole Union?  Perhaps the Commissioner can speak more to that issue.  As we know, and as she has mentioned, the more dependent we become on digital, the more vulnerable we become.  We are small country of 4.5 million people, like the Commissioner's own country.  For a small country, it is a heavy burden to try to protect our digital space.  Perhaps it is something that requires a common European approach.  I ask the Commissioner for her wider views on that issue.</p></speech>

It was devastating and shocking to see Christian Eriksen collapsing on the field.  I find very touching the reaction of the entire football community to the events.  The football community and the fans have shown fair play and warmth.  I find it impressive.  Of course, Christian Eriksen is fine and out of hospital.  He had surgery.  In Denmark, many people have signed up for first aid classes to learn how to do life-saving CPR.  Therefore, something good will come of it.  Obviously, I will be proud if the members join me in hoping for the Danish team to make it through the game on Saturday.</p> <p>  On the question of cybersecurity, it is a bit tricky.  Of course, we have the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, which deals with cybersecurity.  The directive on the security of network and information systems is trying to increase the scope so that more sectors will also be legally obliged to have what it takes to protect themselves against cyberattacks.</p> <p>  At the same time, we see that there is room to do more.  As we increase the use of digital technology, we become more vulnerable.  It is not only about vulnerability in the sense that each and every one of us can make the mistake of clicking on a link that looks attractive but is basically a phishing exercise or something much worse than that, but more systemically, it is about protecting us against the real professional, malicious attacks that we see happening.  We hope to be able to apply six to eight "socks", which is technology that carries out surveillance by patrolling the networks and the cables to determine if an attack is imminent.</p> <p>  The second measure is to start up a joint cyber unit.  We are very much aware that cybersecurity is a national competence.  However, we are also aware that some of the attackers have a lot of resources at their disposal and it may be a good idea for member states to help each other both in their surveillance as to what is ongoing to help out if an attack is under way, but also to learn what happens during an attack so that it can be recognised by others and better prevented.  There are many things that we can do together without affecting the sovereignty of the member states.  Perhaps by co-operating more closely, we can increase the sovereignty of the member states.  I do not think states feel sovereign when they are experiencing a massive cyberattack.</p></speech>

I agree there needs to be greater co-operation given the risk involved, how far we have come and how vulnerable we now are.  I thank the Commissioner for her comments and I wish the Danish team the very best at the weekend as well.</p></speech>

The Commissioner will be quite happy to hear the cheers.  I wish to talk about the need for Europe to be more competitive in the digital age.  With regard to one of the challenges, we see Silicon Valley and all the new companies that have been emerging from there.  We have not seen the number of digital companies growing to the same extent in Europe over the recent years.  In the Commissioner's vision for Europe in the digital age, what can we do to be able to support that creativity?  Part of it may relate to the relationship with some of the tech giants.  I am not sure if the Commissioner wants to comment on the ongoing Apple case, an issue which is much in the news in Ireland, but maybe she might comment on the relationship with the European Union and Apple and the antitrust case against Google that is being taken this week.  How does the Commissioner envisage the digital wallet proposal which her directorate general, DG, is now developing?  Does she believe we should move towards the introduction of a digital euro?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margrethe Vestager" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#F00500"><p>It is interesting and so regrettable a number of successful, now US, businesses have their origins within the European Union.  You find so many clever, entrepreneurial people within our Union.  What we have seen so far is that many of them will leave for the US for skilled employees and capital to come on board.  We have been trying to create better capital conditions by creating the capital union, because European companies often go to the bank and create more debts if they need capital on board, whereas in the US it is much more the custom that you go to the market and sell 5% or 10% of your business and not only do you get capital on board, you get new competences on board.  It is definitely not a given that the innovator or initial entrepreneur who has created a great product also holds the competences to scale that business.  We also want to create a different sort of capital market dynamic in Europe.</p> <p>  The second thing, and here there is a sense of urgency, is to make sure the industrial potential of Europe is being used in full because everything digitalises: energy, mobility, health and agriculture.  Those ought to be the triggering events for European industry to dominate the next big chapter of digitalisation.  That takes an open marketplace in order that they can get to their customers.  It takes capital, a capital market that is willing to take risks and, of course, a Single Market approach in order that solutions can be scaled up because a full Single Market is available.  I am quite enthusiastic about this but it will take considerable effort for us to use this industrial culture and potential to its full.</p> <p>  On the ongoing cases, actually we have quite a few tax cases.  The Apple tax case is under appeal and I cannot comment on that, but what was interesting for me to see is that some of the things we have been looking at before are coming back.  We have to look at the same behaviour, only in slightly different markets.  If it is a different market, there is a different dynamic, but the fundamental behaviour is very much the same.  One of the things that really underpins the Digital Markets Act is that the things we have seen before should be straightforwardly prohibited in order that we do not have to spend the resources to redo investigations we have done before, with the risk of smaller businesses being squeezed out of the market in the meantime.</p> <p>  On the question of the digital wallet, our ambition is that it should work like a passport.  You have a national passport but it is also a European passport.  It is the same idea.  You have a national e-identity and it should work all over Europe as well.  If you can use your own identity to log in to different services, you can much better control what data you deliver or what trace you track after yourself.</p> <p>  The second beneficial thing is that you can create trust.  Other people will know that if you choose to identify yourself, it is really you.  That is one of the things which is really lacking online.  I appreciate that you can be there anonymously, but I also appreciate that I know who I am dealing with.  That can make the Internet a much more trusted place, if we get this to work.  Having a wallet in which you can also stash your birth certificate, educational certificates and all of this can make your life much easier in the administrative procedures you have to go through in life.</p></speech>

Why is a separate Act needed for AI?  Would it not be covered under the digital Act?  Does the Commissioner think there should be more built-in deterrents for these ransomware attacks, such as confiscation of bank accounts, assets and so forth, and that they should be increased?</p></speech>

I think we have seen only the beginning of dealing with this.  Unfortunately, it seems that the digitisation of crime is happening even faster than that of business, the legitimate side of society.  Criminal groups use digital technologies at a level we would love the legitimate side of society to use.  In the coming years, we will develop not only ways to protect ourselves but also a much stronger zero tolerance of this.  Of course, we need also to work on this internationally.</p> <p>  One disturbing issue is that not only are cybercriminals professional in what they do but there are also state-sponsored cyberattacks that in various ways polarise us and make it difficult for people to get the correct information because misinformation is flourishing.  One of the big debates in the years to come will concern how to fight state-sponsored attacks.  It is not tolerable that we should see what we have seen, most recently in Ireland but also elsewhere during the pandemic, when hospitals became one of the main targets of attacks at a time they were under extreme stress to do their best and to help citizens who were suffering from Covid.</p></speech>

We have been careful not to refer to one specific type of technology.  There can be different technologies, but the way in which the technology works determines whether it is defined as artificial intelligence.  It could be technology that helps in a decision-making process, enables people to find patterns or does tasks that humans would otherwise do, such as a simple will or something like that.  We are defining it by what the technology can do to future-proof it, given that there will be new forms of AI.  It develops by the day.</p> <p>  Moreover, we are not focusing on the application as such or the sectors, but rather on the use cases.  We compiled a list of use cases where, after the public consultation, we found there is a risk of fundamental values not being upheld, such as when people are being hired or applying for a mortgage.  These are areas that are sensitive for people, where they want to be seen as who they are, not as their gender, postal code or ethnic background but as the person they are, with their talents and so on and with none of the other aspects.  This is why we are specific with the use cases, but at the same time, there are many use cases where we find there is no risk.  We may ask for transparency in order that people will know they are dealing with a machine, such as in customer service, but otherwise we just say "Go, go, go" because there are so many applications where it will make life more convenient.</p></speech>

We are, I hope, working our way slowly but surely out of a viral pandemic that has crippled Europe and the wider world.  Throughout, we have become overwhelmed with misinformation.  One might call it a misinformation pandemic.  The after-effects of that may linger for significantly longer than will the effects of the pandemic itself.  I recall Neelie Kroes in 2014 taking a significant step forward in empowering our young children to become more adept at manipulating technology and beginning that wonderful initiative that was EU Code Week.</p> <p>  In the aftermath of the pandemic, in the knowledge that our young people in particular need quickly to develop the skills necessary to become exceptionally digitally literate to be able to parse, analyse and critique all the information they encounter on the Internet using social media and other platforms, is it now time - perhaps this is something the Commission is already contemplating doing - to have a European-wide programme of digital literacy education for our young people, at both primary and post-primary level, that gives them those kinds of critiquing, parsing and analytical skills that are so crucial at a time they will most definitely be subjected to misinformation on a scale that is simply incomparable with what we encountered as young people growing up in the EU?  Is that being contemplated?  Does Ms Vestager have any comments to make about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margrethe Vestager" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#G00500"><p>This is something we are passionate about.  Someone told me the other day that the risk of someone passing on an article that is misinformation is higher with my generation or the slightly older one.  It is definitely not always young people who are the source of misinformation or who pass it on; it can very well be people of other ages.  It is important, therefore, to have a broad scope when we are discussing how to ensure we will get the exact competences the Deputy mentioned.</p> <p>  EU Code Week is ongoing because it is a great initiative, and it is encouraging to be part of this.  We also have events - what we call hackathons - because it is intriguing and interesting to see what can be achieved in perhaps just 24 hours if skilled people work in teams on a certain area.  Solutions can be found and that is an inspiration too.  We have an ongoing project to determine whether we can create a European digital certificate, similar to the one for languages, where somebody can receive qualifications of C1, B2, B1 and so on for his or her skill level.  We could have the same for digital skills in order that employers could easily recognise what kind of digital skill a young person or an experienced person has, and he or she will be able to travel with those digital skills.  We are in the process of developing that.  At the same time, it will not apply to each and every one of us such that if we just become more clued in, we will not be misinformed.</p> <p>  We have also strengthened the code of conduct.  It is soft law, but all the big companies, such as the US ones, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as TikTok and Mozilla, have signed up for a number of actions to ensure that misinformation will be suppressed.  During the pandemic, for instance, they sought to ensure that when a person was seeking Covid information, he or she would see the official information from the local health ministry as the first result.  We strengthened the code because we found there was room for the platforms to do better.</p><p>Here, of course, the next step will be the Digital Services Act.  This will give them new obligations.  For example, they would have to consider whether there is a risk that their platforms can be misused for systematic misinformation to people of all ages.</p></speech>

She has had a busy hour responding to all of our members.  I also thank our members.  At the risk of sounding repetitive, which is not what I want to do, the Commissioner has covered everything comprehensively.  It falls to me to conclude.  The erosion of democracy is something that has left our countries and world highly vulnerable.  We saw what happened on Capitol Hill.  We saw the power of digital media and social media and the implications it had on Capitol Hill, which would have been unimaginable had anybody suggested it would be possible.  This is why I believe the work being done by the Commissioner is hugely important for all of us as a country.</p> <p>  Having attended the Conference on the Future of Europe, I am mindful that one of the important pieces of policy work the conference will do is on digital transformation and on the idea the Commissioner has comprehensively addressed today on leaving nobody behind, whether people live in rural or urban areas, whether they are female or male or their age.  None of this should matter and this is a very good objective.</p> <p>  To reflect on what the Commissioner and members have said, during the pandemic we had an attack on our health service.  This was probably at the most vulnerable time in the history of the State.  It proved very difficult for those on the front line in an already-impossible situation.  I feel very strongly about a point that has been touched on, which is that in the work being done by the Commissioner, it will be hugely important to find a way to ensure that information going out is legitimate, trusted and independent.  This is crucial in the work being done by the Commissioner.  It has been critical throughout the pandemic with regard to Covid deniers.  The voice and platform misinformation gets is equally as powerful as the correct and legitimate information.  We have to find a way at European level and here in our own country to ensure we suppress the misinformation that can get out.  It led people astray in the situation the world found itself in with the pandemic.</p> <p>  I do not have any questions because the Commissioner has covered everything so well.  These are just my own rambling thoughts, having listened to everything everybody has had to say.  I invite the Commissioner to make any closing remark she has after hearing from committee members.</p></speech>

They are right that our democracy cannot fall victim to digitisation.  No matter how much I like digital solutions and work for us to use them where they improve lives and convenience and make our societies more inclusive, they are only a supplement to people coming together and speaking in real life, where we can read body language and see the sparkle in someone's eye.  It is still much easier to understand people we disagree with when we see them in real life.  It is a different thing to say to someone's face what some people write in online commentary.  We should never forget this when raising our children.  We must keep reminding ourselves as adults that democracy depends on a civilised way of disagreeing, listening to one another and perhaps finding ways of agreeing.  I look forward to being able to meet the committee in person in the not-too-distant future.  Committee members may not all be football fans or football players but perhaps we could go to a hurling match together.  Such investment is what is needed to stabilise our democracy.  Digital is one thing but humans coming together is the basics.</p></speech>

We do miss that and we look forward to getting back to that day very soon.</p> <p>  I thank the Commissioner most sincerely for being with us today and for being so generous with her time and information.

I welcome Mr. Jackie Conboy, a co-founder of the MEAI, and his colleague, Mr. Matt McGranaghan.  They will be joining us remotely via Microsoft Teams.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite our witnesses to make their opening statements which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As our guests are probably aware, the committee may publish their opening statements on its website following the meeting.  I am afraid members will have to listen to some housekeeping rules again if that is all right.  Our guests opening statements will be limited to three minutes.</p> <p>  I must advise our guests of the following with respect to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and I ask they comply.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, they should note that there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Conboy to make his opening statement on behalf of the MEAI.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jackie Conboy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#K00300"><p>The MEAI would like to thank the Chairman, the joint committee and the clerk to the committee for their work and for the invitation to the MEAI to attend today to discuss the impact of Covid-19 on the music and entertainment sector.  The MEAI would also like to thank most sincerely the members of this committee and Members of the Oireachtas in general who have raised issues relating to this sector and offered their voice and assistance to the association on numerous occasions.</p> <p>  On 12 March 2020, the music and entertainment industry ground to a sudden halt as a result of Covid-19.  As the days passed beyond the initial lockdown, it became apparent that as long as social distancing was a requirement to slow the spread of Covid-19, the industry would be at its mercy.  As of today, 23 June 2021, we are now on day 469 of lockdown or of severe restrictions which prevent those in our sector from working.  On 27 April 2021, the MEAI made a written submission to this joint committee on the Impact of Covid-19 on the music and entertainment sector.  In that submission, we highlighted a number of areas of concern for consideration including social protection, banking issues, business supports from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, sector-specific supports from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and guidelines, consideration and provisions for reopening.  Since then, the landscape has changed considerably and issues relating to certain topics in that submission require urgent and swift action.  These issues are: the proposed cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, from September and the transitioning of recipients on the lowest rate to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, thus classifying them as unemployed; the need for social protection measures and sector supports when the sector is in a state of phased reopening and for those supports to continue until the sector can function fully without restrictions or social distancing; the fact that the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, contains criteria to which other Government supports are not subject, namely, minimum business costs and publication of recipients; and the fact that F&aacute;ilte Ireland guidelines, which state that no live or loud music or performances are permitted, are preventing the sector from a phased reopening process - we would like to see test gigs conducted in licensed premises and social settings so that guidelines can be created for the safe and responsible return of live entertainment in those settings.  We recommend that the VAT rate for our sector be aligned with that relating to the tourism and hospitality sector because this would provide a meaningful stimulus and support for the sector when reopening can take place.</p><p> There is a great lack of understanding of and various misconceptions about the nature of the music and entertainment sector and how it works.  The Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas we have been fortunate enough to engage with over the past 16 months all have an understanding of the severity of the problems and have empathy and sympathy for the situation, but this compassion and comprehension is not necessarily reflected in the slow roll-out of the supports we have been promised up to now.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Many members of the committee are directly or indirectly involved in the industry as well, or were in former lives.  I believe Mr. McGranaghan is not going to give a presentation but he is there for answers as well, as we have a very short session.  I advise members that rather than the speaking slot method we used last time, we are going to use indication.  If members are interested in putting questions or comments to our guests, they can indicate via Teams.  Deputy Munster has done so, so she may begin.</p></speech>

I raise the recently announced changes to the PUP and the effects it will have on the sector.  It will reclassify people as unemployed, so what effect will this have on the ability of those the association represents to work or receive supports?  Does it also mean people could lose funding under the live performance support scheme, LPSS, should they accept work?</p></speech>

To classify a self-employed person as unemployed, our understanding is that person would need to wrap up their business as well.</p> <p>  On the PUP support and where it stands at the moment with the LPSS, we are concerned that because people cannot sign back on to the PUP, there may be this false economy which is being supported by the LPSS and the funding that is given through that.  People may only be able to take a certain amount of unemployment out of that because of the limitation of &euro;960 over an eight-week period for their earnings.  We understand also, from speaking to the Department of Social Protection, that any expenses during that are only applied to the eight-week period as well.  If earnings and expenses were taken over the course of the year, as in a normal business, that would be a more understandable way of looking at it.  We are concerned at the moment people may be in a position where, if they get some employment in July or August, they will be forced to sign off the PUP and then they will have no support further on into winter.  We would be going into a period of natural closing down of the industry anyway as it is seasonal.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests.  I have one short point related to something brought up by the Minister, Deputy Martin, about the arts industry, that is, the whole thing of a living wage.  I think in some other European countries a minimum wage is set for people in this industry.  Do our guests feel this is something that should be done across their sector as well?  Over the next 12-month period, probably, people are not going to be able to get full time work.  This would mean that if there are changes to the PUP, there would be a minimum wage set and the support mechanism would be put in place and we would not have a situation where people would go on jobseeker's allowance.</p></speech>

Again, we think it is step in the right direction.  If it is across both sides, that is, the commercial and non-commercial sector, we would like to be engaging with that.  The only problem is that it is further down the line.  There are more immediate problems we have to deal with sooner because we cannot see that coming in before the middle of next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1483" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021062300002#L01300"><p>I thank Mr. Conboy and Mr. McGranaghan for their contributions and for being very effective representatives for the thousands of musicians and technicians who are a critically important part of our cultural output in Ireland.  I have one quick observation to make and then a question to follow it.  As we recover from the pandemic and begin slowly to reopen our economy, there are sections of the economy where it is exceptionally straightforward to determine they are open, functioning and providing full employment.  For example, if hairdressers are open, they are open.  Their employees come back and they provide that service.  Due to the nature of the music industry, that coming back process is going to be very slow and transitionary in nature.  As Mr. McGranaghan said earlier, it is also affected by the normal seasonal ebbs and flows of the industry in any event.  What do our guests suggest is the best model for continuing to support artists and technicians in the music and entertainment industry, which would allow for the transitional phase to happen in a successful manner so nobody goes over the edge and ceases to be part of the industry and that they are supported and nurtured back to full health, if I can put it that way?  I suspect that will not happen until sometime early next summer.  That is my assessment of how long this is going to take.  For our guests, as representatives of that industry, what is the best model to allow for that support to continue in a very effective way?</p></speech>

One of the most effective supports we have is the PUP.  When we see that being reduced come September, we are very concerned that is going to be a repeat of last year whereby, as other sectors slowly reopened, there were reductions and then, as the larger lockdown happened in October, the rate went back up again.  The PUP is a critical life support but it should be enhanced with additional supports.  The LPSS is a very good support.  We could be critical of certain aspects of it, certainly, and it does not get out all the time to everyone who needs it, so we must look at other ways of ensuring subsidies can be given right across all the different sectors.</p> <p>  One of the greatest supports could be to make guidelines that will allow for work to happen in a safe and responsible manner and not just put this blanket ban on.  That could then encourage a lot of workers back to licensed premises, hotels and weddings.  That is probably one of the best real-life supports, along with maintaining the PUP.</p></speech>

The MEAI representatives said they asked the Minister in August 2020 for a review of the professional artists on jobseeker's allowance scheme.  What was the response to this request?  They also mentioned the failure to recognise musicians, sound engineers, road crews and so forth as sole traders.  Do they see this as a major obstacle to their industry?</p></speech>

The professional artists on jobseeker's allowance scheme was through the Department of Social Protection.  We have asked if that could be reviewed.  We have not received an update on that.  As that stands currently, a person must be a member of a recognised body and the only recognised body in Ireland for a musician or an artist is-----</p></speech>

Without trying to be too negative, the language can sometimes be a little bureaucratic.  We find that to be the case with MEBAS.  Many musicians do not really classify themselves as sole traders, even though that is what they are.  With regard to MEBAS, they do not seem themselves as businesses, even though that is what they are.  The language used has deterred people from applying.  We heard from the Minister last night that there have been just over 300 applications.  We consider that an incredibly low number.  In addition to the relatively high threshold of &euro;20,000 in turnover and the issue of minimum business costs, the language used is a factor which deters people in the industry from applying for support.</p></speech>

I have a question in that regard.  As they know, part of the difficulty has been that the voice of the music and entertainment sector has not been at the table because it has not really had a representative body.  What structure should be in place to ensure engagement with the sector in future?  I am also conscious of the question of universal basic income, a matter Senator Carrigy raised.  I know this is not happening until next year but the planning will begin next month.  That is why it is important the sector is involved, which requires a representative structure to be in place.</p> <p>  My second question has regard to the venues.  We are going to hear about venues being reopened from 5 July.  What message would the witnesses like to hear with regard to venues being able to safely reopen?  Should we look at antigen testing?  What about those who are not vaccinated or who refuse to receive a vaccine?  Should venues be allowed to prevent such people entering the premises?</p></speech>

I will take the second question if Mr. McGranaghan would like to take the first one.  With regard to antigen testing, there seems to be opposition among many organisations, venues and festivals because it would add to the cost of tickets.  There is also the matter of setting up areas for people to get tested and holding areas for them to wait for their results.  If that is the only way forward and if venues can only open up with antigen testing, that is okay.  It is quite interesting.  Over the long weekend two weeks ago, many people were out drinking, eating and socialising in the streets.  It will be interesting to see the results of that.  It is almost like an unofficial test because there were so many people out on the streets enjoying the good weather and having food and a bit to drink.  It will be interesting to see whether that will result in a spike in cases.</p></speech>

Venues such as theatres and large concert halls have made their views known.  It is really important that guidelines be developed for licensed premises, weddings and pubs that do not require antigen testing and which allow for music and entertainment in a safe and responsible way.</p> <p>  With regard to the representative body, the Senator is quite correct.  Those in our industry have paddled their own canoes for a long time.  We have been very fragmented.  We have never had a unified voice.  The Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland is in the process of being officially incorporated.  We hope that this will be a positive step forward.  There are many different voices in this industry and each one plays a very important role and needs to be heard.</p></speech>

I am deeply worried about all of the musicians, sound and lighting people, drivers and so on who work very hard.  I have two quick questions.  I compliment our guests because, as someone said, they have brought a disparate group together.  I see that they faced some opposition.  Some did not like having them on their turf.  They have done a great job representing people in the industry.  I also compliment Senator Murphy for chairing our group.  We meet occasionally to try to tease out issues.</p> <p>  I will move on to my dh&aacute; questions.  Starting with ceist a haon, can the witnesses explain what it is like for the ordinary man or woman facing the loss of his or her pub and the effects this has on him or her?  With regard to uimhir a d&oacute;, why is it taking so long to get supports out to these people?  Our committee takes some responsibility.  We were refusing to meet these good people.  They are powerful groups that are good at lobbying.  I thank our guests.  They have started a lobbying organisation to work for their people.  They are the ordinary plain people of Ireland who love to entertain and give solace to people.</p></speech>

With regard to what it is like on the ground, there are a lot of very worried people out there.  Over the last while, they have had to sell equipment to pay bills because the moratoriums are gone.  They have to deal with the banks in respect of mortgages and loans and so are now selling equipment.  The fact that there is so much stuff on sale means that even the equipment they are selling is not worth as much as it should be.  That is creating its own problems.  From July, the rate paid to people who earned less than &euro;200 a week before the pandemic will drop to the level of the jobseeker's payments.  There is no protection for them whereas there are certain protections for those on the pandemic unemployment payment.  The mental stress out there is unbelievable.  The number of phone calls we are dealing with every day is hard to believe.  Before Christmas, we were dealing with Lions Clubs and organisations like it to get vouchers out to people so that they could have a Christmas dinner or buy kids presents.  That is the reality.  Perhaps Mr. McGranaghan would like to take the second question.</p></speech>

That is a great question.  I hope this committee can help us find the answer to it because a &euro;50 million package was promised in October of last year as part of the budget.  It is now 23 June and, so far, &euro;1 million of that &euro;50 million has been spent.  We are anxiously waiting.  Even though MEBAS and the LPSS are there, that money has not yet reached people.</p></speech>

There will not be time for a second round but people had at least one opportunity to speak.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for being here.  I also thank Senator Eugene Murphy, who has been a champion for their organisation.  He has done Trojan work in the background with the MEAI in the context of its convening its committee and making the presentation to us today.</p><p> I am alarmed by the final comment from Mr. McGranaghan concerning the Government's announcement of &euro;50 million in supports and the fact that only &euro;1 million of that funding has reached the artists, musicians and crews involved.  Will Mr. McGranaghan expand on that?</p></speech>

I do not know the breakdown of that funding, where it has got to or if it has reached the artists and the crews, the people most in need of it, as the Chair said.  Regarding MEBAS, we must, in fairness, give credit to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  She has done great work in advocating for the industry.  Could more be done?  Yes, it probably could.  However, MEBAS is the only non-competitive support afforded to the industry and the Minister fought hard to make that happen.  Every other support given to this industry so far is competitive.  Looking at business supports such as the CRSS and the small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, those are not competitive schemes.  Support is provided once the eligibility criteria are met.  Unfortunately, there are criteria involved even in MEBAS which are not present in other Government support schemes such as the SBASC.  We have a minimum business cost to produce.  Strand 2 of MEBAS, for example, offers grant support of &euro;4,000 on turnover of more than &euro;50,000 and up to &euro;100,000.  It is necessary to supply minimum business costs of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 when applying for that strand of MEBAS, but it is not necessary to do that for applications submitted for support from the SBASC.</p></speech>

As Mr. McGranaghan said, it must be acknowledged that the Minister has done Trojan work to champion the industry.  I am sure, however, that she would welcome the opportunity to provide the relevant information to the committee and, ultimately, to the MEAI concerning the plans for the &euro;50 million in non-competitive funding which must be made available to the artists and crews.  Mr. McGranaghan was right when he mentioned the timeframe and it having been seven or eight months since that announcement.  A great deal of money is still to be disbursed to artists.  An announcement was made last week concerning live performance venues that had been successful in their applications to the LPSS, and that was welcome.  In my constituency, however, only one venue was successful in that regard.  Such a successful application can be a lifeline for the bands, musicians and crews involved, and it is important.  That may be another strand of work for this committee to undertake.</p> <p>  With the blessing of the members, I suggest that we write to the Minister regarding Mr. McGranaghan's final point concerning the &euro;50 million in funding which was announced and how it is intended or expected that the remainder of that funding will be disbursed to those most in need of such support.  It is really a survival mechanism.  As Mr. Conboy stated, bands and musicians are selling equipment, and for far less than it is worth, because there is no timeline in sight yet for the type of reopening which will allow those in the sector to use such equipment to perform again.  It is awful to hear those stories, but they are a reality and it is important that we hear them.  Is it agreed that the committee will write to the Minister regarding this issue?  Agreed.  I thank everyone.  Once we get that feedback, we will communicate it to the MEAI for some feedback.</p> <p>  The meeting may have felt short, but it was very informative.  I thank the witnesses and the members of the committee.  Our next session on 30 June will have representatives before the committee from the Arts Council, Theatre Forum Ireland, the Drama League of Ireland, the Amateur Drama Council of Ireland and the Association of Irish Musical Societies to discuss the challenges facing arts venues and theatres as a result of the impact of Covid-19.  That will be a very nice follow-up in the context of what we have heard about today.  Following that session, we will have a shorter one with restaurateur, Mr. Paul Treyvaud, to discuss the challenges facing the restaurant sector due to the impact of Covid-19.</p></speech>

The purpose of today&rsquo;s meeting is to discuss with the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the role of merchant service providers in the travel trade in Ireland.  This is part of the committee's ongoing work on the impact of Covid-19 on the aviation travel industry sectors.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome to today's meeting Ms Cathy Mannion, commissioner of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, and Mr. David Hodnett, deputy commissioner of the Commission for Aviation Regulation.</p> <p>  I will now read the note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially damaging to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee meeting from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament was chosen to sit, namely Leinster house and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked, reluctantly, to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of Leinster House campus.  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to running the meeting are present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask for everyone's forbearance should any technical issues arise.  However, it has been pretty good of late. </p> <p>  I now call on Ms Mannion, who has roughly five minutes.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cathy Mannion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021062300002#A00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to tell it about what we do in relation to the travel trade sector.  By way of background, the Commission for Aviation Regulation was established in 2001.  We have a number of duties.  These including the following. We set the maximum price the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, can collect from airport charges at Dublin Airport.  We review the costs and revenues of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, as air navigation service provider.  We license Irish-based air carriers and authorise ground-handlers.  We investigate complaints about flight cancellations, delays of at least two hours, and instances of denied boarding.  This is more usually referred to as "EC-261 rules".  We investigate complaints about assistance received by passengers with reduced mobility.  We license travel agents and tour operators established in Ireland and administer a bonding scheme for licensed travel agents and tour operators.  We process claims if a travel agent or tour operator goes out of business.  I now turn to describe our work in relation to the Irish travel trade sector.</p> <p>  Tour operators and travel agents established in Ireland apply to our organisation for a 12-month contract.  These licences are usually renewed in April and October of each year.  We spread them out between the April and October round.  We issue a licence when the company has fulfilled certain criteria.  This licensing framework has been in place since 1982, although it has been updated over the years to reflect the ongoing monitoring requirements and a number of European directives that came into play in the intervening years. </p> <p>  To give the committee a feel for the number of licences, in 2020, we issued 181 licences - 24 for tour operators and 157 for travel agents.  This is a reduction compared to 2019 when we issued 211 licences.  During the year, we monitor our licensees, where they provide us with a variety of information, including monthly and quarterly management accounts and audited annual accounts. This is our only role in relation to solvent tour operators and travel agents.  </p> <p> We have a second role and this is where, unfortunately, a tour operator or travel agent is unable to fulfil its obligations to its customers and becomes insolvent.  As part of the licensing process a tour operator is required to put in place a bond calculated as 10% of its projected licensable turnover.  Effectively, that means its forecast future sales for the years ahead.  It must give us a bond for 10% of that amount.  For travel agents, a figure of 4% applies.  These same figures have applied since the 1980s.  In the event that a tour operator or travel agent becomes insolvent, we call on their bond to cover the cost of consumer claims.  Where the bond is insufficient, there is also in place a travellers&rsquo; protection fund.  This is used to cover legitimate claims, where the size of the claim exceeds the amount of the bond.  In this way, the customer is completely covered for legitimate claims.  In principle, the insolvency protection arrangements cover packages - for example, accommodation, flights and transfer from the airport to the hotel would be considered a package - where travel starts in Ireland and where the package has been cancelled due to the insolvency of the licensee.  There are some requirements that need to be met for the claim to be included in the scheme.  In addition, flights from Ireland, booked through a licensee are also covered.  It is important to bear in mind, though, that certain sales are not covered.  These include accommodation only, and items such as visas and insurance.  The important factors are it is a package, the travel starts in Ireland, and the package is cancelled due to the insolvency of the licensee.  </p> <p>  Under secondary legislation dating back to 1983, claimants have 60 days from the date of the collapse to make a claim to us.</p><p>We are in the process of extending the claim period to 120 days to provide affected customers with more time to submit a claim to CAR.  In fact, we have had that in place since Monday of this week and it has been completed.  One of the concerns raised by merchant service providers was that we had only a 60-day period.  We have now extended that period to 120 days, which aligns with some of the period they apply for customers making a claim to them, something I will come to later.<br/><br/>In June 2020, the Government introduced a refund credit note scheme.  This allows licensed tour operators and trade agents to offer refund credit notes to their customers where a booking has been cancelled due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.  By voluntarily accepting a note, customers could book another package holiday in the future and the Government will back the value of the note in the event of insolvency.  This arrangement was put in place to provide additional support to travel agents and tour operators, which are required, under a recent European directive, to provide a refund to customers in certain circumstances .  This arrangement allowed them to offer their customers a refund credit note and that allowed the companies more time to get their own rebate from their suppliers.  At the same time, the Government provided that the travellers' protection fund would be maintained, which was another important aspect of the additional arrangements put in place last year. <br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, merchant service providers give travel agents and tour operators the ability to accept debit and credit cards in payment for goods and services and they charge for this facility.  I understand, from travel industry representatives, that some providers have required significant upfront financial security deposits.  CAR is not a party to these discussions and does not play a role in these commercial relationships.  It is a matter between the merchant service provider and the business in question.<br/><br/>There is one point of interaction between merchant service providers and CAR and this relates to how consumer financial protection arrangements operate in the event of a travel agent or tour operator becoming insolvent.  Following an insolvency, an affected customer may seek to recover moneys from us or from the merchant service provider.  If the customer submits a claim to CAR, it falls under the insolvency protection arrangements.  The customer may also request the credit or debit card provider to consider reversing a transaction because the travel agent or tour operator has not delivered the services paid for.  This is called a charge-back.<br/><br/>In early 2016, in discussions with some merchant service providers, we provided clarity on how our two processes should work.  We agreed that CAR would be the first point of contact for the customer.  Therefore, if we determined that the customer should be paid under the insolvency protection arrangements, the customer would then not be considered in the charge-back process.  This gives clarity to the merchant service provider that the person will come to us first and we will determine whether he or she is part of our scheme.  If the person is part of our scheme, he or she will not be included in the merchant service provider scheme.  If we determine that the claim is not covered in whole or in part under the insolvency protection arrangements, we notify the claimant accordingly and he or she can provide this information to his or her credit or debit card issuer where he or she chooses to explore the charge-back route.  This is an important point.  In this way, we provide clarity to the merchant service provider about what our role and its role are, and we are the first point of contact.  It goes through our service first, before going down the charge-back route.  <br/><br/>As for our process for reviewing claims, when a travel company becomes insolvent, its customers can access a claims form on our website, <i>aviationreg.ie</i>.  We then assess each submitted form, together with all supporting documentation such as receipts, itinerary and proof of purchase.  At the end of this process, we decide whether the claim can be settled in full, in part or rejected, and we notify the claimant accordingly.  The claimant has an opportunity to have the decision reviewed, and in a number of cases, we have reviewed decisions.<br/><br/>At the end of this process, if the claim is not covered in whole or in part by Ireland's insolvency protection arrangements, and if the claimant has paid by credit or debit card, we suggest they may be entitled to a charge-back from his or her bank and that the claimant contact his or her bank if this is the case.  We suggest they provide the bank with our communication as evidence that the claimant does not have a claim under the bond or refund credit note scheme of the insolvent travel company.<br/><br/>It cannot be any clearer than that.  The consumer goes through our process first.  If they get the money from our process, all well and good, and if they are not eligible under our scheme, we communicate this to them and he or she brings that to the bank in order that the bank will know that the consumer has been through our process first.  In addition, where we can, we have provided any necessary clarity to merchant service providers that have contacted us over the years about how Ireland's insolvency protection arrangements work and what is covered by the scheme. <br/><br/>I will conclude with a summary of recent insolvencies.  In 2020, six collapses resulted in claims, the largest of which was USIT Travel Limited, which ceased trading on 27 March.  In total in 2020, we received more than 3,600 claims and these have been closed out.  In 2021, there has been two insolvencies, the later of which was Joe Walsh Pilgrimitours Limited, which ceased trading on 27 April.  To date, we have received roughly 2,489 claims relating to Joe Walsh Pilgrimtours Limited.  We are reviewing these claims and have started to pay out on them.<br/><br/>I hope the committee now has a clear view of our role in respect of the travel trade in Ireland.</p></speech>

This meeting was prompted by concerns raised by the travel agency sector.  Ms Mannion referred to significant sums.  The sector is reporting that in some instances, a cash security of &euro;1.5 million is being sought at short notice.  It has expressed concern that this may have an impact on the sector and that it may, in fact, contribute to and cause failures within the sector.  It has raised a further concern that there has been no indication or basis outlined for the decisions being made by the merchant service providers.  There have been references to risk but there is no proof of that risk and no clear indication.  There has been a suggestion that a differentiation has not been made between the bonded system here and the non-bonded system elsewhere, or between Britain and Ireland.  The processes employed in Britain are just being transferred to Ireland in an entirely different context, and that is of concern.</p> <p>  Is the commission aware of that concern?  Does it share that concern for an industry for which the commission has responsibility in licensing?  Does Ms Mannion have an opinion on how that issue could be resolved?  What level of engagement has the commission had with the merchant service providers, for example, and what have been their asks?  I note the point about the 60-day period versus the 120-day period.  Have there been any other requests?  What useful role can the committee play in supporting efforts to find a quick resolution to this issue?</p></speech>

In 2016, it was very important to have clarity as to whom customers should go first, ourselves or the merchant card providers.  Such clarity reduces the risk providers might see in other markets.  The consumer comes to us first, we deal with the claim and, where it is not part of the our scheme or arrangements, the consumer can choose to seek a chargeback.</p><p> As the Deputy noted, we have moved from 60 days to 120.  That was in response to requests from service providers and followed discussions with our Department.  I just wanted to say those key things.  Our door is always open.  If any of the providers want to talk to us about what is in the scheme, what is outside it and the process we use, we are always happy to speak to them.  That is as much of a role as we can play in this area.</p></speech>

I do not know who the relevant authority is.  Is it the Central Bank, the merchant service providers, MSPs, themselves, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, or the Minister, Deputy Ryan?  Perhaps this can be amended as further contributors come in but I propose that the committee write a letter with regard to this issue which has been identified.  There is a real question mark over whether the process here is fair in light of the real risk that exists, given the fact this is bonded sector.</p> <p>  I also ask that the committee write a letter with regard to the cliff edge the sector new faces with the regard to the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  My understanding is that it has been confirmed the sector will not be supported beyond 12 July and so faces a real cliff edge.  I am clear this is something on which the Ministers, Deputies Varadkar and Ryan, should be contacted.  It is important there be that focus, given the precarious state of the sector as a whole as a result of the implications of Covid.</p></speech>

That is straightforward.  The scheme needs to be extended.  On the first item, we may continue with our deliberations and questions and get a complete picture.  That is why we have Ms Mannion and Mr. Hodnett before us today.  We will then, as a committee, write to whomever we need to write to and do whatever further work we need to do.  It is a good suggestion but we are just starting the process.</p></speech>

I am only a new member of this committee so I am not as familiar with the topic as some of the other members but, from what I am seeing, it seems merchant service providers want to have it both ways.  If an operator gets into trouble or enters liquidation, the Commission for Aviation Regulation is there, but the MSPs seem to want extra deposits and extra security on top of that.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

The legislation is quite specific on this point.  We have to look at matters case by case.  What I am giving the committee today are the high-level principles of how it works.  Generally, if a package is booked and the travel agent or tour operator becomes insolvent resulting in it not being possible for the package to be taken, we step in.  Sometimes the travel agent might become insolvent but the customer has all the necessary information on the booking and so can go on the holiday.  An insolvency does not mean every customer will not be able to take a holiday.  It depends on the case in question.</p></speech>

There are many laws involved, some of which date back to 1982.  Generally, an agency has to be licensed in Ireland to avail of the scheme.  There are other rules that can be enforced in Ireland but I do not propose to get into them today because they involve different sorts of arrangements.</p></speech>

We require them to put in place a bond of 4% of expected turnover for travel agents and 10% for tour operators.  We monitor them during the year to ensure the value of the bond is in line with the projected licensed turnover as the year progresses.  If, unfortunately, one of these companies becomes insolvent, that money can be drawn down.  It is like money in escrow.  We have first call on it.  We draw down the money and use it to settle claims.  If that money is insufficient, Ireland has a travellers' protection fund, which Government ensures is sufficiently funded to cover any excess.</p></speech>

Mr. Hodnett might want to step in on that.  I believe this arrangement ended in 1987.  Since then, the money has been increased over time.</p></speech>

We find that we are drawing more on the Travellers' Protection Fund over time.

I have seen an email from the Department of Transport to a representative of AIB Merchant Services.  It is fair to say that the merchant service providers have been asked in the context of the matter we are discussing to bring clarity and they have not brought clarity.

No matter who we are, for a merchant service provider to decide that 30% or another percentage of the total value of future bookings is the risk is not in line with CAR bonding levels relative to turnover.  That level has broadly worked out for the past 30 years, with a couple of exceptions.  Let us take the 30% figure or the &euro;1.5 million being asked of a travel agent.  Given that the agents have had no trading in the past 18 months and that we have a high bonding indemnity here, surely that is unfair.</p></speech>

On 4 May, the Department of Transport wrote to AIB Merchant Services.

It is important that we support the travel agents who have not done anything wrong.  They are being asked for outrageous amounts of money.

There is a lacuna here.  The practical implication is that it may put travel agents and tour operators out of business in Ireland.</p><p>Many jobs are involved in the tourism sector, so we ask the commission to examine that area.  Beyond what we are going to do as a committee, there is a need for that lacuna in the law to be examined.</p></speech>

Ms Mannion has covered some of what I was going to ask.  The commission has engaged with the merchant service providers and told them exactly what is going on.  They are not confused about how the commission operates, the extent of their risk or the process they have to follow.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

I agree with the Chairman that there is a lacuna here.  There is a failure to regulate or control this.  We should invite in the merchant service providers but we probably need to examine where regulation is necessary.  We all failed when we were considering the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020, which will change the nature of how CAR is going to operate.  The regulatory parts, in any event, are going to become part of the IAA.</p> <p>  Ms Mannion has made her case in regard to that.  We have put on the table that the merchant service providers are being utterly unfair and that we need to find a means of dealing with that and asking them the direct questions.  What is the timeline, as Ms Mannion sees it, and what changes does she foresee in regard to aviation regulation as this new legislation is put into operation?  What is her view on it?  Beyond that, is there scope for new regulation that could deal with this?</p></speech>

It is always best to be part of a larger strand or organisation.  In short, the sooner, the better.  I hope it will all be in place by September or October of this year, if we get through all the necessary processes.</p> <p>  Mr. Hodnett might wish to comment.</p></speech>

Obviously, all legislation will have weaknesses that need to be examined, not least from a point of view of best practice regulation.  Sometimes it is only through interaction with all the stakeholders and by putting something into operation that we can see those weaknesses.  There is a definite difficulty for travel agents and they are being dealt with utterly unfairly.  There is a failure, too, at State level.  I accept that Ms Mannion cannot comment at length in respect of that but we as a committee need to deal with it.</p> <p>  I am happy enough to return to the other members whatever time remains because I know we will be under time pressure.</p></speech>

I accept that she will not able to agree with what I have to say but I want to use a little of my time to make a brief statement.  As a sector, travel agents have been ravaged.  They pay a bond fee to the Commission for the Aviation Regulation, at 4% of their annual turnover, as a safety net to ensure that if somebody goes totally insolvent, or if there are issues with air fare refunds, there will be some clawback and something there to protect them.</p><p>What I have been alarmed by over recent months is that these merchant service providers are on the wings.  Depending on how one views them, they are either an asset to protect the consumer, which they are, given that a person can book by card and there is an additional safety net there, or a vulture to many in the sector because, in some instances, they demand cash security deposits as high as 30% of projected turnover.  In one case in Ireland, they demanded a cash security deposit of &euro;1.5 million, which was absolutely ludicrous and would be crippling for businesses that are trying to function to some degree of normality and have fallen well short of that over the past 15 months.  They are striving to recover, but that will be impossible when they are being charged more than seven times what the commission requires them to hold as a bond.  The merchant service providers are hanging around asking for seven times that.  I accept that Ms Mannion cannot comment on this and I have heard what she said in response to other members, but I just wanted to make that point.</p><p>Ms Mannion sat on the aviation recovery task force last year.  One aspect of its report related specifically to the commission's role and I want to home in on it.  Recommendation No. 5, on Dublin Airport, states:</p> <blockquote> 	The regulatory regime as overseen by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) should continue to apply to Dublin Airport, with a planned Interim Review of the current price-cap determination to be held in the coming months.  Airlines should continue to pay all airport and air navigation charges relating to Dublin.  The Government should provide a rebate directly to the airlines of all Dublin Airport charges and air navigation charges as paid by the airlines.  This would represent State Aid, and it would have to be notified to the European Commission for approval in accordance with State Aid Rules. </blockquote> <p>People have bemoaned the fact that recommendations from the aviation task force have not been implemented.  Again, I do not expect Ms Mannion to comment on that, given that the task force met as a broad entity and we are not individualising this.  Nevertheless, one issue I have seen in the report is that it was intended for the continuance of the commission's regulatory functions at Dublin Airport, so it still has all of this scope.</p><p>As we approach the end of June and look to 19 July as a date from which international air travel will resume, and as we look to the sector bouncing back, is there anything Ms Mannion can say to people who are tuned in and who work in the aviation sector, such as travel agents and others who are concerned about where the sector in general is going, in regard to how pricing charges and the regulatory framework that is in place can be used in a positive discriminatory way to ensure that air travel into and out of Ireland will be shared better with the regions, rather than funnelling everything through our national airport?  Dublin Airport is important - do not get me wrong - but it is equally important to have economic recovery in the regions and air travel to them.  Is there anything in the current regulatory framework that could be used as a positive discrimination tool?</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, we are going through a process of reviewing that.  We had a determination in 2019 but its underlying assumptions became invalid when Covid emerged because the airport's passenger numbers dropped by up to 90% due to the devastating effect it has had.  Since then, there have been two changes to prices for Dublin Airport for 2020 and 2021, effectively suggesting we keep them as they are.  We are in the process of consulting all interested parties as to what we should do from 2022 onwards.</p></speech>

The questions I had intended to ask have been answered.  Travel agents have appeared before the committee previously and I know many of them personally.  They have had a desperate two years and are under considerable pressure to survive.  At a time of crisis in the industry, excessive burdens are placed on travel agents.  Compliance is a big issue.  Anomalies have been highlighted at this meeting and we will need the merchant service providers to appear before the committee.</p><p>In 2020, the commission issued 181 licences, including 24 tour operator licences and 157 travel agent licences.  Part of the commission's role is to monitor a variety of information including monthly and quarterly management accounts, and annual accounts.  The impression we have is that when those 181 licences come up for renewal in October, there will be a significant reduction in the number applying because they are not able to survive the current crisis.  From the commission's information on ongoing checks on travel agents and tour operators, does it feel that there will be 181 applications again in October or does it think that will be reduced significantly?</p></speech>

It has had a difficult time, which we fully appreciate.  Against that background, much of the industry was relicensed last year, which seems positive.  They battened down the hatches and managed costs as well as they could.</p> <p>  Regarding this year, we are finding that for the most part, businesses are on top of their costs.  They are hanging in there, waiting for something to improve.  For many of these companies, bookings in the summer and the months afterwards are of vital importance.  Even in the latest round, many people were licensed, which is positive.  It gives me a feeling that they are managing the situation as well as they can.  I know it is difficult for them but for the most part, they are doing their best to hang in there and to wait for an uptick in sales.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Lowry that we should have the merchant service providers before the committee.  It might give us an opportunity to understand the rationale behind some of their actions.  Maybe we can schedule that at an appropriate time.</p></speech>

We might also write to the Central Bank about the financial regulation of providers.  The more immediate issue is that we have a sense of urgency about getting merchant providers into the committee so that we have an overall view.  The travel agent and tour operator sector is important.  It has come through a difficult time.  This measure that the merchant providers are looking at is placing an impossible burden on the sector.  Deputy Lowry asked how many will renew their licences.  I suggest that if this measure continues, far fewer will renew it.  We need to cover that.</p></speech>

We are discussing the proposals on supports that are necessary to ensure rural air connectivity, with specific reference to Shannon Airport, with the Shannon Chamber in association with the Irish Hotels Federation.  On behalf of the Shannon Chamber we have its director, Mr. Kevin Thompstone, and from the Irish Hotels Federation, Ms Elaina Fitzgerald Kane.  They are both very welcome.  It is sunny in Limerick.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompstone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021062300002#H00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to outline how Shannon Chamber, in conjunction with the Irish Hotels Federation and with the support of Ennis, Galway and Limerick chambers, want to present a solution to the Government to aid the restoration of air connectivity to Ireland and recover routes that were viable before Covid-19.</p> <p>  The aviation sector contributes an estimated &euro;8.9 billion to Ireland's GDP, with foreign tourists making a further &euro;8.7 billion GDP contribution.  It supports 140,000 jobs and attracts 8.8 million overseas tourists arriving by air.  The recent announcement by Aer Lingus that it is closing its crew base at Shannon Airport is a devastating blow to the airport, the Aer Lingus employees and the region generally.  It is an indicator of the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the sector nationally and globally.  The collapse in international travel, through effectively halting aviation in Ireland, has the potential to cause further severe and long-term damage to a critical driver of our economy in the absence of a clear and actionable plan to restore air services to regional airports.  It is against that background that we have prepared a business case setting out the urgent need for a multi-annual, fully funded, regional air access recovery and growth action plan for the aviation sector.  The business case we have prepared outlines the three levels of multi-annual funding airports will require until at least 2024, and potentially as late as 2029, to restore international connectivity to 2019 traffic levels.  That time span is based on EUROCONTROL's most optimistic forecast for a return of Europe's air traffic to 2019 levels.</p> <p>  The three funding levels are the following.  First is multi-year capital expenditure funding to enable our regional airports to survive during the recovery period.  Funding of the order of &euro;32 million annually has already been provided by the Government, and we welcome that.  That level of funding will need to be sustained over the period of the crisis.  The second category of funding is a doubling of Tourism Ireland's tourism marketing funding from &euro;47 million to &euro;94 million, together with an industry activation fund of &euro;92 million over three years, as called for in previous task force reports to the Government.  Finally, and as covered in the aviation task force report from last year, is a fixed euro amount per passenger to subsidise airport charges to enable airlines to restore critical routes to and from North America, the UK and Europe as soon as possible.</p> <p>  To substantiate the business case, particularly for the last item, the fixed euro amount per passenger, we have prepared a detailed traffic recovery support scheme, which we call the TRSS for short, providing costings for the airport charges element of the business case.  The model is based on a review of international traffic and route support schemes in operation in countries such as Spain, Denmark and Cyprus and in other parts of the world, and has been prepared using Shannon Airport's 2019 traffic levels to estimate the level of funding required.  The current assumptions in the financial model show a total cost range of between &euro;20 million and &euro;39 million for Shannon Airport for the period July 2021 to June 2024.  It is calculated based on giving airlines a percentage refund of monthly all-inclusive passenger charges.  The idea is that they will get the refund based on the percentage of traffic they deliver to an airport compared with the same month in 2019.  To be eligible for a refund, an airline would need to achieve or exceed monthly traffic thresholds.  All the detailed assumptions are set out in the model we have shared with you, Chairman.  While the calculations are based on Shannon Airport's traffic figures for 2019, the model can also be used to quantify the funding requirement for all airports, based on their 2019 traffic levels, using the CSO data we have added to the model.</p> <p>  We welcome the Government's special package of &euro;80 million for aviation, which included an EU state aid approved allocation of &euro;20 million for route incentives and charge rebates at Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports covering the winter period that has just finished.  We also welcome the &euro;200 million in horizontal supports which have been provided to the sector through wage subsidies, rates waivers and so on.  However, our business case shows that the levels of supports provided to airports and airlines will need to increase substantially and be multi-annual rather than focused on the recently completed winter season.  The TRSS costs over a multi-annual period, whether for Shannon alone or for all State-owned airports combined, is a fraction of the economic impact of the aviation sector.  For example, the maximum three-year cost of airport charges support for Shannon Airport is less than the annual local economy and Exchequer spend in respect of just three hotels in the region where I am sitting today, Dromoland Castle Hotel, Shannon Springs Hotel and the Great National South Court Hotel, Limerick.</p> <p>  The International Air Transport Association, IATA, has been consistently making the case for international government action to stimulate market recovery in the face of the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors.  The TRSS we are presenting to the Government is our solution to stimulating such a recovery in Ireland, so we are very much in solution mode.  Again, I emphasise that as Shannon Chamber, together with the Irish Hotels Federation and with the support of Galway, Ennis and Limerick chambers, we believe Ireland must adopt this approach, given what is happening internationally, with &euro;173 billion given by governments globally to airlines and airports since the onset of Covid-19, and that is just up to December 2020.  We will be facing into a very competitive aviation marketplace once travel restrictions lift, with airlines favouring airports with lower airport charges and route support facilitating fare reductions to attract and reignite passenger numbers growth.  Ireland's regional airports simply must be enabled to compete.  That is why we need and must have a clear, actionable and fully funded plan to restore connectivity to this island.</p></speech>

According to Mr. Thompstone's analysis of what is occurring in countries across Europe and elsewhere that are trying to attract business and generate a recovery, has there been a mixture of funding for airlines and airports or is it more the role of the airport to ensure that connectivity is linked to a region?  We had representatives of Aer Lingus before the committee yesterday.  Mr. Thompstone may have had an opportunity to see the proceedings.  We were trying to understand why an airline such as Aer Lingus would not make commitments to an airport such as Shannon Airport even though the State is providing significant support to it through loans, etc.  From Mr. Thompstone's experience, does he believe one of the best approaches is to support the airport in the region with the necessary funding to ensure connectivity, and that this is ultimately how we might best achieve the balanced-----</p></speech>

If they have lower airport charges, that increases their potential to restore routes they were previously providing.  When we looked at what was happening around the world, we found that the airport in Copenhagen, for example, is providing airport charge rebates, starting at 45% this year, to airlines that are connecting Copenhagen to global hubs.  We found this was being done in Cyprus as early as last summer.  In Spain, the authorities have introduced a system that is very straightforward and simple.  They are saying that a rebate will be given on airport charges <i>pro rata</i>based on the level of traffic this year compared to that in 2019, before Covid.<br/><br/>The critical piece in our model is that the Government would provide the airport with the cash needed to pass on lower airport charges to airports.  Why do we say &quot;to airports&quot;?  It is because the airports currently do not have any income stream because the airlines are not flying.  If they can be got back flying, an income stream will come in.  The airports need the income stream to run their operations.  It is for a defined period.  We have modelled from July of this year to June 2024 to coincide with the optimistic scenario coming from EUROCONTROL.  The idea is that, for the defined period, regional state airports, in particular, would get a sum in euro per passenger and, in turn, pass on the saving to the airlines, but with the incentive that if the airline hit a threshold based on 2019 levels of traffic, it would get back a portion of its airport charges <i>pro rata</i>.  We start the rate at 35% this year, rising to 50% next year, and then to 70% and, ultimately, 80%.  Indeed, if an airline reached a higher level, it would also get back a <i>pro rata</i>rebate.  If it reached 100% of its 2019 level, it would get back the full rebate.  The arrangement is designed to be very straightforward and easy to understand.  If 2019 levels are reached, one gets back a proportion of the airport charges.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Thompstone.  To some extent, his proposal can be used by all airports.  From my observation of what is happening across Europe, the same kinds of things are being done for all airports.  Coming from the Shannon region &ndash; others will have a similar view &ndash; I believe it is about ensuring the best outcome as the recovery takes place in Ireland, which is ultimately a small island where airlines are trying to consolidate for the obvious reason that they are under enormous pressure.  They are trying to consolidate out of one location, principally Dublin.  Is there anything in the schemes Mr. Thompstone has devised that can be applied exclusively to Shannon Airport?  The bottom line is that if there is a scheme that covers all airports, they will try to reduce their costs, as we know.  They have already got rid of the crew base at Shannon Airport.  Mr. Thompstone, from his experience, will be conscious of the state aid rules and all that go with them, as am I.  Is there an imaginative way to design a scheme that would protect the foundations at Shannon Airport so we could build upon them to protect and enhance the recovery in the region?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompstone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021062300002#J00700"><p>In response to what Senator Dooley is saying, the first point is that in July 2020 the Aviation Task Force, in its recommendations on airport charges, said the Commission for Aviation Regulation should decide on charges for Dublin Airport as it would normally.  Separately, for the regional airports, particularly the regional State-owned airports of Cork and Shannon, there is a need for some kind of intervention to incentivise airlines to come back in.  The proposal we are putting forward would be for the regional airports, including those in Shannon and Cork but also those in Donegal, Knock and Kerry.  The reason for that, from a state aid point of view, is that we are trying to minimise the red-circling.  The more one red-circles in respect of a geographical area or sector, the greater the issues from a state aid point of view.  Therefore, we are trying to make it very much a regional issue.  After that, it is really up to the airports and airlines to work together.  The most innovative airports will attract the traffic in the end.  Shannon Airport has a strong base from which to work.  One should remember that we are talking about restoring routes that were viable up to 2019.  It is not about new business; it is about getting back the Shannon-Heathrow, Shannon-New York and Shannon-Boston services and so on.  This also applies to other airports.  The services in question are what provide the passenger feed for the hospitality and leisure sectors and what enable internationally traded companies in Ireland, be they foreign owned or Irish owned, to engage with their customers and supply chains and so on.  The connectivity is vital.  It is very much about regional connectivity.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Thompstone and Ms Elaina Fitzgerald Kane from the Irish Hotels Federation.  Like other members from the Clare and Limerick region, I have had a lot of engagement with the Shannon Chamber around this proposal, which I believe is a very strong proposal.  It is evidence based and a lot of work has gone into it.  I welcome that it is a collaborative approach between the Irish Hotels Federation and the chambers of commerce at Shannon, Ennis, Limerick and Galway.  It is a strong combined effort.  I propose that this committee would endorse the proposal in full and that we would put our whole weight behind it as a committee to recommend to Government that it adopts this approach.  There have been some lifesaving measures provided by the Government in supports but we need a pathway forward and we need to ensure that it is a multiannual approach.  There is a strong emphasis on multiannual in this report, be it capital expenditure funding or incentives around passengers and marketing.  Shannon Airport is so important to the mid-west and the western region and to all the hospitality and businesses that need this vital connectivity.  I want to emphasise that point.  Will Mr. Thompstone please explain how important the Heathrow route is to Shannon and to the mid-west, and especially for business connectivity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.554" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompstone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021062300002#K00200"><p>I would be happy to do that.  The Shannon-Heathrow route is a scheduled service and we have three flights a day.  Pre-Covid we were at about 40 flights a week.  That Shannon-Heathrow connectivity connects Ireland to a global hub in London Heathrow.  In my day-to-day commercial business I spend most of my time in countries around the world, be it in Africa, the Middle East Asia and Europe.   I would fly to a client's location for one week or two weeks.  Typically, I could be found at 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday evening catching that Shannon service into Heathrow and then I would take an overnight flight from Heathrow and arrive into southern Africa or the Middle East or Asia.  What is interesting about doing this regularly is that I meet other business people, from not just the Shannon free zone but also from Galway, Limerick and other areas who are catching that very same flight.  We will also usually meet in the connection centre at Heathrow going to all corners of the earth.  Similarly, the route is a vital link for the tourism side.  Transatlantic connection is very important but Heathrow is also a source for generating a significant amount of back haul traffic into Shannon Airport and the wider Wild Atlantic Way.  </p> <p>  I will put this into perspective.  Transatlantic Shannon Airport numbers in 2018 would have been the bones of 500,000 or 450,000 passengers on transatlantic services.  Consider hotels such as Dromoland Castle in Clare.  It would have had about 16,000 American bed nights up to 2018-2019 and 75% to 80% of those would have come through Shannon Airport.  That business is gone.  The same situation applies to many of the Irish Hotels Federation member companies that Elaina is representing today.  A scheduled service like that and the connectivity it provides to a global market is absolutely vital for the hotel industry, the hospitality industry and the leisure sector.  It is also vital for foreign direct investment and Irish owned businesses who are trading internationally.  Such connectivity is a critical piece of economic infrastructure and is not available to us today.</p></speech>

I was very interested in reading the traffic recovery support scheme, TRSS, statement on how that would work.  Perhaps Mr. Thompstone will give us some figures on how he came up with the projected numbers that he has.  I assume that they are coming from the European model of what will come out after recovery.  Mr. Thompstone has answered most of the questions I had about being back to the 2019 levels, and if the airlines do not reach that level they do not get a refund or whatever.  Obviously then there is the exponential growth and the more flights they bring in the more passengers they bring in.  I do not have to tell anyone in this room how important the flights are - especially those Shannon-Heathrow connections - for the economy, for business and for families.  A lot of Irish people have family connections in the UK and there are ongoing connections too.  Will Mr. Thompstone outline for the committee the concerns that the chamber is getting from business people?  Are they concerned about the cabin crew base going from Shannon?  Do the businesses see this as a threat to the Heathrow slot?  Are they telling the IHF that they are concerned about that?  Will Mr. Thompson give us feedback on what he is hearing from the businesses?</p> <p>  I would also like some more information on how Mr. Thompstone has modelled the figures.  I worked in the travel industry for 19 years and I know how difficult it is to get routes in and especially to bring them back once they have ceased being with an airline.  My time is very short and I appreciate Mr. Thompstone answering those questions.</p></speech>

On the TRSS and how it works, at a minimum level and just month by month, consider July this year for example.  We would say to airlines that if they hit a minimum level of 35% of the traffic they had in July 2019, we will give them back the same proportion of their airport charges.  We are not saying that it is 1%, 2% or 3%: the airlines must hit a minimum threshold.  We want something back from the airlines, which is a minimum level of traffic.  If the airlines hit that we would give them back their airport charges <i>pro rata</i>.  If they go above that and hit 50%, 60%, 80% or 100% they will get back those charges also.  If every airline was to hit 2019 levels of traffic just at the threshold level of 35% this year, going up to 50% next year and graduating up to 80% the total cost would be &euro;20 million over the three years of the programme.  If every airline was to hit 100% the total cost would be &euro;38 million or &euro;39 million.  This is the  equivalent - at the upper end - of what three hotels, for example Dromoland Castle, Shannon Springs Hotel and the South Court Hotel in Limerick, would pay out in wages and Exchequer contributions annually.  So the payback is very quick.<br/><br/>With regard to the Aer Lingus decision to close the cabin crew base at Shannon, it is regrettable.  I particularly feel for the Aer Lingus employees and staff there.  While I do not know many of them not personally, as a frequent user of the airport I know all of their faces and their names.  It is important to emphasise, however, that although Aer Lingus is taking the crews out this does not necessarily mean that Aer Lingus will not be bringing the services back.  It would mean that they will have to position crews into Shannon.  The business community's questions on this are about whether there are any implications for the timings of flights in and out of Shannon airport as a result.  The same would apply to Cork Airport if any such decision was to be made there in the future.  I heard the CEO engaging yesterday with the chairman.  Aer Lingus is obviously under significant financial pressure and are now looking at every angle to cut costs.  This brings us back to why the traffic recovery support scheme is so important.  We must recognise that for a defined period of time the airports are going to be in difficulty and need to be sustained during the recovery period.  That is when governments should be intervening, when there is a market failure and when there is a problem particularly with economic infrastructure.  I put it to the committee that connectivity to Heathrow, to Europe and to north American market is a critical piece of economic infrastructure to the whole of the Atlantic economic corridor, wherever one is in that space.</p></speech>

I also have a query on the Shannon-Heathrow slot which is critically important to us.  Mr. Thompstone said that he flies out to Africa, to Asia and other places.</p><p>I know many people who are doing similar things.  My concern is that when an airline is not based in Shannon, we are depending on flights coming elsewhere.  If a flight goes technical out of Dublin first thing in the morning, then we are goosed.  I know Aer Lingus has claimed it will not do that, but our job as public representatives is to keep the pressure on in that regard.  I believe the TRSS is a very good scheme.  I am sure other airlines will do something very similar.  We need to ensure we sell it as best we can.  People have vented their frustration.  They want to travel as soon as soon as we can get through the pandemic.</p></speech>

As the Chairman and other members know, there is significant engagement with Shannon Chamber, the Irish Hotels Federation and all who hold Shannon close to their hearts and have concern for the airport.  Far more happens beyond the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.</p> <p>  I have read Mr. Thompstone's document, which was already presented to us in the county some weeks ago.  What is proposed is very innovative.  Three countries, Spain, Denmark and Cyprus, have operated schemes along the lines of the suggested traffic recovery support scheme.  Mr. Thompstone is correct to say that this money will recirculate in the economy because landing planes on the tarmac in Shannon means that the passengers they carry will exit the airport and, invariably, spend their money in local shops and restaurants.  They sleep overnight in local hotels.  The economy is cyclical.  The money comes back in and goes around.  It is similar to the way people said the construction industry works in that 70% of the money circulates right back through the economy again and everything comes full circle.</p> <p>  Intervening in Shannon has effects throughout the region.  The two are interlinked.  They are cogs of a wheel going in the same direction.  The economy in our region lives and dies in Shannon.  I do not use the word "dies" in a pessimistic way.  They are so symbiotically linked such that if one is damaged, the other also gets damaged.  The proposed scheme is very innovative.  It would involve a sliding scale that would take account of where figures are on a seasonal basis and thereby would allow the Exchequer to adjust.  That is a point I have been making to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  This intervention can absolutely work.  The document is self-explanatory.</p> <p>  I want to change my questioning somewhat.  I commend the witnesses before us.  Two and a half years ago, they came forward with a document to reinvigorate Shannon Airport and air connectivity into an out of the mid-west.  I refer to the report compiled by Copenhagen Economics and commissioned jointly by the chambers of commerce in the mid-west.  It was issued at a time when Shannon was faltering and trudging along because it was competing against Dublin.  Things were not very rosy.  However, this document has a new sparkle to it because it is very relevant as we get beyond 19 July and as we look towards summer scheduling and, moreover, a recovery.</p> <p>  This needs to be looked at in tandem with a capital expenditure, capex, per passenger intervention involving a capping of the number of passengers who can land at the capital's airport.  Before people in Dublin start jumping on Twitter, I am not looking to shut Dublin down.  This works very successfully in the Netherlands where there is an annual cap of 500,000 flights into that nation's capital airport.  That has resulted in many airlines using the airports in Eindhoven, Rotterdam and The Hague.  It has driven far more traffic and given rise to a 6% to 10% boost in air travel via those airports.  That was one of the recommendations from a year and a half or two years ago.  Does Mr. Thompstone believe that is still in the mix?</p></speech>

It is indicative of how important chamber members regard connectivity through airports in the regions.  Every argument I am making here today applies equally to Cork Airport as it does to Shannon or any other airport in the western region.  The Copenhagen report highlighted that very few if any countries in Europe or the rest of the world have the level of concentration of air traffic that Ireland has on Dublin with over 90%.  In February, the Government announced the route incentive scheme which was very welcome.  It provided &euro;26 million of which &euro;20 million was for Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.  As the incentive scheme is based on 2019 levels of traffic, by definition most of it will go to Dublin Airport.  We need a strong capital city and we need a strong Dublin Airport, but we also need strong regional connectivity.  Our issue is with the level of concentration in Dublin.</p> <p>  The rationale for either capping or incentivising more traffic into Cork and Shannon is to reduce the level of congestion.  One of the things we have learned from the Covid pandemic is that there is a significant premium on space - space around people and ability to move into and out of an airport quickly.  We can contribute to the Covid solution by bringing more traffic into Cork and Shannon airports.  It is not an either-or in that sense.  It is not about equity.  It is about coming up with something that is sensible for our economy, for our country and for our people.</p> <p>  This comes back to the argument for intervention.  If we do nothing and just leave it to the market forces, then the Copenhagen Economics people will be back in two, three, four or five years' time and that number will be 99%, which would not be good for the country.</p></speech>

Apart from a Turkish Airlines 747 which lands there quite regularly, DHL flights etc, there is very little cargo traffic.  Some 1% of cargo leaving Ireland goes by air.  I was alarmed to see crates of cargo from Boston Scientific, each valued at &euro;1 million, on pallets on the apron of Shannon Airport to be trucked overnight to Heathrow, to fly back over our skies again to the United States.</p> <p>  We all talk about passengers who go on the ground and spent money in Ms Fitzgerald Kane's hotel and other hotels throughout the region.  Based on its long runway, the capacity of its hangers etc., does Mr. Thompstone envisage the potential for more air cargo into and out of Shannon airport in tandem with this?  I thank Mr. Thompstone and Ms Fitzgerald Kane.</p></speech>

It could be high-value low-volume goods in the belly of aircraft that are carrying passengers.  During the pandemic, a very high volume of cargo traffic has come through Shannon Airport.  It is a very competitive business which is why some cargo goes by road.  One of the things we have learned during the pandemic is that businesses value choice.  We need multiple points of connection to our key markets.  It is strategically weak for us as a country to have everything go through one seaport connection as we have discovered through the UK.  The very same argument applies to air cargo.  I definitely see potential in that space for airports in the western region.</p></speech>

We had very good engagement with them. On 6 May we would have presented to the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton.  She was accompanied by advisers and Department officials.  We had a good engagement that day.  We have shared all the documentation the members have, namely, the business case from March, the more detailed presentation in May and the Excel model that backs everything up, with the Minister for Transport and senior members of Government.  We have a meeting scheduled, the latest date I have for it 16 July, with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and we look forward to that engagement.  </p> <p>  As I emphasised, we are here today to talk about the need for an action plan.  We cannot just wait and leave it to the market.  That action plan has to be put together now.  We cannot wait until all the public health issues are resolved.  Now is the time to plan.  That plan must be multiannual; it cannot be just for a winter period or a summer period.  It has to be in line with the forecasted recovery, which in the most optimistic scenario is looking like 2024.  It also has to be funded.  There is a defined period of time for this.</p></speech>

We will write to the Minister for Transport and the Government indicating our full support for it.  We will be engaging with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in the Chamber next week; this is a matter members will be able to raise with him.</p> <p>  I want to touch on two issues.  Regarding the scheme the group has put in place, if an airline carries 35% of the passenger numbers it had in a month, say, July, in a previous year, and if its passenger numbers for that month were 100,000, it would have to carry 35,000 passengers in the month of July.  If its numbers increase to 50% of the passenger numbers for that relative month, how much funding would the airline get back from the Government?  What funds will Shannon Airport get from the State?  To drill it down, if the airline carries 50% of the passengers in a respective month relative to that month in a previous year, which is 15% above the 35% figure, how much funding it get from the State?</p></speech>

If it were to hit 50%, it would get back 50% of the airport charges.  That is why there is a minimum cost and a maximum cost in the scheme.  The minimum cost is if they just hit the threshold.</p></speech>

The reason for that is we want to incentivise airlines to do as much as possible but at the same time there is a minimum floor they must hit.</p></speech>

We are assuming market conditions will improve and, therefore, the likelihood of airlines coming back will increase.  We would start this year with the summer season with a threshold of 35%, we would drop it down in the winter season to 30% because that is when it is hard to get airlines flying.  During next year's summer season we would move it up to 50%, in the following year we would move it 70% and then we would move it to 80%.  It would have a stepped effect.</p></speech>

I thank the members for this opportunity to speak with them.  We appreciate their time and interest.  With respect to Covid, ours is a decimated industry that operates in a symbiotic relationship with aviation.  We ran at a level of 30% of our overall revenue last year.  We have had five months of closure.  We are taking baby steps into recovery as part of the quasi reopening we have in so far as we are open to residents only or for outdoor service.  To give members an indication of the summer months, what would be considered the peak season of June, July and August, hotel occupancy in Limerick city is running at 16%.  Essentially, that means only one out of every ten bedrooms is occupied.  Ours is the worst performing region in the country despite all the fantastic amenities we have.  It was great to see F&aacute;ilte Ireland's development plan launched this week.  </p> <p>  In essence, hotels across the country, in the main, are only existing because of the life support they have been on from the Government perspective.  The outlook is poor.  We could not be confident about it, particularly in the context of international travel.  There is some uncertainty about the sector reopening on 19 July.  If the reopening goes ahead, and everybody hopes it will, we also hope public health plans will progress, but what will that look like for the sector?  We are cognisant a number of southern European countries, in particular, announced very early when they would reopen.  They have made some progress ahead of us.  There is also a sense of progress markers.  At what points will we see changes in that respect?</p> <p>  As Mr. Thompstone mentioned, our tourism industry is worth &euro;9 billion.  Some &euro;7 billion odd of that comes from overseas and less than &euro;2 billion comes from the domestic market.  Irish people have been fantastic in supporting hotels across the country last year when they could but Covid has had a major impact.  During the worst period of the pandemic in our 270,000 job-strong tourism industry, some 160,000 jobs were lost.</p> <p>  In the areas represented by the Shannon, Limerick, Clare and Galway chambers, 50,000 jobs in the tourism sector alone would fall within those areas.  If we were to extend that along the western seaboard and take into the consideration the other regional airports, for which the case is also being made today, we would be talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Tourism represents one in ten of all jobs in Ireland and 70% of those tourism jobs are outside Dublin.  As many members know from their constituencies, sometimes tourism is the only show in town.  It has a significant impact on suppliers and the retail sector.  When we had the first lockdown, in my home village of Adare, the shops closed very soon after the hotels just before the lockdown.  They are very interlinked.  That is the reality of it.  Reference was made to the business community and foreign direct investment.  We cannot exist without it.  Regional airports such as Shannon, Cork and the others are the lifeline to the area.  We are really feeling the hit.</p><p>To answer the question regarding doubling the tourism marketing fund, that was something suggested initially as part of the tourism recovery task force, of which I was a member.  To give an idea of its scale, in previous times, every euro Tourism Ireland spent on overseas marketing led to &euro;130 in tourism revenues.  If that ratio of 130:1 is not return enough, it tells its own story in terms of the ability of tourism to contribute.  Prior to Covid, tourism contributed &euro;2 billion per annum to the Exchequer.  We believe the impact of tourism is critical in terms of supporting Shannon.  The Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, has suggested, as has Mr. Thompstone in his report, that recovery may not come until 2024 and as an island nation, we have a lot more to do, particularly given that the restrictions have been a bit tougher than what was experienced across Europe.  Particularly from a regional perspective, this is a really proactive approach.  It is three-pronged and looks at multi-year capex.  As Mr. Thompstone mentioned earlier, airlines simply have no income.  It also looks at the doubling of the Tourism Ireland marketing fund and an industry activation fund because one cannot exist without the other.  The last piece is the TRSS.  The merits of it speak for themselves.  The impact of the visitors to the area, not to mention the business community, is the glue that ties our whole region together.  The committee will see a similar glue in the other regional airports as well.  Hopefully, that answers the Chairman's question.  </p></speech>

It is a sensible approach to rebuilding.  I compliment them on their initiative.  They have put forward a very compelling case, which is accompanied by a strong business plan.  It is innovative and shows vision and ambition, which is what we require at this difficult time.  It deserves moral and practical support and I have no doubt the committee will endorse the report, put its authority behind it and seek Government intervention, as outlined in the report.</p> <p>  We mentioned Clare, Limerick and Galway.  It is also important to remember that Shannon is of significant importance to Tipperary, an area I represent, and north Tipperary in particular.  A large number of our people work in Shannon or rely on the Shannon hub for connectivity.  In particular, Lough Derg and our tourism sector feed off Shannon Airport and the Shannon region.  Many involved in our business sector rely on connectivity through Shannon to run their enterprises properly.  I listened to the T&aacute;naiste last week in the D&aacute;il put forward a suggestion that we should promote Shannon as a cargo hub.  This indicates that there is Government support for that initiative and the witnesses should pursue this in a more formal manner and possibly make a business plan for that particular project within the business plan.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations today, which were very professional, and assure them of our support.  </p></speech>

It is great to see Ms Fitzgerald Kane from the Woodlands Hotel in Adare here.  It is the most beautiful village in Ireland.  I have great memories of her hotel and am delighted to see her here.  I support everything the witnesses are trying to do.  I would sound a note of caution.  I live in Dublin now instead of Galway.  Many people on this side of the country are asking what is the big issue as with motorways nowadays, one can be in Dublin within an hour and a half, two hours or whatever.  Consequently, they think there is no great need for the regional airports or the emphasis on them.  I ask the witnesses to look for additional funding for marketing, particularly for Shannon and Cork airports.  I will not talk too much about Cork too much because I do not know as much about it as some of those present.  I first flew from Shannon in 1968 to London as a boy and have great memories of that airport.</p> <p>  I have significant concern about the negative press relating to Shannon because of flights by US forces.  I want to put on the record that nothing illegal is happening.  Those aircraft are flying in under UN chapter and are perfectly legal.  We have a paper on that if anybody cares to contact me about it.  I wish the witnesses the best.  Some of my colleagues from the region may wish to get back in there.  </p></speech>

My questions may touch on issues raised previously.  I will start with the recent announcement by Aer Lingus and the closure of its cabin crew base.  In light of the fact that there has been no commitment to resume the vital Heathrow route, could the witnesses comment on the direct and indirect knock-on effects on tourism and hospitality business owners in the region they have seen or that have been relayed to them?  No conclusions have been drawn on the back of numerous reviews and reports and task force recommendations have not been implemented by the Department of Transport.  Therefore, very little action has been taken.  How has this affected confidence in the region?  This is something with which I am particularly concerned.</p> <p>  What does Shannon Chamber anticipate with regard to the strategic review of Lufthansa and will this result in its closure?  Do the witnesses think that Shannon Group should intervene to prevent further decline in the aviation industry base at Shannon?  Do the witnesses anticipate a decrease in foreign direct investment in Shannon if connectivity continues at its current rate?  To date, has the Government committed to or considered a capital investment scheme such as the witnesses' proposal of the TRSS?  Has the Government engaged with Shannon Chamber and taken on board the measures outlined in detail in the presentation to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, several months ago?  </p> <p>  I will touch on something mentioned in the witnesses' responses.  They spoke about Spain being an example of best practice or a country that has modelled their TRS scheme.  In light of this, can the witnesses give us an example of what Spain has provided for regional airports akin to Shannon?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.589" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompstone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021062300002#N00500"><p>I thank everyone for their support for the proposal, which is very much appreciated.  In response to Deputy Wynne's questions, I would always be a glass half-full person.  One of the things I can say about aviation over the years having worked in economic development and in aviation, particularly in Shannon and around the area over many years, is that it is a cyclical business and there will be ups and downs.  Aviation is clearly in a down phase at present.  The airline industry and the wider aviation sector are impacted, which is why we are talking about Lufthansa Technik doing a review of its operations.  I have been around and have seen a lot of those in the past.  Many of the businesses that are there today have been through multiple ownerships but the one success we always have in Shannon is reinventing to deal with whatever issues are thrown at us from the marketplace.</p><p>I would be very confident about Shannon's future from that point of view.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, the Aer Lingus decision on the cabin crew base in Shannon is regrettable, particularly from the point of view of the people working there who are directly affected and their families.  At the same time, though, I would be confident that we will see Aer Lingus flying into Shannon again.  The question is when.  Hopefully, it will be sooner rather than later.  I would be confident because, as Ms Fitzgerald Kane mentioned earlier, right up and down the Wild Atlantic Way, we have a superb tourism project.  We know there is pent-up demand around the world for that.  With Tourism Ireland getting the marketing funding we are proposing on the back of previous task force recommendations, we believe the message will go out to the world that Ireland is open for business.</p><p> If we can back that up with the route incentive scheme we are proposing today, there will be a market for the future.  The same also applies to foreign direct investment.  We have blue-chip companies, most of them run by Irish people, regardless of where the ownership is, up and down the Atlantic economic corridor, whether it is in Castlebar, Galway, Ennis, Shannon, Limerick or Cork.  We have a strong base there and we have good, practical Irish and non-Irish people working in those businesses.  They will push, as they have always done, to make sure those businesses succeed.</p><p> That brings us all the way back to the reason we are here today, which is that governments intervene when there is market failure.  We clearly have market failure now.  Our recommendation is to intervene for a defined period during the recovery to enable that critical mass we have, be it in tourism, hospitality, leisure, manufacturing or the international service industry to realise its potential, as we have shown in the past.  If the Government does that, it will get the payback as our numbers have shown.</p></speech>

I thank our two witnesses for attending.  I concur with the sentiments expressed by many members on the need to enhance regional connectivity.  Not surprisingly, coming from County Cork, I have a particular Cork angle.  I do not make any apology for that.  I thank the witnesses for the presentation.</p> <p>  If NPHET recommends to Government that we do not proceed with the roadmap for opening in July, how would Ms Fitzgerald Kane describe the impact or import of that decision to the sector if it were to occur?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-23a.593" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elaina Fitzgerald Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021062300002#O00400"><p>It would have a profound impact.  I am in a hotel in Dublin right now as a guest.  The doors are locked for people who are not staying in the hotel.  Some hotels have such a close link with their communities.  When they cannot provide indoor dining, it is a huge part of their business.  Not being able to reopen at a fuller scale or a restricted version of a fuller scale will have a huge impact on businesses, teams and communities.  It is untenable and, in some cases, businesses have not been open for 16 months.</p> <p>  One of the points I will make is that we as hoteliers, and I am sure I can say this on behalf of all the tourism community, cannot wait for the point where we are not dependent on supports, which we are.  They are so welcome, particularly now as we are trying to recruit people and retrain them.  It is like starting all over again but the notion of not being able to proceed to the next level would have a hugely devastating effect.  It is across all elements of one's business, whether it is indoor dining or weddings with a couple whose hopes and dreams have been put on hold.  Any threat to international travel is untenable given the fact that other countries are open and have more clarity around their lead time and what it will look like.  As an island nation, with &euro;9 billion in tourism revenue and &euro;7 billion of that coming from overseas, any further threat to that is just untenable.  It is something I do not want to think about.  It will make the road to recovery so much more difficult than it already is.  That is 270,000 livelihoods in terms of tourism, not to mention the other people who are affected.  We have seen that it is catastrophic.</p> <p>  In the context of Government, we often hear the sector was the first and hardest hit but the last to recover.  That is the difficult bit and that is where we need the most help.  We are very thankful for what has been put in place.  If we want to get back to having sustainable levels of activity to sustain regions and communities, however, this three-point plan needs to be put in place to pivot us to be the best version we can be.</p></speech>

I will finish on this.  The issues around the tourism marketing funding, industry activation fund and route incentivisation schemes are initiatives that we as a committee should support at all levels and actively pursue.

My local publican, Mr. Charlie Chawke, is from Adare.  I know Adare very well and I believe the region has so much to offer.</p> <p>  I have always admired Shannon as the birthplace of things like duty-free and Irish coffee.  Aeroflot's fuel farm was there in the 1980s and 1990s and so on.  Shannon has been a significant part of Irish aviation forever and I certainly want to see it do well.</p> <p>  I would often be much happier if not everybody was flying or had to fly out of Dublin.  It benefits people who do not or should not have to come to Dublin for all the flights.  If we can share that aircraft and airport traffic better across the entire island, it would be good for everybody, including sometimes on days when Dublin Airport is enormously congested.  Do not think that just because we are in Dublin we want to keep it all for ourselves.  That is not the case.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on route incentivisation.  Is that purely and only for returning traffic?  It is not for new routes.  It is just for routes that were there in 2019.</p></speech>

The way we set the scheme up is for the recovery of traffic and routes that existed up to 2019 that were viable.  That is our whole objective.  It is getting back routes that were operating successfully beforehand but because of the pandemic and restrictions on travel have not been able to operate over the period.</p> <p>  We said in our assumptions to the model that airlines could opt for either the existing route support schemes that most airports have already or the traffic recovery support scheme we are putting forward but not both.  It is one or the other.</p></speech>

How much of the business was Ryanair's in 2019 in terms of the total passengers carried?  Has Mr. Thompstone had negotiations with Ryanair on what it might be able to do if these systems were put in place?</p></speech>

If we were to go back five, six or seven years ago, Ryanair was a major contributor to traffic at Shannon Airport.  It had reduced the number of services in recent years.  The great thing about Shannon Airport in recent years is that if people were taking transatlantic flights, for example, a whole range of airlines were flying transatlantic routes.  Between Cork and Shannon airports, at the peak in summer 2018 I believe just short of 50 transatlantic services were coming into Ireland every week.  We are not just talking about Aer Lingus but United Airlines, American Airlines and Norwegian Air.  I am sure I have missed others.  We have a good product.</p></speech>

I know it is at approximately just under 2 million for the past ten years or so.  What is the actual total capacity?  What could Shannon Airport comfortably handle going through it in a year?  Is it 10 million or 15 million?  What is it?</p></speech>

That is a message our committee should take.  Rather than having to build loads of extra terminals for capacity in Dublin if we get back to pre-pandemic levels, which I accept will not be today or tomorrow, we should try to make sure that Shannon Airport and the regions outside Dublin, which is a region in itself, also do well.  It is in everybody's interest.  I wish both witnesses the very best.</p></speech>

The Senator is right.  If we can reduce congestion in Dublin, it will improve the visitor and passenger experience there.  Taking my own situation, for example, it also means I will not be heading off on a Friday evening or a Saturday morning to drive to Dublin, unsure of when I will get to Dublin Airport because of the traffic and congestion on the M50, and spending an extra day travelling in both directions.  If you take a layman's business, passengers are flying into Dublin, spending their time there and being bussed to the Cliffs of Moher with very little local economic impact.  Again, that leads to more congestion in Dublin.  We know from the Covid-19 pandemic that we need more space.  Yes, we need a strong capital city and Dublin Airport, but there is unrealised potential in our regional airports, particularly-----</p></speech>

There has been a whole range of engagement with various aviation interests, including airport leasing companies, manufacturing maintenance companies, the hotels, Tourism Ireland and the airports themselves.  We have not yet engaged directly with airlines but we are very much open to doing so.  It is a marathon, not a sprint, so we will be working on it constantly.  We started work on it back in January.  That will continue over the coming months until we get the right result.  It is too important for our economy.  We cannot appear to get it wrong.</p></speech>

We have gone over time.  It is a very important subject.  Phenomenal work has been done, specifically by Mr. Thompstone in respect of the document he has produced and Ms Fitzgerald Kane in her role as president of the Irish Hotels Federation.  They have worked together to prepare the proposal.  I also acknowledge the work of the Shannon Chamber CEO, Ms Helen Downes, along with its president, Mr. Stephen Keogh, who have also worked on the proposal.  It is very practical.</p> <p>  The proposal for a Covid-19 traffic recovery support scheme, TRSS, which in effect supports routes, is very well researched and is grounded in fact.  It seeks to restore the type of aviation connectivity that existed before the pandemic.  The proposal looks at routes that were vibrant before the pandemic and Shannon specifically in terms of its huge capacity.  There is a large multinational base and a large tourism sector there.  How many airlines were flying transatlantic out of Shannon Airport before the pandemic?</p></speech>

We are fully behind this proposal.  We will follow it up with the Department and Government.  Perhaps the witnesses could inform us of the outcome of their deliberations with the Minister.  There is also an element of active engagement with the airlines.  I ask the witnesses to provide us with feedback from that engagement.</p> <p>  I represent Limerick city.  I know how important Shannon is to the mid-west.  It is the jewel in the crown.  It brings the tourists in and the multinationals into the area, and it facilitates travel from the area.  We are an island nation.  Along the western seaboard and in the mid-west, in particular, Shannon is key.  We fully endorse the proposal as a committee.  Perhaps the witnesses will also explore the cargo aspect.  We must go onwards and upwards.  I have not seen a proposal like this in some time.  It is thought-out, specific, easy to understand, results-driven and based on viable routes.
