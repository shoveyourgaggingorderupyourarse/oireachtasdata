    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2022020200002#A00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to present the Revised Estimates for 2022 to the committee.  Budget 2022 was set with the ongoing challenges of Brexit and Covid in the background and in the transition between the current Common Agricultural Policy and the new CAP.  The agriculture Vote for 2022 provides my Department with the resources to deal with these current challenges and opportunities across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, marine and forestry.</p> <p>  My sole focus as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the protection and enhancement of the incomes of those who are the bedrock of the sector, namely, farmers, fishers and food producers and their families.</p><p>In a time of transition, farmers can have confidence that the budget protected farm family income and supported action to improve safety and sustainability on farms.  We succeeded in protecting all the crucial farm schemes and the budget provision allowed us to provide additional funding for a number of policy priorities.<br/><br/>The resilience of the sector is demonstrated by the fact that exports of agrifood products in 2021 are estimated to be around &euro;15.2 billion, an increase of almost &euro;1 billion or 7% on the 2020 figure of &euro;14.2 billion and a 70% increase on the &euro;8.9 billion recorded in 2010.  These figures include &euro;1.7 billion in non-edible agrifood sector goods, including forestry and animal feedstuffs, which are not included in the Bord Bia food and drink figure of &euro;13.5 billion.  My Department and its agencies, in consultation with stakeholders, continues to monitor the impacts on the agrifood sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector coming out of Brexit.<br/><br/>For 2022, the total Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounts to &euro;1.891 billion.  That is comprised of &euro;1.574 billion in current expenditure and &euro;317 million in capital expenditure.  This figure represents a gross increase of approximately 4% or &euro;65 million on the 2021 allocation and builds on the 11% increase on the allocation I secured in budget 2021.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that the Department will receive further funding from the Brexit adjustment reserve during 2022 through Supplementary Estimates, thereby giving the committee an opportunity to examine the proposals at that stage too.  We are working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.<br/><br/>When appropriations-in-aid are considered, the 2022 net Vote is estimated at &euro;1.461 billion.  This is arrived at by deducting the income we receive in appropriations-in-aid from our overall expenditure.  The agriculture Vote is subdivided into four expenditure programmes corresponding to the four key strategic objectives set out in the current statement of strategy.  I will now speak about each of these four programmes, A to D, and the key themes.<br/><br/>Programme A relates to food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare.  The total allocation for programme A in 2022 was &euro;341 million, an increase of 6%.  Irish farmers, fishers and agrifood companies produce world-class food that is known across the world.  They produce products to the highest international standards of food safety and quality.  Our food safety and traceability systems continue to be recognised as among the very best in the world.  Regarding programme expenditure, I am continuing to fund vital services to ensure those standards are maintained, including the meat inspection service and the various supports provided by the Department testing laboratories. <br/><br/>The level of bovine tuberculosis in Ireland continues to be relatively low with progress being made during 2021 thanks to the new TB strategy I launched at the end of 2020.  TB levels are lower than in the previous year for the first time since 2016.  Enhanced actions to clear infection from herds experiencing extended breakdowns were initiated in June 2021.  The goal is to eliminate TB infection from such herds to help them go clear as soon as possible and reduce the risk of repeat breakdowns.  The TB forum, supported by Department officials, will continue, during 2022 and beyond, to implement the policy options outlined in the bovine TB eradication strategy.  Our focus will be set on reducing disease year by year.  The strategy is not set in stone.  It is very much a roadmap and will be subject to revision on an ongoing basis in line with the trajectory of the disease.  I have increased funding in the wildlife programme to help to further drive down TB rates this year and beyond.  I have discussed with members the importance of this matter at meetings of the committee over the past year.<br/><br/>The programme for Government committed to a doubling of the <i>ex gratia</i>funding for animal welfare organisations within two years.  Funding has been provided in 2022 to fulfil this commitment.  Funding in programme A will also support the wind-down of fur farming operations in the State.  I will be progressing Report Stage of that legislation in the D&aacute;il later this evening. <br/><br/>Programme B relates to farm sector supports and controls.  It is where the vast majority of our farm schemes are housed.  A total of just over &euro;939 million is available to programme B in 2022, to be paid almost exclusively to farm families.  That is in addition to &euro;1.2 billion funding from the European Union in respect of the various direct payment schemes.<br/><br/>Keeping farmers farming and assisting them in producing the world-class, safe and sustainable food they do is a key priority of mine.  This support is also vital to farmers who deliver public goods and environmental benefits.  As well as the inherent environmental benefits involved, this investment enhances our sustainability credentials, which are invaluable as we serve increasingly demanding and knowledgeable customers at home and around the world.<br/><br/>There are several key provisions in programme B in my Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2022.  Conscious of the pressures on the tillage sector, I will allocate some &euro;15 million of this sum specifically for that sector.  This is an increase of &euro;5 million on the outgoing year.<br/><br/>Beef and sheep farming is the lifeblood of many rural communities and helps ensure a balanced regional economy.  The 2022 Estimate provides &euro;104 million in targeted supports for livestock farming.  I am providing more than &euro;85 million to support sustainable beef farming.  This includes over &euro;40 million for the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, during the transition period.  It also includes over &euro;44 million for the beef sector efficiency pilot, based on the BEEP-S scheme.<br/><br/>The sheep welfare scheme provides a valuable support to sheep farmers for undertaking actions which make a positive contribution to flock welfare.  I was pleased to be able to secure additional funding for the scheme in budget 2022.  This underlines my commitment to the sheep sector.  The allocation for sheep welfare scheme has increased from its original allocation of &euro;17 million in 2021 to &euro;19.5 million in 2022 to cover the continuation of the scheme in 2022 and the change of reference year, leading to an increased number of sheep being able to avail of the scheme.  <br/><br/>These measures, together with the allocation of more than &euro;450 million for schemes such as the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the results-based environment agri pilot, REAP, and areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme will support livestock farmers to improve the economic and environmental performance of their herds while providing valuable income support for the sector.  I am also providing &euro;79 million, made up of &euro;50.287 million in subhead B5, which includes a &euro;29.9 million carryover, as well as &euro;29 million in European Union recovery instrument, EURI, funding, including the capital carryover, for targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, to support investment on farms and the continuation of the TAMS during the transitional period.<br/><br/>Turning to forestry, which I know is a priority of this committee, I am providing &euro;100 million in support of the forestry sector.  This provision is in recognition of the vital contribution it can make in mitigating climate change and supplementing farm incomes.  In 2022, our aim is to increase the number of afforestation licences we issue.  The overall output of licences increased by almost 60% from a low base in 2020.  This demonstrates significant progress and we are determined to see that trajectory continue through this year.<br/><br/>Supplies of timber for the processing sector have thankfully stabilised over 2021.  This time last year we were in a real crisis with supply.  The backlog of forestry licence appeals, which had been a significant administrative burden and a delaying factor in many licence applications, is being dealt with, piece by piece and bit by bit, making progress each week and month.<br/><br/>In addition, an independent regulatory review of the forestry licensing system has been commissioned, a new system facilitating a pre-application engagement between the forester and the Department is being piloted and arrangements are being made to provide a financial contribution to applicants towards the cost of environmental reports.  We will also publish a new forestry strategy for Ireland this year.</p><p> The carbon tax allocation has been reduced from &euro;23 million in 2021 to &euro;3 million for 2022.  The programme for Government commitment provides for additional current funding of &euro;1.5 billion of carbon tax funding for new schemes that will incentivise farmers to farm in a green and more sustainable way up to 2030.  This funding will be additional to that provided for by the Common Agricultural Policy.  This commitment is being met in full.  It is intended to programme the carbon tax funding to enhance the new schemes proposed under the CAP strategic plan.</p><p> In the programme for Government the clear commitment was to direct the additional carbon tax funding specifically towards enhancing the environmental scheme in the CAP.  Because the new CAP was delayed by two years and will not start until January 2023, I have reduced the profile of the carbon tax in 2022.  The funding will be available to be pumped into the environmental scheme between 2023 and 2027.  This is being true to the programme for Government commitment on expenditure of the carbon tax.  This will allow funding to be programmed into the CAP strategic plan, ensuring compliance with agriculture state-aid rules and with a view to securing Commission approval for the interventions proposed in the CAP strategic plan.  We will see a coherent green architecture in CAP strategic plan that will run from 2023 to 2027.</p><p> Programme C deals with policy and strategy.  The total allocation for programme C is almost &euro;403 million.  Many of the programme C allocations reflect the comprehensive approach to Brexit responsiveness.  Access to finance is crucial for business needs and is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the challenges posed by Brexit.  In addition to liaising with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, my Department and I work closely with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department, as well as with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his Department.  The Estimates for 2022 will provide for ongoing access to the loan schemes through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for farmers, fishers and food and drink SMEs.</p><p> To support our food industry a provision of &euro;7 million has been made for this year through the Enterprise Ireland capital investment scheme.  This is to support the meat and dairy sectors investing in greater product and market diversification.  We will support Irish research and innovation activity to enable the sector to innovate and deliver greater efficiency and economic, environmental and social sustainability.</p><p> In 2022, for the first time, there is a dedicated budget for farm safety of &euro;2 million.  I recognise the ongoing work of the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, in making real progress in this area.  This new funding will play a significant role in achieving cultural change around safety on our farms.  They are working environments and we must continue to work together to make them safer.  Reductions in the rate of fatal and serious incidents on farms will happen only by changing behaviours, increasing awareness, training, and investment in key farm safety and in farmer mental health and well-being measures.  The &euro;2 million allocation is in addition to the continued funding for farm safety equipment under TAMS, a recently launched accelerated capital allowances for farm safety equipment scheme, and a range of locally-led schemes focused on farm health, safety, and well-being projects.</p><p> In recent budgets increased funding has been provided to Bord Bia to strengthen its understanding of consumer priorities and preferences in Ireland and in distant markets and to communicate these insights to Irish food companies for use in product promotion, development, branding and marketing.  The Bord Bia grant is &euro;53 million in the 2022 Estimate.</p><p> Teagasc&rsquo;s capital allocation has been increased by &euro;3.85 million to &euro;10.45 million.  With this funding Teagasc proposes to establish the national agricultural sustainability research and innovation centre at Johnstown Castle.  This is a strategically important project to support strategic national commitments to increase the sustainability of our agricultural and food systems.  The project has been in gestation for some time due to funding requirements.  I was pleased to secure &euro;9 million in Exchequer grant aid towards the construction costs from the Department&rsquo;s capital budget on a phased basis to 2024.  The allocation this year is &euro;3 million.  This funding represents a strong commitment by the Government to provide farmers and other stakeholders with access to practical solutions to improve soil health, restore and protect biodiversity, improve water quality, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and ammonia, and enhance soil carbon sequestration.</p><p> I was very glad to be able to visit Johnstown Castle prior to Christmas to turn the sod on the new research and innovation centre and officially open the newly revamped Johnstown Castle.  It is now opened to the public.  It was my first time there and anyone in the area should visit it.  It is a tremendous castle that has been well restored.  It is well worth a visit.  It is on the same grounds as the existing facilities and the new national agricultural sustainability research and innovation centre.  Johnstown Castle is where much of the research was done to verify the emissions reduction potential of low-emission slurry spreading, which enabled us to programme the gains we are getting from it into our national inventory to reduce our overall emissions.  It is a real-life example of the work that has been going on there.  The new innovation centre will help to drive this forward and will be very important in the coming decade.</p><p> The allocation to the horse and greyhound racing fund is &euro;89.7 million.  This is a reduction of &euro;7.8 million when compared with last year's allocation.  As we welcome back spectators to both sports the fund&rsquo;s 2022 budget allocation is appropriate.</p><p> Programme D deals with the seafood sector.  The provision for the Department&rsquo;s seafood programme has been increased by 17% to a total of &euro;207 million for the continued promotion of the environmentally sustainable development of our fisheries sector, aquaculture and wider seafood industry.  This sector supports some 16,000 direct and indirect jobs almost exclusively in coastal communities.  The provision will help fund vital investment in our fishery harbours, most particularly in Killybegs, Howth and Castletownbere.  I also announced significant investment of &euro;25 million for a new deep water harbour in Rossaveel.</p><p> The budget allocation for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, in 2022 will allow it to continue to meet its national and EU obligations as Ireland&rsquo;s competent authority for the enforcement of sea fisheries and seafood safety law, and to meet challenges coming from Brexit.  The core areas of the SFPA include the costs associated with certifying seafood in food business premises throughout the country and providing 24-7 inspection services at the main fishery harbour centres and numerous secondary ports around the coast.</p><p> In response to the impacts of the trade and co-operation agreement I established a seafood task force in March 2021 to examine these impacts and make recommendations on appropriate measures to mitigate them.  The Navigating Change report of the seafood task force recommends 16 support schemes with an estimated cost of &euro;423 million to assist the seafood sector and coastal communities to mitigate the impacts of the trade and co-operation agreement, including temporary and permanent cessation schemes for the fishing sector, capital investment schemes for seafood processing and aquaculture, marketing supports, marine infrastructure renewal, enhanced community-led local development through the seven fisheries local action groups, and liquidity support for co-operatives and processors.</p><p> Most of the schemes recommended by the task force are proposed to be funded in 2022 and 2023 under the EU Brexit adjustment reserve.  An amount of &euro;31.5 million has been allocated to Bord Iascaigh Mhara in this year's Estimate to manage schemes that are approved under the Brexit adjustment reserve along with its other normal important work.</p><p>The recommendations of the task force are being urgently examined and assessed across government with regard to available funds, eligibility under the Brexit adjustment reserve, state aid and the public spending code.  A Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme recommended by the task force was implemented in 2021 and provided supports to vessels in the polyvalent and beam trawl segments to temporarily cease fishing activity in a particular calendar month, thus increasing the quota available for remaining vessels that were fishing.  The scheme had a total of 229 applicants of which 179 were successful.  The cost of the scheme was approximately &euro;10 million.  The task force has recommended a second temporary fleet tie-up scheme for 2022 and I am considering that. </p><p> In January I announced a Brexit inshore fisheries business model adjustment scheme to provide support to assist inshore fishers in adjusting their business model to the post-Brexit market environment.  As recommended by the task force, one-off payments of &euro;2,700 are available to owners of vessels under 8 m in length and &euro;4,000 for owners of vessels between 8 m and 18 m in length.  That scheme has a total budget of &euro;3.7 million.  The Brexit adjustment reserve funding is an initial allocation for 2022 and I will be announcing other schemes in the coming weeks and months.  These will be rolled out on a phased and prioritised basis as recommended by the task force.</p><p> This is a comprehensive, if not especially brief, overview of some of the key issues and the range of measures that apply in the agrifood and marine sectors for this year.  I am satisfied that the 2022 allocation, together with the supports to be provided under the Brexit adjustment reserve, will provide a good, balanced package of measures for farmers, fishers, coastal communities and the food sector.  I look forward to taking questions on specific areas and further developing some of the key points on which I have given an overview.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2022020200002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  Before opening the discussion to members, I will ask one or two questions.  While I welcome the significant funding for TAMS, as we all know, building costs have increased beyond all recognition in the past six months.  The &euro;80,000 ceiling in place for farmer investment in TAMS has become inadequate.  Will the Minister review that ceiling?  Any construction work on farms now quickly exceeds that ceiling.  Changing the ceiling will have an impact and extra funding will be needed.  If TAMS is to maintain relevance for farmers in the context of increased costs, the ceiling for TAMS has to be looked at.  Costings were examined late last year and have been revised.  With the cost of raw materials now, the ceiling definitely needs to be revised.</p> <p>  On TB, I welcome the increased focus on wildlife.  We can see the results of that.  As the Minister said, we have seen a reduction in the number of reactors for the first time since 2015.  Is that completely focused on badgers?  Are resources being put into controlling the deer population?</p> <p>  Will the Minister provide a breakdown of the &euro;53 million allocated to Bord Bia?  Where will that money be spent and how has it been allocated?  If that detail is not available today, I ask the Minister to revert to the committee with an answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2022020200002#D00300"><p>The point on TAMS is very relevant.  I have completed and implemented a review of the costings and another review is ongoing.  I also announced my intention to increase the ceiling from &euro;80,000 to &euro;90,000 as part of the next CAP.  I acknowledge the Chairman's point in regard to the pressure on costs over the past year.  I will consider the matter further, taking on board the feedback of the Chair and of some colleagues.  It is an issue on which the Chair has spoken to me previously.  It is a valid point and one I will reflect on further.</p> <p>  In regard to TB we had a few very challenging years when the figures were going in the wrong direction.  It was important that we came together in order to try to put a new strategy in place.  I was grateful for the support of all key stakeholders last year to get agreement on a new TB strategy.  The new strategy implementation group and its three working groups are up and running and making good progress.  All the stakeholders are working well and, for the first time in several years, that is leading to a reduction in reactor rates.</p> <p>  Overall funding for the wildlife unit is significant, particularly for badger vaccination for which funding is increasing from &euro;1.9 million in 2021 to &euro;2.1 million this year.  This is a key focus in managing the wildlife impacts.  Another important issue is providing targeted resources for advisory staff working with farmers, which has been a challenge, providing increased time, assistance and advice to manage the risks at farm level and ensuring that reactors are removed promptly.</p> <p>  One issue I did not cover in my initial contribution, on which members will be keen for an update, is the removal of the derogation for burning of bushes and scrub.  I have engaged with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, over the last few days on the issues and challenges for the farming community on that issue.  I am glad to report that the Minister will provide a derogation for farmers,to enable them to burn scrub.  We will engage in terms of looking at future options and alternatives that may be possible in the years ahead.  This is an important management tool and I am grateful to the Minister for recognising the importance of providing a derogation and ensuring it is available for farmers, outside of the nesting season of course.  It is an important facility for farmers, one which they use in a balanced way.  I know the Chair is interested in this matter and Senator Paul Daly also brought it to my attention.

They are allocated on a percentage basis for each of the programmes.  It is therefore not necessarily directly related to the programme; it is a reflection of the overall administration costs.  For anyone who wishes to see what exactly is happening in administration and where the costs are before they are then allocated to the four programmes, there is a separate table here that breaks down the administration costs and where they might be up or down and the subhead within administration to which that is attached.</p></speech>

Every farmer's reason will be different.  We had the REAP as well, but that was for farmers not currently in GLAS.  There was a very successful uptake of that, which shows, even for those who are outside of GLAS, the appetite that is there to come into a scheme.  My approach to GLAS was to try to make sure that, while we were in the two transition years, it would be as practicable and hassle-free as possible for farmers to roll over their GLAS participation and to continue it.  We saw 42,000 of the 49,000 who had completed five years roll over their participation and avail of the extra second year, which will, I hope, be there next year to-----</p></speech>

We could not do a new scheme for them.  It would be much more practical for those who were in GLAS, for example, to continue on GLAS and to continue with the measures they had than it would be to do a new scheme.  I do not think doing a new scheme would necessarily have continued to capture those 7,000 farmers.  Maybe some are retiring.  I imagine there are a myriad of reasons-----</p></speech>

Thankfully, we are gathering momentum and making a real impact and we will see real, significant progress on that over the course of this year.

I am worried.  I have looked at the figures for this year to date.  While I acknowledge that the number of licences for felling has improved, on the planting side of it I have looked up the figures for January and February so far and it is backwards we are certain to go again.  That is what I worry about.</p></speech>

Where somebody clear-fells a site, the obligation is on him or her to replant that within two years.  A new afforestation licence is valid for three years.  The licensee has to plant the site within three years.  Last year's output of afforestation licences was not as successful as, for example, the progress that was made on felling.  That will be a focus this year.  Our objective will be to double the number of afforestation licences issued this year.  The number of afforestation licences granted last year was 500-odd but, in land area terms, that was just over the 8,000 ha mark.  We have seen about a 60% uptake of licences that are granted reaching afforestation.  Our objective is to make progress towards 8,000 ha.  We are making a profile for that and we will continue to do that because it shows our commitment to funding that.  At the end of last year, in October, when it became clear what the level of afforestation was last year, in the October Revised Estimate I reprofiled the funding it looked like we were not going to spend in that regard.  At the start of this year, we are putting in place funding that would cover 8,000 ha.  There will be a significant effort in the Department this year to address afforestation licensing and make real progress on it.</p></speech>

The Department has made changes to it, and I welcome the new dates.  What was the outlay for the sheep welfare scheme?

What was projected at that stage was potentially up to &euro;25 million.  That was then subject to demand, so I think the level of uptake was &euro;16 million or &euro;17 million.  As with all the other schemes that are in place and the outgoing CAP, until we have entered the new CAP in 2023, the only option available to us is to look to roll over those schemes.  It is not a requirement of us but it is something I have wanted to do.  Therefore, I have rolled over the sheep welfare scheme too but updated the reference year in a way that seeks to maximise the number of sheep that qualify.  Updating that reference year means that more payments will be made in respect of sheep this year.  The reason I have increased the budget is to facilitate those extra payments.  As the Deputy will be aware, under the new CAP, the &euro;10 payment is due to increase to &euro;12.  As he will know, many sheep farmers would like that to be more, but that is what we are doing.</p></speech>

Next year, from what I can see, most farmers will need to be using the low emission slurry spreading system, LESS, going by the nitrate regulations and all that.  I was looking at gear and what it costs.  It costs between &euro;50,000 and &euro;80,000 to get the gear in.  If the Minister does not talk to the contractors or the Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland, FCI, there could be a problem in many areas.

The Deputy is correct on those figures.  Do we have an answer as to that &euro;28 million difference in the output targets for 2021 and 2022?  We will check that.  The 2020 outturn is the same as the 2022 output target.  2021 was the first year of the new seven-year programme; 2022 will be the second year of it.

It is basic payments and greening so there would be a slight reduction in overall Pillar 1 as we move from the previous seven-year period, which ran from 2014 to the end of 2020.  There was a small 1% to 2% drop in Pillar 1 payments at the start of 2021.  That will stay constant until the start of 2027.  Pilar 2 went up but Pillar 1 dropped slightly.  That adjustment happened for 2021.  I am not sure of the reason for the difference but I will check it.  We would expect the 2022 figure for basic payments to be the same as 2021.</p></speech>

Will the Minister look into the slurry issue?  I can see a problem.  I am a contractor.  The bit I do will not change Ireland but I am talking about the number of farmers ringing at the moment who are not familiar with what they have to do this year and next.  On Sunday evening, two of them rang me wondering what they have to spread with this year.  Next year, they have to look at whether they are under 100 or over that.  Does the Minister understand me?  Most of them will be on the LESS system over 100.  Many contractors would be just splash plate at the moment and will not be going down that road for the amount of work they are doing, unless some bit of help is given.  This is not about subsidising; it is about the environment that is being played to make sure we reduce emissions.</p></speech>

I understand where the Deputy is coming from.  We have to push on and try to assist that transition.  The Deputy is right that much of the slurry will be spread by contractors.  They will play an important role and we want as much use of LESS as possible because it makes financial sense from a farmer's point of view every year, this year more than ever.  It makes sense from an emissions point of view as well.</p></speech>

What we are now projecting for next year is representative of what we feel is likely to be the demand.  For the number of consignments of live animals and products inspected at border inspection posts, 75,000 is projected for next year.  We had projected for last year that it might be up to 500,000.  It has been less than that but we are looking to match the level of inspections with demand based on what we have seen over the last year, which was the first year of Brexit.</p></speech>

In terms of the next CAP programme, we have increased the funding for organics fivefold.  It is something we intend to drive on very significantly at Government level and to make real progress on over the next years.  The message I have for many farmers is to consider how suitable organics would be for them and how much would be involved for them to go organic, and to look in particular at how their income could be improved for those who take up that option.  With regard to the projection for next year, the output target for last year was 1,880 and we are hoping to increase that by about 400 to 2,230 this year.  That is certainly doable.  We have the funding in place to do it and we will certainly be getting the message out there to farmers to apply.</p></speech>

The Minister says he is putting in the funding to reach the target of 8,000 ha but we will not reach it, no matter what spin the Minister puts on it.  We need to be honest with the public at this stage and tell them we are not going to reach this.  Does the Minister have confidence that we will reach that figure?  I know he is saying he is putting in the funding, which is welcome across the board and nobody will give out about that.  However, despite putting in the funding to reach that 8,000 ha target we keep talking about, and about which this committee keeps putting out messages to the sector, it is not going to be reached.</p></speech>

We need to do everything we can to get there.  It is very important for our climate change targets, for farmers&rsquo; income diversification and for providing raw materials to displace other more carbon intensive materials, for example, in the building industry.  We will get there and we have to drive on as hard as we possibly can.  It is unlikely we will make that jump this year.  I am profiling the funding that will be available to do it but we would all agree it is unlikely we will get to that target over the course of this year.  I will monitor it closely.  We are making progress in regard to licensing and we are in a much different place from where we were this time last year.  There is still a lot of work to do but we are gathering momentum all of the time.  As it moves towards the end of the year, in assessing where we are at, I will then look at the spending profile.  Certainly, at the start of the year, there is a clear indication of our intent and willingness to fund this, and I am profiling the funding that will be required to meet our target.</p></speech>

That is clearly not the case.  I note the Minister copied the same line in his opening statement.  From what we know at the moment, the backlog alone will take until October to clear and there is nothing new coming into the sector.  If we are going to take until October just to clear the backlog, how many more licences are going to come in after that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2022020200002#G00600"><p>We are dealing with it.  Although it has not been dealt with or completed yet, we are making progress on it every month.  Members know, as I do, that this time last year there was a real crisis in the sector.  Sawmills that would normally have sourced their logs from Irish forest were not able to get those logs and sawmills that did not want to import logs were importing.  Thankfully, we are no longer in that situation and we now have wood flowing freely through the system.  In any given year, imports of logs are always dwarfed by exports because the vast majority of the timber we produce in Ireland is exported, although we import timber for some purposes.  We are back at that equilibrium that we have been at in terms of supply, in particular the supply to the sawmills.</p> <p>  Prices have gone up in line with international prices and it is not a supply issue at Irish level because we have more than enough supply in the system.  The challenge is obviously around licensing in terms of getting through the licence applications that are there.  Real progress has been made and, over the course of this year, significant further progress will eat into that backlog.  Thankfully, we have moved gradually over the course of the last year to a situation where we are issuing more licences in a week than the number of applications received.  We have tipped that balance and, over the course of this year, we will be issuing significantly more licences than applications received and eating into that backlog.  Through the regulatory review that is ongoing, we are looking to see where and how we could possibly make the system leaner to give even greater capacity to issue more licences.  We are going in the right direction and we will continue to make progress month by month over the next year.</p> <p>  As Deputy Fitzmaurice pointed out, afforestation will be a significant priority this year for the Department and we seek to double the level of afforestation licences issued.  Over last year, we made massive progress in dealing with the appeals backlog, for example.  All of the committee members co-operated in December 2020 in facilitating a change to legislation to streamline the appeals system.  At that stage, we had 1,000 applications backlogged in appeals, as well as the challenge in regard to straightforward licensing.  That is now down to ten or 20 files in the appeals system compared with 1,000 some 13 or 14 months ago.  Again, that has been a significant help and has provided certainty around the pipeline so the appeals did not become a blockage as well.  That is a reflection of the progress that has been made.</p> <p>  When we come from such a challenging position as we were in this time last year, we do not flick a switch and get to where we want to be overnight.  Thankfully, I can report that we are making progress week by week and month by month.  We are on the right pathway and it is one that will deliver more and more progress and gradually clear that backlog.  The backlog of applications has reduced by approximately 1,300 over the course of the last year.  We want to get to a stage where we have the normal equilibrium of files in the system, potentially around 2,000 files at any one time going through the various stages of the process.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the tremendous work that the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has done in leading out and turning the corner.  It was a challenge she faced when she was appointed.  The crisis was coming to its most acute point, and a lot of work had to be done to move it forward.  It was also very challenging for the team of officials in the Department, as well as for everyone working in the industry, to gradually work our way out of it.</p> <p>  We are on that pathway now.  We have to start changing the narrative because we are at the stage where we are able to process and issue significantly more than we are receiving, which is driving down the backlog.  We now want to get the message out to people that we want more licence applications and we want people to look at forestry in a positive way.  While we have further road to go in dealing with the challenge, we are on that road and that should bring confidence back to the system and enable us to change the narrative.  It is still challenging but we are on the pathway.</p></speech>

The 2020 outturn was 1,030, the 2021 output target was 13,050 and I see the 2022 output target is 2,400.</p></speech>

Since Brexit, there has been a significant increase in demand for a number of certifications, health certifications and phytosanitary controls.  When we put together the 2020 output target we worked off estimates of what the impacts from Brexit might be.  We have a much better line of sight now, having gone through a year of the post-Brexit situation, of actual demand and level.  The number has been adjusted to reflect the experience of the past year.</p></speech>

We have import requirements under which certification is required for goods coming into the EU.  We must manage those at our border entry points.  The other challenge is when certification in respect of exports to the UK will commence.  Two or three times in 2021, deadlines that had been set were then moved out.  They have moved out again into this year.  Our figures are based on our best estimate.  The Department has contingency plans for how things will be actioned when this happens.  We have already put in place many staff who will cover these tasks and requirements.  We are making an estimate at this stage based on the current projection.</p></speech>

As the Minister will know, many larger companies operate 24-hours a day, seven days a week.  Does the Department have the staff and resources in its allocation to meet those requirements?</p></speech>

We have put a lot of preparation into being ready for that.  There has been significant engagement with food business operators on what their needs will be and in trying to give line of sight of the arrangements that will be in place when the new import controls come in.  We have had time to reassign staff because of the delays and there are other staff who would be in a position to take on those duties and responsibilities.  As such, I am confident that we have the capacity to provide that service.  Importantly, we will continue the engagement at individual food operator level on their particular needs and how models can be adjusted to work well when these controls inevitably come in.</p></speech>

Obviously the Northern Ireland protocol is important and essential to the flow of goods from north to south and east to west.  It is important that diplomatic efforts continue to ensure it works well.  I will continue to do all I can to work North and South.  I will continue to support the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, in his engagements at the EU level and the ongoing engagement between the EU and the British Government to ensure the Northern Ireland protocol works well in the time ahead.  It is important for the Republic, Northern Ireland and the island.  The relationship between the two islands is also very important.</p></speech>

EU funding for this area has reduced on a year-on-year basis.  The Minister mentioned that our test results last year pointed in the right direction for the first time in a number of years.  Will that have an impact on EU funding?  Will we be able draw down funds or will the Minister make the case to draw down additional income supports from the EU for the TB eradication programme?</p></speech>

Thankfully, last year was the first year we saw the figures increase again.</p><p>I cannot tell the Deputy offhand how that will impact on the future contribution from the EU in support of the programme, but certainly any deterioration in the programme would have led to a further reduction in figures.

Two impacts have arisen from the increasing cost of the eradication programme over the past couple of years.  The first is the fact that the EU contribution has been reducing and the second is that the higher incidence rates are leading to increased costs to the national Exchequer.  Not only do we have to make up for the reduction in the EU's contribution, but the increased costs associated with having reactor animals, having to pay compensation and having to manage that challenge are also leading to an increase in cost.  Hopefully, with everyone working together and the new TB strategy bearing some fruit, we will see the overall costs reduce and herd incidences continue to reduce in the years ahead.</p></speech>

The freer the interaction is between this island and our neighbouring island, the better it will be across all ranges of goods, including all food types.  There is a challenge in that Britain is now a third country and, therefore, third-country rules apply.  That means that seed potatoes, many of which had previously come from Scotland, cannot come in from now on.  The EU is willing to facilitate that on the basis of veterinary alignment between Britain and the EU, but the British Government has not indicated its willingness to go down that route so there has not been progress.  We will continue that conversation because we want as much engagement and the smallest number of barriers between Ireland and Britain as possible, but we have to work on the basis that there is no prospect of the situation changing in the short term.  We have to turn that challenge into an opportunity to reignite our seed potato sector and supply seed potatoes nationally as opposed to from imports.  We have the capacity in this country to grow seed potatoes in the same way that Scotland does.</p> <p>  I have had a number of meetings with members of the potato industry and the IFA national potato committee.  I have made it clear and emphasised to them that it is very important that this is industry led.  It is our industry nationally that is looking for seed potatoes and it is important they give confidence to those who are considering becoming seed potato growers that they will buy that seed potato from them, if they grow it, because it is a significant step for somebody to get into that industry.  We need to see those relationships.  We also need ware potato growers to build relationships with existing seed potato growers, in addition to new ones, to give certainty that if they grow seed potatoes this year, the growers will provide the market for them, depending on quality obviously.  As Minister, I will certainly be doing all I can to support seed growers and ware growers to build that relationship through investment in the sector, for example, through the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme.</p> <p>  I was in the national seed potato base for the country, Tops farm in Raphoe, on Monday and met the team there, which is led by Gerry Doherty.  I had a discussion with them about the work they are doing in providing seed potato and the genetics for it.  I also opened a new glasshouse, which the Department invested in last year, that will expand its capacity to grow seed potato.  There is an exciting opportunity to reignite this industry.  Those working at Tops farm showed me documents going back to the 1970s and 1980s.  My father was in the book as being a seed potato grower in the 1970s.  The vast majority of farmers in Donegal then were growing an acre or a hectare of seed potatoes.  Some 3,000 acres of seed potatoes were grown in the county in the late 1970s, while it is something like 200 ha or 300 ha now.  In counties in the northern part of the country, in particular, there is a real opportunity to service that industry nationally and to add value.  It is something we have to work to try to develop.  I will certainly do all I can to push that.</p></speech>

Will the Minister or his Department provide guarantees that if those within the sector invest in developing seed potatoes for the domestic market, they will not be undercut if an EU-UK deal transpires, our market will not become flooded and people's investment will not be rendered useless?  There is that genuine concern.  If we can provide some guarantees, we will see a flow of investment.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned a number of times that the take-up rate for afforestation licences, that is, the actual implementation from receiving a licence to planting, is approximately 60%.  It appears to be spectacularly low in that people go to the effort of securing a licence, and the afforestation process is not an easy one to go through, but then do not actually fulfil it.  I previously asked both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hackett, whether there had been an engagement with those 40% or so who are applying for licences but are not seeing it through in order to identify the particular gaps that bring them to a point.  These are people who have received licences.  It would dramatically improve the figures if we could move them from having a licence in the drawer to trees in the ground.  It would make everybody's life much easier, not just now, but in decades to come.  Has a particular piece of work been done in respect of that cohort?</p></speech>

There has always been a gap between the number of afforestation licences issued and the number that then proceed to plantation, but it is important that is looked at.  It is being considered as part of the Project Woodland review work.</p><p>On the issue of the Department moving forward with those files, it is contacting farmers who have afforestation licences asking them to confirm that they wish to proceed with their applications.</p></speech>

This is being done in particular to ensure we can maximise the percentage.  Each application takes a great deal of work and it makes sense to work on applications that applicants want to proceed with.  The Department is double-checking that they intend to continue and want that work done, which makes sense, to ensure then the percentage is as high as possible.  The figure for those proceeding to plant is approximately 60% currently.  Afforestation licences are valid for three years and planting is to be done in that period.  A clear-felling licence is a replanting licence and anyone who clear-fells has an obligation to reforest the cleared plantation within two years.  The afforestation licences are for forestry in addition to the existing forestry stock.  As the forest is clear-felled, it is replanted within two years and the afforestation then adds to the national stock.</p></speech>

As the Minister said, the level of work, cost and man-hours involved is substantial so we should not allow that to go to waste in the case of 40% of the licences issued when there may be a small number of relatively easy measures the Department could take to bring those licences across the line.  It would be important to do that.</p> <p>  I will not discuss organics as we are short on time other than to ask one question.  On the procurement of organics by Departments and statutory bodies, has the Minister examined measures to support the purchase of organic products by bodies expending public money, for example, in the case of hospitals and schools?</p></speech>

Considering the reliance which so many sectors have on Teagasc-led research, is the Minister satisfied that its budget is sufficient to do all that we have been asking it to do?  In every sector we discuss at this committee, we refer to the need to Teagasc to carry out some work.  Is its budget sufficient to allow it to do everything that is required of it?  Obviously there are additional pressures on the organisation arising from the ongoing climate action debates.</p></speech>

Last year, the total grant to Teagasc was &euro;145 million, &euro;139 million of which was for current expenditure.  Its allocation has increased by approximately &euro;8 million this year to &euro;152.5 million.  The biggest part of that increase, of which &euro;3 million is current expenditure, is for capital expenditure, which has increased by approximately &euro;4 million.  The main dynamic and rationale behind that is the expenditure of &euro;3 million for the national agricultural sustainability research and innovation centre in Johnstown Castle, which I mentioned in my opening address, and Ballyhaise Agricultural College in County Cavan, which I visited last week when I turned the sod on new student accommodation there.  There is &euro;1.5 million in the Estimate for this year towards that facility which will see the development of a new student block with 24 bedrooms to accommodate 50 students at an overall cost of &euro;3 million, split between this and next year.  This is a great facility and will be a very important investment in both the Deputy's region and my region.  There is a strong allocation to Teagasc, for which funding has increased on both the current and capital expenditure side.</p></speech>

Is that new money or is it the case that when money is repaid, it goes back into the pot?  In other words, can it be re-loaned or is this an actual decrease in the money available?</p></speech>

We prepaid some of this money from capital savings and free capital this year in forward payment.  We have fully supported both the Brexit income loan scheme and also the Covid-19 income support scheme through that funding.</p></speech>

What I am trying to get at here is an understanding of whether, when farmers are repaying their loans, that funding comes back for reissuing or is that the end of funding in the scheme and we then rely on whatever the headline figure is on subhead C10?</p></speech>

That is how this works.  In both the Brexit impact loan scheme and the future growth loan scheme, 80% of the risk of the loan is covered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  This leads to a reduced loan interest rate for the farmer concerned.  There is a cost associated with this and a payment to the banking institution for the reduced interest rate that is ultimately made available to the farmer.  If loans are not fully used up, payments are not made to the banks for the unused parts, leaving spare capacity which we could look to use in an alternative way.  There is a cost-----</p></speech>

Last year, in the 2021 Estimate figure, some &euro;18.7 million was available under these loans.  Assuming they were all drawn down, farmers would have been repaying that money.  When that money is repaid to the banks, does it become available to be reissued under the same scheme or are new farmers who apply relying wholly on the &euro;13.2 million that has been earmarked for SBCI in the subsequent year?</p></speech>

Ultimately, the farmer is paying back less because the SBCI is making a paying to the banking institution.  While the farmer will be repaying the loan, it will be at a lower interest rate because the additional interest that would have applied has been covered by the SBCI.</p></speech>

Does that increase include the &euro;25 million announced for Rossaveal Harbour?  With Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, I have met campaigners in the area a number of times, so I welcome that funding.

Over the next two years, it is planned to spend &euro;35 million on the smaller piers and harbours.  That work will be funded to the tune of 85%, with local authorities providing the other 15%.

Room capacity will continue to be reduced in the short term until all microphones and seating can be returned.  It is important also to note that masks should continue to be worn by those present when not addressing the committee.  We have received no apologies, which is good.</p> <p>  We are going to examine the 2022 Estimates for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I welcome to the meeting the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, who is participating online from within the Leinster House complex.  We appreciate the comprehensive briefing materials that have been provided by the Minister's Department for today's discussion.  Those materials have been circulated to all committee members.</p> <p>  Before we start I want to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I now invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement on the Revised Estimates, which have been circulated to all members.</p></speech>

I am pleased to discuss my Department&rsquo;s 2022 Estimate with the committee this morning.  I understand that the secretariat has been provided with a briefing relating to the detail of the Estimate, which hopefully has been of assistance to members.</p><p>Before outlining some of the specifics of our Estimate and plans for this year, I would like to say a few words about where we now find ourselves, not least in terms of the battle against Covid-19.  Undoubtedly, the past two years have been traumatic for large parts of our society.  The roller coaster of the pandemic and the impact of the various waves of the virus is something that none of us had ever experienced before.  As a nation we have shown solidarity and resilience and have learned to adapt to the various challenges.</p><p>Despite the damage that has been inflicted by the pandemic, most sectors of the economy are now recovering well, with strong growth in domestic demand and high numbers of workers returning to employment.  It is worthwhile to note that the unemployment rate for all persons, including those on the pandemic unemployment payment, was 7.5% in December 2021, down from 21.7% in December 2020.  Since the start of the pandemic we have aimed to minimise the loss of life, protect the health service and save as many jobs and businesses as possible.  The Government was not found wanting when it came to supporting the economy and jobs, providing a robust and sustained multi-billion euro package that compares well internationally.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, has been extended even though many other countries have ended their furlough schemes.  The rules for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, have been relaxed and tax warehousing has been extended. </p><p>Turning to my own Department, the 2022 Estimate provides us with a gross allocation of &euro;903.8 million, &euro;358.8 million in current and &euro;545 million in capital funding.  Excluding the significant one-off Covid funding provided in 2021, mainly through the restart grants, our core funding has been increased by more than &euro;100 million this year.  In addition, we will also have a further &euro;79.66 million in capital carryover and a further &euro;80 to 90 million in own resource income for use this year.  This additional funding will allow us to increase the core allocation to Intertrade Ireland by &euro;1.2 million to enable it to launch new initiatives including a trade information service and a supply chain initiative.</p><p>Our enterprise agencies continue to help sustain and grow our enterprise base.  The net increase of 31,736 new jobs created by the clients of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, in 2021 was remarkable, considering the significant headwinds of Covid and Brexit.  In fact, Enterprise Ireland announced that Irish exporting companies recorded their highest ever jobs gain in 2021, while IDA Ireland also announced the highest ever jobs gain in the multinational sector in a single year.  We are well on our way to reaching the Government target of having 2.5 million at work in Ireland in 2024.  I have spoken before about my belief in the ability of the economy to bounce back strongly and although these figures do not capture the experience for all Irish businesses, they are certainly grounds for hope and positivity.  I am, however, very aware that some sectors continue to suffer and struggle, especially tourism, hospitality, aviation, entertainment and the arts.  Core capital funding to IDA Ireland next year is being increased by &euro;26.5 million.  This will allow the authority to expand its regional property programme which continues to provide property solutions in locations across the country.  It is worth saying that more than half of all investments won by the authority in 2021 went to locations outside of Dublin.  There was foreign direct investment-related employment growth in all regions. </p><p>Some &euro;7 million will be provided to progress the expansion of the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training to promote biopharmaceutical investment in Ireland.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million is being allocated to the advanced manufacturing centre in Limerick, which will provide a state-of-the-art facility for both indigenous and multinational companies to develop new technologies. </p><p>The IDA Ireland grants budget is also being increased by &euro;5.5 million<i>.  </i>Core capital funding to Enterprise Ireland is being increased by &euro;31 million.  This includes allocations to the climate enterprise action fund and the digital transition fund, which I will return to later in my contribution.  Funding is being provided for further calls of the regional enterprise development fund and the online retail scheme.</p><p>Last year, in excess of 7,400 new jobs were created by LEO clients, which is an increase of 3,000.  The additional &euro;2 million in core capital funding for the LEOs will be targeted at providing increased training and related supports to assist SMEs, particularly in the areas of climate change and digitalisation. </p><p>Balanced regional development will continue to be a focus for us this year.  The new regional enterprise plans, due to be published shortly, will identify growth opportunities and strengthen collaboration between local stakeholders to promote job creation.</p><p>The plans build on the core activities of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and other State bodies.</p><p> In addition to existing streams of funding, the new plans will benefit from funding under the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.  The disruptive technologies innovation fund, which stimulates the development and commercialisation of groundbreaking technologies, will receive an additional &euro;35 million to allow for a further call this year.</p><p> Other initiatives being funded from the Department's core capital allocation include an increase of &euro;3 million for the European Space Agency programme, in line with the commitment under the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040.</p><p> The Revised Estimate has also allocated discrete capital funding of &euro;17 million for Covid measures this year.  This allocation, together with the capital carryover of &euro;79.66 million, essentially means that almost &euro;100 million is available to respond to Covid-19 in 2022.  The Covid credit guarantee scheme, for example, has been allocated &euro;45 million to meet any claims against the guarantee this year.  Further funding is being provided to other Covid measures such as the sustaining enterprise and accelerated recovery funds and the Covid products scheme.</p><p> While coping with Covid, many businesses have also had to continue to prepare for and deal with Brexit.  The Department and its agencies continue to assist businesses in those sectors most impacted.  The additional funding provided in the 2022 Revised Estimate, including funding secured from the Brexit adjustment fund, will ensure that targeted measures, such as the Enterprise Ireland food transformation scheme and the Brexit impact loan scheme, can continue to be accessed by businesses.</p><p> The 2022 Estimate also increased our current funding for this year by more than &euro;13 million.  The additional funding will allow for extra resources to be provided to the Department's regulatory bodies and enterprise agencies.  In particular, increased funding will be provided to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to allow them to recruit additional staff and meet the increasing demands for their services.</p><p> The budget of the new Corporate Enforcement Authority is being increased to ensure that it has the requisite resources to carry out its role as a robust, statutory and independent agency.</p><p> Additional current funding is also being provided to the IDA to promote and market Ireland for the purposes of FDI.</p><p> While, understandably, Brexit and Covid have been our focus in recent times, the challenges of climate change and digitalisation are also important and will be even more so in the future.  The challenge of digitalisation and the imperative for businesses to embrace digital technologies is crucial to our post-pandemic economic recovery.  To boost the uptake of digital technology in enterprises, we have set up the digital transition fund as part of our national recovery and resilience plan.  This comprises &euro;85 million in multi-annual funding which will run to 2026.  The &euro;10 million in funding being provided to the fund in the Revised Estimate this year will be targeted at increasing digitalisation of all businesses across products, processes, supply chains and business models.</p><p> Separately, &euro;3 million will be provided to establish Ireland's European digital innovation hubs as part of a Europe-wide network.  These hubs will be designed to make digital technology more readily available to SMEs and to provide advice, expertise and opportunities to experiment with technologies such as cybersecurity, AI and high-performance computing.</p><p> Under the allocation to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;10 million is being provided to the climate enterprise action fund to assist Irish companies to build the capabilities required to deliver sustainable products, services and business models.  This &euro;10 million will also go towards the development of a carbon reduction fund, which will be aimed at encouraging manufacturing enterprises to engage actively in green research, development and innovation.  The Climate Toolkit 4 Business website is now live, providing businesses with a tailored assessment of their carbon footprint.  The kit was designed specifically to provide businesses, particularly small businesses, with an easy-to-use carbon calculator and generates an action plan specific to the business to help it to get activated in carbon reduction.</p><p> Before I finish, I wish to mention briefly some other items on my agenda for 2022.  Over the coming months I will take the lead on behalf of the Government in creating five new workers' rights.  These are as follows: a new public holiday; the right to request remote, home or hybrid working to complement the new right to disconnect; new redundancy rights for people laid off during the pandemic and subsequently made redundant; statutory sick pay; and the protection of tips and gratuities.  With the help of members present, I hope these will all be in place by autumn, certainly by this year.  We will also make progress towards a living wage for Ireland and universal occupational pension coverage for all workers through auto-enrolment.</p><p> I hope the foregoing gives an outline of my Department's 2022 Revised Estimate and a flavour of our plans for this year.  I look forward to discussing the Estimate with the committee and answering members' questions.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.</p> <p>  Covid supports have been extremely welcome for businesses.  I have engaged with quite a number of businesses that have said they would have gone under without them.  What is the plan to withdraw Covid supports in 2022?  Will the enterprise agencies continue to support companies throughout 2022?  Obviously, these supports cannot keep going forever.</p> <p> According to the Minister, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs have performed very well on job creation in the past year.  Are there plans to improve that further next year?  What are the challenges the Minister sees coming down the track?  The industry seems to have weathered Brexit and Covid pretty well to date.  People have been talking about labour shortages and inflation.  Has any thought been given to trying to attract some of our diaspora but who might want to come back and could assist our workforce here?  Does that come under the Minister's remit?</p> <p>  In the agrifood sector, &euro;70 million in funding under the capital investment scheme was announced in November to respond to Brexit.  There was &euro;100 million in total announced.  Is there to be a call too and, if so, when will it happen?  Will it be for more than the &euro;30 million available in 2022?</p> <p>  An issue many of us are interested in is the Government policy to rejuvenate towns and town centres, especially rural towns such as, in my constituency, the town of Youghal, which the Minister is familiar with and which is very much on the margins.  What is the Department's and the State agencies' view on targeting such towns and visiting them to see what land is available?  IDA Ireland is getting a big increase in its capital expenditure for property, I assume for purchase, in order that advance factories and facilities might be available.  In my region the Construction Industry Federation is concerned about what it sees as the lack of property, advance factories and so on that people could be invited to use.</p> <p>  Another issue, which might have come up at our meeting last week, when Mr. Martin Shanahan was before us, is remote working hubs and, beyond that, remote working spaces in order that people would not have to travel long distances.  We are talking about scaling that up to a higher level than just hot desks.  Has any work been done on that?</p> <p>  Those are some of the questions I wanted to ask.  Overall, the impression I get from businesses out there is that things are going well.  IDA Ireland is in a league of its own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#B00500"><p>The Covid supports specifically for business are being phased out.  The CRSS, which is the weekly grant for businesses that are closed, is effectively gone now because there are no businesses closed.  The EWSS is being phased out at the moment for a lot of businesses such as in retail, construction, manufacturing and the services sector.  For them it will end at the end of April.  For those sectors that were hit by the 8 p.m. rule - hospitality and entertainment, for example - it will run until the end of May.  Tax warehousing runs until April, although the Minister for Finance is looking at the possibility of extending that.  The concessionary 9% VAT rate runs until August.  After that, we are back to just the traditional supports previously provided through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and LEOs.</p><p>The remit of local enterprise offices has slightly changed in that traditionally they would have only assisted businesses with ten or fewer employees.  That has now been changed so that they can assist businesses with more than ten employees, but there can be a complication in that some EU state aid rules do not allow us to grant aid businesses with more than ten employees.  As a general policy, LEOs will now be able to assist slightly larger businesses.<br/><br/>In terms of challenges, Brexit and Covid are not gone away yet.  I do not think it will happen, but we always have to be wise to the risk of a further serious wave of Covid that might result in restrictions being imposed, so we have to bear in mind that possibility.  As Deputies will be very aware, Brexit is still playing out and the final trade arrangements between Britain and Ireland and between Britain and the EU are not yet resolved, nor are some of the issues around the protocol.<br/><br/>As the Deputy mentioned, labour shortages are definitely a major issue in the economy at the moment.  Almost every employer in almost every sector tells me that they now struggle to find staff.  The unwinding of the PUP and EWSS might ease the situation, but also the other issue is work permits.  We might get back to that later, but we are trying to deal with the very significant backlog that has developed because of a surge in applications for work permits and rising costs, both of which are not under the control of the Government.  Rising energy costs are hitting businesses just as they are hitting households.  On rising insurance costs, people know the work we are doing through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform to try and get employers' liability, EL, and public liability, PL, down in particular.  We got good results in motor insurance, but we are not yet seeing EL and PL insurance costs coming down.<br/><br/>On the agrifood scheme, &euro;70 million of the &euro;100 million has been allocated to businesses around the country to help them to essentially diversify into markets other than the UK and to move up the value chain with the food products they produce.  We have &euro;30 million that is not yet allocated, but we will allocate that this year.  We will do a further call for that &euro;30 million, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, again encouraging food producers to essentially invest capital to modernise their plant, become more sustainable environmentally and produce products that are higher up the value chain.<br/><br/>In terms of the towns, every town is different, so every town needs its own plan, but we are helping with the remote working hubs.  We do not fund them all through Enterprise Ireland; others are funded through the Department of Rural and Community Development under the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  There is a lot of them now - 150 or so - and we think there will be 400 by the end of the year.  <i>Connectedhubs.ie</i>is a very good website to take a look at and see where the hubs are and how easy it is to book a hot desk almost anywhere in the country if someone needs one.  We see ourselves continuing to invest in them in the years to come because it allows us to bring old buildings in town and village centres back to use and get people back into the town and village centres, which is exactly what we want.<br/><br/>The IDA Ireland property programme is working very well.  I know people often ask why the authority does not do more site visits to their county or town, but if you do a site visit, ideally, you want to show the visitors something.  What has been successful around the country is where IDA Ireland built out an office building or a factory and it is then ready to be taken over by the investor.  Of the 11 built in recent times, nine are occupied, and we are going to continue to build them out around the country so that we can have more options for multinationals in particular to invest in all parts of the country and not just in Dublin.  I think I have probably covered everything there.</p></speech>

I ask him to convey our congratulations to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the LEOs.  The numbers are truly astounding looking at the decade.  In 2011, we had 300,000 people working in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland companies and now we have 500,000.  It is an extraordinary expansion in our export base.  Most of them are very innovative and enterprising companies.  That is the backbone of the progress we have made.  The role of the public service in facilitating that needs to be acknowledged.</p> <p>  I acknowledge not only the five new workers' rights, but rights for the undocumented, a new focus on quality work through apprenticeships, a reform of the CAO system and innovative enterprises.  We are at the foothills of a lot more expectation on enterprise, not only towards workers but also towards climate and the circular economy.  I am interested in the Minister's views on how we ensure that those high-quality changes can be made by small business, the same as large.  Many large companies stick on their brand references to having a low carbon footprint and all the rest of it by 2050 but this will be much more of a challenge for the small companies.</p> <p>  The Minister did not mention the circular economy.  I know it is not everyone's cup of tea.  However, it is much more meaningful than just looking at climate alone, but at the materials and processes used as well as the opportunity for repair and upgrade during the lifetime of the product, the patterns of use by consumers and the waste and end-of-life situation.  Has the Department started to think more seriously about how we get that level of quality into the design of what we do in Ireland?  In ten years, this will be the source of competitive advantage.  The enterprises that can show that they have changed the impact of their entire supply chain will be the winners.  I am interested in the Minister's view on that because one of the strengths of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland is that they have always looked around the next hill to see where the opportunities lie.  I strongly believe that this is where opportunities will lie in the future.</p></speech>

I will make sure what he said at the start of his contribution is passed on to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and my departmental officials as well.  To answer his first question on how we enable SMEs to make high-quality changes in the way the big firms do, we are very aware that the smaller firms will need additional help to make the changes that need to be made.  As part of the European recovery fund, we secured multi-annual funding for a digital transformation fund and a climate transition fund.  We have not fully decided how we are going to use all of that.  The money we have is not enormous, but we think it will help to prompt businesses to make the right changes to digitalise and also to embrace climate action, including the circular economy.  The climate transition fund has two parts now.  There is a climate enterprise action fund and a climate carbon reduction fund.  It is about awareness and doing climate audits and teaching businesses sustainable practices.  The climate reduction fund is more for capital investment and measures such as heat pumps, for example, capital investment that help to improve the carbon footprint of companies.  I anticipate that there will be another future growth loan guarantee scheme, which was really popular.  While we do not have sanction for it yet, we have an understanding at government level that we will be able to develop a new loan product this year and there will be a very strong focus on climate and digital with regard to that.</p> <p>  Other schemes include those provided by LEOs, green for micro, and lean for micro and funds that are used to help businesses to take climate action and also to digitalise as well.  When it comes to the circular economy, that is probably something that my Department and I need to take a bit more interest in this year.  I started to learn about it in recent months.  I was in the centre in Ballymun last year to see what they do there.  I dipped into it myself by getting two pairs of runners that I was going to throw out renovated.  They are great.  They look like they are new although they are seven years old.  In the past I would have thrown them out and bought a new pair but instead I got them renovated by an Irish small business for approximately &euro;60 instead of buying a new pair.</p><p>I was very impressed with that.  Fashion is just one small area, but we buy so much fashion imported from abroad and then discard it.  Let us think about the number of Irish jobs that could be created by people repairing, reusing and renovating clothes, suits, footwear and so forth.  It is only a small part of the circular economy but there are big opportunities to create employment in this area.  It is something I will have to pay more attention to this year.  Separately, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications is drafting legislation on this.  I am not sure exactly how that is going to work but there is legislation due on the circular economy.</p></speech>

What he is talking about is not really much of a right if it is just the right to request.  If we had a situation where one has a right to request the minimum wage, people would think that was laughable.  It is similar with the right to request time off or the right to request a vote.  It is not much of a right if one is providing that the employee can ask for it and the employer can reject it on the ground that it is not suitable on business grounds.  The Minister helpfully gives 13 reasons it may not be suitable, but stresses that it is not limited to those.  Effectively, he is turning the clock back.  One of the few benefits for workers during the pandemic in terms of being able to work from home is being reversed and we are returning to a situation where workers will be compelled to go to the workplace, even if their work can be done effectively at home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#D00400"><p>I totally reject that it is turning the clock back.  At present, workers do not have a legal right to request remote working.  What is happening in practice at workplace level all over Ireland is that people are being very sensible.  Even where employees do not have the right to remote working provided for in their contract, employers and employees are being very practical in the workplace and agreeing arrangements that suit both sides.  That is what will happen; it is what is happening.</p> <p>  During the pandemic people were told to work at home.  Some people will want to go back to the office full time, others will want to work remotely and most will want to blend.  In the vast majority of circumstances that will be worked out at workplace level without the need for any Government intervention.  Where this becomes relevant is in those cases where is no contractual right at present to remote working and where an employer has not worked out something at workplace level with the employees.  In the proposed legislation, for example, there is a requirement that every business should have a remote working policy.  That is not the case at present.  I believe it would be beneficial for existing staff or any new staff that might arrive to at least know what their employer's policy is with regard to remote working.  The legal right is essentially a procedure that will be followed if somebody requests remote working.  It requires that the employer takes it seriously and allows for appeals to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p> <p>  However, the legislation is only at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  I am open to the view that it needs to be strengthened.  Perhaps 13 reasons are too many and perhaps we have to make sure, as I indicated in the interviews I did about it, that it is not just a procedural right, that it is not a case of an employer just ticking a box and saying "No", that it is possible to have that reviewed and that somebody cannot just manifestly and ridiculously refuse a request that is reasonable.  I am open to having the legislation strengthened.  It is only at pre-legislative stage as the Bill is not yet drafted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#D00500"><p>I will explore that further.  I take the Minister's point, which I welcome, that he is willing to review it.  As it stands, however, all this provides is the right to request and the right to the employer to say "No".  Even the suggestion that 13 reasons might be too many misses the point.  The 13 reasons are just examples that are given.  Instead, there is an overarching position that the proposal requested is not suitable on business grounds.  The heads of Bill explain, without prejudice to business grounds, that the business grounds may include them but are not limited to them.  As it stands, an employer can reject the request simply on the ground that it does not suit the employer's business.  The employer can give a number of examples, but can simply say that it is not suitable on business grounds.</p> <p>  There is another point.  Is it not case that, as it is currently drafted, if the employer says "No" within the designated timeframe, the employee has no right to appeal?  There is no right to appeal on substantive grounds as the legislation is currently drafted.  Instead, it is only if the employer fails to meet, for example, the procedure around it, so the employer is delayed in responding to the employee.  However, if the employer says it is not possible to do the job or work cannot be reorganised among existing staff, even if that is patently ridiculous, one cannot appeal the substantive rejection.  Under the heads of the Bill, one can only appeal a procedural error by the employer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#D00600"><p>That is correct but, as I indicated on the day the heads were published, we intend to strengthen that so it is not just a procedural right.  It cannot be the case that an employer just ticks one of 13 boxes or ticks another box.  This will be more than a procedural right.  If the rejection is manifestly unfair, the WRC will be able to respond to that.  However, we have to be realistic as well.  There cannot be an absolute right to remote working.  People understand that there are a huge number of jobs that cannot be done remotely, such as construction, most of retail, hospitality and manufacturing.  I will not bore members with the list as they all know how many jobs cannot be done remotely.  It is also the case that there is other work that it might be possible to do remotely but by doing that the services provided to the public would be diminished and, perhaps, business performance would be reduced.  That is not fair either.  We have to get the balance right here in how this lands.  The view of the Attorney General, which is very strong, and I have 36 pages of legal advice on this, is that there are strong limitations on the extent to which the Government can intervene and alter a contract that an employer and employee have entered into freely and legally.</p> <p>  The legislation can be strengthened and I intend to strengthen it.  I hope some good proposals emerge from the committee when it does its pre-legislative scrutiny.  What happened in the pandemic is that remote working or home working happened suddenly.  There was a big change as a consequence of the pandemic which was largely positive, but a lot of complicated things were not teased out.  We have to tease them out now.  Health and safety is an example.  How is that going to apply in the home?  To what extent would the employer be responsible for an injury in one's home office or if one burns oneself in one's kitchen while one is on a work break?  Many of these things have to be teased out, and they could not be teased out during the pandemic.  We have an opportunity to do that now.  That is why in-depth pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee would be very welcome on this legislation.  I am very open-minded about changes and improvements, but I do not want to cod people either.  There cannot be an absolute right to remote working because some jobs cannot be done remotely and people need autonomy to run their businesses as they see fit.</p></speech>

To be clear, what the Minister is proposing is not a right to remote working in certain circumstances.  All that is being proposed is the right to request it.  There is a big gap between the absolute right to work remotely regardless of the job and, on the other hand, just the right to ask and the right of the employer to refuse.</p></speech>

I had a Topical Issue debate this morning and that delayed me.  I will not rehearse my and my party's view on the right to be turned down when making a remote working request, which is what some people have nicknamed the legislation.  I welcome that the Minister is open to amendments to it and that he acknowledges the need for it to be strengthened.  We are happy to work with the Department and the committee to ensure that the legislation is made fit for purpose, if it can be, and I look forward to that engagement.</p> <p>  With reference to the matter at hand, we had representatives of IDA Ireland before the committee last week and we will have representatives of Enterprise Ireland before the committee in the coming weeks.  The data in the briefing document regarding the employment figures for companies supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland indicate a robustness in respect of employment and when one looks at the jobs, enterprise and development programme figures from page 77 onwards the expectation looks positive.  However, when one looks at the metrics for the LEOs the Department does not appear to have as ambitious an outlook for this group.</p><p>It states that the 2022 output target is 1,800 new jobs created for LEO client companies.  Given the funding for LEOs is significantly below that of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, is there a case to be made that with greater investment and support for the talents that exist in LEOs that they could help to deliver greater employment in conjunction with the SMEs and microbusinesses that they work with?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#E00200"><p>The short answer to the question is "Yes".  Could the LEOs do more?  If we scaled them up and provided them with additional funding and additional staff?  Could we be more ambitious in the job creation targets that we set for them?  I think that we could.  We are increasing resources for LEOs and scaling them up.  We probably could do more.  One of things, as I mentioned, is the alignment of work with slightly larger companies, so those with more than ten employees, into the future.</p> <p>  One of the issues that we run into around limitations for LEOs is that, unlike Enterprise Ireland client companies and IDA Ireland companies, most of them are not involved in exports and, therefore, it is often a company that is competing with another company down the road or another company in the domestic market.  We have to be careful that when we provide aid to a company that we are not supporting them financially to the detriment of a competitor down the road.  That is something we always have to bear in mind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#E00300"><p>I appreciate the need to be careful.  Equally, there is a need to be ambitious, with which I am sure that the Minister will agree.  It is welcome that he is open to looking at the funding for LEOs but he needs to put a bit of action behind that.  They have the potential.  Notwithstanding the concerns raised about funding one company to put another company out of business, and I get that nobody wants to see that, there is a balance to be struck.  When comparing the funding for the Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland with funding for LEOs, a cogent argument can be made to increase funding and set ambitious targets.  I thank the Minister for his response.</p> <p>  In programme C, the associated documents outline increased funding of &euro;526,000 for the WRC.  It indicates that this will allow the WRC to increase its staffing complement and inspectors are specifically referenced, which is welcome.  Is there a reason that on page 84 there are no metrics for the WRC even though there are metrics for other regulatory bodies?  Is that an oversight?  Can the Minister confirm how many additional WRC inspectors and staff will be recruited?  How many additional inspections will the WRC carry out?</p> <p>  I have come across a number of cases, and I know that this matter has crossed the desk of the Minister as well, where organisations that are wholly funded by the State refuse to recognise trade unions in some instance, or attend the WRC in some instances, and after they attend the commission walk away from recommendations.  It makes no sense that there are two arms of the State.  There are organisations that are funded wholly and entirely by the State and provide services on behalf of the State that feel they can simply look at WRC recommendations, or invitations to attend conciliation, and simply not go.  These are really vital community services.  The workers who are involved in the delivery of these services do not want to be all the time running in and out to the WRC, threatening industrial action and balloting for industrial action because they know the importance of the services that they provide.  Can the Minister comment on this matter?  I fully appreciate that he cannot interfere in every local case but there should be a mechanism by which organisations that are State funded should respect the third-party machinery of the State.  Every time there is a dispute the Minister and his colleagues in government will say that the matter has gone to the third-party machinery and cannot interfere but when organisations walk away from the results then there is precious little point in them going in the first instance.</p></speech>

I think I am correct that we are increasing the number of inspectors by ten this year.  We plan to expand that service, and expand the WRC, over the next couple of years.  With more people at work then there is going to be more work for the commission.  We also need to increase the number of labour inspections happening in general in certain parts of the economy.  I am going to try and get those numbers now, if I can, but I think that it is ten additional WRC inspectors or staff for this year.</p></speech>

Is that ten additional staff?  My understanding is that some of the people are coming up to retirement this year.  If three of them go then there will only be seven.

The WRC is staffed by 200 civil servants.  There has been a 25% increase in staffing since October 2015.  Total funding for 2022 is &euro;15.7 million with an additional &euro;500,000 to allow for additional inspectors to be hired.  The total number of WRC inspectors will increase, therefore, from the current sanction of 60 to 70 over the coming years.  That is a net increase of ten.  We will need to build on that in the years ahead because there is a backlog of work to be done.</p></speech>

I will not refer to any one specifically but they think that there will be no comeback for them other than that which the workers will do by way of industrial action.  We should do everything that we can to avoid employees having no option but industrial action.  A recognition dispute in the private sector is par for the course and trade unions will deal with those.  A recognition dispute in the community, voluntary or semi-State sector should be relatively unheard of.  There is a partnership approach and we could spend all day debating how that fares for workers but there is a partnership approach, particularly in the public service.  I cannot understand why these organisations, and I am not referring to any one in particular, feel that they can walk away from third-party recommendations, shrug their shoulders and they know that there is going to be no comeback.  They do not even get a letter from the relevant Minister to ask them to engage and work with the representatives that the workers have chosen to represent them.  It is very poor form that we repeatedly get requests from workers where an award has been made and the employer simply says that he or she is not implementing that.  That is a recipe for industrial chaos when we do not need that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#E01400"><p>There will be occasions even when Departments take that approach and there can be good reasons in individual circumstances.  The Deputy will know that decisions are not binding.  Some countries have binding decisions where they are binding on the union and the employer but it does not work like that in our system.  As the Deputy will know, unions very often do not accept a recommendation from the WRC so this works both ways.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#E01500"><p>They do acknowledge the WRC.  My issue is not about whether the recommendation is accepted.  My issue is about whether organisations will actually go into the WRC and engage in the process.  That is the difficulty very often even when a case does not reach the stage of a recommendation being issued.  This matter comes under the remit of the Minister, he has direct responsibility for the WRC and he sits at the Cabinet table where State-funded organisations, funded by other Departments, wilfully ignore the recommendations.  Such a situation is acceptable or sustainable.  Therefore, we need some strong action from the Minister, as the person responsible for the WRC, and collectively as a Government to say that this is not on.  That should be done.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that he wishes that they would engage.  They are not engaging and that is a simple fact today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#E01600"><p>The Deputy has made a fair point.  Being bound by a recommendation is different from engaging.  Public bodies and private entities that are funded largely by the State, I think, should engage with the industrial machinery of the State.  I do not know whether it can be done but maybe in the future what we should write into contracts and tenders is a requirement that they do so in order that they are willing to engage in what are essentially the mechanisms of the State.  If one wants a contract from the State then perhaps we should consider working that into contracts but that is something I will have to get advice on as to whether it is possible, and what the pros and cons are.</p></speech>

In his remarks, the Minister said he wanted to expand the work and capacity of the WRC over the next couple of years.  Is there a written-down plan relating to that in terms of targets to be hit and the number of inspectors?  While any increase is welcome, 70 is still below the figure recommended in 2006.  The population and the numbers in employment have gone up and the demand on the WRC and for inspections will go up with them.  The Minister said he was going to expand it over the next couple of years but is there a written-down plan with targets set?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#F00200"><p>No, we do not have a multi-annual plan in that sense.  I think the target for 90 related to the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, and a lot has changed since then, including the establishment of the WRC.  That target relates to an agreement from quite some time ago.  The objective this year is to go from 60 to 70.  I intend to seek sanction in the budget next year to have a similar increase the year after so that would get us up towards 80.  What will be interesting to see is how we get on with regard to recruitment because as is the case across the economy, recruitment is a real challenge between retirement and additional inspectors.  If we can get to 70 this year, that will put me in a strong position to look for funding in the budget to get to 80 next year but we do not have an multi-annual plan as such.</p></speech>

Regarding the number of high-potential female-led start-ups, the output target for 2022 is 22.  In 2020, the outturn was 19 out of 22 while in 2021, the outturn was nine out of a target of 22.  Is the Minister confident that this year, the target of 22 can be reached?  Similarly, is he confident that the targets for women on boards of listed companies can also be reached by the end of the year?</p></speech>

Unless there is some major shock to the economy that we are not expecting, they can be achieved.  We are ahead of target when it comes to targets relating to female participation on boards.  I work very closely with Balance for Better Business.  All the interim targets have been met and, therefore, that would give me confidence that the target can be met this year.</p></speech>

I have been engaging with Mr. Martin Shanahan and we are very happy in Waterford about the announcement of the advanced factory.  The contract has been signed to build that so that is good news.  The Minister highlighted in his presentation that there was an &euro;80 million carryover from last year in unused capital appropriation.  A capital support fund was opened up late in the year for Enterprise Ireland where the window of opportunity was only three months.  Somebody had to procure, spend and have it all invoiced and done within a three-month window.  I will get the Minister the name of the fund; I cannot think of it offhand.  It is something that needs to be looked at.  It is not feasible to ask business to engage in that way.  We all know the difficulties involved in even trying to get builders at the moment, and that was something I wanted to highlight.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the climate action fund, climate investment fund and, hopefully, new climate and digital loan products.  We have a significant problem, as does Europe and the rest of the world, namely, the increasing use of plastics.  We are doing very little to mitigate plastic production.  The idea that all plastic is recyclable is not true.  We need a strategy.  It is not enough to say, "Reduce and reuse".  We need a strategy to get other packaging into the supply chain.  A significant volume of plastic nanoparticles is entering the organic biosphere and will poison us all over the next 50 years, notwithstanding global warming.  This is something the Department could lead on.  </p> <p>  Another issue I would like to touch on is public procurement, which I have raised previously.  We have public procurement policies that are not helping SMEs to get on that public procurement pathway, particularly smaller businesses.  An issue I must raise directly with the Minister relates to some health procurement.  The HSE is trying to change certain contracts and derogate what it agreed to in contract terms.  This needs to be flagged.  A number of businesses are in this space and are suffering very badly.  </p> <p>  The last issue I wish to raise involves insurance and occupier's liability.  I know the Minister heads up the Cabinet subgroup.  The duty of care legislation was promised in September 2021.  The spring legislative programme made no reference to that.  Can he outline what obstacles are holding that up and when we can expect some reform and legislation to be presented on duty of care?  Owner's and occupier's liability is so important now.  It is a significant headwind in respect of insurance costs for business going into this year and beyond.</p></speech>

It has been really good news and my thanks go to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for that.  I think there will be a good pipeline of investment for Waterford and the south east in particular.</p> <p>  There was a lot of unused capital last year.  Much of it was related to Covid; things that were supposed to happen that just did not happen and construction delays in particular.  We have been able to carry approximately &euro;100 million of that.  Sometimes what Departments try to do at the end of the year is spend unused capital.  That means putting together a scheme and trying to administer it quickly.  It is far from ideal.  It probably works better around equipment than things that require build.  What we try to do sometimes is get money out towards the end of the year rather than hand it back but perhaps that is not best practice.  Multi-annual budgeting would be a lot better but we are allowed to carry over approximately 10% of any underspend.  That at least does help.  The carryover last year will be targeted at the Covid credit guarantee, sustaining enterprise fund and other supports.  </p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about plastic.  A lot of plastic can be recycled that could not be recycled in the past.  People can put a lot more in their green bin than they did in the past and there are a lot of plant-based alternatives to plastic but, obviously, this is more an area for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications than it is for me.  </p> <p>  I will have to follow up on the issue of duty of care with regard to insurance.  That falls under the remit of the Minister for Justice.  She and her Department have done some work in that area.  The idea was to reform the Civil Liability Act to rebalance duty of care so that people are expected to be a bit more responsible about not injuring themselves.  Again, it is important to get that right.  The ministerial committee on insurance will meet in the next couple of weeks.  An update will then to go to Cabinet on the progress made in implementing the actions.  I will make sure duty of care forms part of that update.  </p></speech>

Could the Minister comment on that?  My colleagues in the Regional Group and I met him in last autumn on the issue of buying local.  Does the Department have a programme for that initiative and the idea of trying to give public procurement support to indigenous companies?</p></speech>

We have not yet decided but are likely to do something similar this year.  PIAB falls under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, so he is leading reform of PIAB.  A general scheme to reform the board is expected to go to Government this month.  The aim of that is to facilitate and increase the number of personal injury claims that are resolved by the board, particularly to increase the incentive to accept the its award rather than going to court.</p><p>That is often where costs increase.  The Minister of State should have the general scheme published later this month.</p></speech>

InterTradeIreland, in particular, has been really successful with cross-border trade on both sides.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could pass on my comments.</p> <p>  He stated in his opening contribution, "We will also make progress towards a living wage for Ireland."  Will he confirm his understanding of a living wage?  What should be the rate?  How does the Minister intend to progress to that?</p> <p>  The Living Wage for Ireland group has a living wage of &euro;12.90.</p></speech>

On the living wage, we have asked the Low Pay Commission to do research on this and advise us.  The Chairman rightly pointed out that a group has pointed out what it believes the living wage should be in Ireland but any group can establish itself and come up what it thinks a living wage should be.  The appropriate body to do that is the Low Pay Commission.  It is a statutory tripartite body involving unions, employers and experts and they calculate the national minimum wage.  I imagine it will be the body we ask to calculate the living wage when we are able to introduce it.</p> <p>  The research will look at three areas: how a living wage should be calculated, who it should apply to and how we would phase it in.  It is intended that it would be higher than the existing national minimum wage.  There are different ways that it can be calculated.  Some calculate it by the minimal essential standard of living, MESL, and that it is all about what is put in the basket.  There is the question of what is considered minimum and essential and what is not.  That is complicated but it might well be the right approach.   The other way, which is much simpler, is to have it as a percentage of the median wage.  It could be 55%, 60% or 65% of the median wage.  None of that is decided yet.  The purpose of the research is for the Low Pay Commission to study all that and present the Government with a recommendation or options. </p></speech>

The Revised Estimate states that &euro;1.69 million is being provided to the office and that it has "the requisite resources in its transformation to the robust, statutory and independent Corporate Enforcement Agency."  The brief states that it builds on the &euro;1 million additional funding previously provided to the ODCE to prepare for this transformation.</p> <p>  Before the committee last year, the agencies that front the battle against white-collar crime outlined how a lack of human and financial resources inhibited their ability to deliver on the remit.  I note the comments in the Minister's opening statement.  Does he feel an operational budget of approximately &euro;6 million, even if it is increased by a welcome 20% on the ODCE's previous budget, is sufficient given the important and very complex work the corporate enforcement agency will need to carry out?  </p></speech>

The idea is to get the new body up and running this year and to get it doing its work.  The legislation is done.  We need to now actually create the body and ensure it is up and running.  We do not have full agreement yet on resourcing from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is really important because we need garda&iacute; seconded to the authority if it is going to do its work properly.  We have a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is not yet signed.  We need to get all that done in the next couple of weeks and then set up the body.</p> <p>  The Garda headcount will go from seven to 16, so it is more than doubling of Garda resources for the body.  The headcount for the new agency will be 50% higher than was the case for the ODCE.  I am not saying that we will stop there; we need to scale it up and give it more resources in the years to come.  However, the target for this year is to get it up and running and working.</p></speech>

However, in its contact unit, the HSA handled 5,000 complaints, 47% of which related to Covid.  Less than half of complaints were directly Covid related yet more than 95% of inspections related directly to breaches or alleged breaches of Covid mitigation measures.  From these figures it would appear that the concentration on Covid, which I completely understand naturally had to come to the fore, was to the exclusion of other health, safety and welfare at work issues.  Complaints were being made that were being ignored.  My question is simple: is the Minister concerned that during the pandemic, under the cover of Covid, that breaches of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act were going undetected by virtue of the fact that the HSA, with the resources that it has, was concentrating almost exclusively on Covid-related measures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#G00800"><p>That is a fair question.  It is probably the case across the public service that the concentration on Covid sometimes meant that other work did not get the attention that it would have had there not been Covid.  The HSA would tell us that when it carries out an inspection, it does so in a way that is wide and comprehensive.  It does not simply narrow in on one thing that might be Covid compliance.  If it sees other health and safety issues or other health and safety issues are brought to its attention, it also deals with those.</p><p>On complaints,the HSA handled 5,000 complaints, 47% of which related to Covid.  There were 11,000 requests for information and more than 56,000 courses were done online with <i>hsalearning.ie</i>.  One very crude measure of health and safety in the workplace is the number of work-related fatalities.  That fell last year, thankfully.  One death in the workplace is one too many but there was a 38% decline in 2021 relative to 2020.  That is only a very crude measure of health and safety but it is good that it went in the right direction and we did not see a deterioration.</p></speech>

My concern is around the complaints that were referred and not followed up.  The Minister said that when the HSA goes in inspect, it inspects a range of issues but does he have the figures to back that up?  There were 7,400 workplace inspections.  Arising out of those, has he heard from the HSA specifically that other breaches were detected or was it simply the case that they were there to look at Covid?  They could have looked at something else but there was not something else there.  Are those figures interrogated by the Department?</p></speech>

There are regular meetings between my Department and the authority.  I do not have the figures to hand but I will see if I can get them.</p></speech>

I think it would paint a full picture.  People do not go to the authority on a whim.  It is something they do when they feel they have no other option.  Very often, they have raised the issues at workplace level but they have not had any traction on it.  My concern is that the concentration on Covid, while completely understandable, may have allowed other breaches.  I am not going to put words in the Minister's mouth but I assume that he shares those concerns.  It needs to be followed up.  It is not good enough to say that when they are there they will have a look at everything because there could be a complete disparity between the calls that were made and the inspections that took place.  A closer look at those figures to see exactly how many were related to Covid and were then broadened out would tell us the extent to which those other issues are being dealt with.  Then there are still the remaining issues that could not be addressed through a workplace inspection.  Some may not have been appropriate to a workplace inspection, which I understand, but those figures are fairly significant.  The hope would be that as Covid recedes, touch wood, that they will get back to the normal regime of responding to those complaints as they are made and carrying out inspections as they are required.</p><p>On page 32 there is a breakdown of funding for programme expenditure areas highlighting the moneys both current and capital going to the three different programmes.  Programme A on jobs and enterprise development, receives more than &euro;561 million, programme B on innovation and commercialisation receives more than &euro;275 million and programme C on regulation receives more than &euro;105 million.  It is somewhat the Cinderella or poor relation of that group.  It would seem there is plenty of funding to go to business and development, all of which is important.  I accept that.  I am trying to understand why there was no appetite within the Department to allocate additional moneys to programme C, which is to help the HSA, WRC, ODCE, CCPC and other agencies that are trying to deliver on their mandates, especially after the good work we saw done by the HSA and WRC throughout the pandemic in keeping workers safe at work.</p></speech>

With regard to other health and safety matters, it is possible that other health and safety breaches went undetected and uninspected because of the focus on Covid-19.  At the same time, though, I would hope that part of the experience of the pandemic and Covid-19 has helped to raise that bar in respect of health and safety in the workplace.  It made people much more aware of respiratory etiquette, hand washing, the need for hygiene and cleaning, the benefits of separating people out and not crowding them into a workplace and the benefits of good air quality.  It could be that one of the positive legacies of the pandemic is a higher bar and greater awareness of health and safety in the workplace more generally.</p> <p>  Programme C does not get less money because it is less important.  The programme on regulation gets less money because what is done in programmes A and B is very expensive.  They relate to capital grants, by and large, for constructing buildings and helping to build plants and factories and so on.  That is obviously much more expensive than regulation, which is mainly down to salaries.  There has been a very considerable increase in resources for all the regulatory agencies in the past couple of years.  That goes for the WRC, HSA, ODCE and National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, as well.  We would anticipate seeing resources and budgets for those agencies continuing to rise.</p></speech>

I genuinely wish I shared his optimism with regard to the bar being raised simply because people are now more aware of the need for separation, hand washing, etc.  My fear is because of the time lost.  It is in the Minister's statement that he will bring forward workers' rights legislation, some of which will be welcome and some of which will have to be subject to amendment as we have discussed.</p> <p>  I do not necessarily share the Minister's optimism, however, with regard to things not going back to the way they were.  My experience from talking to workers' representatives and workers is that there was a rush back to business as usual for an awful lot of people, that is, working in a place where the protocols cannot be observed and where people are all squashed in together. etc.  I do not, therefore, share the his optimism; I wish I did.  We will leave that where it is.</p> <p>  I have one more question on climate action.  It is one of the most important challenges we as a globe are going to face and we here in Ireland are facing it too.  A significant section in the overview relates to this.  How does this fit in with the aspirations expressed by the Minister and his Department?   How does it fit in alongside IDA Ireland's role in marketing Ireland as somewhere to locate data centres?</p> <p>  It was reported that the authority's global head of strategy, public policy and international financial services raised concerns with a senior official in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that data centres were being scapegoated and portrayed as the "culprit for current electricity problems".  I do not believe that is the case but I do not think the Minister or anybody else is going to deny that they make a massive contribution to being the "culprit for current electricity problems" and, indeed, the crisis we have in our electricity supply.  Last week, the head of IDA Ireland appeared before the committee to defend its role in data centres.  Given the electricity consumed by such centres has jumped by 144% in five years, how does this square and fit with the climate action aims of the Department?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022020200002#H00400"><p>The way IDA Ireland would describe it is that in Ireland we try to build an ecosystem for investment.  We have done very well in terms of life sciences and tech and data centres are part of that, particularly when it comes to tech investment.  That is the argument IDA Ireland would make as to why we should continue to host them in Ireland.  If we want to encourage tech investment in Ireland and companies and start-ups to invest here, we cannot say that one aspect of tech, which is data, is something we do not want in our country.  We have to be able to provide the electricity, however.</p> <p>  The Deputy pointed out that 10% or 11% of electricity is now used by data centres, which is quite a lot.  One would think it was more than 10% or 11% based on some of the reports and comments but it has been increasing considerably in recent years.  Because of the grid constraints now, I believe we will see a slowdown in the number of data centres being connected, particularly around Dublin.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how it squares with our climate objectives.  It can only square with our climate objectives if we make sure the electricity we use is green.  Data centres will have to be somewhere in the world.  We all use data.  We are using it now because we are holding this meeting remotely.  When this meeting is over, we will all be on our phones using data.  Data has to be stored somewhere and if it is going to be stored anywhere in the world, it should be stored somewhere it can be powered by renewable electricity.  How we square that with our objectives as a Department is to dramatically increase the volume of renewable electricity we produce and renewable energy we use so that green power is powering those centres and everything else.</p></speech>

Could he put some figures on that?  The figure of 11% is a lot.  I do not hear anyone saying it is any more than 11% but I hear people saying it is currently at 11%.  That is where we are sort of starting from today.  It is only going in one direction.  It is only going up so 11% of the grid is already fairly significant.  I do not think that needs to be overblown by anybody.  It stands alone as a high figure.  The Minister has acknowledged that it is going to increase.  Can he put a figure on what he predicts will be something of an inevitable slowdown either in Dublin or across the State?  Does he have it either in his head or as part of his climate policy that when the figure gets to, we will say 11%, that is very high?  Will he stop at 15% or is it 20%?  At what point does he make the decision that our electricity supply is being put at risk by the establishment of data centres, which, as we all know, may drive a certain element of industry but does not create employment?  We are talking about tiny numbers of people being employed in them.  What is the cut-off in the Minister's head or according to the Department in this regard?  Where does it stop?</p></speech>

It is a decision for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The Deputy will have seen the new policy it produced in the past couple of months recognising that because there are constraints on the system, there will be fewer data centre connections over the next couple of years, particularly in the Dublin region where capacity is tight.  The way I see it is that we need to produce much more electricity in Ireland, largely from renewable sources.  We need it not just for data centres by any means but to power industry, electric cars and our homes.  We need to get off fossil fuels over the next couple of years and decades and move towards renewable electricity, green hydrogen and other fuels.  We are constrained, however.  We do not produce enough electricity in Ireland to suits the needs and demands.  We have to prioritise at the moment.  Data centres would be of a lower priority than homes, hospitals, schools or industry itself.  That is why they are not being connected.</p></speech>

I appreciate what the Minister said about the constraints but I would appreciate even more a response from him that would indicate that he acknowledges the constraints and will be able to ensure that figure of 11% does not get any bigger.  He has just accepted it will get bigger.  There does not seem to be any limit set by the Minister or his Department.  By the way, it is not necessarily that he has the power to enforce it but he should have an idea in his head of what percentage of the electricity generated will be given to these data centres.</p></speech>

They are using 11% and that is only going to rise.  As he said, 11% is a very high figure so 11% of a bigger figure is an even higher amount of electricity.  That is the only direction in which it is going.</p></speech>

I put a lot of work into setting that up.  I ask the Minister to pass on my congratulations and encouragement to the campaign to keep going.  A small number of companies still do not have female directors and they need to be focused on and encouraged to make the necessary changes.</p> <p>  I am also pleased that the Department is increasing the number of staff processing work permits.  It is an area on which we get a lot of representations because there are lots of delays there and with the shortages of labour now, it is an issue of real concern.  I encourage the Department to expedite the process of increasing the numbers working on work permits and to see what can be done to ensure that applications are turned around faster than is the case currently.  Some work permits can take a long time to be processed and people out there are under a lot of pressure trying to access labour.</p> <p>  On that point, I mentioned earlier the issue of encouraging and supporting Irish people who wish to return to Ireland.  I refer to those who emigrated for a few years, some of whom have small children now, who want to come home and work here.  In the past, some Departments held jobs fairs where they went abroad, not just to look for investment but also to encourage people to come back here.  Has any thought been given to doing that?  Is that happening now or is the Department considering it?  When people do come back they face challenges in finding accommodation and in getting insurance, driver's licences, and so on.  These challenges must be overcome for them to be able to perform here.</p> <p>  Another issue that I have raised from time to time is the security of our mobile telephone platforms, about which a number of businesses are concerned.  The issues of cybersecurity and data security need more attention.  Some people have suggested to me that our mobile telephone platforms are not secure and can be easily hacked.  The data of businesses, politicians and VIPs can be accessed easily, their conversations can be accessed, their locations can be identified and so forth.  This is something that needs attention at Government level, particularly as it could have an impact on business and FDI.</p> <p>  Another issue of concern is State-backed export credit insurance.  We are one of the few exporting countries in Europe that does not have such a scheme.  In 2020, there was an extension to the state aid derogation from the European Commission in respect of credit insurance or implementing cuts.  Exporters are under pressure and are at a competitive disadvantage.  Has the Department done any work on this?  The Minister may not be able to answer now.  There may be costs involved in the State getting involved in something like this but as I understand it, we are one of the few northern countries that does not have a State-backed export credit insurance scheme. </p> <p>  I ask the Minister to comment on the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP.  How does he see that developing and does he believe it will be busy?  He may not know that for sure but what are the indications at this stage?  I know it has been set up and am interested to hear how it is going.</p> <p>  Finally, last week Mr. Martin Shanahan appeared before this committee and gave a very good overview of the work of IDA Ireland.  In my own area there is a very large authority-owned site that has been sitting idle for 12 years.  I am sure I mentioned it to the Minister previously but I just want to put it on the record.  The 56 ha, fully serviced site, which lies between Carrigtwohill and Midleton, has already cost the State &euro;100 million but has been idle for 12 years.  The road network is the main reason it cannot be accessed.  Recently, the Department of Transport decided not to fund Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to continue work it has already started to improve the road network so that this site can be accessed.  It is an absolutely fabulous site, totally flat and fully serviced with water, wastewater, electricity and so forth.  The local authority is totally perplexed as to why work on the road infrastructure, for which &euro;1.3 million has already been spent on improvement designs, has been put on the long finger.  I raised it in the D&aacute;il last night but the Minister for Transport was not available to respond.  I have written to him and I am still awaiting a response.  This is a serious issue from the point of view of inward investment, job creation and so on.  Not only that, TII has now objected to housing being developed in the area because the road infrastructure is not up to scratch.  It beggars belief that we have one arm of the State impeding IDA Ireland in its work of trying to attract investment to this particular site that is not very far from Cork city, its airport, port, universities and so forth.  There is a rail line at one side of the site.  We also have an arm of the State effectively blocking housing development that is badly needed too.  I ask the Minister to talk to the Minister for Transport about this and see if he will look at it again, seeing as so much money has been spent already.</p></speech>

We are pleased with the results we are getting in increasing the number of women on company boards.  However, we need to do a bit more on senior leadership teams where the numbers are not as good, albeit they are moving in the right direction.</p> <p>  On work permits, we have a real problem.  There is a 19- to 20-week wait for work permits to be processed and that is down to volume.  There has been a 70% increase in applications on last year.  That is probably distorted by the pandemic but even if we compare with 2019, there has been an increase of nearly 50% in applications.  This is a reflection of the fact that employers cannot get staff, not only in Ireland but from anywhere in the European Economic Area, and are now looking to take people in from outside of Europe.  It also reflects that we are allowing more work permits in areas like construction and agrifood where there are big labour shortages.  We are staffing up the section, big time.  We have gone from 15 or 16 staff to about 50.  We are also offering overtime and bringing in staff from other sections to process the permits.  A lot of the staff that are now processing permits are doing it for the first time and there is a bit of a learning curve.  That said, we anticipate - or at least the Secretary General assures me and the Minister of State, Deputy English - that we will see a big improvement over the next couple of months.  It is something we are monitoring on an almost daily basis because we know it is creating real problems for businesses.  They have staff who are willing and available to come to Ireland to provide care and to allow businesses to function but they cannot get them in.</p> <p>  On the returnees and jobs fairs, I will have to check on that and get back to the Deputy on it.  Generally, that is something that employers rather than the Department would do; we would just help out.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has some very good guides on what to do as a returnee, how to get car insurance and so forth.  The Department did some very good work on that in the past.  I will have to come back to the Deputy and get him a better, more detailed response.  The same goes for the question on mobile phone security, which is a cybersecurity issue under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  </p> <p>  We looked at the issue of an export credit insurance scheme a couple of years ago and decided not to go ahead with it.  The business case did not really stack up and there was a risk for the taxpayer.  We have had some bad experiences with such schemes in the past but we might look at it again.  </p> <p>  SCARP is new and is an alternative to court-based examinership.  Some people call it examinership light and it is designed to allow companies that would otherwise fail to restructure, renegotiate their debts and survive, allowing them to have another day and keep on their staff.  The proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating.  We have not yet seen many companies go through the process.  I read in the newspapers about one company that is going through the process now, which is a tourism business in County Kerry, but I am not sure of the details of that.  We are going to monitor things very closely over the next couple of months to see how many companies go through the process, what their experience is like and how many companies and jobs are saved as a result.  It is going to need to be up and running for at least six months, if not a year, before we can do that assessment properly.  </p> <p>  The Deputy and I have talked about the former Amgen site in east Cork previously.</p><p>I appreciate that he is using this opportunity to raise it again.  We as a Department want to see investment on that site.  A lot of investment has gone into it already.  That is taxpayers' money.  We want to see jobs and investment happening on that site.</p><p> I take the point the Deputy is making on the roads programme and the need to prioritise public transport but we also need to build roads because we need roads to access housing and IDA Ireland sites.  I have asked my officials in the authority to look at the eight projects that are stalled from the point of view of business and enterprise to see which ones should be prioritised.  I am getting many representations from people all over the country about road projects that have been slowed or stalled.  I want to get a sense from the authority and officials in my Department of which of those are most valuable economically.  I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on that once I have that analysis done.</p></speech>

I would be interested in hearing what IDA Ireland has to say about it.  I brought it up last week with Mr. Martin Shanahan.  Not only is the road down there extremely dangerous but the site has been lying idle and growing weeds for 12 years, when it should be providing employment at a high level.</p> <p>  I also thank the Minister for his comments on export credit insurance.  There is a tightening of credit insurance and I am told our companies are coming under pressure.  It would be useful to get briefings on that from the Department and maybe for the Department to look at this again.</p></speech>

In spite of the challenges posed by the pandemic, the commission carried out 7,687 inspections in 2020 and recovered almost &euro;1.7 million in unpaid wages for workers.  Data revealed by a parliamentary question outlined how, since 2011, the WRC has recovered almost &euro;18 million in withheld wages.  Further parliamentary question data revealed the scale and number of breaches of employment law detected by WRC investigations since 2015.  In those six years, it has detected breaches in employment law in more than one third of investigations.  A total of 35.9% of the cases investigated found breaches by employers regarding non-payment of the minimum wage, employment permits, protection of young persons, annual leave and public holidays and unpaid wages, among other areas.  That is a stark figure.  I ask the Minister and Department to put a focus on protecting workers and tackling rogue employers, who negatively impact on the vast majority of good employers, for the year ahead.   I thank him.</p></speech>

The vast majority of employers are good and treat their staff well.  I know he will agree with that.  The fact that one third of inspections throw up an issue does not mean that one third of businesses mistreat their workers because the WRC responds to complaints and targets businesses and sectors where it thinks there could be abuse.  It is still a lot and it is positive that this year we will have ten additional inspectors.  Hopefully that will allow more work to be done and more rights to be vindicated.</p></speech>

It is important to note that masks should continue to worn by those present when not addressing the committee.  I will remind members of this as necessary.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in any way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or any official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  The committee has agreed to examine the indexation of the welfare and taxation system.  The committee has scheduled a series of public meetings and intends to discuss several areas of interest, including the rationale for indexation, the creation of an indexation system, the operation of that system and the impact of indexation on budgetary sustainability.  We also hope to publish a report on the topic.  Today is the second of these meetings.n behalf of the committee.  I welcome Dr. Claire Keane and Dr. Karina Doorley from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  I invite Dr. Keane to make her opening statement on behalf of the ESRI.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Claire Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to the ESRI to appear before the committee.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Karina Doorley.  We work in the area of taxation, welfare and pensions research at the ESRI.  We are happy to provide our views on indexing the tax and welfare system and will focus on the rationale for indexation, how such a system could be created and the economic sustainability of such a system.</p> <p>  I will first speak to the rationale for indexation.  Indexation, or changing the monetary parameters of the tax and welfare system in line with price or earnings changes, is often suggested as a useful policy tool, both nationally and internationally.  Currently, the Irish tax and benefit system is not automatically indexed.  Instead, discretionary changes to tax and welfare parameters are announced, usually at budget time.  Historically, these changes have, on average, kept pace with earnings growth, although on a year-to-year basis, there can be some deviation.</p> <p>  The absence of a rule for increasing welfare payments, tax credits and bands in line with inflation or earnings growth has implications for household purchasing power, the Exchequer, poverty and income inequality.  If we consider a year in which price growth is 2% and earnings growth, which is usually higher, is 4%, and if all tax and welfare parameters are frozen, the purchasing power of those receiving welfare falls and income taxpayers face paying more of their income in taxes, a position known as fiscal drag.  The Exchequer experiences an increase in income in real terms due to this fiscal drag.  People may also lose eligibility to cash and non-cash benefits, such as medical cards, housing and childcare subsidies and student grants, due to earnings growth.  Income inequality tends to increase as the incomes of those dependent on welfare falls relative to workers.</p> <p>  If tax and welfare parameters increase in line with price growth, the purchasing power of those receiving welfare is constant, Exchequer revenue from income tax still increases in real terms, as tax credits and bands fail to keep pace with wage growth, and income inequality increases, albeit by less than in the case of no indexation.  Only by indexing tax and welfare parameters in line with wage growth do welfare recipients and workers see their income grow at the same rate.  This wage indexation scenario is distributionally neutral in that it keeps at-risk of poverty rates and income inequality constant.</p> <p>  The creation and operation of an indexation system first requires the identification of a benchmark, or a desirable or adequate level of welfare benefits.  Once the benchmark has been reached, further increases can continue to be linked to the benchmark or to a price or earnings index.  Previous expert groups have suggested benchmarks for the Irish welfare system.  The report of the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group from 2001 suggested that if indexation were to be adopted, the lowest welfare rates should be increased to 27% of gross average industrial earnings.  in 2010, the national pensions framework suggested that the State pension should be benchmarked at just over a third of average weekly earnings to prevent elderly poverty, with the road map for pensions reform suggesting a similar benchmark.</p> <p>  In terms of which index to use, ESRI research argues that the natural index for indirect taxation is prices to ensure that taxes set at a fixed rate per unit of a commodity, such as excise duties and the carbon tax, remain constant in real terms. However, indexation based on earnings growth may be more suitable for income tax and welfare parameters if the aim of indexation is to avoid poverty or inequality increases.</p> <p>  Internationally, there are many examples of indexation systems in operation.  There are few examples of automatic and unified earnings indexation, such as in Denmark, and the most common practice remains adjustment linked to prices.  When uprating is linked to earnings, this is often limited to pension benefits.  Indexation of tax bands and credits is much less common in Europe but more commonly seen in the US and Canada.</p><p>While typically wages rise by more than prices, they can both be subject to cyclical variations and at times if wage growth falls behind price growth, then indexation with respect to real wages would imply falls in real incomes for welfare recipients.  If welfare payments are protected during downturns, they must be increased by less than the full extent of growth in upturns to avoid what is known as a ratcheting effect whereby social welfare rates grow faster than either incomes or inflation in the long term.<br/><br/>Regarding budgetary sustainability, it is important to bear in mind that automatic indexation removes some discretion available to Government each year and can reduce the scope for more targeted measures for groups considered to be at greater risk of poverty or deprivation.  It can also limit the Government&rsquo;s ability to respond to economic shocks.  ESRI research by Callan <i>et al</i>, estimated the net cost of indexing the tax and welfare system in 2020.  In that year indexation would have cost between &euro;462 million for price indexation or &euro;1.3 billion for wage indexation.  That was between 10% and 29% of the available fiscal space that year.<br/><br/>In summary, indexation, or a lack thereof, has implications for poverty and inequality.  While price indexation of the tax and welfare system would ensure that inflation does not erode purchasing power, it would still result in an increase in poverty rates and inequality.  Indexation in line with earnings growth would avoid these increases but generally comes at a higher cost for the Exchequer.  Both indexation options reduce budgetary flexibility.  The decision to index the tax-welfare system is, therefore, ultimately a political one but could be assisted by using a microsimulation model, such as the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH model.  That has been used in the past in advance to estimate the cost of indexation options each year and to assess their financial feasibility.</p></speech>

I appreciate the presentation and the written documentation from Dr. Keane.  I have a couple of questions.  There has been more discussion of indexation over the last period than there was in the preceding decade, for different reasons.  Let us say we were to index social welfare rates in the context of budget 2022.  If we were to index, for example, the core working age payment in line with the cost of price inflation what increase would we have been likely to see?  We saw a &euro;5 increase in the core working-age payment in budget 2022.  Alongside that, what in the researchers' view is the best way to index social welfare rates with the aim of protecting people from poverty?  Should it be price indexation as opposed to wage indexation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#B00400"><p>I will take the first question on budget 2022.  We looked at this for budget 2022.  We compared the actual changes announced to the tax benefits system to what would have happened if the system had been indexed in line with forecast price growth for 2022.  This is a little bit different from the way indexation typically operates because it is generally backward-looking, so we are looking at adjustments based on inflation over the last year.  We compared it to what would happen if you indexed in line with forecast price growth for next year.  At the time forecast price growth was 2.2%, if I remember right.  That has grown since then.  This is the issue with using a forecast rather than using a historic series for this.  We estimated that welfare payments at least were expected to keep pace with forecast inflation of 2.1%.  There were a few exceptions.  The thresholds for the working families payment were increased by slightly less than forecast inflation.  Child benefit was frozen in nominal terms.  Those two benefits were not keeping pace with inflation but, by and large, the others were or almost were.  The cost differential there would not have been too much if we were looking at a forecast inflation measure for indexing the welfare system at least.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#B00500"><p>Maybe Dr. Keane will come in on the second point but to pick up on what Dr. Doorley said, it refers to a projection but obviously we now know those figures are grossly wrong.  It went from 2.1% to 5.5%.  Dr. Doorley said the &euro;5 increase was in line, or thereabouts, with inflation.  Therefore, it would need to be increased by say &euro;5, &euro;6 or &euro;7 to meet the real cost of inflation now.  That is the average cost of inflation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#B00600"><p>That is right.  If the objective is to keep pace with forecast inflation, then the increases would have had to have been larger than they were.  That is true.  That is typically why most countries that operate a system of indexation use a historic index.  They will look at average inflation over the past year and use that to index next year's parameters.  Of course, there are issues with that.  In the UK we are seeing that average inflation over the last year was up much less than forecast inflation for next year is and there are calls to adjust the way indexation is carried out next year because of this.  Thus, depending on the business cycle, using a historic index can be problematic because you are tied to using potentially a lower index than what forecast inflation might be.  Of course, there is always the option of discretionary policy to target those imbalances.</p></speech>

Looking at where we are with inflation, there is another point I want to talk about on the average rate of inflation and the impact that has on lower-income deciles and households.  If we were to keep pace with what the Central Statistics Office, CSO, is reflecting about price increases there would have to be an extra &euro;5, &euro;6 or &euro;7 added to the core social welfare payments above what was agreed in budget 2022.  The inflation we are experiencing this year is more than the inflation we have experienced in the last 12 years combined.  Given we are in a situation that may be temporary, though it may last a year or two, is the best way to address that through discretionary measures whereby you would have a temporary top-up?  This is as opposed to baking it into the permanent social welfare increases in a budgetary cycle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#B00800"><p>There are a number of ways to address that.  I am not sure which might be considered the best.  It might depend on how timely the CPI information you are receiving is.  In the UK there are currently calls to wait until April when the increase is due to come in, see what the most recent information is then and use that figure rather than using the average over the last year.  Thus, depending on when your information on whatever index is chosen comes in, that is always an option.  You can always adjust closer to the time the increase is coming in and make use of the most recent information.  In situations like the present one, where we expect much of the inflation that is occurring to be transitory as it is due to energy price increases, there might be other ways to address that specifically rather than indexing the whole tax-benefits system.  You could use, say, the historic index for indexing the whole tax-benefits system and if we know there is a significant portion of transitory inflation at the moment that is driven by energy prices, then there might be other instruments to use in the tax-benefits systems for that purpose, such as fuel allowance or other targeted measures for low-income families who are less able to switch how they are heating their homes, fuelling their cars or whatever it is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#B00900"><p>I hear Dr. Doorley's point on the discretionary options and there is legislation now being published to assist households with energy costs to a value of &euro;100 before VAT.  If you wanted to keep pace with inflation, and looking again at social welfare recipients, there would need to be an extra, say, &euro;6 on average increase in social welfare rates.  In the absence of that, those families are going to be &euro;300 poorer this year than last.  Even if we offset that with the energy measure that is being brought in it still leaves them &euro;200 poorer than they were last year.  How important is it for those type of measures to be targeted in terms of inflation?  That takes me to another question on taxation.</p><p>If we index the taxation measures every year, either by price or by wage inflation, we are keeping the system as it is.  Therefore, one is deciding to have the tax take as a percent of GDP, compared with our European neighbours.  One is deciding to have a low tax economy and, therefore, starving public services of resources.  Is indexation always the best thing to do?  While indexation can lift people who need a lift, it also benefits seriously wealthy individuals because they get the benefit from the same indexation, particularly when we look at the tax package of &euro;500 million in last year's budget.  I think more than &euro;340,000 of it was aimed at the higher rate of tax and dealing with that band.  Yet, 80% of earners are excluded from that benefit.  Therefore, should indexation be broad-based, or should it be targeted?  What is the experience in other areas?  I apologise because I know that there was a lot there, so I will stop now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#C00200"><p>I will try to work backwards.  I do not think that we would say that indexation is definitely the best policy.  This ultimately comes down to the political trade-offs and what is the best thing to do with the available budget.  Indexation gives a measure of certainty and security to families who know that if their incomes are to increase, they will not suddenly lose access to their national childcare scheme, NCS, subsidy, to their medical card or something like that.  It also avoids a bracket creep and it ensures that income inequality and poverty will stay relatively constant as the default.<br/><br/>However, there is always a role for a discretionary policy to override some of those things.  We would not necessarily say that it should be the case that the default should be indexation.  Dr. Keane and I always argue that we should compare whatever policy changes that are made to an index system, so that we can see how income distribution is deviating from the<i>status quo</i>.  Even if it becomes the policy, there is still always a role for discretionary policy, if the Government objective is to increase tax on high earners.  There can always be a discretionary policy that can operate alongside indexation. <br/><br/>I should say as well that in many countries that operate indexation, whether this is price indexation or wage indexation, there is often an option for a government to pause it, or for it to say it does not have the budget this year.  Therefore, it can be the default policy for as long as the budget is available.  What we tend to see is that even over time the policy within a country can change from year to year.  I am not sure if I have answered everything.</p></speech>

I have been engaged with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on how it calculates inflation.  Obviously, the average figure is accurate and all the rest, but it does not really reflect the fact that we all, as individuals, are placed on the income scale and have different baskets and, therefore, have different rates of inflation.</p> <p>  As Dr. Doorley knows, the Office for National Statistics, ONS, in Britain has changed as a result of the campaigning that has been done by the activist and author who forced it to change the way that it will calculate inflation.  Has Dr. Doorley or the ESRI any view on the fact that the average rate of inflation, which is used for indexation, for social welfare rates and for so many policy discussions, does not reflect the real impact on lower-income households?  I thought what the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Gabriel Makhlouf, did was interesting.  It was a really a desktop exercise that broke it down into the poorest 20% of households in the State and the richest 20%, if you want to call them that or the highest earners with highest incomes in the State.  The difference in the inflation rate between those two categories of individuals is 0.8%.  Obviously, the lower one&rsquo;s income, the higher the inflation rate.  In the ESRI's view, would that breakdown of inflation based on decile - it also has an impact in terms of rural-urban - be a helpful addition to policy development?</p></speech>

We are seeing that inflation for lower-income groups is higher than it is for higher-income groups but that does not tend to be the case over the longer term.  If we look back, it tends to balance out.  For example, there may be some things that higher income groups consume that grow at a higher rate.  Certainly, however, there is nothing obliging one to use the average consumer price index, CPI.</p> <p>  If the CSO is planning, as it has stated it is intending to do and as the ONS has done in the UK, to produce CPI by, for example, income deciles or quintiles, there would be nothing to stop one from saying that in a year where the inflation rate for the poorest fifth of the population is significantly higher than the average, that could be used as the indexation rate.  There is nothing forcing one to use the average.  In general, what we would see is that the average and the inflation rates by income groups tend to be quite close.  However, in a year where there is a big divergence, there would be nothing to stop one from, say, rather than using the average number, indexing the welfare system by price inflation and using the price inflation that is occurring for the poorest fifth of the population.</p></speech>

I agree with Dr. Keane's analysis.  They are very close for all deciles when there is low inflation, as we have experienced for well over a decade.  However, when there are spikes, there is that divergence.  I thank Dr. Keane for that.</p></speech>

Again, there would be nothing to stop one from using a forecast in a particular year.  If, say, in a worst-case scenario, one overshoots - for example, if forecast inflation is 6% and one gives the 6% rise - but it turns out that inflation only grows by 4%, then one could reduce the rise the following year, so that the system does not get out of kilter.</p> <p>  Again, the whole issue of benchmarks is important.  We are not saying that the social welfare and tax system is perfect as it is.  However, given the estimate we did in 2020 that indexation would cost between 10% to 29% of the fiscal space, that still leaves a lot of fiscal space available to target measures at discretionary policy.</p></speech>

I was listening attentively to the previous discussion.  I would be interested in getting an understanding of the ESRI's view on whether this would be right across all social welfare payments that would be indexed.  Would this move on into other benefits, such as social housing qualifying criteria and so on?  Where would the ESRI see a line to be drawn?  For example, if somebody qualifies for social housing, would the HAP payment, in turn, need to be indexed?  I am trying to get an idea of where the ESRI would see a line there.  I do not know if that is possible.  Is this all-or-nothing, or is there a partial system whereby one could index some things and not others?  Where does taxation fit into this?  Would the ESRI also consider indexing taxation bands and thresholds?</p> <p>  Earlier, Dr. Keane mentioned a figure of 10% to 29% of available funding for the last year's budget.  What was that figure based on?  Was it based on only social welfare increases, or was it based on all those other different benefits?  Was taxation included in that as well? </p></speech>

Therefore, it was increasing tax bands, as well as welfare rates.  If we look at what other countries do, there are not many countries that index up everything, for example, indexing both tax and welfare bands, tax credits, along with welfare rates.  My opinion would be that ideally one would index everything, otherwise the system would start to get out of kilter.  Therefore, if there are increases in social welfare rates but not increases in tax bands and tax credits, then one starts to possibly create disincentives to work.  This is because a person would effectively not take home as much, if the tax system does not keep pace.</p><p>Ideally, we would think about the system as a whole.  A couple of years ago, it was pointed out that social welfare increases might result in some people losing their medical cards, for example.  The then Minister for Health weighed in on this at the time.  If the income limits for the medical card do not grow at the same rate as welfare increases, people could lose medical cards.  The same applies to childcare subsidies.  We have really seen this with student grants.  Research has shown the student grant rates and income limits for student grants have really not kept pace with inflation.  What has happened is that fewer and fewer third level students have been qualifying for grants as a result of their parents just getting average wage increases.  Back in the 1970s, the student grant was roughly equal to the unemployment payment.  It could be seen as a minimum amount needed to live, but it has fallen massively behind because it has not kept pace with inflation.  Ideally, we would index-----</p></speech>

When the grants, social welfare rates or other benefits are brought to an adequate level - there is an arbitrary decision to be made in this regard - indexation is beneficial.  In many countries, the student grant rate is equal to that of unemployment benefits.  In this regard, we need to examine our system and determine where we believe there should be increases.  From then on, further increases could be made in line with inflation.</p> <p>  The downside of indexing the entire system is that it is costly.  Dr. Doorley and I work on developing and maintaining the simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH model.  The SWITCH model is used in Departments as well as by the ESRI.  It would give the advantage of being able to cost changes in advance, giving figures for what would occur if we just indexed social welfare, changed tax bands and credits or changed the system as a whole.  That is where the political decisions come in.  If it was going to cost too much, one could just decide to index certain aspects.</p> <p>  Internationally, that is done quite frequently.  In some countries, only pensions are increased in line with inflation.  In others, all welfare rates are increased while in yet others, there are increases to welfare bands or tax bands.</p></speech>

Pensions, more often than other welfare benefits, get indexed in line with wage growth, and other benefits may be increased in line with prices.  That is a decision that has to be made by policymakers.  In Ireland, State pension rates are already higher than payments such as the unemployment payment.  If we continue to index one by a higher amount, it will continue to grow out of kilter with the others.  The argument has sometimes been that people on pensions find it harder because they cannot just go back to work or try to earn more money if inflation is high.  That was the argument.  It has mainly been a financial argument in that if all welfare rates are increased by the same amount, it will cost more than if certain benefits only are increased.  In this regard, a decision has to be made.  I believe the indexing of all welfare rates should happen, but it may be that a political decision will need to be made that only certain benefits may be increased in a particular year if it is going to cost too much to increase all of them.</p></speech>

Where there are unexpected circumstances or shocks to the system, Dr. Keane referred to making an adjustment the following year.  A year is a long time away for those stuck on a fixed income when inflation is at a rate of 5% or 6%.</p></speech>

It is a question of whether the forecast, if it is not correct, must be fixed each year.  From a purely practical point of view, most countries use a slightly historical index.  We are talking about a few months.</p></speech>

That would probably happen more when there is a large increase in inflation.  In this case, one might want to use a more recent figure than the yearly average.  It is precisely as the Deputy said in that it is easy to say an average can be used, but if people are facing much higher costs in the shorter term, it is an issue.  In this case, we could use the example I gave earlier, whereby a forecast is looked at.  If the forecast were very different from the yearly average, it could be used for the time being.  One could then look ahead to the next year&rsquo;s budget and ask how close the forecast was and whether the increase was too much or not enough.  A correction could be made so that even if the forecasts were constantly ahead of the reality, it would not be necessary to go back constantly to cut social welfare rates; one could, perhaps, just limit the increase the following year.</p> <p>  In general, these things settle down over time.  There will be certain years with spikes.  Unfortunately, this year is one of them.  However, if it is felt there has been an overshoot, the increase can always be tempered down the following year.  If the forecast is 6% and the reality is 4%, one might not increase by as much the following year, but at least people on social welfare would be given an adequate increase in the shorter term to deal with the costs they are facing.</p></speech>

That was work we did a couple of years ago for budget 2020.  The advantage of the SWITCH model I am talking about is that the analysis can be done in advance of the change.  The costing can be done in advance and it can be seen that if the money is not available in a given year, the increase will have to be lower.  That decision can always be made each year if needs be.</p></speech>

This is an interesting discussion.  It makes me think of what else could have an effect.  Let me hone in.  On budget 2020, the ESRI produced figures of &euro;462 million for price indexation and &euro;1.3 billion for wage indexation.  The delegates mentioned higher education grants by SUSI.  In its analysis, would the ESRI have included increasing thresholds for everybody, including workers and people on social welfare?  While all the indexing is great, my concern is that, in real terms, if we were to use cost rather than wages, we would get to a stage very quickly where it would be less obvious that work would pay.  Is there a risk in that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#D01300"><p>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, the lower number, the 10%, was for price indexation, and the 29% was for wage inflation.  We indexed all the parameters of the tax benefits system that are currently in the model.  There are some smaller benefits that we cannot model but, by and large, the tax benefits system is modelled.  We included all of it.  We also included indirect taxes.  We should keep in mind that when we talk about indexing the tax and benefits system, we should also be thinking about the indirect tax system because excise rates that are set as a proportion of the unit of a commodity sold are not increased in line with inflation automatically.  Indexing the indirect tax system in line with inflation actually results in an Exchequer gain, whereas indexing the rest of it, the direct tax and welfare system, results in an Exchequer loss.</p><p>We did the whole tax benefit system.  If we were to index the welfare system in line with price growth, we would see welfare recipients receiving relatively less in real terms than workers.  That should actually increase the incentive to work but it is also going to have an impact on poverty and inequality.  That is because wage growth tends to be higher than price growth due to economic growth.  From year to year there can be differences but in the long term, wage growth tends to be higher than price growth.  If we were indexing the welfare system in line with price growth, we would see an increase in income and equality because those who are receiving welfare are seeing lower real income gains compared to those who are in work.</p></speech>

Dr. Doorley said one can take any year and model it based on the system or the interpretation that can be done with it.  Let us say there is a projection of 6% inflation in 2023 and we index link everything and give an increase.  If there is no increase predicted the following year, can we see a point where incomes will fall again?  How does that work, for instance, if we have a deflationary situation?</p></speech>

We saw that over the great recession in that in some years, indexation might actually suggest a cut to the actual amount of social welfare or a cut to tax spends and credits.  What the Government can do in that case, if a decision is made that it is not going to cut social welfare rates because there is negative inflation, which tends to be quite rare, is freeze it.  Rather than cutting it the Government could say it is going to protect welfare rates or protect our tax bands and credits, if it can afford to do so, and maybe reduce the increase that comes the following year so that it averages out over time. Say in the first year the Government thinks inflation is minus 1% and decides it is not going to index or cut by 1% and the following year inflation is 3%, it would only give it a 2% rise.  It would sort of freeze things in years where there is actual deflation and then give slightly lower inflation increases the next year so that over a couple of years it averages out overall.  That would prevent the Government actually having to cut social welfare rates.</p></speech>

We also have a situation where we have an inability to pay clause by the Government if we have a serious recession.</p> <p>  I am coming at this other issue with my Joint Committee on Disability Matters hat on.  The Indecon report that was produced a short time ago stated that the additional cost of living for somebody with a disability is &euro;9,000.  If we set up a system where we have indexation, we would need to calibrate where there are deficiencies at the moment to bring them up to a level.  Is that something the ESRI could see being done?  I know it is a political decision at the end of the day but is it something that would merit serious consideration in order to take the anomalies that exist for people with disabilities out of the system ?  How would the ESRI approach it from an economic point of view?  How would it advise the Minister?</p></speech>

If indexation was being considered, the first step is the benchmarking process and asking at what point do we want to benchmark all these different tax and welfare payments.  If the Government was particularly concerned about the level of disability payments, it might be an idea to look at how the consumption of households containing people with a disability is different from the consumption of other households.  That would give an idea of what kind of extra weight should be given to their payment compared to another household.  There is a bit of ongoing work on this.  It is something we might be working on a bit later this year as well.  Obviously, that will all be made public if we publish a report on it.  The place to start is by asking what the correct benchmark is.  I am guessing that there is going to be in international literature the level at which disability payments should be set relative to, let us say, core welfare rates.  Given that starting point then the indexation process could start.</p></speech>

We have to level the playing field first in terms of the anomalies and particular situations that exist and after that there should be indexation, whether it is done by price or wages.  The other thing we must protect against is the danger that work does not pay and becomes marginal.  It is important that we encourage as many people as possible and that it pays for them to work.  I will leave it at that.  I thank the witnesses for their very insightful discussion and presentation.  What I like most about it is the plain language because it can be very complex.  It is great in order that we understand it better.  I thank them both.</p></speech>

Our next speaker is Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, whom we have lost.  She was online a second ago.  We will give her a moment to come back.  In the meantime, I might ask some questions if that is okay with our witnesses.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions but I will stay on Deputy Canney's point around disability.  The ESRI very kindly sent us that report from 2019, which was really helpful.  One of the sections was around variations across benefits.  It seems to me that a huge amount of work was done on the variations when it comes to pensions.  I presume that was because there is a legacy of contributory pensions and private pensions and it is a complex area in which there is already a body of research but not when it comes to more complex payments.  I would proffer that disability payments, for example, are more complex because often, in the same way as with unemployment, people sometimes move in and out of that particular stage of life and might have more costs and need more supports.  There does not seem to be the same amount of economic research on that particular topic.  Dr. Doorley mentioned that research is being done.  Is it fair to say that there is not the same kind of engagement on what indexation might mean for the disability sector?  Based on what Dr. Doorley has seen from the Indecon report, which she has talked about with others, would it be fair to say that it seems we are quite far back on disability and there would need to be a kind of catch-up transition phase before we actually engage with pure indexation in that regard?</p></speech>

I suppose the Chairman is right.  There is not the same body of research about the adequacy of disability payments compared to something like pension payments.  That is because much of the research that looks at the level at which welfare is set does so in an attempt to establish what incentives to work are.  It is very difficult to talk about incentives to work when we are studying a population with a disability because, obviously, many of them are self-declaring as unfit to work.  It makes absolutely no sense, therefore, to be looking at incentives to work and what level of payment is the correct one to have this trade-off between a safety net but also keep incentives to work for those who can do so.  I guess that is why there is probably a little bit less research in this area.  It is also quite complex to study because the typical types of survey data we use do not have much information on disability.</p><p>From our perspective, with the SWITCH model and the data we use, we know if somebody is receiving a disability payment but we do not know anything else, so it is quite hard to establish their level of need in terms of payment without going to another data source, such as the household budget survey.  With that we may be able to determine where their expenditure might exceed that of other households that do not contain a person with a disability and abstract from that what might be the correct level of payment.  I do not have much more to say on that topic now.</p></speech>

This is something I asked in last week's session and I believe the answer I received was very much based on economic data.  I am very mindful that in Ireland we sometimes do not necessarily have access to the type of data we need to make these kinds of big public and civic decisions.  I suspect part of that impression I have formed comes from my sitting on the health committee.  It seems we do not really have access to adequate amounts of disaggregated data around health and sometimes ethnicity.  I know representatives of the Traveller community often speak about the lack of aggregated data around what they experience.  Would it be fair to say from Dr. Doorley's description that the economic "number data" might be there but the more complex information around the social aspects, or that kind of data, may not be as available?</p></speech>

In Ireland we are not so great at using administrative data and, as researchers, we often must rely on surveys that may not, for example, contain a very large number of people with a disability.  That sort of restricts the analysis we can do.  In Scandinavian countries, for example, there is much more usage of administrative data.  It is important Departments do not operate in silos.  In the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, we have shown how we really have been able to use administrative data and information quite quickly and pull it together.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is doing a good job of bringing administrative data into surveys as well.</p> <p>  On the specific question of disability, we also need to think about the wider questions.  For example, we know employment rates of people with disabilities in Ireland are much lower than other OECD countries.  The OECD in a recent report pointed to issues such as a lack of engagement with employers and helping people with disabilities into employment.  That is one point.</p> <p>  Another matter that can often create a disincentive for people with disabilities to work is their potential need for flexibility.  They may not have the physical capacity to work full-time and we hope remote working will help there.  There is also the question of retaining secondary benefits, for example, such as medical cards.  Somebody with a disability may really value having a medical card because it covers so much of the cost of the disability.  It might be important not only to have medical cards that are means-tested but to also recognise people's health status.  For example, people with certain conditions might be able to retain cards so the issue does not act as a disincentive to work.  Looking at the medical card scheme would be important as well as looking at the sort of headline disability payment amounts.</p></speech>

In fairness, I have heard it mentioned at the disability matters committee that there are such hidden barriers to participation.  I will return to the data while I have somebody who cares about this.  Dr. Keane is a rarity in that respect.  Are we not taking in that information or asking the right questions?  What are the barriers?  Are we not gathering the information appropriately, centralising it or making it available.  I know the witnesses may not be at the front face of gathering this information.  What is their impression of the issue?</p></speech>

The Department of Health might hold information on how often people go into hospital or how often they use a medical card, for example.  I know there are major data protection issues but in other countries there is often something like the CSO, a central statistical agency tasked with bringing information together.  The CSO already does this quite a lot for survey data, including the survey of income living conditions, SILC, that Dr. Doorley and I would use a lot.  That brings in administrative information on incomes and such matters but it could certainly be improved.</p> <p>  There is a financial side to this and if the CSO did the work, it would have to be provided with the resources to do it.  As researchers, we often contact Departments and we may or may not get information, so that might bring clarity in that respect.  There can also be a cost saving aspect.  If we get a system up and running where data are recorded and centralised, we may not have to rely so much on surveys, which can be costly to carry out.  If we centralise the process and have joined-up thinking between Departments, it can help.  Somebody must take on the role of drawing all of this together.  The CSO may not thank me for suggesting it but it is a natural candidate to bring together all this information.</p> <p>  As a researcher, of course I will say that all this must be made available to researchers so we can access the data.  I know that I have tried to get data from a Department but it could not be provided to me because of data protection rules, etc.  It would be very good to ensure researchers have access to this as well.</p></speech>

The public should know that what we are talking about for decision-making is largely anonymised data that is disaggregated and not in any way traceable to the person.  It is more about understanding what life is really like in Ireland and being able to use those numbers to make decisions.</p> <p>  I am nearly out of time but I have another question relating to the 2019 paper.  I always find it incredibly useful when people give examples from other countries.  I am interested in the variation across countries, although I know some of this data are older.  It is interesting that Denmark has a completely unified system, so does the ESRI have a position on what country is doing this well that the committee could consider?  As we go down the list, which includes Finland, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand, it seems many of those countries were considering aspects such as price indexing.  In fairness, not just today but last week when we had representatives of Social Justice Ireland and the Nevin Economic Research Institute in, we hear that wages are a much better benchmark.  Are we seeing difficulties for those countries or has the economic research community come to a position that the wage benchmark is better?  How did those countries get to that position as a group?  Is that from a different era and we have moved on?</p></speech>

That is it in a nutshell.  That is if the aim is to at least try to keep poverty and inequality constant; again, we are not saying that should be the aim and there can be targeted measures to try to decrease levels of inequality.  If these measures are being implemented and we are trying to keep things constant, wage indexation is necessary.  Otherwise there is a gap between people who rely on welfare and those who have wages.  There would be disparities between those in time.</p> <p>  In some countries there has been much change over time.  It used to be that there was price indexation but in particular over the great recession many countries moved from wage indexation to price indexation, purely because of the cost of wage indexation, which is higher.</p></speech>

My laptop decided to die and restart but here I am.  All the questions I wanted to ask have been raised.  We are seeing a rise in the cost of living with increasing inflation and that is affecting lower-income households in particular.  In our alternative budget we suggested a &euro;10 increase in working age payments, and that must be done urgently.  Sometimes there is a policy that tries to help lower middle-income earners.</p><p>It actually ends up also helping those higher earners.  Specifically, we can see that when we are trying to target the middle income group.  Have the witnesses any policy suggestions on how we could tackle that whole issue of the middle income group?  That is not to take away from the lower income group; I do not mean it that way, but sometimes we can be more targeted in that sense.  The issue with the middle income group is how to target that group and assist them without actually in turn also assisting those on higher incomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#G00200"><p>I think budget 2022 was a really good example of a budget that assisted low-income families and high-income families, but not so much the middle-income families.  That was really down to the fact that there was some indexation of the tax benefit system.  Many benefits were increased by close to inflation or perhaps a little bit more than inflation.  A few were not.  The income tax system was indexed by more than forecast inflation, so that gave a kind of a boost to higher-income families.  In the middle, there was only a small change to PRSI rates.  That effectively became a tax increase for middle-income families who were not benefiting from the change to income tax.  There was also a lower than forecast inflation increase in the working families payment and a freeze to child benefit.  The cumulation of those things around the middle of the income distribution, together with changes to indirect taxation, meant that the middle of the income distribution did not see the same benefit from budget 2022 as the lower income households, who benefited from targeted changes to welfare payments, and the higher income families, who benefited from tax cuts.</p> <p>  I suppose what was missing from budget 2022, if the objective was a unified enough indexation, was changes to PRSI rates, USC rates, increasing them in line with inflation as well as just income tax.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#G00400"><p>I did not have visual contact earlier but I was able to listen to the meeting.  One of the findings that has been consistent since we started discussing this topic is that the introduction of a State pension rate that is a percentage of a certain average &ndash; one of the witnesses mentioned 34% of earnings - has been regularly discussed since the 1990s and in the initial presentation from the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Obviously, the area of pensions is big news.  Indeed, it led on RT&Eacute;'s "Six One" news today because of the publication of report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  For some people, without the addition of something like the fuel allowance on top of the State pension, they are simply not keeping pace in real monetary terms with what is needed for them to live reasonably &ndash; I will not say comfortably &ndash; and not in jeopardy.  We were told that a State pension should be pitched at around 30% to 35% of the average industrial wage.  I ask for the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.295" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Claire Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#G00500"><p>It might sound like a bit of a cop out, but there is no correct level to have a benefit at.  The Commission on Pensions and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare were established to look at those kinds of issues.  In this case, the advice is to set the State pension at around one third of average wages.  It used to be the average industrial wage.  I think now they are moving towards having it as a percentage of average wages across all occupations.  I suppose it is about looking at it to see if it is adequate.  Some indicators that answer those questions for us are, for example, elderly poverty rates.  We know that elderly poverty rates in Ireland have fallen substantially because of the active discretionary policy of increasing State pensions over time.  On what the Deputy has said about deciding on a benchmark, I cannot say that it is the right or wrong amount because that is ultimately a decision.  The decision has to be made by weighing up how much it costs, whether it is sustainable, etc.  If we go with the advice that the State pension should be roughly one third of average earnings, indexation will allow us to sort of forget about whether it is keeping pace with prices or wages each year.  If we automatically index the pension, then it will continue to stay that rate.  However, it would suggest that if we decide to benchmark pensions at around one third of average earnings, then we would have to increase them in line with wage inflation to keep that benchmark.  If we just increase them in line with prices, it would more than likely fall behind and in a few years' time we would have to play catch up again.</p> <p>  Looking at elderly poverty rates, yes, we do have people below the poverty line who are over 65.  However, the poverty rates for the over-65 age group are substantially lower than those of other age groups.  It is also important to look at other groups in society.  For example, we know that there are very high poverty rates and very high deprivation rates among lone parents - much higher than among older age groups.  It is important to monitor those measures, such as poverty and deprivation rates, among different groups in society or age groups.  That allows us to determine whether an amount is adequate.  Many people in Ireland who are over 65 and are below the poverty line are not getting that maximum State pension amount.  These are people who are qualifying for a lower than maximum State pension amount.  That might be something that has to be looked at.  It tends to be people who have been in and out of work, might not have enough social insurance contributions or have been abroad and do not have the full insurance contributions to come back to Ireland.  In general, if we decide on what an adequate benchmark is, then that is where the indexation helps, as we do not have to constantly monitor it each year to see if rates are falling behind for certain groups.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#G00600"><p>That is interesting.  It is a notion that I have thought about over the years.  Thankfully, for the over-65 age cohort, they are vocal and good at advocating.  However, it is interesting to note &ndash; not that we want any kind of poverty level in any cohort &ndash; that the weight of poverty among the over-65s is significantly less than for other groups under that age group.  Now, that is worrying in itself.  It leads me to the question about indexation being a universal thing.  I do not regard myself as being particularly well-off.  I earn a very good salary but I also have a very significant mortgage like many others.  The energy bill piece, whereby the Government is giving a &euro;100 rebate to all electricity account holders, is like the index-linked pension increase.  Everybody gets that, regardless of their need for it.  I could think of many ways in which that &euro;100 could have been distributed a little more fairly, particularly to those who might suffer from energy poverty and may have needed more than that.  There are also others who do not particularly need it but welcome the reduction of &euro;100 of their energy bills, but would not notice if they did not get it.  With indexation, someone who would be on a very good defined contribution pension, defined benefit pension or reasonably comfortable, would also get the benefit of the indexation if it was to be brought in.  I ask the witnesses for their views on attempting to distribute that a little bit more equitably in targeting it.  With targeting, obviously, people have worked and will assert that they have earned it, they have paid their stamps, and they are entitled to that.  It seems to me that the universality piece comes back to the old argument about child benefit.  As we know, there are families who open an account for their baby almost on the day they come back from hospital, and in goes the child benefit for weeks, months and years.  When the child reaches the age of 18 there is a great, big sizeable pot there because they are comfortable, and fair play to them.  There are other families for whom existence would simply be impossible without that benefit.  I ask the witnesses for their views on that.  It is not directly connected to the issue at hand, but I am sure the witnesses can see where I am coming from.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.297" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#H00100"><p>There will always be trade-off between a measure being administratively simple and well-targeted and even being perceived as fair.  Child benefit is a good example.  It does not seem fair to exclude some children from this benefit even if their parents have very high means but the universality of child benefit means many people get it who simply do not need it.  The same is true for this electricity bill credit.  Interestingly, this was one of the recommendations of the European Commission for policymakers who wanted to give some temporary help to households for what they considered a transitionary increase in fuel prices.  One of the suggested measures was an energy credit.  Others included temporary increases to targeted payments such as the fuel allowance.  That is something that was done here during the pandemic, namely, the fuel allowance season was extended by four weeks because elderly people were being asked to cocoon.  This time around the policymakers have gone with this energy credit.  It is administratively simple.  It would probably have been very difficult to identify who needed it.  It is hard to come up with rules like that without linking it to existing benefits or systems.  That is the reason that was the option chosen.<br/><br/>To return to the universality of indexation, it depends on what the Government objective is.  For example, do we want to target any changes in the current income distribution using policy?  If the answer to that question is &quot;No&quot;, then indexing the system in line with wage growth every year will simply keep it the same.  If that is the policy target, then that is the correct policy to follow.  If the answer to that question is &quot;Yes&quot;, that we want to influence the income distribution and we think people on very high incomes should pay more tax or as their earnings increase an extra portion of those should go to the Exchequer, there is a case for a discretionary policy of excluding certain payments from indexation.  Ultimately, that must be a decision based on trade-offs between what policymakers think the income distribution should look like and what the fiscal cost of those policies is.  When we talk about indexation if we want to keep the <i>status quo</i>, indexing everything by wage growth annually is the way to do it.  Then if we decide we do not want to keep the <i>status quo</i>, we do not index and we have <i>ad hoc</i>budgetary changes every year, which during the past 30 years in Ireland have kept pace with earnings growth.  Even though we have not had a formal indexation system, on average, our tax benefit system has kept pace with earnings growth, albeit that policy was not in place.  Even though we were not doing it automatically, that was the underlying intention or implicit rule behind changes to the tax benefit system over the years.</p></speech>

If we decide to index, it perhaps takes some fun out of budget day for everybody or whatever way one would want to think about that.  If we have automatic indexation to which we commit, the Government's hands might be a little tied each year if, for example, the economy is not performing so well.  That has probably been one of the keys to resistance.  Also, we do not have a historical pattern of doing this.  It is something that has come up recently.  Even if we were to commit to doing it, there is nothing to stop us decide to change that.  For example in the UK, indexation is used but this year it will not do it, the main reason being given is that wage indexation would be unreliable because of the Covid pandemic.  Very odd figures for wage growth have come out during that time because many people were taken out of the labour market.  There is nothing stopping us from bringing in indexation and then deciding in a particular year we cannot afford it or can only afford price indexation and not wage indexation.  The Government always has discretionary power to decide in that respect.</p></speech>

I may not have articulated that well.  If we were to index State pensions to the average industrial wage, or whatever else is connected to that, in the economy, is there an argument for indexing taxes for the ordinary individual pre-retirement to wage increases, etc?

In Europe, it is mainly indexation of welfare parameters that happens but in the US and Canada they also index the tax system using the same index.</p></speech>

I apologise for having had to step out earlier.  If I ask a question that has already been asked, I will check the proceedings and get the answer to it.  I would like to know what base measures should be used to calculate indexation and whether the triple-lock measure is the best there is or whether there is a better way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karina Doorley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020200002#H01700"><p>I will take that question and Dr. Keane might add a further comment.  With base measures, we would be talking about what index we should use, whether it should be price or  wage indexation, or a mix of those.  Really that depends on the expected outcome.  If the objective is to maintain income inequality and poverty rates, therefore, if we do not want to increase poverty rates or income inequality, indexation by wage growth is the correct measure.</p><p>It will keep the income distribution constant in relative terms.  If we want to ensure people's purchasing power does not decrease, then price indexation is the correct method of indexation.  Given that wage growth tends to exceed price growth most years, though, indexing by price means that income inequality will increase because people who are in work will be relatively better off than people who are out of work.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question about the base.  She might remind me of her second question.</p></speech>

However, I am going to move on and say that there have been calls for an independent body similar to the Low Pay Commission to oversee indexation.  Would the ESRI support such a body and what approach should it take?</p></speech>

If an arbitrary decision is made each year, a little of that certainty disappears but there would be an advantage for the Exchequer in knowing that things were affordable.  If there is price or wage growth in a particular year but the economy is in trouble, an independent body like that could decide not to give an increase because the economy could not afford it or would have to borrow.  Alternatively, increases could be weighed out.  For example, let us say there is deflation and prices fall.  The body might decide that it does not want to cut social welfare rates.  It could keep them constant and decide on a smaller increase the following year.  Having a body to consider such matters would be an advantage.</p> <p>  I am not trying to plug what Dr. Doorley and I do, but we work a great deal with micro-simulation models.  They allow us to take a representative sample of the population and determine how much indexing would cost if we believed inflation was going to be X percent next year.  This sort of research could feed into such a body, give it options and show it that, if it were to increase rates in line with prices, it would cost this much and if they were to increase with wage growth, it would cost this much.  That work can be done a year in advance.  We carry out a great deal of analysis before a budget happens.</p> <p>  The advantage of a commission or body like the one the Deputy referenced would be budget sustainability, in that we would not be giving increases in years where we might not be able to afford them.</p></speech>

I assume that it is some kind of software.  It was outlined in the 2019 paper.  Will the witnesses explain it a little?  I see that the database was set out in terms of households from 2015 but that there was a significant update in 2019.  Are we still largely just updating the 2015 data or is there a regular update based on new CSO figures?  I presume that the CSO survey on income and living conditions is not the kind of survey conducted during the general census.  I am unsure as to where we stand with the census at the moment, but if it has been delayed, will that pose a difficulty for the ESRI?</p></speech>

SWITCH has been in existence for approximately 30 years.  Recently, we overhauled it completely.  Basically, it is a giant tax benefit calculator that is linked to survey data from a representative sample of households.  The current version of the model is linked to the 2016 survey on income and living conditions that the CSO provided to us.  The survey included administrative information on welfare receipts by families.  Using the survey's information on demographics, household composition, work history, income and so on, we can simulate families' tax and welfare entitlements.  We can simulate the current income distribution because the SWITCH model programmes in all of the tax and welfare benefits that a particular household should be entitled to in light of everything we know about it from the survey.</p> <p>  We can also simulate counterfactuals.  The model allows us to determine what would happen to income distribution if the tax rate was changed or all of budget 2022's changes were implemented.  We use it a great deal in "What if" scenarios - what if this changed, what if that changed and how would it affect income distribution, poverty rates, income inequality, etc.</p> <p>  We update the model almost continuously but the data update usually happens every year.  We introduced the 2019 data last year.  It is unlikely that we will introduce 2020's data because they will be so skewed by the pandemic, but we have conducted a statistical procedure on the 2019 data to make them representative of the current population.  It is called nowcasting, whereby we take into account employment and income levels in the current population and apply them to the rich survey information that we have.  All of that is linked to the SWITCH model, which contains all the tax and welfare rules.  The SWITCH model is based on a European platform called EUROMOD, which is used all over Europe in academia and policy circles for research and budget preparations.</p></speech>

The Departments of Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and Health all have access to it.  They all have active users within them and they regularly undertake pre-budget analysis using the model.  Importantly, they have access to the model on the CSO server, so they are using the model without any input from us unless they need technical help or advice on how to model this or that.  They access their results themselves, which guarantees budget secrecy.  They can run their own analyses and communicate those to policymakers securely.</p></speech>

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness&rsquo;s statements are potentially defamatory - I am sure they are not - in relation to any identifiable person, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I again remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within in the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members not adhering to this constitutional requirement to participate.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of the Leinster House campus will be asked to discontinue their remarks.  </p> <p>  I call on Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in, who, I understand, is going first, to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

I welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in this topic, and I am pleased to engage with members on this vital issue.  Having conducted research in all 15 former Soviet republics over a period exceeding two decades, I am open to discussing the Kremlin&rsquo;s relationship with other countries in the region as well.  I will briefly review the role of the EU in its eastern neighbourhood through the prism of Russia and Ukraine, outlining their perspectives, motives, interests and part of its sphere of influence.</p> <p> Official thinking in Moscow suggests that these former colonies cannot be treated as equals, or, indeed, as fully sovereign states with divergent interests.  Among the political elite in Russia, there is a pervasive belief that Ukraine is not a fully independent country but, at best, a historical part of Russia and, at worst, a political Frankenstein, artificially stitched together during Soviet times and now sustained by Russia&rsquo;s adversaries.  From this perspective, if there is no separate Ukrainian people, how can they enjoy a right to self-determination?</p> <p>  When, at the Bucharest NATO summit in 2008, it seemed possible that Ukraine, along with Georgia, might obtain a membership action plan, an animated Vladimir Putin claimed that Ukraine was an artificial state.  It was reported publicly that he had threatened to intervene in Crimea and eastern Ukraine in retaliation.  Six years later, in his 2014 speech announcing the annexation of Crimea, Putin proclaimed: "it pains our hearts to see what is happening in Ukraine at the moment."  He stated that Russians and Ukrainians were &ldquo;one people&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we cannot live without each other.&rdquo;  Coming when it did, as Russian military forces invaded Ukraine, this does not seem like an expression of affection.</p><p>Like an abusive former spouse, the Kremlin maintained that it could not imagine being separated from Ukraine and that any violence meted out was only for the betterment of its errant partner.  By invading Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin flagrantly breached international agreements such as the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, part of which involved Ukraine giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in return for a guarantee from Russia, the US and the UK to protect its security and territorial integrity.<br/><br/>The Kremlin argues that it is responding to provocations from NATO and the EU.  According to this narrative of defence-motivated expansionism, Russia has seen NATO and the EU extend to its doorstep, undermining its traditional sphere of influence.  This, however, is to invert the sequence of events.  When the Cold War ended, there were many, not least within NATO itself, who questioned whether the organisation had a future.  After all, it had been established to confront the Soviet Union.  With the collapse of that adversary, it seemed NATO had lost its <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>.  What injected the organisation with renewed vigour was the queue of former Soviet states and satellites requesting, nay demanding, entry under its protective umbrella.  They feared, and recent events have certainly vindicated those fears, that the Kremlin&rsquo;s weakness was temporary.  Thus they sought to escape the abusive cycle of history while they could.  Far from NATO or the EU aggressively seeking new members, they acquiesced to a concerted drive from ex-communist states to join.  A small state like Estonia, with a population of just 1.3 million, of which at least a quarter are ethnic Russians, can rely on the EU and NATO to fend off the Kremlin&rsquo;s covetous glances.  The substantially larger Ukraine, however, is very much on its own.<br/><br/>The NATO&ndash;Russia Founding Act signed in 1997 committed Russia and NATO to respect &quot;the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all states and their inherent right to choose the means to ensure their own security&rdquo;.  Despite this, the Kremlin has fostered a narrative of betrayal, namely, that the West has reneged on promises and taken advantage of Russia when it was weak.  The natural offshoot of this is that only firm leadership, as provided by Vladimir Putin, can reverse this trend.  The Kremlin is demanding that NATO guarantee in perpetuity that it will never accept new members from eastern Europe.  This would include, in the first instance, Ukraine and Georgia, but would also extend to countries such as EU member states Finland and Sweden.  This would, in effect, allow Moscow to have a veto on who can join NATO.  It is difficult to see how any international organisation or club would allow a third party to exercise such powers at the expense of aspirant states.<br/><br/>The Kremlin is also demanding that there be no NATO deployments in those member states that joined the organisation after 1997.  This would include all those countries from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and would create a two-tier NATO with first- and second-class members.  The Kremlin also opposes Ukraine being afforded with the means to defend itself.  The less Ukraine is able to protect itself, the better able the Kremlin will be to impose its will.<br/><br/>The Kremlin&rsquo;s vocal articulation of its ultimatums, amplified by the menacing military build-up along Russia&rsquo;s border with Ukraine, is designed to undermine the ambitions of its neighbours for greater integration with Euro-Atlantic structures.  It also seeks to demonstrate Russian capabilities against NATO assets in the region and to test the unity and resolve of the EU.  While the focus has been on NATO, Moscow is also opposed to its neighbours joining the European Union.  Indeed, it was the prospect of a closer relationship with the EU that precipitated the crisis in 2013 which culminated with the Kremlin&rsquo;s annexation of Crimea and intervention in Donbas.<br/><br/>Roughly translated, the Kremlin&rsquo;s position is that its insecurities can only be assuaged when it is surrounded by weak dependencies that are not part of any supportive alliance such as the EU or NATO.  However, the Kremlin in no way tries to mitigate the insecurities of the smaller states in the region that have traditionally been the victims of Kremlin-sponsored aggression.  Armed with nuclear weapons, Russia is well-protected against military attack.  What the Kremlin fears is not invasion, but rather losing its influence in what it considers the near abroad.  Political elites in Russia see themselves as rivals to, rather than partners of, the European Union.  Conversely, many in Ukraine see the European Union as a means to escape from the Kremlin's shadow.<br/><br/>During the past century or so, Ukraine&rsquo;s history has been punctuated by civil conflict, world wars, tyranny, gulags and famine.  Yet somehow, miraculously, it has come out at the other end.  Little wonder that the national anthem proclaims defiantly that &ldquo;Ukraine is not dead yet&rdquo;.  When we see the summitry between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden, we can sometimes lose sight of the fact that 40 million people live in Ukraine and that they are at the centre of this crisis.  It is they who suffer as a result of this calamity and, if the situation deteriorates, it is their lives and livelihoods at stake, not those of political figures in Moscow, Brussels, or Washington.  Indeed, it has been a source of frustration for many Ukrainians to see their fate discussed at international summits without any representative from their country.  For as the old saying goes, &ldquo;if you are not at the table, you are probably on the menu&rdquo;.<br/><br/>When I first went to live and work in the former Soviet Union more than two decades ago, Ukraine was not petitioning for membership of NATO or the European Union and most people were content with its status of a militarily non-aligned state.  Most Ukrainians were neither pro-Russia nor pro-NATO; they simply pro-Ukraine.  How Ukrainians appraise what is best for their country has changed dramatically during the past decade.  The vast majority now see the Kremlin as a determined adversary that has killed many of their compatriots, occupies a substantial part of their country and maintains a constant threat of further military aggression.  At the same time, they feel their allies are comparatively indifferent and irresolute and have been unable to demonstrate a level of support that might deter the Kremlin.  As a result, Ukraine is in a difficult place.  Although at the heart of Europe and bordering the EU, many in Ukraine fear they are not viewed as a country worth defending with the same degree of solidarity and determination as other parts of Europe.  It is as if we have somehow placed them psychologically outside of Europe and in the Kremlin&rsquo;s sphere of influence.<br/><br/>The European Union's greatest achievement is also the one we take most for granted.  After Europe was repeatedly torn asunder by aggressive expansionist regimes, the EU played a vital role in healing the wounds and ensuring that common values and ever-increasing interdependency made war within its borders inconceivable.  Over the decades, the EU has had a magnetic pull on its neighbours.  Since 2004, the organisation has had 13 new members join.  Of those, 11 are former communist authoritarian regimes which, like Ukraine, had been subordinated to the Kremlin.  Today, we speak about Ukraine, but the issues at stake, while affecting Ukrainians acutely, are not confined to Ukraine; they are central to the future of Europe.  Fundamentally, it is about freedom and the right of states and peoples to determine their own political destiny free from the threat of military aggression.  I look forward to engaging with committee members on these issues.</p></speech>

In Europe&rsquo;s greatest security crisis since the Yugoslav wars, the EU, at least institutionally, is more a bystander than an actor.  The European Union struggles to define a coherent position.  All members agreed on three things: that Russia&rsquo;s invasion, occupation, and annexation of Crimea cannot stand, that Russian destabilisation of eastern Ukraine is unacceptable and that Russian demands to subvert the sovereignty of its neighbours cannot be accepted.  Beyond that, however, European agreement tends to dissipate.  Each EU member state, no more than our own, brings its own geography, history and values to bear in defining its foreign policy.  The EU is a unique experiment in attempting to draw that geography and those histories together in pursuit of shared democratic values and interests.  Russia&rsquo;s aggression towards Ukraine, however, throws European divisions into sharp contrast.</p> <p>  The EU has had some successes.  EU foreign ministers have met, reaffirmed their opposition to Russia&rsquo;s attempt to re-create dividing lines and spheres of influence and agreed on a collective diplomatic approach towards Russia and the outline of hard-hitting sanctions if these become necessary.  There is also close co-ordination between Europe and the US, bilaterally and through NATO, on what might and what cannot be part of a diplomatic solution.  The EU has also increased financial assistance to Ukraine and has allocated more than &euro;17 billion to the country since 2014.  A new &euro;1.2 billion assistance plan of emergency loans and grants has just been announced.</p><p>The new European peace facility is being used to assist the Ukrainian army.  Assistance is also being funded to counter Russian disinformation campaigns and repeated cyberattacks.  Yet, European Union countries continue to differ on how they see the threat and on how best to respond.  Russia looks very different, depending on whether you are sitting in Dublin or in Riga.  NATO has reinforced its deployments in its own member states, such as Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, while Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands have sent military support to Ukraine.  Germany, on the other hand, is proceeding to open the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, has blocked arms exports from other EU countries to Ukraine and has instead offered to send helmets and medical supplies.  Finland and Sweden have, for their part, stepped up their military co-operation and preparedness and debates about their co-operation with, and even membership of, NATO have intensified.</p><p> What does this mean for Ireland?  It means that we need to take security and defence in Europe more seriously.  Obviously, that starts at home with our upcoming debate on the forthcoming report of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  It means listening more carefully to the security concerns of our EU partners, just as they listen to our security concerns with respect to Brexit.  It means calling out aggression.  It means defending the rule of law and existing treaties and, finally, it means Ireland contributing more seriously to debates on EU foreign, security and defence policy, bringing its own values and interests to bear.</p><p> I also look forward to the questions and conversation to come.</p></speech>

I will open the discussion to members.  There is a rich array of issues to discuss.  I will take members in the order they indicated.  Deputy Richmond is first.  He will be followed by Deputy Calleary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#D00300"><p>I thank both professors for their very insightful presentations and their wider commentary.  I was about to use the phrase "over recent days" but they have both been talking about this for quite some time, long before the most recent escalation activities.  I will ask them both a couple of questions to begin.  I then have individual questions for each of them that follow on from their presentations.  In their opinion, what is the degree of Irish exposure to contagion in the case of an escalation of the situation?  Things have eased off, we hope, in the past couple of days.  A lot of focus was given to military activities in the Irish exclusive economic zone, but what will the contagion be if there were to be military intervention, a bombing campaign or even a land invasion?  How could that impact on Ireland?  Professor Tonra touched on this a little when he referred to disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks, which we know all about in this jurisdiction.</p> <p>  The second more general question is on the scope for Irish activity either at Government level or, more importantly, parliamentary level, because this is a committee of Parliament, to engage with European partners to address the concerns both witnesses raised in quite some detail.  We are looking towards the next Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of Parliaments of the European Union meeting in a couple of months' time in Paris.  What role should parliamentarians be playing in the European debate?  We talk about the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence discussing foreign policy and defence co-operation more widely but, in respect of a European scope, it seems any time we talk about defence, and shared interests and security, in the European Union, we very quickly go down the rabbit hole of concerns about the militarisation of the EU and opposition to a European army.  While that may make for a good slogan, it does not help us to actually address the very live and real concerns that are on our doorstep.</p> <p>  I have two more specific questions.  Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in mentioned the 13 former Soviet states he worked in and the Russian role in each of them, which was highlighted in Kazakhstan in recent weeks.  He and Professor Tonra hit on one area of particular interest and that is the reaction and response in Finland in particular but also in Sweden to the ongoing escalation.  This committee visited Finland during the lifetime of the previous Oireachtas.  We had good engagement with our counterparts.  It is a country of similar standing and we have a number of shared interests.  In the Brexit debates, Finland was a surprisingly strong supporter of all Irish interests.  It also shares many military interests with this State, as does Sweden.  There was a lot of talk at the start of the pandemic about how Finland had an amazing emergency response unit because it had been preparing for emergency for its entire existence in fear of an invasion or a military attack and not necessarily a pandemic.  What are the learnings for Ireland from the approach of Finland and, more important, what support do the likes of Finland and Sweden need from a like-minded country such as Ireland?</p> <p>  My final point is a more general one for Professor Tonra.  He will forgive me for saying that it is a point I have heard him make a few times, going back to my time at University College Dublin, to be quite frank, which relates to the limitations of Europe in respect of the ambition for a common security and defence policy.  He referred to it again in his presentation and he refers to it with great regularity.  Do we simply have to accept that there is only so far we can go?  Is the move the EU has made over the past few years with the last treaty in this area, and the appointment of a higher representative, as good as it gets?  Ultimately, will member states' concerns, and he cited the example of Germany quite succinctly, trump most areas if it is a case of one or the other?</p> <p>  I will go back to my original second question.  Where does this then go for us as parliamentarians who work across a European network in highlighting that this is a concern?  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I, along with others, are part of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  We talk about these issues.  There is a desire to talk about how the EU can solve all problems, but what are the realistic approaches, especially in the area of what could be called defence or security, but is really more about providing that peace of mind to European citizens, particularly when we are facing this new wave of threats from state and non-state actors?  How do we have that discussion at a national and European level in a way that can lead to some form of strengthening of capabilities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ben Tonra" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#D00400"><p>What is Ireland's exposure?  There is a generic and a specific aspect.  On the generic, small states in the international system do not have a lot of power and, therefore, have to rely on the rule of law.  Otherwise, they could be subject to the rule of force.  There is a generic, principled interest in the defence of international treaties, international norms and international law.  What we have seen with respect to Russia and Ukraine is a serious abuse of existing treaties and agreements and an ongoing failure on the part of the Russian Federation to respect agreements it solemnly signed going as far back as the end of the Cold War.  That generic point is very germane and important.</p> <p>  On the specific, in respect of an accelerated conflict - there is ongoing conflict already - between Russia and Ukraine, there are multiple nightmare scenarios of death and destruction in Europe, divisions and fractures in the European Union, migration flows and military implications for Europe that threaten Ireland's basic interests entirely beyond looking at the economics of trade, gas flows, energy security and all the other things that flow from it.  We are looking at something quite cataclysmic.  I do not think people are exercising hyperbole when they talk about this as the biggest security threat Europe has faced since the Yugoslav wars.</p> <p>  The role of the Parliament and parliamentary committees such as this, and the key attribute they bring, is the capacity to listen and to inform.  This committee genuinely has the capacity, for example, to talk to members in the Baltic states in particular and in central and eastern Europe, to get a sense of what their concerns and interests are and what they need us to do.  I have had a couple of interactions with ambassadors over the past number of weeks who have asked me about Ireland's position.  A couple of them have expressed genuine concern that they have not heard stronger statements coming from a senior level at Iveagh House about what has been going on.  There have been generic expressions of concern, but there is a genuine question about why we are not hearing more, and more robustly, when Ireland is so invested in the kinds of security structures and agreements that Russia has been abusing.  That parliamentary role of informing and listening to our partners is critical.</p> <p>  In respect of the specific question that was addressed, which goes right back to my own bailiwick, there is a paradox at the heart of this.  The 27 member states tell us that they want a European Union that speaks strongly with one voice, but at one and the same time those member states will not give the European Union the institutions, capacity or responsibility to undertake that.</p><p>There is a very obvious reason for this, which is that the European Union is not a sovereign.  It is not a state and there is no prospect on the immediate horizon of it becoming a federal state.  Therefore, there is no political hierarchy.  In the absence of a sovereign, there can be no European army.  The European Union cannot act like Russia, China or the United States of America.</p><p> We have a phrase in political science, forgive me, but we talk about the reification of states, that is, talking about states as if they were people.  We use phrases like "Germany feels" or "Russia wants" but that is not true; we know that it is governments and political leaders we are talking about.  We do that at an even worse level with the European Union because we talk about it as if it is a country and as if it can do things on an executive level that it simply cannot do.  It is a polity of 27 sovereign member states.  Until those member states, individually and collectively, decide that they want the European Union to have the kind of capacity that they say they want it to have, it simply is not going to happen.</p><p> Is this as good as it gets?  There is an obvious glass half full, glass half empty kind of argument to this.  When I started looking at EU foreign policy co-operation back in the day, the sum total of that co-operation was quarterly meetings of foreign ministers.  That was it.  Four times a year foreign ministers sat down and they had a chat.  When one compares that with where we are today, with the High Representative-Vice President, HRVP, the European external action service and all that comes with that, one can see that huge progress has been made.  However, there is a question as to how much better this can get until member states make that profound decision as to whether they want the EU truly to be a sovereign-like actor in the international system.  Without acceptance or agreement, that simply cannot happen, and, in the interim, we impose expectations on the EU that it simply cannot fulfil.</p><p> There is another issue about which I am concerned.  We heard Josef Borrell, the HRVP, talking about the EU being able to speak the language of power.  We also heard Ursula von der Leyen talk about the new European Commission being a geopolitical commission.  There is a danger there because such talk accelerates and exacerbates this capabilities/expectations gap.  The European Union cannot speak the language of power unless 27 sovereign member states let it and they will not do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Donnacha &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#E00200"><p>Just to add to that, it is imperative that we emphasise the fact that the EU does not act with one voice.  That is something that Russia has tried to take advantage of over the years in different ways.  The main drivers of EU policy towards Russia have been varied and are dependent on individual member states.  The size of states is relevant.  As Professor Tonra mentioned, small states have particular priorities.  Small states like Estonia and Latvia do particularly well within the European Union because they can use the European institutions, potentially, to drive their point home.  This is an issue which is of much more relevance to countries that border the Russian Federation.</p> <p>  That brings me to the second point which is that the geographic location of individual member states also has an impact on what kind of policies they try to get the EU to adopt.  Their own historical development is also relevant.  There is a huge difference between how countries in the Baltic region and eastern Europe generally approach Russia and countries west of a certain line.  Russia is aware of those divisions and has tried to replace conversations with the EU, as an institution, with bilateral arrangements where it can.  Germany, as has been mentioned; is a classic example of that.  It was after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 that most of the progress on Nord Stream 2 was made.  The pipeline has only been completed in relatively recent times.  The Kremlin has supported different parties and factions within the European Union, including Euro-sceptic, far-right and populist parties, that have sowed division.  That has been a particular policy.</p> <p>  When it comes to the question of Irish exposure if there was an invasion, the first thing one would have to address is the type of invasion we are talking about and there are several possible scenarios.  One would be a full-scale invasion but I think that is unlikely.  Whatever about the appetite, the digestion would not be good from a Russian military perspective.  A country of 40 million people would be an awful lot to occupy and there would be a severe risk for Russia of a backlash within the Russian Federation itself.  Domestically, it would not be a popular war so I do not think that is what we are talking about.  We are, therefore, probably looking a partial expansion from the base which Russia enjoys at the moment in Ukraine.  Another possibility, which has not achieved much attention but which is there, under the radar, and which may actually be kept in reserve, is the recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states.  The Duma in Russia is going to discuss this matter later this month.  A motion has been put down before parliament and of course, it would follow the practice that we saw in Georgia in 2008 where Abkhazi and South Ossetia were recognised.  That would then put an end to the whole negotiation process on the conflict zones in south eastern Ukraine and the EU has not really thought through what its response would be in that event.  The sanctions that are being mentioned at the moment are very general but as we have seen, sanctions have not, until recently anyway, seemed to modify the behaviour of the Kremlin in any respect.  There would have to be a very clear articulation of what those sanctions would be so that the Kremlin would be able to estimate the cost of pursuing its policies militarily.</p> <p>  On the question of what Ireland could be exposed to in terms of cyberwarfare, one would only have to ask the Estonians.  In 2007, when a Soviet-era statue was moved, on the initiative of local government, from the centre of the city to a military graveyard, the Estonian Government, which is very dependent on e-government, was exposed to intense cyberwarfare over a couple of days which disabled its ability to communicate with its citizenry.  Obviously, that is unlikely to happen in the Irish case but it shows what is possible for small states that incur the wrath of the Kremlin.  Ireland, of course, is not a member of NATO.  That is something that is particularly valued in Russia, and it has tended to emphasise that in its relations with Ireland.</p> <p>  Finland has a different type of non-military-alliance status but it does have conscription.  It has an historical experience with Russia which is very different from Ireland's experience.  A part of Finnish territory, Karelia, was occupied as a result of the war in 1939 or 1940.  I am not sure the Finnish experience is one that we can really transfer because geography really dictates the relationship, but certainly how the Finns can have an armed or more meaningful neutrality is an ongoing source of comparison.</p></speech>

I welcome Professor Tonra in particular.  It is 30 years since he lectured me and gave me a workshop on the politics of European security.  It seems that the more things change, the more they remain the same.</p> <p>  Professor Tonra spoke about the limitations of the EU and I tend to agree that it has been very much a bystander.  Is there anything, within those limitations, that it can be doing a lot better?  In fairness, he outlined a pretty serious programme of actions that the EU has undertaken, many of which were unknown to me.  Is there anything that the EU can be doing with its moral authority in particular?  In the context of the remarks about the limitations, one hears about Putin, Biden, Macron or Johnson but one never hears Ursula von der Leyen's name in the context of driving this or driving any particular agenda around it.</p> <p>  Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in spoke about his work in 15 former Soviet republics over the past 20 years.  In his view, with that experience and work behind him, are we at a more unstable time in Europe than we have been for some time or does it just seem that way?  That question is also for Professor Tonra who has been working in this space for a long time too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Donnacha &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#E00500"><p>To the question of whether we are in a more unstable period, the answer is "Yes".  The Cold War had a certain rigidity to it.  There was an understanding that the Iron Curtain was a permanent feature of the European security landscape.  This meant that when the uprising happened in Hungary or the Prague Spring occurred in 1968 and Soviet troops were pushed in to suppress these democratically inspired uprisings, there was nothing the West was going to do.  That was quite clear.</p><p>At the same time, Russia's intentions were to legitimise its landgrab after the Second World War and it achieved that, in a way, with the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.  There were certain rules that were respected.  Russia was a conservative power within Europe in terms of land and territory.  It was trying to conserve the status quo and gets its achievements after the Second World War recognised.</p><p> Now it is a revisionist power.  It does not have international borders, as other states do, but rather blurred margins.  It has given itself a right to intervene on behalf of, for example, Russian citizens who have found themselves, in the Kremlin's view, on the wrong side of the border after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  From a Kremlin perspective, the collapse of the Soviet Union was not one event but instead is almost like an ongoing process, and there have been some rectifications the Kremlin has tried to put in place.  Sometimes we talk about a new cold war, but it is important to emphasise that Russia is not the Soviet Union in terms of capabilities.  We often forget that.  The Russian economy is smaller than that of Italy and its population is substantially less than that of Nigeria.  Its willingness to use force against its neighbours is what gives it that prowess.  That willingness, to return to the Deputy's question, makes the current security environment more unstable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ben Tonra" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#F00200"><p>When Deputy Calleary and I were last directly engaging some years ago, European security looked very different.  We were talking about a Europe whole and free at the time, and that is very significantly under threat now.  As for what Europe as a whole could do, we have to return to an earlier point.  Josep Borrell travelled to Moscow as the High Representative and was roundly humiliated by his Russian interlocuters.  I do not know the individual psychologies or the precise details of the events but it was visible that the Russians did not take him or the European Union seriously as an interlocuter or actor.  Part of that relates, as Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in said, to self-interest.  The Russians do not wish to see the European Union in pole position on this.  They want to deal directly with Washington because they want to see themselves on a par with Washington.  Dealing with the European Union as an equal is, for them, a downgrade.</p> <p>  On moral authority, there is much literature on this, as the Deputy well knows.  We talk about normative power Europe and the power of European values, but those values rest on material power.  The Union has material power in respect of trade and economics, although it is much more limited in terms of diplomacy and has effectively none in the military sphere.  There is a genuine policy question to be grappled with, namely, whether we want the Union to have material power across all realms.  Perhaps we do not, and there may be good arguments for that, but we then have to accept the Union's limitations as an international actor that come as a result of that, and witness the European Union being marginalised in the way the Russians have successfully marginalised it to date.</p> <p>  President Putin referred to the end of the Soviet Union as a great strategic tragedy.  This comes to the Deputy's question about whether we are now at a more dangerous point.  Putin is, in effect, attempting to roll back the end of the Cold War and to re-establish Russia's sphere of influence.  He is attempting to return Russia to a place of global pre-eminence alongside the United States, as two global nuclear powers.  For him, a strengthened Europe is an impediment to that goal.  In that regard, we are indeed in more unstable and more dangerous times.  One can have an entire conversation about what went wrong.  From the time at which I was lecturing in Trinity College Dublin, TCD, when we were talking about partnership with Russia, Russia coming into the European family, Gorbachev talking about a European home, we can have a conversation about what went wrong with respect to that and where the blame rests, but we are now at a point where the prospect of some new kind of curtain falling across Europe is certainly on the Russian agenda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#F00300"><p>I was going to start by pointing out how good a student Deputy Calleary was, and I might have even asked about Deputy Richmond but I always assumed he was best in class, or at least that is the story he has sold.  We could go all over the place debating foreign policy but we will not go there.  Deputy Calleary asked how far the European Union can go within the constraints.  I acknowledge it is slightly different from the point of view of the vaccine roll-out, whereby there was not a national competence and the EU, because it was in everybody's interest, was able to do business, for want of a better term.</p> <p>  Best case scenario, there is a diplomatic solution to this.  There is always a wee bit of doubt, but while invasion is possible, we all probably do not expect it to happen.  Our guests spoke about some of the issues I wanted to ask about.  Vladimir Putin is President, and there will be a number of people who believe their clock was wiped at the end of the Cold War and they will use whatever means they can as leverage.  On one level, going up against Vladimir Putin is like going up against the local drug dealer.  He has greater leverage because he is willing to burn your house down.  The real question, however, concerns how many houses he is willing to burn down.  Dictators do not tend to improve with time.  These might be decisions we do not necessarily like but they are logical.  The Russians are willing to play games in the Balkans and throughout Europe and to do what they are doing here.  They are involved throughout Syria and the wider Middle East and, obviously, they have economic engagements in places I am not even aware of.</p> <p>  I acknowledge they do not have a crystal ball, but where do our guests think Vladimir Putin is in this context and how far is he willing to go?  There was some conversation earlier about Ireland being a weak point, some of which relates to the Commission on the Defence Forces and the fact we lack certain capacity even to exist as a neutral state.  That is something that needs to be answered outside of this committee.  This is not just about our fear in respect of cybersecurity, and there was the HSE attack.  Beyond that, there was a belief that some of the criminal elements that were involved could almost be called sub-contractors, given they may operate for a particular state we may have recently mentioned.  We will always be up against that sort of capacity.  That is difficult to take on and it will have to happen at an international level.  There was also the implied threat of actions in the exclusive economic zone to cut the communication cables for a significant portion of Europe.  How weak are we in that regard?</p></speech>

He sees himself, as Professor Tonra noted, as a rival to the European Union and he has tried to set up rival structures.  For example, he has set up the Eurasian Economic Union, which is an attempt to mimic, in a diluted form, what the European Union has managed to achieve economically.  There is NATO and he has set up a Collective Security Treaty Organization, which was in use in Kazakhstan recently, and Russian troops were also called into the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.  What he is arguing is that he will be an arbiter in these issues.  The Deputy put it well when he compared him to a drug dealer.  He has his own bailiwick and he wants others to respect it, and he will have complete authority within that.</p><p>As the Deputy stated, dictators do not age well.  There is no exit strategy that we can see for Vladimir Putin.  He has changed the Russian constitution in a way that means he could stay in power for a long period.  The rival club he has tried to set up is based on very different values.  We looked at Kazakhstan recently, for example.  It is a kindred dictatorship.  Of course, it has differences with Russia, economically and whatnot, but it has a similar type of regime.  It is like a mutual support group in a way.  The European Union, on a normative level and a values level, challenges that system.  As regards how far Putin is willing to go, I would say it is a far as he is allowed to go because, ultimately, as I stated, even though he has shown a willingness to use force, his resources are not those of the European Union - far from it - or, indeed, the West collectively.  He has proven to be a gambler but a very cautious one.  If one considers the wars he has chosen, Chechnya was the first.</p></speech>

Chechnya, for example, was a very popular war.  It was very early in his presidency and he learned early on that he could derive political dividends from a winnable, manageable and popular war.  Similarly, Georgia in 2008 was a five-day war that also was popular domestically.  He got what he wanted strategically.  Of course, we know what happened in the context of Crimea and Donbas in 2014.  That is why I was saying that in terms of the options open to him with Ukraine, Ukraine is the end.  Donbas is the means to act as a leader and the ultimate objective is to prevent Ukraine departing from that sphere of influence and joining Euro-Atlantic structures and using those conflict regions as leaders to exert pressure.  It is about identifying the pressure points.  I do not think it would be in his interests to inaugurate a full-scale war in Ukraine.</p></speech>

The only evidence I have in respect of how far Putin wants to go is that the things he has asked for are genuinely impossible.  They cannot be delivered or anything like them because it would create a neighbourhood of sort of sub-sovereign states all along Russia's borders.  The committee members have all been involved in negotiations.  One has to consider what is in the mindset of a person who asks for that which cannot be given.  Where do you go from there in terms of negotiations?  Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in has spoken to more important points in that context.</p> <p>  I wish to touch on the point of the logic the Deputy also raised.  It is somewhat perverse because from a Russian perspective, what it is actually achieving is the reverse of what it should want in logical and rational terms.  For example, it is creating a conversation in Finland and Sweden about NATO membership and closer relations.  It is driving the Germans away from Nord Stream 2, with all the pressure that others are putting on.  One has to ask what is the perversity of the logic that is going on there.  It comes to the Deputy's point about dictatorships, because Putin is not afraid of NATO.  He knows NATO does not pose a threat to the Russian Federation but what do pose a threat - not to the Russian Federation but to Vladimir Putin - are democratic revolutions.  That is his terror.  We can have a whole different conversation about the extent to which the West - the liberal democratic world - was promoting democracy and freedom across the Continent of Europe and that, for Putin, is a genuine threat.  To my mind, that is what he is fighting.  That is what he is trying to prevent.</p> <p>  As regards Ireland and a weak point, I heard the Deputy's colleague, the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on defence, speaking very well on "Morning Ireland" earlier.  It is precisely the issue raised by his colleague.  It is precisely that we do not even know what is happening in our airspace and seas.  We do not know because we do not have the very basic equipment to do so.  This has prompted and is contributing to a healthy conversation about Ireland's defence and security capacity, with whom we co-operate and when.</p> <p>  On a final point - I hope I do not cause offence - I refer to the international reportage on Irish fishermen taking on Moscow.  It was portrayed as a cute or funny story in the US media.  It was also embarrassing and a little bit shameful.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their presentations.  It is clear that the EU lacks real hard power or any diplomatic muscle here.  What role could an autonomous EU military capacity play in combating Russian aggression in Ukraine?  What framework would have to be put in place for such a force to be established?  What issues of national sovereignty would be involved in establishing such a force?  In the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, what role would the EU play in helping to put boots on the ground, that is, bolstering the Ukrainian defences?  There is an EU package of &euro;1.2 billion to Ukraine, but is there anything else the EU can do?</p></speech>

The EU is not a sovereign; it is composed of 27 sovereign member states.  If those 27 sovereign member states choose to come together and provide a collective defence, which is one of their declared ambitions, they may do so, but it will be a defence that rests in the hands of 27 sovereign member states.  The answer to the Senator's second question is almost equally short.  The EU has no capacity to put boots anywhere because it does not have any boots.</p></speech>

At that time, there was the Falklands War, the rise of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and so forth.  It was a very interesting time in my life.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in first.  Coming in so late in the discussion, some of the questions I prepared have been asked.  I wanted to ask about Russia and the threat of EU liberal democratic values.  Professor Tonra has answered on that issue but I will put it to Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in as well.  To what extent is Russia not afraid in the context of security and defence matters but, rather, is afraid of the rise of EU liberal democratic values?  I know Professor Tonra answered that question but perhaps Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in will answer it as well.</p> <p>  What is his view on the Russian military exercises?  Was it a threat?  Was it meant to intimidate or was it a story that was blown out of all proportion?  I know the former chief of staff of the Defence Forces, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, said it was meant to threaten and intimidate.  I would be interested to hear the views of Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in on what was behind the decision to hold these military exercises that are taking place this week, I understand.</p> <p>  What is Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in's understanding of the cyberattack on the HSE?  Who carried it out?  I heard Professor Tonra say that there is a bit of unhappiness about the Irish response to Ukraine specifically or to Russia in general.  I have sat beside the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il Chamber, including when he was leader of the Opposition, for many discussions on statements pre- or post-European Council meetings and I know he is a staunch critic of Russia and all the various things it has been doing through the years.  Does Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in consider that has anything to do with the cyberattack?  Is Russia out to get Ireland in any way or was it purely a criminal act with no direct or indirect link to the Russian Government?</p> <p>  I will move to my questions for Professor Tonra.  Nobody has mentioned the so-called strategic compass this morning.  What is his understanding of that?  At the conclusion of his presentation, Professor Tonra stated that Ireland will be bringing its own values and interests to bear in that context.  I hear what he has been saying all morning, but does the strategic compass give him any hope for dealing with the challenges we have outlined?  I am not saying I agree with all the views he has articulated, but does he think the strategic compass has the capacity to improve the situation as far as the EU is concerned?</p><p> Could the witnesses comment on the so-called Normandy framework involving Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine?  I understood that Russia was happy to use that process to deal with the Ukraine crisis.  Is it just sowing division between the EU and the US?</p><p> My next question concerns Germany.  I know we cannot refer to Germany as a person so what is the new Chancellor Olaf Scholt up to?  What is his strategy relating to Russia and the EU?  Is he falling between two stools?  The witnesses said he has given the go-ahead for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and blocked exports to Ukraine.  Is he trying to play both sides or is he slowly coming round to the EU perspective on this issue?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Donnacha &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#H00300"><p>On the issue of cyberattacks and whether Russia was out to get Ireland, I must confess that I have no evidence to suggest it was or it was not.  I think this is a matter for the security forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would not be able to comment on that.<br/><br/>On the substantial point about the extent to which the liberal democratic project is perceived as a threat, this is at the heart of this.  I lived in the post-Soviet space when that wave of colour revolutions occurred in the mid-2000s, the first of which was the Rose Revolution in Georgia and which was followed by the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyztan.  I wrote a book and a number of articles about that.  It took the Kremlin very much by surprise and there was a downturn in relations between the Kremlin and the EU and the west generally from that period onwards because the Kremlin's narrative was that these were foreign-sponsored attempts at <i>coups d'&eacute;tat</i>.  The suggestion was that, therefore, they were trying to depopulate the post-Soviet space of those kind of regimes to which Russia has strong attachments and possibly aiming at Russia itself.  What we learned from that is that those regimes fell for many reasons.  It was not even primarily due to any external support.  That view would, of course, deprive the people who were protesting of any agency.  It was often the strength of the regime itself that was a factor.  Georgia and Kyrgyztan had very weak regimes.  Sometimes it was simply the failure of the state rather than the strength of the opposition.  The opposition often had to be there, had to be organised and had to be allowed to organise and there had to be a strong civil society, media and NGOs.  That was there in places like Georgia and Ukraine, where they had competitive systems.  Even though they were not perfect in terms of democratic credentials, they had a competitive system.  What we know now is that not only do democratic movements learn from each other, so do authoritarian states.  Dictatorships also have a learning curve.  What they realised was that they had to shore up those vulnerable areas.  We then saw a raft of repressive legislation being brought stultifying the ability of any independent media or NGOs to develop.  That all originates from 2005 and 2006 onwards.  <br/><br/>It is very much that fear of some kind of democratic popular movement that animates Vladimir Putin's actions in the region.  That is at the heart of why Ukraine is so important.  It is important to stress the difference between regimes because we often lump them together in the post-Soviet space.  Ukraine has had five or six different presidents in the past 15 or 20 years, while only one man has been in charge in Moscow.  It is the Kremlin's narrative that Ukraine is a failure because of its political system and should be more like Russia so a successful Ukraine would be a challenge to that important Kremlin narrative.</p></speech>

My first publication was a book chapter written with Patrick Keatinge on Ireland and the Falklands crisis.  That is how far back I am going as well.  The question regarding the strategic compass is a really good one.  It emphasises something really important.  The reason they are trying to develop this strategic compass is precisely to address the issue I identified at the start, which is this loss of understanding and appreciation of everybody else's security situation.  We call this a lack of a strategic consensus in Europe - the fact that we see Russia differently in Dublin than they do in Riga.  The strategic compass is a mechanism to try to get member states to think more profoundly about each other's security concerns and take them on board in the way they deal with their own issues.  I am slightly jaded in the mid-later point in my career in terms of what this can actually deliver, but it is part of that incremental iterative process of building up consensus within the EU as to what kind of international actor the EU should be.</p> <p>  The Deputy's point about the Normandy framework is spot on.  The reason the Russians like the Normandy framework is because they are dealing with national capitals.  They are not dealing with the EU bilaterally one to one.  They do not want to deal with the EU bilaterally one to one because they know they are outgunned hugely in terms of economic and moral authority.  If they keep the conversation on the military and security side, they do not have to talk to the EU because the EU does not have any capacity in the security and military sphere.</p> <p>  Regarding the new German Chancellor, fair is fair, the man is only getting his feet under the desk.  He has a coalition to manage.  There are very different and wide-ranging views within his party and between his party and the Green party, particularly in terms of how to deal with Russia.  Again, we come back to two things about Germany.  One is the centrality of its economic interests, which we see most visibly in terms of its reaction on Nord Stream 2, and the second involves Germany's sensitivity regarding military issues, defence and doing anything that evokes echoes of its own tragic history.  In dealing with all that, Germany will inevitably be a laggard or on the back foot.  If it chooses to work with its European partners, Germany can do a lot in terms of building that collective European perspective but I do not underestimate the challenge involved in the EU doing that because we all have such different perspectives and coming up with a single European ideal and purpose is really challenging.</p></speech>

All politics is local so I was dealing with that so I missed most of the discussion for which I sincerely apologise.  I did not hear the discussion about academic qualifications but I will gloss over that issue.  I genuinely mean it when I say that I am sorry I did not hear all of the discussion.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the impact of the debate on joining NATO in Finland and Sweden.  What are the witnesses' views on that and where it is going?  I read one or two articles.  It seems there is a debate but they are not seriously considering it and at least for now are happy to remain as they are.  One of the lessons I learned from my time in Brussels involved how the Swedes and Finns view Russia.  Of course, I should have known but I did not.  It was certainly a learning curve for me.</p> <p>  My second question is about Nord Stream 2.  How strategic is this?  Germany has come round to saying that if there is an invasion, this could be on the table.  That is really significant.  I remember when the Russians basically switched off the gas seven or eight years ago.  Some people froze to death in high-rise apartments in Hungary.  Within a short enough period, they switched the gas back on because, of course, it was worth nothing to them while still in the ground.  My question is two-pronged.  How strong might Germany be in holding the line on Nord Stream and how far would Putin be prepared to go in terms of suffering the financial consequences of that?</p> <p>  Senator Keogan asked a question about boots on the ground.  As the witnesses noted, the EU does not have the boots.  However, different countries do have them.  French boots could be put on the ground.</p><p>Could certain European countries, like France, go it alone or is it more likely if there is any intervention in support for Ukraine, a number of countries would be involved?  If action were taken by the French to intervene in any way in Ukraine, how would that be likely to play out in the forthcoming French presidential election?  One of the advantages President Putin has is that he does not need to keep looking over his shoulder.</p><p> I have the same question in the context of other European countries.  What would the impacts on national politics in any other European country be if it were to consider a possible intervention in Ukraine?  Even though it is no longer with us, do the witnesses see any role for the UK?</p></speech>

She is right; there is no immediate prospect of Finland and Sweden joining NATO.  However, we need to consider their defence postures and defence structures.  The Swedes have sent troops to Gotland and they normally never have troops on Gotland.  They have done that specifically because of this crisis.  Finland and Sweden are almost ad idem in their own defence and security co-operation.  They are now deeply embedded in NATO.  It is not possible to put a cigarette paper between the Finnish and Swedish armed forces and NATO in the context of their relationship.  The only thing they do not have and thus far do not want is the Article 5 security guarantee.  They are both members of Partnership for Peace, as is Ireland.  It shows the flexibility of Partnership for Peace to provide for a really close relationship, as Finland and Sweden have, and a very distant relationship, such as Ireland has.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked a very good question about Nord Stream 2.  We need to remember that 40% of Europe's gas comes from Russia.  Germany is decommissioning all its nuclear power plants.  It needs that gas.  France took the opposite approach.  It is bumping up its nuclear programme because it does not want that dependence on natural gas.  Very tangible interests and realities need to be acknowledged.  The Deputy is right that the game between Russia and Europe with respect of gas is in a sense something of a game of chicken.  Neither side can afford for that to be turned off.  However, Russia has thought about this and has build up enormous reserves in recent years.  It knows that if it were to do something, sanctions would hit it and it has prepared for those sanctions.  The capacity of the Russian people to bear hardship is unparalleled in comparison with anybody else's.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked where this might hit France and what France might do.  France is a fascinating case study.  There is a traditional row in Europe between a sort of Gaullist vision of a European security defence, which is independent, and an Atlanticist NATO vision of defence which is very transatlantic.  The French also have deep historical ties to Russia going right back through history.  President Macron is playing his own politics with respect to being seen to lead Europe - the man who flies to Moscow and has conversations with Vladimir Putin.  He wants that.  What we used to call <i>le Front National</i>, which I will still call the National Front, has its own very particular relationship with Putin and his allies, which plays into domestic French politics in the way the Deputy said.<br/><br/>The Deputy's final point was on the UK no longer being with us.  She will have seen the reports today of some sort of amorphous strategic conversation between the UK, Poland and Ukraine.  That concerns me, if only because it evokes memories of the First World War and the way in which multiple bilateral alliances fed into the actuality of war in Europe in 1914.  We need to remind ourselves that we have security structures in Europe.  We have the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and the Helsinki Accords.  We have guarantees about the inviolability of borders and a Europe whole and free.  Russia is breaking those agreements.  Ireland should be very voluble in defending that.</p></speech>

That is quite clear from EU member states.  Ukrainians are not expecting that.  Sometimes they find the reluctance to facilitate the arming of Ukrainians to protect themselves bewildering.  That was brought forth in the last week or two when having been requested to provide military assistance, the Germans sent 5,000 helmets.  Vitali Klitschko, the Mayor of Kyiv, said it was a joke and asked if they might send pillows next.  That is the level of support.  Sanctions plus military supplies, particularly anti-aircraft equipment, are about the maximum people are expecting.  I do not think anybody is expecting troops on the ground for a variety of reasons.</p> <p>  The German Chancellor has said that prudent sanctions should be considered.  It was unclear what he meant by that.  He stressed that the countries initiating the sanctions would also suffer, by which, of course, he meant Germany.  I do not know if the Germans would revisit it in retrospect, but Germany's decision on Nord Stream 2 was remarkable.  It was very poorly received by Germany's neighbours in the EU.  Poland and the Baltic states saw it as a way of guaranteeing that German customers would keep German gas even if it was switched off for Ukraine in order to exert political leverage as had been done in the past.  The Deputy is right in stressing the importance of this.  It reasserts the need to move to alternative forms of energy.  Addiction to gas has been flagged as a problem for many years and we need to find alternatives.</p> <p>  Brexit and not having the UK simply means one less powerful voice at the table at international institutions.  Because the EU does not act as a single voice, the member states are often act on behalf of the EU at international institutions, such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and even the UN.  With the UK having left the EU, we have gone from having two EU permanent members of the UN Security Council to one.  It has been halved.  Again, it is a weaker voice on these international institutions.</p></speech>

We have covered a vast array of questions.</p> <p>  I have a question for Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in on Russia.  I was in Moscow and I remember the immediate economic collapse.  I saw the terrible poverty there.  At the time I was there the rouble became valueless because nobody knew what value to put on it.  The hotel where I stayed converted basically to US dollar.  They called it unit of currency, but we knew what we were paying.  Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in said that Russia is now economically less strong than, for example, Italy.  It is quite a poor country in terms of the standing of its people.  How strong is Putin's popularity given the economic weakness and the general poverty levels in Russia?</p> <p>  I note that Russia has issued passports to citizens in eastern Ukraine.  Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in suggests there is no likelihood of an actual invasion but I would be interested to hear his take on annexation of what is already occupied and perhaps a pushing of the boundary there, leading to the "Russianisation" formally of eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>  Professor Tonra said that the voice of Iveagh House on Ukraine is weak.  What should Ireland's voice on the current situation be?</p></speech>

The Chairman spoke about what he experienced in the 1990s.  The 1990s was a pivotal decade for Russia.  It is an integral part of the narrative Putin has constructed around himself.  Russians tend to take the long view of history.  There have been long periods of authoritarianism, punctuated by brief times of troubles.  These times of troubles were like a democratic moment when there was an option to go on different trajectories.  There has always been a reversion to the authoritarian template, such as with the inauguration of the Romanovs in the 1700s, the inauguration of the Soviet Union or the inauguration of Vladimir Putin in the 1990s.  Russians look back at that as a time of poverty and humiliation.</p><p>President Putin's policy has been to reassert Russia's place in the world - to make Russia great again.  That is popular with many people.  We will never get an exact gauge of how popular it is because no alternatives are allowed to emerge and opinion polls, to put it mildly, are imperfect.  There is a long tradition in Russian culture of people taking that the position that they do not have very much but their state is powerful, taking pride in Sputnik going into space and so on.  It is essentially a refined Soviet model.  President Putin's remarks in regard to the collapse of the Soviet Union was mentioned.  He described it as the great geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.  He also said that anybody who did not regret the collapse of the Soviet Union did not have a heart, but anyone who wanted to reconstruct it did not have a head.  He has taken what be believes are the best things from the Soviet Union, namely, its prowess in science and technology, its military prowess and its place in the world, and tried to refine it in away that it is not communism or socialism.</p><p> In terms of the passportization of the eastern Ukraine, that is a very good point.  That has been the policy all along.  The Kremlin will say that it has a special interest in protecting the interests of Russian citizens around the world.  Where there are not Russian citizens, it has manufactured them by, as has been said, handing out passports.  In most of these countries, dual citizenship is not allowed so it is a very provocative move to be offering these passports.  They are being offered, usually, in areas where the Government does not have jurisdiction such as in eastern Ukraine.  In the past, this has been a precursor for formal annexations or recognitions of breakaway regions.  As I mentioned earlier, a very possible alternative if President Putin felt it would achieve his objectives, if he could go no further and he wanted to demonstrate a point, would be not a full-scale invasion but an attempt to consolidate and formalise the relationship he has with south-eastern Ukraine, moving it from an external relationship to an intimate one whereby he recognises it formally either by absorbing it into the Russian federation or recognising it as a state and allowing for inter-state co-operation from a Kremlin perspective.  That is a strong possibility.  It is one that we have to watch.  The best indicator of future behaviour is past behaviour.  That is what he has done in other parts of the post-Soviet space where has felt that his interests were not being respected sufficiently.</p></speech>

I do not think I used the word &quot;weak&quot;.  What I was implying - this comes back to Deputy Haughey's question as well - is, as both of them will recall from their political careers, that there is a difference between support and support.  The Irish Government's position has been spot on, <i>pro forma</i>, as it should be in terms of the declaration.  My point is that as a small country so invested in the rule of law, international treaties and the post-Cold war settlement that we have, we might be a little more in terms of our support, not just on the rhetorical level but also on the practical level.  I do not want to go full <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i>on it.  We do not have the defence capacity to do anything of material value for Ukraine, but one would like to see a conversation happening at Cabinet or in Iveagh House on what more could we do to visibly show Ukrainians that we are with them and that we are standing with them and, by implication, show to our partners in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that we have their back in the way that they had ours.</p></speech>

From his point of view, what does Ireland need to do to improve in that context?  I do not expect a comprehensive reply, just a couple of headlines.  I am not sure if Professor &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in answered my question about the Russian naval exercises and whether they were meant to intimidate and threaten or they were just something that was happening anyway.</p> <p>  China appears to be backing Russia in respect of Ukraine.  What is China up to in this regard?</p></speech>

If the committee could find an EU angle on the commission, I would love to come back on it.  The short answer is that if we have three levels of ambition outlined in that document, my hope and aspiration would be that the highest level of ambition would be pursued by the Government and subsequent Governments.  That is it.  That would only bring us up to the level of other small European states of comparable size.<br/><br/>On the question with regard to China, again, it is an issue on which we could speak for a day.  China and Russia are <i>ad idem</i>in terms of what they are doing.  What they are both doing is challenging the established international order.  There are good reasons to challenge it because it was formed at a certain time in history, with particular interests at the forefront, and it does need profound reform.  Both China and Russia have an interest in destabilising and changing the rules of the game.  Those changed rules will not suit countries like Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Donnacha &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022020200002#K00800"><p>On the Russian naval exercises, the timing and location aroused a lot of interest.  It is speculative, at least on my part, to argue why Russia did it and when it did it, but it is interesting that it reversed the decision.  That demonstrates that it acknowledged that it generated a lot of negative publicity in Ireland and that was unwelcome and it was not going to help its cause.  Russia's relationship with Ireland has been traditionally frosty despite declarations to the contrary.  I cannot think of any other country in respect of which we have expelled so many diplomats.  I refer to the embassy on Orwell Road, from which three Soviet diplomats were expelled by the Garret FitzGerald-led Government in the 1980s in respect of, it was reported, a spy ring that was operating out of the Stillorgan Shopping Centre.  If I am not mistaken, the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, when Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2010, expelled a diplomat for the cloning of passports at the embassy in Dublin, whereby people who were applying for visas were having their passports cloned and they were being distributed to spies abroad, which was remarkable.  Most recently, because of the Salisbury attack and the use of Novichok in England, along with many partners in the EU, we expelled a Russian diplomat.  Relations had not been good before this.  This was felt to be an unnecessary provocation.  As I said, for me one of the most interesting things is that on this occasion Russia listened.  The naval exercises will still take place, but the fact that they will take place outside of Ireland's exclusive economic zone is something to be welcomed.  It is significant.</p></speech>

Mr. Yuriy Filatov, to discuss foreign policy and security in Europe.  The ambassador is welcome.  I thank him for agreeing to meet the committee to discuss matters of mutual concern to our respective countries and our people.  At a time of heightened tensions between Russia and the West, this meeting gives us all the opportunity to both discuss and exchange views on our different perspectives and to share ideas on how we can best move forward towards easing tensions and continuing to work together to deal not only with the issues between our respective countries, but many other issues facing humanity.  I welcome the ambassador and his officials.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear his opening statement before going into a question-and-answer session with members of the committee.</p> <p>  Before proceeding to the business of the meeting, I remind members that mobile phones should be switched off completely or put on airplane mode for the duration of the meeting as they can cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee room even if on silent.  We all hope that we can proceed accordingly.</p> <p>  This is our first meeting in our committee room in plenary session or full committee session since the Covid restrictions have been lifted.  The ambassador will see, therefore, that not only are some members wearing masks, which can be removed to facilitate dialogue, but Deputy Clarke and other members are attending the meeting from their offices outside the precincts of the committee room.  They will also be facilitated by way of direct access not only to his opening address, but to observations and questions.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person, the direction from me, as Chairman, will be that such remarks be discontinued.  Of course, it is imperative that all such directions are complied with.  </p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in a way that makes that person identifiable.  I remind members that they may only participate in the meeting by remote means if they are physically present in offices or rooms on the Leinster House complex.  I think the only member operating remotely is Deputy Clarke.  She is very welcome and will be called in order of indication.</p> <p>  With that, I am pleased to invite the ambassador to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Yuriy Filatov" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020200002#A00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to continue our dialogue on the matters of mutual interest on international and bilateral agenda.  It is obvious from our perspective that the most pressing issue now facing Russia, Europe and beyond is the threat to Russian national security resulting from the eastward expansion of NATO in recent years.  The security situation on the western borders of Russia is unacceptable and has to be dealt with.</p> <p>  On December 15 2021, Russia proposed to the United States and NATO to sign legally binding agreements on security guarantees.  The key provisions of these draft documents include obligations of non-expansion of NATO, non-deployment of offensive weapons near Russian borders, return to the configuration of NATO&rsquo;s forces as at the time of the signing of the Russia-NATO Founding Act in May 1997, as well as confirmation that Russia and NATO do not consider each other as adversaries.  The documents also imply mutual obligations of renunciation of the use of force, as well as interaction based on the principles of indivisible and equal security and mutual restraint in military planning.</p> <p>  I will outline for the committee the nature of Russia&rsquo;s legitimate and reasonable concerns that are at the heart of our initiative.  Having officially proclaimed Russia as the main threat, NATO has been implementing a doctrine aimed at containing Russia.  NATO&rsquo;s expansion led to the extension of the line of contact between Russia and NATO member countries.  By advancing more than 1,000 km eastwards, NATO acquired capabilities to use non-strategic weapons to hit targets deep in Russian territory.  Furthermore, the legal foundations of European security have been undermined by the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, known as the ABM Treaty, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and the Treaty on Open Skies - all with the tacit consent of NATO member countries.  Moreover, NATO by its current doctrine is tasked with achieving military superiority in all spheres - sea, land, air, cyberspace and space - and in all theatres.  It has been consistently involving other countries in its military activities, especially the neutral states such as Finland and Sweden.  That is not to mention that NATO curtailed co-operation with Russia and imposed restrictions on the Russian permanent mission in Brussels, disrupting the political dialogue on security in Europe.</p> <p>  More recently, NATO intensified combat training activities in the immediate vicinity of Russia&rsquo;s borders, including in the Arctic, that involve strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, as well as naval missile defence systems.  That also included increased military drills in the Black Sea region, with 15 last year compared with only eight in 2020, accompanied by more frequent reconnaissance aircraft flights in the area, which have increased by 60%.  NATO&rsquo;s greater capability of deployment of strike weapons at our borders, as well as the expansion of NATO&rsquo;s military infrastructure further to the east, increases the risk of an armed conflict.</p> <p>  Of deep concern is the advanced status of the NATO-Ukraine enhanced capabilities partnership, Ukrainian military transformation on NATO&rsquo;s standards, as well as the presence of alliance military personnel in that country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.393" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>All those are facts on the ground and the reasons Russia insists on legally binding agreements that would help stabilise the security system in the Euro-Atlantic.  The key to that is the principle of indivisibility of security.  It is fundamental to the entire architecture of European security and its accurate interpretation is crucial for the prospects of our dialogue with western countries.  The Charter for European Security signed at the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, summit in Istanbul in November 1999, which was signed for Ireland by the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, formulates the basic rights and obligations of the participating states regarding this principle.  It emphasises the right of each state to be free to choose or change the way in which it ensures its security, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve, as well as the right to neutrality.  The same paragraph of the charter clearly conditions this right by the obligation of each state not to strengthen its own security at the expense of the security of others.  It also states that no state, group of states or organisation may exercise preferential responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in the OSCE area or consider any part of it as its sphere of influence.  At the OSCE summit in Astana in December 2010, the leaders of our countries approved a declaration, confirming this integral package of interrelated obligations.  However, western countries continue to pick and choose from this package only the provisions they want, to be exact, the right of a state to be free to choose alliances to ensure exclusively its own security.  They shyly omit the clause "as they evolve", as it was also an integral part of the understanding of the indivisibility of security, implying mandatory withdrawal of military alliances from the original function of deterrence, as well as their integration into the all-European architecture on collective rather than a narrow group basis.  The principle of indivisibility of security is selectively interpreted to justify the irresponsible policy of NATO expansion.  The western governments also try to ignore one of the key OSCE documents, the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security, which states clearly that participating states shall "take into account the legitimate security concerns of other States" when choosing methods of ensuring security, including participation in alliances, and "maintain military capabilities commensurate with legitimate individual or collective security needs".</p><p>I would like to emphasise the indivisibility of security means that security can be either one for all or none at all.  As the Istanbul document stipulates, every OSCE participant has an equal right to security, not just NATO members, that interpret this right as referring exclusively to the members of this North Atlantic club.</p><p>One cannot but acknowledge that the decided aims and rhetoric by the US, NATO, and EU leaders have reached a level of absurdity.  We are witnessing the daily drumbeat about the so-called imminent Russian invasion in Ukraine as well as the readiness by the West to respond to that invasion with massive and destructive sanctions against Russia.  Any unbiased and serious observer would note that not only are there no facts on the ground to support such invasion fantasy and not only has Russia stated repeatedly it does not have any intention to attack Ukraine or anybody else, but there are not even hypothetically any political, economic, military or any other reasons for such invasion.  Our conclusion is that a rather dangerous game of shadow-boxing is going on for the sake of a certain political agenda in Washington, Brussels and European capitals.  It is indeed dangerous because it might push the current Kyiv government to undertake another military adventure in the east of the country, which would be catastrophic for Ukraine and for the entire of Europe.</p><p>We must be candid in that the EU, of which Ireland is a member state, has played far from a benign or constructive role in Ukrainian affairs over recent years.  We cannot but recall a pivotal moment in modern Ukrainian history, namely, in February 2014, when the US and the EU provoked and supported a bloody unconstitutional coup in Kyiv against the legitimate government that was, by the way, not even close to being pro-Russian.  As a result, radical nationalist forces came to power in Kyiv.  It is they who started a military conflict, essentially, civil war, in the eastern regions of Ukraine, where the local population did not accept this coup and its nationalist agenda that includes elements of neo-Nazi ideology.  People there did not want to follow Kyiv&rsquo;s orders to ban the use of the Russian language, which is the mother tongue for a large number of Ukrainians.  They stood for their right to maintain the way of life they were used to, preserve their cultural identity and traditions, and protect their homes and families from aggressive neo-Nazi bands.  People of Donetsk and Lugansk turned out to be quite successful in defending their land.  Soon afterwards some Europeans began to realise what happened.  France and Germany joined Russia in the so-called Normandy Format to convince the Kyiv regime as well as leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk to sit at the negotiating table and sign the Minsk Protocol.  This document remains the only viable way to resolve the internal Ukrainian conflict.  The package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, as it is called, was endorsed in the Resolution 2202 of the UN Security Council in 2015, therefore, it is an international legally binding act mandatory for implementation by Kyiv, Donetsk and Lugansk.</p><p>Right now the most important thing the European Union as well as the US could do to achieve peace in Ukraine is to force the Kyiv government into implementing the Minsk Agreements.  Without such pressure there is no realistic chance that the current regime in Ukraine would undertake any steps to fulfil its obligations, starting with a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk.  This month Russia serves as a chair of the UN Security Council.  On 17 February we have scheduled a meeting of the Council on the subject of the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and invited the permanent representative of Ukraine to attend.  This will be a perfect chance for the Council to insist that its decisions shall be implemented.</p><p>I would like to conclude on the issue on which I stated, namely, security in Europe.  Regrettably, the situation is by no means better than in December.  A response from the US to our draft agreement does not give much ground for optimism.  Our key demands on the non-extension of NATO are being ignored.  Our answer to that is still being assessed.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is abundantly clear that we must find a way to safeguard the security interests of all involved in the process: Ukraine, the European Union and Russia.  It will only be possible if proposals from Russia are treated with a serious and responsible attitude.  We hope that all reasonable, dialogue-oriented countries, including Ireland, will support the pursuit of peace and stability in Europe.</p></speech>

He is most welcome and we appreciate him attending.  I thank him for his role in relaying to the Russian Government in recent weeks the feelings and concerns of the Irish people regarding the proposed naval exercise in waters inside the Irish exclusive economic zone, EEZ.  We appreciate the way in which that exercise has been moved away from our shores.</p> <p>  I am also glad the ambassador is here to hear from us as the representatives of the Irish people - and the members on this committee include a sample of those from all parties and none - about our fears and concerns and those of the people we represent regarding the accumulation of Russian forces on the border of Ukraine.  I remind the ambassador that Ireland's neighbour, the UK, decided in recent years to leave the EU.  In the context of the chequered history of our relationship with that country and our aspiration to unite our island, we did not agree with that decision and we did not like it.  We could not understand it, and we still find it hard to do so.  The UK's decision threatened Ireland financially and had grave implications for our trade with it and with other European partners.  It even had the potential to contradict the Good Friday Agreement.  The protocol included in the withdrawal agreement is now being further debated and clarified by the UK and, on our behalf, the EU.  It is being done through negotiation because we and the other EU member states accept that the UK is a sovereign nation.  Neither we nor the wider EU sought to negotiate by amassing troops on the UK's borders.</p> <p>  My questions, then, are simple.  I heard and noted what the ambassador said and the justification he believes is necessary as a result of the growth of NATO.  Does Russia accept that Ukraine is an independent and sovereign state?  Equally, did not the NATO-Russia Founding Act signed in 1997 pledge "respect [...] [for] the inherent right [of all states] to choose the means to ensure their own security"?  Andrei Kozyrev, who after the collapse of the Soviet Union was the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation until 1996, recently commented that: &ldquo;The United States and NATO were on the right side of history by admitting new democracies to the Alliance and being willing to find an accommodation with Russia.  It was Moscow that returned to its antagonism toward NATO."  Would the ambassador agree with that analysis?</p> <p>  To reiterate my three questions, does the ambassador accept that Ukraine is an independent sovereign state; does he accept as well that, as a sovereign state, it is, of course, entitled, as it should be and as the EU and we believe it to be, to choose its own means to ensure its own security; and, does he agree with the comment made by Andrei Kozyrev about antagonism towards NATO?  </p></speech>

He is welcome.  I also thank him for agreeing to meet with me last week.  Much of what I will say here will echo what I said to the ambassador directly last week.  Given my concerns and those of my party about not only the maritime exercise planned off Ireland's south-western coast but also the escalating crisis on the Russia-Ukraine border, what we need now is some calm.  We need a de-escalation of the current crisis.  Unfortunately, we continue to see more sabre-rattling on all fronts.  As we sit here, joint military exercises are taking place between Russia and Belarus.  The Neptune Strike 2022 maritime exercise is also taking place in the Mediterranean, and encompasses the entire Sixth Fleet of the US Navy.  There was also, of course, the planned exercise by Russia, which has now, thankfully, been moved out of the Irish exclusive economic zone.  Today, as well, 3,000 more NATO troops have been deployed by the US to Poland, Germany and Romania.  Therefore, when I call for a de-escalation of the current crisis, I direct that call at everybody involved, including NATO and Russia.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been committed to Irish neutrality and I spoke to the ambassador last week about what we see that as representing.  It is active neutrality, and that means not having the UK's Royal Air Force, RAF, policing our skies, the US using Shannon Airport, or, indeed, Russia using perceived weaknesses in our defence capabilities to carry out maritime exercises.  Therefore, neutral means neutral.  Regarding individual nations, we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations according to their internationally-recognised borders.  That was borne out in a UN resolution passed by the General Assembly in 2014, which Ireland supported.  The resolution spoke to the territorial integrity of Ukraine and it must be central to diplomatic efforts to resolve what is, unfortunately, an escalating crisis.  Equally, the Minsk agreements must also be central to the situation.  Unfortunately, those have not been ratified.</p> <p>  I have several specific questions for the ambassador.  I ask him to give an assurance that Russia is prepared to work through all available platforms to attempt to find the means to de-escalate the current crisis.  In addition, it was notable that he made no reference to the planned maritime exercise off our south-western coast.  It is, of course, welcome that the exercise has been moved out of our exclusive economic zone and into international waters, but I would have much preferred to have seen the exercise being cancelled completely and not just moved.  I refer to a broader attempt to de-escalate the crisis.  I thank the ambassador for listening to the Irish people, the Irish fishermen, me, the Government and everybody who has serious concerns regarding the planned exercise.</p><p>I want the ambassador to clarify what date the Russian Federation first notified the Irish authorities of its intention to carry out military exercises in the exclusive economic zone.  When were the Irish authorities first notified of that?  I would also like him to clarify, in the context of the originally planned exercise in the Irish exclusive economic zone, if and when the Irish authorities highlighted to him or to the Russian Federation that the Irish authorities first needed to make a determination on the proposed exercise in accordance with Article 6(3) of the EU Habitats Directive and Irish regulations.</p><p> Given the close proximity of transatlantic cables between Ireland and America to the original site of the planned exercise, would the ambassador agree that the location first chosen could be viewed as provocative?  If he does not agree it was a provocation, why was that exact site chosen for the original naval manoeuvres?  Would the ambassador agree that such an action could be viewed as an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the defence capabilities of Ireland aimed at sending a message to both the EU and NATO?  Was Russia choosing to exploit our weaknesses as a neutral country to send a message to the EU and NATO?  I would appreciate it if the ambassador could answer those points.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020200002#D00300"><p>I welcome the ambassador and thank him for his address.  I am a firm believer in dialogue and talking to each other.  I served alongside Deputy Cowen at the Council of Europe for a period and he will know this to be the case.  When there has been a disputation at the Council of Europe, I have always argued that we should have dialogue rather than freezing out the membership of any country.  It is important that we sit and talk.  For that reason, it is great the ambassador is here and we welcome him.  Of course, dialogue has to be frank to have any value but I welcome the ambassador and thank him for his attendance.</p> <p>  We welcome the decision to move the planned military exercises outside Ireland's exclusive economic zone.  However, recent reports suggest that the new location for those exercises is situated over sub-sea communications cables between the US and Europe.  Can the ambassador give us some more information about the new location and what factors played a part in selecting it?  Perhaps the ambassador could give us assurances that these will be exercises and no more.</p> <p>  Does the ambassador agree, as many reports have suggested, that these military exercises off the Irish coast are intended to send a message of intimidation not just to Ireland but also to NATO?  I would like him to comment on that.</p> <p>  In light of the recent escalation in rhetoric, is Russia committed to a peaceful resolution of the current security situation with Ukraine and the West?  Could the ambassador give us a reassurance on that point?  We would be putting the very same question to the US and NATO.  We want a de-escalation.</p> <p>  Does the ambassador believe that independent and sovereign countries should be able to decide for themselves what organisations and alliances they wish to join?  Does he agree that it only becomes an issue or problematic if there is a particular threat to the neighbouring country?  Should sovereign countries be free to join organisations until that point?  What immediate measures will it take for there to be a de-escalation of tension?  I gather Russia is now responding for a second time to America.  What does the ambassador think would be enough for de-escalation?</p> <p>  My next question relates to Belarus, a matter of great concern to many people in this country, as the ambassador will be aware.  He will also be aware of arbitrary arrests and long prison sentences in Belarus for very little activity, including just participating in protests, etc.  The justice system in Belarus has broken down.  There is a dictatorship there.  I hope the ambassador will disassociate himself from that.  I hope he will say that Russia is not in support of what is happening in Belarus.  I would like to hear that Russia is clearly against it.  That does not preclude good neighbourliness but nobody could support what is happening in Belarus.</p> <p>  I again welcome the ambassador.  This is an important dialogue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Yuriy Filatov" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020200002#D00400"><p>I thank the Deputies for the questions.  I will try to sum up the main subjects.  There is no question but that Ukraine is an independent, sovereign state.  That is an axiom and there is no quarrel with that.  Ukraine has a right to live peacefully and securely within its borders.  The point I have been trying to make is that one cannot live in a vacuum.  A country cannot provide for its security without any regard for the security of its neighbours and adjoining states.  That is the whole heart of the matter.  If the security interests of one state overlap with those of another, those countries must talk and devise a viable rapprochement or agreement which would carry the security of both states.  That is the logic with all our initiatives.  I emphasise that the way it has been developing makes it abundantly clear that our way of doing things is by dialogue and looking for a peaceful and political negotiated solution.  There is no other way.  War is by no means in our plans.  If there is a war, it is not because of Russia.  I hope, and am pretty sure, there will not be any war.</p> <p>  If one has looked at every newspaper every day for some months, one will have seen the same thing repeated time and again, that is, there has been a build up of troops.  There has not been any troop build-up in Russia in the adjoining areas to the border with Ukraine.  Whatever troops are there are on Russian territory in areas of their permanent deployment.  There has been no escalation over recent months.  We do not trust any so-called US intelligence that points to the contrary.  The hysteria looks to us as if it is a deliberate attempt to heat up the situation, create a scenario for military conflict and exploit it in a number of ways, including a political way in propaganda terms, etc.  Not only is NATO pushing its military infrastructure to the Russian border, it is brazen enough to tell us to move our armed forces away from the border in our own territory.</p><p>This is not the way to run the railroad at all.</p><p> Regarding de-escalation, I think members of the committee would agree that you cannot de-escalate something you have escalated.  We have not done anything in terms of escalation.  That brings us to the previous point.  The troops are there.  They have been there.  That is the deployment of a western military region.  There is nothing there to support the theory that tomorrow there will be a war with Ukraine.  This is ridiculous if this word is permitted; I hope it is parliamentary enough.</p><p> Let us move down the list.  I do not think any responsible politician would think of anything other than a peaceful and political solution to this.  We have concerns.  President Putin himself just yesterday when he met the Prime Minister of Hungary in Moscow talked to the press about that.  He was absolutely clear.  He does not have excessive enthusiasm about the responses to our initiative, but he is very bent on pressing ahead with these well-thought-through suggestions, indeed demands, because we have to demand that.  We have an imminent real threat to our national security.  What would you think if some other country or bloc - military organisation - had strike missile systems at your border with five minutes flying time to Moscow?  I do not think any responsible leader would be able to ignore that simple fact.  We are looking for dialogue.  We will be insisting on doing that quickly and without any protraction.</p><p> On the issue of exercises, as members might appreciate, I am very fond of this issue and recently I have spoken on it many times.  I said it last Monday at the beginning of this whole story that it was not a big deal to begin with and it is not a big deal right now.  We must remember that our navy is within its right to carry out the exercises.  We talked about the fact that there is no message involved here to Ireland or elsewhere.  Even the scale of the exercise is just two ships.  I do not think it is enough to send any message except that it is routine training, planned probably two years in advance with no idea of pressing any buttons.</p><p> There have been plenty of amusing stories saying that there were some kinds of frantic exchanges between our governments.  I would not delve into the communications between our governments, but there was nothing frantic about that.  I do not have an exact date of when they received notification.  It was probably last Saturday, the week before.  That was done in a more or less technical manner.  There have been some public comments which I, personally, did not appreciate.  There was no frantic handling of this affair.  However, what was there was willingness to look into the real practical concerns which, to our mind, the fishermen had.  It was my initiative to invite them to have a talk, to listen to what they had in mind and hear what the problem really was.  We looked at the map and at that point it became clear that there actually was not a problem.  They did not have any plans of pirate-like activity or Greenpeace-like actions.  These are very sensible hard-working people.  They have only been concerned with their well-being.  They have the quota opening on 1 February.  They are looking at the opportunity to get their quota without any hindrance.  It just made sense.</p><p> All in all, the area of the fishing grounds and the area of the planned exercise barely overlapped.  That was not the question.  However, they asked if we could ensure that nobody would go into their area and they would certainly not go into the area of the exercises.  If that is the issue, we certainly tried to accommodate the whole thing.  The conclusion was if there is a problem - there is a problem for the well-being of a great number of fishermen in the area - the decision was made on humanitarian grounds to relocate the exercises to avoid the completely unnecessary hardship for the fishing industry of Ireland as well as decrease the risk of any incident at sea.  I think that was a responsible sensible solution which stands.</p><p> What else?  The cables, my favourite.  It seems like whenever you go through the Atlantic in the general area you almost certainly cross the routes of transatlantic cables.  I do not put any water into the theories which are abundant that these exercises or other exercises are somehow linked to this James Bond-like story.  Looking into today's newspapers, I would suggest to the proponents of this that they should care about cables in the central part of Ireland which have been cut for profit.  That is probably the real problem for Ireland or at least for the rural part which lacks Internet and telephone.</p><p> I would not want to be in a position to comment on anything pertaining to the internal affairs of Belarus, which is an independent country.  There has been a period of real problem there and we cannot stand by because we are bound by not only many historical, family, economic and social ties, but by the agreements on the union of two states.  We have been very active making sure the situation develops into the stand-down mode.  It is not easy.  It is not a black-and-white picture there and has not been.</p><p>I am sure the committee members would appreciate that I am not in a position to go any further.  It is a matter of very peculiar and acute attention what is and has been going on in Belarus and we support every effort which is being made there to resolve these sociopolitical problems peacefully without any problem and without any loss of life or hindrance to the population or to freedoms of the population.  Let me put it this way.</p><p> I tried to cover more or less all the issues.  If I forgot something, please excuse me.  It was a big list.</p></speech>

I would remind members to desist from repeating the exact same questions as have been asked already because the likelihood is that the ambassador will give the same answers he has already given.  I am anxious to broaden debate and give everybody an opportunity.</p></speech>

Irish neutrality is important to us.  We wear it as a source of pride.  The ambassador will have heard many members around the committee room already referencing it.  Does the Russian Federation believe that the State is militarily neutral in world affairs?</p><p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Mr. Sergei Lavrov, wrote to the Government today asking if we have changed our position on post-Cold War European security arrangements.  What specific action as a neutral actor has the State taken to warrant that question in that letter today?  Specifically, what has Ireland done to warrant that letter today?  In that letter, the Russian Federation's Foreign Minister asked that we would respond individually and not as part of a European collective.  As the ambassador answers my question, I would like him to state what we have done individually to warrant the letter in the first place.</p><p>The ambassador mentioned the famous undersea cables.  One of the issues that might give suspicion to that is, for example, that in August 2021, a 300 ft Russian vessel, the <i>Yantar</i>, was reported to be in our economic exclusion zone.  For what purpose would a 300 ft vessel be in Irish economic exclusive zones?  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an ambasad&oacute;ir.  I thank the ambassador.</p></speech>

It is H.E. Mr. Filatov's second time before us in the new D&aacute;il and Seanad.  It was great to see the ambassador speak so fondly of his diplomatic incident with the Irish fishermen.  It is clear from the ambassador's demeanour today that he was taken by them, their work ethos and their commitment to their communities and to the environment.  It is nice to see that.  It shows what dialogue can do and how positive it can be.</p> <p>  In relation to the issue in Ukraine and Russia's strict adherence to the concept of indivisible security, we know that means that Russia will respect all territories and their integrity and their sovereignty.  I was interested to hear the ambassador say that the idea of tens of thousands of troops being positioned and increased on the Russian Federation's borders is untrue and that they are constantly being deployed there and there has been no escalation.  Has the fact that there has not been an increase recently been independently verified by any third party?</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Gannon's question, initially, why did the Russian Federation choose to have the naval trials in Irish waters?</p> <p>  I also asks the ambassador to comment again on the issue in relation to Belarus.  Obviously, we have a huge love of Belarus.  As we have with Russians, we have much in common with them.  We have great ties with that beautiful country and the beautiful people there and we are shocked and upset at the unlawful detentions stemming from pro-democracy protests.  It is something that we are concerned about.  If possible, I would like to hear more of the ambassador's thoughts on it.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1583" speakername="James Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020200002#F00500"><p>I welcome the ambassador to the committee.  It is good to have H.E. Mr. Filatov here to have this exchange; it is always good to talk.</p> <p>  Like some of my colleagues, my first question to the ambassador is why the Russian Federation chose to have a military exercise in the corner of Irish waters and EU waters in the first place.  The Russian Federation cannot have been unaware of the damage to fish stocks and marine life.  The fishermen made the ambassador aware of it, if he was not already.  Going beyond that, the Irish Government has a programme of legislation to develop our marine potential.  I refer to significant infrastructural investment - everything from renewable energy through to the telecommunications and cables that we have already talked about.  It is a sensitive and important part of Ireland's footprint - its marine waters.  These are also EU waters.  It seems very curious that a decision would be taken to have an exercise within a corner of the EU and within a corner of Irish waters.</p> <p>  Deputy Gannon and Senator Ardagh already alluded also to the submarine cables.  The ambassador laughed it off with a James Bond reference.  Much worse than James Bond happened in the past 50 years.  There is a real threat with much of this.  It is also a fact, I believe, that there was circling by Russian aircraft of those same submarine cables in the past two years.  There was an exercise where aircraft circled for many hours.  Potentially, they could have been mapping the plot of those cables.  A certain number were in the area.  There seems to be ongoing Russian interest in those areas of the cables where they join and I would wonder why that is.  In terms of an area, the shipping lane is the naval gateway or approach to Europe where vessels would arrive.  All of this prompts the question, "why would you go there in the first place?"  If I were to play football, I would not start on my neighbour's lawn.  I would go out on the green field outside of it.  There is the whole Atlantic Ocean in front of the Russian Federation.  Why pick a corner of Europe, and a corner of Ireland, to do it in?</p> <p>  Even though the Russian Federation has moved - I thank the ambassador and his country for taking that decision - there will still be a downstream impact in terms of whatever manoeuvres are performed or whatever military exercises are done, or whatever firing is done.  The waters will still be knocked on.  The marine life, potentially, will be impacted, even though it is a little further afield.</p> <p>  There was a statement this evening, at approximately 5 p.m., before the meeting started and a question was put to the Irish, either by the ambassador or by his colleagues, asking whether the Government changed its position.  I do not know if it has or not.  I do not speak for the Government.  I am a member of a Government party but I am not a Minister.  If it had, if any of us had, could the ambassador blame us?  With all we have seen in the past couple of weeks, the activities and the exercise and the fact that the Russian Federation has chosen to perform military exercises in the corner of what is still a neutral country's hinterland, would the ambassador think it unusual or in any way surprising if we had begun to reconsider these issues?  It could be said that Russian activity in the past couple of weeks has done more for NATO recruitment in this country than the US ever did in the past 40 years.  It is something the ambassador should think about very carefully.</p> <p>  I will be very interested in the ambassador's answer to the final question I put to him.  In his opening statement, the ambassador talks about theatres of war and theatres of exercise and about naval, air, etc.  The ambassador also talks about cyberspace.  There has been significant suggestion that Russia has played an active part in disinformation campaigns and disruption campaigns in the UK, in the US, but also in Western Europe and also within the EU.  Has it ever done that in Ireland?  Will the ambassador be in a position to advise us on that today?  It is a significant concern that Russian disinformation campaigns permeate cyberspace in this country and elsewhere.  I look forward to the ambassador's responses, and thank him.</p></speech>

The ambassador is most welcome.  I will keep my questions short because a number of questions I had wanted to ask have been asked already.</p> <p>  I listened with interest to the ambassador's responses around the escalation and the commitment to a diplomatic route but what I have not heard is how Russia intends to use the Presidency of the UN Security Council to achieve that.  If the ambassador could give us an outline on that, that would be very helpful.</p> <p>  I read recently of a report dating back to last September regarding the parliamentary elections in Russia involving Apple and Google acquiescing to the demands of the Russian Government in terms of the removal of apps and the removal of YouTube videos.  On Russia's foreign policy, could the ambassador indicate to us "the level of truth" perhaps is the correct term there is in Russia seeking to develop its own sovereign Internet?</p></speech>

This is a fact.  This is Ireland's choice and this is your policy that is enshrined in your Constitution.  What else is there for me to say?  We certainly respect the choice of the Irish people.  It is a fact of life and law.  There is nothing to debate here.<br/><br/>With regard to letter, as referred to by the foreign Minister, is not an exclusive message to Ireland.  This letter, sent to all foreign ministers of all the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, countries, OSCE, which comprises all of Europe, and including United States, and Canada, was a point and a question.  I tried to dwell upon this in my opening statement: &quot;how do you at this point in time view the principle of indivisibility of security?&quot;  This is the heart of the matter now as we are debating it and as one can tell from our own discussion here, it is quite important and crucial as we make up our minds.  Everything else will depend upon the answer to this question.  This is not a challenge, it is a respectable question that will be factored into our own deliberation and the report to the President as to the next steps by Russia in the ongoing dialogue.  This is a pretty obvious and, I believe, respectful way of conducting diplomacy.  There is no hidden agenda.  Ireland is among the partners with whom we talk about these things.<br/><br/>The next question was about only one independently verified information about troop deployments.  I can tell the committee that we certainly know for sure where they are and where they have been.  I do not know of any independent actor in this area of the verification of troop deployments.  We had the open skies agreement, which the United States has unilaterally ruined.  Under that agreement one could have imagined that there would be aircraft flying, taking photos, and ensuring that the situation is there, but there is no chance to do that because this agreement is no longer working.  Ireland just has to believe us or them; it is for Ireland to choose.  We are not in a game of trying to whip up tensions.  There is no reason for us to do so.  Ukraine is our neighbouring country and we want stability there.  We want the conflict there to be over, with a good reliable outcome.  That is the whole policy motive, reason, aim and goal.  That is it.  I reject any speculation about our troops on our own territory.<br/><br/>In our press, we have a newspaper <i>Kommersant</i>, which is a well-regarded, more or less, like an opposition paper.  They sent news reporters to the areas adjoining the Ukrainian border, and they went through village talking to people and asking them &quot;Have you seen anything there?&quot;  People did not, at first, get the idea of the question because there had been no tanks there, nothing except maybe hungry wolves running around because it has been quite a winter this year.  The overall picture there just shows that the troops, whatever they are, are in their winter quarters and stationed as they were. There is no activity at all.  The highway from Belgorod, which is a Russian city, to Kharkov, which is a Ukrainian city, is a major highway.  It is working okay and the checkpoint on the border is working okay.  The traffic is not that much, but it is still there and trucks are going both ways.  The committee might be surprised to hear it, but trade is still going on between Ukraine and Russia.  We did not respond to the sanctions the Kyiv Government imposed in certain areas of our economy.  We are still carrying on trade in the interests of many economic operators in both countries.  There is also the humanitarian exchange with people going back and forth for family reasons.  The reality there is different if one compares it with the pictures in the newspapers here.<br/><br/>I certainly believe that the whole hoopla is a political gimmick.  It is a well calculated attempt.  There are plenty of experts in the intelligence area in the US.  The committee members might remember the old US movie &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;.  Perhaps the members have seen it.  The story is about how to make up a conflict in Europe by manipulating the media, without any conflict, and just with certain technology of manipulation.  This very much resembles the whole story now with the build up.<br/><br/>On the famous cables and the question of &quot;why there?&quot;, I am not aware of any specific reason the general staff of our Navy picked this particular point of the Atlantic.  I am aware that they have been carrying out training in all parts of the Atlantic.  I am pretty sure that there is no specific point to it that is connected to the transatlantic communication cable, even for technical reasons.  We are talking about two corvettes going there for five days.  I must make one very important.  The committee will be aware, as I am sure it has received well-prepared briefings, that the exclusive economic zone is not territorial waters.  These are international waters and our Navy is pretty much in their own right, under international law, to carry out these exercises.  This exercise is a small, small part of the military activity around Ireland that is carried out by the UK Navy and the US Navy.  I honestly cannot recall over recent years, since I have been here, anybody in the press raising an issue of environmental damage to the Irish economic interests as a result of such military activity by Ireland's neighbours.</p><p>I appreciate the attention paid to Russia in this regard, but I do not think that it is in any way comparable to what is going on.  Not on a daily basis, but on a constant basis there is a lot of nuclear submarine traffic around the north side of Ireland.  There have been numerous incidents in the past.  They have inflicted lethal damage on fishermen with their propellers taking in the nets.  If you compare the two things, there is nothing to be concerned about.</p><p> I will now refer to cyberspace.  This is a developing story.  We are very well aware of the dangers and potential of harm there in terms of many issues such as intrusion into personal life and disruptions in critical infrastructure.  We have been through one of these episodes here in Ireland, as the committee knows perfectly well, with the attack by hackers on the HSE system.  It was suggested that the hackers were Russian.  We immediately suggested our assistance in the investigation of this matter, as we have a very potent cybercriminal force within our police department.  Our Irish partners decided to go another way but, in any case, we would appreciate such co-operation because it can only be done bilaterally.  We need to pinpoint these kinds of people if they are in Russia.  If they are doing harmful things, we have to grab them.  We are interested in that.  In Russia, we suffer more than 20,000 attacks a year of a major magnitude.  I do not remember exactly, but out of that there is a considerable portion of ransomware attacks and we are very concerned about that.  There is nothing here other than a huge blanket area of co-operation.  We have been active at the UN.  We need a legal basis for that, and we have promoted a UN convention on cybercrime because we do not yet have the universal instrument in this area that we need.  That would facilitate co-operation on practical matters in instances like the one I mentioned.</p><p> The sovereign internet is an idea that is being played out in a number of countries, including in Russia.  It does not mean closing the Internet to outside access.  The idea is probably to have a back-up system like we have a backup of a hard drive just to make sure that if it goes down we have something to rely upon.  That is the only thing.</p><p> Could you help me with the question asked by the member online, Chairman?</p></speech>

We have to recognise it as a fact.  That is certainly shared by many within the council &ndash; by the US and others  - that it has to be implemented.  The issue is how to go about that.  That is a job for diplomats to do.  That is the most practical way we could use the council's resource and political clout to provide an impetus in this direction.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, it all boils down to 2014.  If, at that point, there was not a mistake made by the UN and the US - that was a colossal blunder and a strategic mistake to support this violent overthrow and access to power by radical elements &ndash; we would not be discussing it today.  Everything would be fine for Ukraine, more or less.  The Minsk agreements were the only way out at that point in time, which provided a framework to get the two sides in Ukraine together &ndash; the government and what they call separatists.  These people in the east simply did not recognise what happened in Kyiv.  They did not like that, and they did not want anything to do with that.  It would take serious, sensible dialogue with them to settle things within Ukraine.  Unfortunately, that was not on the cards and that is the still the issue.  If only the western guarantors of the agreement, namely, France and Germany, would employ all their political pressure, we could see a good outcome.</p> <p>  That brings up a very interesting point about the sovereignty of Ukraine.  Literally speaking, it is a sovereign, independent state, but in reality it has become a highly questionable proposition.  It is abundantly clear that the current government of the country is accountable not to its own people but mainly to Washington and other capitals upon which it depends, in terms of political, financial and economic assistance.  It looks like a very profitable proposition.  I heard just the other day the President of the European Commission announcing another &euro;1.2 billion of assistance to Ukraine.  That is good.  I would be happy if it reaches the people in Ukraine, but I am not sure about that.  That is just a footnote to that.</p> <p>  On the question of Belarus, I reiterate that we support the agreement.  As was said about Ukraine, it all goes back to Belarus - the independence, sovereignty and integrity of Belarus, including the integrity of the society.  There has been lots of turmoil.  They have come through that dramatic period.  I hope that our dialogue with Minsk, which is not entirely public, will help to calm things down and will play to the overall improvement of the political and economic situation there.</p><p>I will stop at this point.</p></speech>

I wish the ambassador and his team a good evening and thank him for coming before the committee.  It is very useful to have an in-person meeting because we can both listen to the ambassador's words but also read his body language, which is perhaps more revealing and more insightful.</p> <p>  I have four questions.  The first one is on Ukraine and the remaining three are on Ireland.  Ukraine received its independence in the 1990s and agreed to hand over all its nuclear warheads to Russia in return for security guarantees.  Will the ambassador briefly outline to the committee what guarantees were give to Ukraine in return for the nuclear warheads?  Ukraine honoured its part of the agreement by handing over the nuclear weapons.  What is the ambassador's assessment of whether Russia has honoured its side of the agreement?  </p> <p>  On the embassy in Dublin, I think it was four years ago that the embassy applied for planning permission to increase the size of its building by approximately five times.  The application was eventually declined.  My question has two parts.  Had the application been approved, would that have made the Russian Embassy in Dublin the largest Russian embassy in the European Union?  Second, does the Russian Embassy have any further plans to submit planning applications to increase the size of the building?</p> <p>  A number of years ago after the Salisbury poisoning attack, Ireland expelled one member of staff of the Russian Embassy.  Has the number of personnel working at the embassy increased or reduced since that date?  I ask that the ambassador give us an approximate figure for how many personnel are working at the embassy and whether the SVR or GRU have personnel based there.</p> <p>  My final question is more straightforward.  We note the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, has not received any further notification of a live-fire exercise somewhere in the Atlantic.  Are we to take it Russia does not intend to run a live-fire component as any part of an exercise in the next week or two in the Atlantic?</p></speech>

I thank him for taking time to answer all the questions that have been put to him.  Like colleagues, I welcome the resolution of the proposed military exercises off the south-west coast in our economic zone.  I congratulate both governments and others for their involvement in that.  We believe the Ukrainian people are a sovereign, independent people and should make their own decisions without hindrance from outside.  The ambassador agreed with that in his contribution when he said Ukraine has a right to live peacefully and safely within its borders.  My first question to him is: "Why not the people of Georgia?"  I understand the ambassador has stated Russian troops are present in foreign countries only by official invitation.  Is that correct?  The people or Government of Georgia never asked Russia to invade their country.  My other question is when will Russia withdraw from the occupied Georgian territories.</p></speech>

He is a very impressive diplomat.  I have seen him in action before and he does his job well, so I congratulate him on that.</p> <p>  I am from Cork and I know many of the fishermen he dealt with last week.  We were very pleased the Russian Navy and the Irish fishers fleet would not be coming head to head in the Atlantic.  That was a good outcome.  When was the last time the Russian Navy carried out exercises in the Irish exclusive economic zone such as those recently planned?  When was the last time such exercises occurred there, if ever?  That is one question.</p> <p>  The second question is on economics.  The last time we spoke I asked the ambassador about the impact of Covid-19 in Russia and on the people in Russia.  It has has an impact in many countries, so he might give us a quick overview of the impact of that disease on the Russian people and economy.</p> <p>  I have been wondering about this for quite some time and take the opportunity to ask the question.  How would the ambassador describe the political system in Russia?  Is it a democracy, an autocracy or a pseudo-democracy?  How would he describe their political system?  How would he describe the Russian economic system?  Is it capitalist?  What is it?  In the past there was socialism involved in the USSR, in the early days, but what is it now in the ambassador's view?</p> <p>  He has mentioned that the media have been manipulated.  That is if I heard him correctly; he may correct me if I am wrong.  He said, and I wrote it down, that "there has been no escalation in recent months" of military on the borders of Ukraine.  He may correct me if I am wrong but he said war is not in Russia's plans, and we welcome that.  The ambassador says what is there now is a permanent deployment.  Will he give us an idea of what the scale is of the military establishment, if you like, on the borders of Ukraine?  We have seen satellite imagery of large troop deployments, tanks, heavy weaponry and so forth.  Is that all media manipulation?  Is it a mirage?  What is going on there, if anything?  Will he give us an idea of what is happening?  Maybe the Chairman would like to visit and see for himself what is going on, if that is something we could do as a neutral country.  In his statement, the ambassador said: "The security situation on the Western borders of Russia is unacceptable and has to be dealt with".  Will he say more about what he means by "has to be dealt with"?  Later he said: "Let me outline the nature of Russia&rsquo;s legitimate and reasonable concerns, that are at the heart of our initiative."  What "initiative" are we talking about?  What did he mean by "at the heart of our initiative"?  He did not go on to say what that is, except for criticising NATO and so on.  What Russian initiative is he referring to there?  I would be interested in that.</p> <p>  Most of the other questions I was going to ask have been answered.  Those are just five or six short questions.</p></speech>

After we hear the ambassador's replies we will return to Senator Craughwell.  Then I think Deputy Gannon has a quick supplementary and perhaps Deputy Brady does also.  However, I am conscious of time and the fact our members have other plenary duties as it our Wednesday evening in Parliament.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Yuriy Filatov" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020200002#J00700"><p>I will try to be as concise as possible.  With the first question, I suspect the Deputy has been referring to the Budapest memorandum of 1994.</p><p>That was the agreement concerning Ukraine giving up nuclear weapons that remained on its territory after the break-up of the Soviet Union.  The signatories, Russia, the US, the UK and Ukraine, pledged not to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine and to use all the OSCE principles without exception.  We remain fully committed to honouring these obligations.  The memorandum was made strictly in the realm of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  In legal terms, that is the area of its legal power.  The memorandum does not provide for a commitment by any of the signatories to put up with silence in respect of, or much less support for, an unconstitutional, armed <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>in Ukraine.  In signing the memorandum, Russia did not undertake any obligation to force any part of Ukraine to remain in Ukraine against the will of the people living there.  We believe that memorandum has been violated by the US and the European Union, which openly provoked and supported this <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>in 2014.  We do not accept any arguments about the 1994 memorandum.  This is a completely different story and there is nothing in that memorandum that pertains to the events of recent years.<br/><br/>The embassy construction is a long story.  We have applied for and received the permit, which suggests all the relevant State agencies have examined it, as the Chairman knows well.  After we had broken ground, we heard news of a decision taken by a different element of the Irish Government to suspend or revoke this permit, on the grounds of national security.  We have been talking to the Government since then because we do not accept that argument.  We do not think the construction of our embassy could, in any imaginable way, bear any risk to the national security of Ireland.  We are in dialogue still to try to find a compromise.  The Deputy has his figures wrong.  It is not by any standard the largest Russian embassy in Europe and it will not be five times larger than it was.  In essence, we are seeking to build a protocol reception area with the necessary equipment, such as a kitchen, a storage facility and so on, and to install two new housing blocks.  The extension of the office space is quite insignificant.  The current building is 100 years old and it was designed for living in, not for office use.  It is just about working according to modern standards, if I can put it that way.<br/><br/>On the question about our staff, I do not want to comment on the very unfortunate and unwarranted episode in our relations, namely, the expulsion of a member of staff, which was severely mishandled by the Irish Government.  The Government knows my opinion on that.  It simply wanted to show solidarity with other countries in Europe without any due regard to our relations.  The moment has passed, although we do have some current visa programmes that may be relevant.  That is diplomatic life.  The complement of our staff is slightly lower because of these circumstances of personnel but it is not a big deal.<br/><br/>On the issue of the notification of the air authority, that takes time and the forces made a decision to relocate.  As a result, they had to redo all the paperwork from scratch.  They are doing that and it will take time.  As for whether it will involve air notification or only maritime notification, I do not know.That is not my job.  I am pretty sure they will do everything according to the law and to standard procedures.<br/><br/>We did not occupy Georgia.  The fact of the matter in 2008 was that we had a small peacekeeping contingent stationed in South Ossetia.  Unfortunately, the leader of Georgia at the time, Mikheil Saakashvili, probably thought he was almighty and could resolve the issues there.  The area dates back centuries.  Ossetia, north and south, has been back and forth in respect of Georgia and the Soviet Union redrew the borders.  It does not matter.  The only reason we have been there with our military personnel is to ensure the disengagement line between Georgia and South Ossetia.  Saakashvili made a decision to attack South Ossetia and, in the process, we lost a number of our servicemen.  The decision was made to answer that attack with force, which we did.  We did not go to Tbilisi, although, as military experts have noted, there was plenty of opportunity to do that.  We simply restored the <i>status quo</i>.  Politically speaking, we recognised South Ossetia because there was no way for it to return to Georgia after what had happened.  It was war that had been waged on them.  That was a clear oppression on the part of the Georgian Government, which led to the downfall of Saakashvili, if you take an internal political view in Georgia.<br/><br/>I do not have details on the previous time we conducted exercises in the vicinity of Ireland, although I can look into it and supply it to the committee later if that is desired.  This is not about sending a message.  It was not in the past and it is not now.  There can always be a first time, as they say, but there is nothing behind it.  There is no message, no harm and no trouble for Ireland.  It is not related to Ireland.  That is not to diminish the stature of Ireland within the world but is rather a reality of life.</p><p> On Covid-19 in Russia, we are a step behind because we were quite well during the December period of peak here, but now things are okay in Ireland and we are experiencing our peak with Omicron.  It has the same characteristics as here.  There are massive numbers with illness but it is a mild form.  There is not as much hospitalisation so the system is quite all right and capable of handling that.</p><p> That was a very nice try with the question on the political and economic system in Russia.  It is pretty much clear that it is in the eye of the beholder.  The way it is being portrayed is that it is a dictatorship by Vladimir Putin.  It is clear to me that the Russian people do not think so because they have voted for the president on numerous occasions, and have voted directly.  It is not the way, for example, people vote in the United States.  One will never ever discern what is really the count there and who won or lost.  That is their way of building democracy.  Ours is a direct vote.  We have always invited international observers.  People are free to watch.  We have an elaborate system of monitoring the elections and the voting procedure.  It is on the screen constantly.  I do not have any doubt that the outcome of the elections is the outcome that people want.  By that standard, and this is the only standard, it is democracy, no matter what people elsewhere think.  What matters is what Russians think.</p><p> Regarding the economic system, it is a market economy.  We had a period of more or less wild capitalism.  We have moved through the period of the early accumulation of capital, as Karl Marx put it, which took perhaps decades in the West.  We ran through that in a few years, leaving the country in a very poor state.  Now it is starting to level off.  The economy is working.  By the way, the Covid-19 pandemic showed the resilience of the economic system.  We moved through that with decent figures.  We did not have a huge downturn in domestic product.  Inflation is manageable and unemployment is more or less okay, so it is working.</p><p> On troops and satellite images, the only image I have seen is troops stationed in their garrison in Yelnya, which is in the Smolensk Oblast region.  It is very far away from the Ukrainian border.  It is the only image being printed over and over again in known newspapers.  They say in Langley that they have other images, but they do not show them.  That is my only comment.  I am of the opinion that it is being played out as an intelligence propaganda disinformation campaign, all combined with certain political purposes.  I am sorry that I was probably so mute in my initial statement because the Deputy asked what initiative was taken.  The initiative is that on 15 December we passed to the US and NATO draft agreements, texts of legally binding treaties on mutual guarantees of security in Europe.  That has been published.  The Deputy can read it in English on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, if he is meticulous about the diplomatic legal things.  That is our initiative.  It is based on the concept of indivisibility of security.  One simply cannot live in security if one's security is based on devoiding one's neighbour of security.  That creates instability.  That is a law of physics almost.  That is our initiative and let us hope it works.  That is our intention.</p></speech>

I am sure it is getting tiresome having to respond to so many of us.  I will try to get through this as quickly as I can.</p> <p>  Regarding Russia's relationship with Ireland, we would like to think that our countries would be friendly towards each other.  There are two issues that continually arise with respect to Russia and Ireland.  One is the ships that are regarded as spy ships off our west coast.  Does Russia have spy ships travelling up and down our west coast?  The other one is that, as friends, why would Russia's aircraft fly along our west coast with their transponders switched off?  Why would that happen?  I live in a housing estate and it is like me looking over the wall of a neighbour's house under cover of some sort to see what is going on.  One would not expect a friend to do that.  I am interested to hear the ambassador's comments on that.</p> <p>  I accept that there was a great deal of media coverage of the Russian exercise in the Atlantic and I accept that it is not an unusual occurrence.  All navies have exercises in the Atlantic, so there is nothing unusual about that.  However, the location was unusual and I regard it as a provocative move towards Europe more than a provocative move towards Ireland, given Ireland's inability from a defence point of view.  Many people in Ireland would have seen it as a provocative move.  Clearly, the ambassador's response to the fishermen is welcome and I am delighted Russia decided to move the exercise elsewhere.  Can he tell us precisely where it is likely to take place now?  Is it true that Russia informed the UK before Ireland was informed that the exercise was to take place?  I am interested to know that.</p> <p>  The ambassador spoke about Russia's friends in Belarus and about Russia being a peacekeeping force, a people who want the same freedoms as the rest of the world.  What steps has Russia taken to convince the Belarusian authorities that the detention of political prisoners is wrong?  What steps has it taken to try to convince those authorities to release them?  I hope I am not going too fast for the ambassador.</p> <p>  The ambassador says in his document that states have a right to choose their partners and their friends.  Why does it worry Russia so much that they choose to be friendly with NATO countries?  NATO is not in Ukraine at present, so why would that worry Russia?  With respect to the aerial photographs of the build-up we are seeing, if it is just normal everyday behaviour for the Russian Federation to have so many troops on the border with Ukraine, is the ambassador saying there is an equal number of troops on the borders with Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia?  If it has, it must have a massive entire force.</p> <p>  My colleague, Senator Wilson, raised the issue of Georgia.  Members of this committee have seen photographs of the area in Georgia that is now covered by Russia.  Prior to the occupation, which is what we believe it is, there were villages and farm buildings there.</p><p>There was every sign of people living there.  Now, it seems to be devoid of all buildings.  We are being told, and I would like the ambassador to explain this, that there is constant probing on the borders with Georgia now, which is to say, the enforced borders.  We are also being told that farmers and farming families have been separated from their lands and if they try to get back to their lands, they are arrested when they cross the border.</p><p> The ambassador says Russian troops are there in a peacekeeping role.  Has Russia stood idly and quietly by while whoever is in charge has destroyed buildings and razed entire villages to the ground?  Is he aware of that taking place?  If he is, who does he blame for it, if it is not a Russian takeover of that particular part of the country?</p><p> The last time I spoke to the ambassador about Crimea, he gave me a history lesson.  Perhaps he will give a history lesson to the entire committee about Russia's rights to be in Crimea.</p><p> Other than that, I wish we could see a de-escalation by all sides of what is going on right now because all it takes is one unforeseen act to drag all of us into some sort of conflict.  While my colleagues talk about neutral Ireland, I talk about militarily non-aligned Ireland.  There is a slight difference.  I do not want to see conflict and conflict does not take a whole lot.  I was around in the 1960s during the Cold War and anything could have happened at that time.  In the situation we are in now anything could happen again.  It only takes one person to do something wrong and the next thing, we have a war on our hands.  I thank the ambassador for being here.  I hope he will deal with those issues.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the ambassador's presence.  I was struck by a number of statements in his opening commentary.  He stated that he felt that his government saw no reason to invade Ukraine and in reply to Deputy Stanton, he spoke of the need to de-escalate.</p> <p>  I will raise three issues, the first of which relates to a domestic matter.  I was struck last week by some public commentary of a meeting that took place between the ambassador and the Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces.  Let me say that such meetings are commonplace.  The meeting in question was labelled a courtesy call, which again is perfectly normal.  What struck me, however, was a statement following the meeting.  I hope I am not misquoting anybody but the statement attributed to the Russian embassy in Dublin noted that the meeting discussed "prospects of contacts between [the] armed forces" of Ireland and Russia.  What might those prospects be?</p> <p>  The second issue relates specifically to what has happened since our meeting last year.  I do not wish to dwell on the situation in Belarus, and I acknowledge what the ambassador has said regarding the internal affairs of the country.  However, he has heard from Senator Ardagh and others of the importance of the relationship between Ireland and Belarus.  I direct the ambassador to the Ryanair flight that was forced down over Belarus on 23 May of last year.  Does he have a view on that?  Does he have any information he might like to share with the committee on the whereabouts of Mr. Roman Protasevich, the young reporter who was taken from the Ryanair flight and about whom we have heard little in recent times?</p> <p>  The final issue, which is the subject matter of our meeting, goes back to the points raised by Deputy Stanton.  How might matters now be de-escalated, having regard to the highly charged and tense situation within Europe?  These are issues that do not just pertain to Ukraine, however important those are.  We are dealing with issues that are central to the future of Europe, as I think the ambassador also indicated.  In recent times, I read a fascinating article by Vladimir Putin, dated 12 July 2021, in which he speaks in graphic and indeed comprehensive terms of the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians.  In the context of current developments, when he speaks about a family, a spiritual relationship and unity, it strikes me as extraordinary that Russia would amass tens of thousands of troops, heavy artillery and armed equipment of a quite threatening nature along the border and directed at members of its family.  Will the ambassador elaborate on the steps he would see as being appropriate towards a de-escalation, which I think we are all in agreement should take place?</p> <p>  The ambassador mentioned a list of issues that were presented by his government in December.  However, I have to say that these requests were actually demands that cannot be met.  I am struck by a statement by one of Russia's neighbours, the President of Finland, today.  Again, like Ireland, Finland is a militarily neutral country.  The President of Finland stated: "The list of demands presented by Russia in December aims at a fundamental change in the structures of European security."  He reminded governments in Europe and beyond that nobody can ignore the situation any longer and the demands of the Russian government are shaking the foundations of European security and have already been rejected.</p> <p>  In response to the ambassador's commentary that these requests, demands or requirements are still on the table, they are really not going to be met.  I wonder how at the same time we can advance issues of diplomacy.  We did not really get a chance to talk to any great extent about the Normandy talks and the Normandy format.  I believe there is a real opportunity to continue in that guise.  I am struck by a statement made last week on behalf of the Normandy group that there will be "unconditional observance of the cease fire [...] regardless of differences on other issues of the implementation of the Minsk agreements".  Is the ambassador in position, on behalf of his government, to guarantee this committee that the unconditional observance given in Normandy last week in the Normandy format will continue?  The group has not met this week but may meet next week.  By way of concluding comments, will the ambassador indicate how he would see matters being de-escalated, having regard to the fact that everybody in this room believes that is the only way forward?</p> <p>  Before the ambassador responds, I will invite Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile to contribute.  He is attending remotely and has been very patient.</p></speech>

In deference to him, my colleagues and the ambassador, I will keep my contribution brief.</p><p>I thank the ambassador for his engagement and his contributions at the committee.  Colleagues have outlined the importance that we place on Ireland's neutrality on the international stage.  We also place a great deal of importance and pride on our own process of conflict resolution, moving beyond conflict, and the peace process here in Ireland that we have benefited from.  In the context of all that has been said so far, does the ambassador believe that there is a position for Ireland, not least through our place on the UN Security Council, to play a proactive role in seeking to practically assist that process of de-escalation?  I welcome the opportunity to engage with the ambassador this evening.  I know that colleagues have put a whole range of questions to him, so I do not need to rehearse those.  Does the ambassador think that Ireland can do something through the UN Security Council to utilise our soft diplomatic power internationally, as well as our experience with peace-building and conflict resolution to practically assist the process of de-escalation?  I thank the Chair for allowing me in at the very end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Yuriy Filatov" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020200002#N00200"><p>There are no spy ships to the west of Ireland, as far as I know.  Maybe there are some that nobody knows of, but as far as I know, there is none.  We have covered the matter of the transponders a number of times already.  There are no military aircraft in Irish space.  Ireland has responsibility for a huge area of air traffic control.  For decades, there have been training flights by our military aircraft in that area.  That is always done under strict rules and procedures, designed to keep it safe with no hindrance to anyone.  I do not accept the analogy about peeking in at the neighbour.  There is nothing to be concerned out.  I do not think our exercises are provocative for Europe.  I will get back to the nature and scale of these exercises.  As far as I know, they were planned well before this period of tension.  If we were to send any signal to Europe, I do not think that would be it.  It could have been done in any other way, but not in this particular way.<br/><br/>Regarding the question of the UK before Ireland, I do not know.  There might be some procedure of air traffic control channels.  I am not particularly well aware of those.  One does not have to put much into that.  It is very much a technicality.<br/><br/>Regarding our friends in Belarus, we have been with them throughout the recent period of tension and turmoil.  It is a delicate thing.  Tempers flare and sometimes there are over-reactions.  We look at what happened in Kazakhstan recently.  I would not want that kind of thing in Belarus or elsewhere.  People have cut heads off police officers who tried to maintain some semblance of order.  We have done what we can under the circumstances.  There have been requests from the Government of Kazakhstan to the Collective Security Treaty Organization, which comprises Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia and Kirghizia.  We have a peacekeeping force which can be deployed efficiently to assist, within 24 hours.  We have been on the verge of that but there have been no requests from the Government of Belarus, which is an independent and sovereign state as much as Ukraine is, probably even more so under these circumstances.  There are many friends of ours in the world, not only Governments but elsewhere.  We maintain a close dialogue with them.<br/><br/>The matter regarding NATO in Ukraine is quite clear.  I agree with the Chairman.  The core issue of security is not about Ukraine <i>per se</i>.  It is one aspect, though it is a very vivid access.  If, for example, ground-to-ground missile sites of NATO are in the vicinity of Dnipropetrovsk, it is a range of just 500 km from Moscow.  The posture of NATO has been decidedly anti-Russian over recent years.  On top of that, there is the hostility of the Kyiv Government towards Russia.  This is a recipe for a real threat to our national security, which we cannot ignore.  We are trained to achieve results through dialogue and diplomacy.  The president has said that if it fails, then we will have to think about other measures to safeguard our own security.  I hope it will not come to that.<br/><br/>I do not think there has been any real change, as members might imagine from press reports, in the military posture in the western region of Russia.  This is striking to me.  I have seen just one photograph republished over and over again, of Yelnya.  Yelnya is a small town in the Smolensk region.  It is ridiculous.  It resembles the late Secretary Colin Powell.  I respect him as a gentleman, but he was often at the UN with a small vial of white powder, saying that it was a weapon of mass destruction.  The current situation resembles that.  Secretary Powell has been upstaged by US intelligence.  I hope the whole story now will not go in the same direction.</p><p>Senator Craughwell's information on Georgia resembles some news stories in the Tblisi newspapers.  They are not necessarily true.  I know he is a man of integrity but I ask him to take this stuff with a grain of salt.  There are no signs of life, proving constantly there is no military activity there whatsoever on the part of South Ossetian troops.  There is no reason for that.  I hope Georgians understand that too.<br/><br/>The question on Crimea requires a long time to answer.  I suggest we could meet specifically to discuss that matter.  I will try to respond in a few words.  Crimea has always been Russian and it always will be.  The only period of interruption was under the Soviet rule when nobody cared and Khruschev transferred the administrative command over Crimea from the Russian Federation to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  Nobody cared.  Come 1991, the Crimean people cared and, on the break-up of the Soviet Union, they wanted to go to Russia where they belong.  Unfortunately and tragically for them, nobody in Moscow listened to them.  Those in Kyiv made every effort to keep Crimea within the newly independent Ukraine.  There have been three referendums on the issue, all indicating that the will of the people in Crimea is to be with Russia.  In the end, the coup in 2014 provoked the people in Crimea to stand aside.  There had been no conflict there thanks to the Russian troops that were stationed in Crimea through all those years, under an agreement with the Ukrainians.  They essentially played the role of peacekeepers.  They made sure there was no intervention by the political parties in Crimea.  The referendum that was organised was legal and legitimate under the UN Charter.  The people voted overwhelmingly with no machine guns at their heads.  It was their initiative and a long-standing belief they demanded and deserved.  That was it.  This is a stand-alone subject.  We, as diplomats, are normally not allowed to show any emotion but I have relatives in Crimea and I know how it went through the years.  I know of the jubilation at that time all over the peninsula.  It was like spring.  It happened in spring and they called it the Crimean spring.  I do not want any people to insult the good-natured people in Crimea for their choice with all this political hoopla.<br/><br/>I was also asked about my meeting with General Clancy.  It has been played up in the media in a bad way, which is unfortunate and unwarranted.  I do not want to repeat anything.  There have been enough comments from the defence side and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Defence.  It is an absolutely normal diplomatic practice.  I asked for a courtesy call with the new chief of staff in November.  In a general sense, the more dialogue we have bilaterally the better because we understand each other better.  The Chairman made a point about military contacts.  Perhaps as a former Minister, he recalls there is an Irish contingent in the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria.  We were invited by the Syrian Government to bring Russian military police to the area and that has been the case for some time.  They co-operate and maintain a useful and important contact.  We touched on that point with General Clancy.  We certainly both said that should be continued because it is an important thing.  That is what we have in mind.  There are other things that do not relate to the military <i>per se</i>.  We have regular army games and some Irish servicemen participate.  I know a boxer from the Irish Defence Forces took a bronze medal in those games.  I do not know what is bad about that.  It is a good thing to build trust among servicemen.  <br/><br/>I was also asked about de-escalation.  The Chairman mentioned an article by the Russian President, unity and so on.  In the overall thrust of our position towards Ukraine, one simply cannot find anything pointing to any hostility on our side towards Ukrainians.  We are interested in stability and peace and, hopefully, a good neighbourly relationship with Ukraine.  That is for sure.  We have seen a lot of manipulation by some western powers in their accusations that Ukraine is stimulating nationalism, even radical nationalism.  There is a notion that Ukraine is anti-Russia.  That is a very unfortunate way of analysing the situation.  I believe those powers are simply using Ukraine as a tool to maintain some sort of instability on the Russian border and in that way putting political pressure on Russia.  That is our assessment of the intention of some people in Washington and beyond.<br/><br/>I agree that there was slight movement recently when the representatives of the political council within the Normandy format met in Paris under the initiative of France, and we welcomed that.  We took part in that.  It was good.  Ceasefire is good.  It is something Luhansk and Donestk tried to maintain for years.  There is always a chance of shelling.  We have supported the idea of disengagement, which would physically prevent this kind of stuff going on.  When forces disengage to the point of 30 km or 40 km, it is okay because artillery fire cannot reach the other side.  That was not the case for many years.  Some 13,000 people have died there, the majority of whom came from the civilian population of the Donestk and Luhansk regions.  Those fatalities were a result of shelling from the Ukrainian side.  That is a fact.  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, monitors who are there attest to that in their reports.<br/><br/>I was asked about the role of Ireland and there is a distinctive role it can play.</p><p>I hope it will be played by Ireland because of the real independent, in some ways, perspectives on international affairs and principles we share on the central role of the UN, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the preference for dialogue instead of guns and the peacekeeping experience Ireland has had.  All of that combines into a force for good.  I respectfully suggest that Ireland uses this right now to help this very important dialogue we have started.  The obvious way would be to tone down the rhetoric.  This is extremely important.  Every day you listen to reports and you see repeated statements by Josep Borrell, or the UK foreign minister, that tomorrow there will be destructive sanctions, we will crush Russia etc.  What point is made by that?  Do they want to frighten us?  They will not frighten us.  The only result of this is spoiling the atmosphere.  It makes it a little bit more difficult to proceed with the dialogue, that is the only result.  If Ireland, and I see some signs of this in the recent comments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others, I see there is a certain movement towards understanding the importance of the moment and the political side of things, not exchanging verbal shells, not about guns and munitions but about getting down to business at the table and negotiating.  We will not be going public with that, we will work hard but let us keep our fingers crossed.  </p></speech>

We do not need that today, but I suggest a written submission be made to the committee.  There is a humanitarian crisis in Yemen and also the situation in Ethiopia, so I would be interested to hear the views of Russia on those.  Amnesty International issued a very useful report yesterday dealing with the apartheid policies of Israel on the Palestinian people, and there are specific asks of the UN Security Council in that report, in terms of sanctions, arms embargoes, and the creation of the UN Special Assembly on Apartheid which was stood down.  There is a specific ask for that to be re-established.  I would be interested to hear Russia's views on some of those issues and a written submission would be useful to avoid prolonging the meeting here today.</p></speech>

Having regard to that we are grateful for the time he has spent with us and for his acceptance of our invitation to attend.  He will be aware, as we are, that we meet at a time of great uncertainty, a time of considerable instability in Europe.  He has listened to members of our committee who represent all parties in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann and some Independents.  While we differ over a range of issues he will have heard that we are united in our position as an all-party committee in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  He will have heard an expression of a unified voice for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  We leave him with that strong message, that he should use his undoubted influence - as indeed we saw last week - and his good offices in Moscow to take a message that de-escalation of current tensions and the pursuit of diplomacy is the only way forward at this time.  We thank him for being with us and look forward to further engagement.</p></speech>

I am joined by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement and eGovernment, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  The group comprises a significant number of Votes including: Vote 11 - Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions; the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department, including the Vote 14 - State Laboratory, Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service, Vote 18 - National Shared Services Office, and Vote 19 - the Office of the Ombudsman; Vote 15 - the Secret Service; Vote 39 - the Office of Government Procurement; and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer  The Minister of State is happy to address questions relating to the Office of Government Procurement and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, and I will respond to members' questions regarding the other Votes.</p> <p>  I understand that a detailed briefing has been supplied to the committee by my officials, who were assisted in this task by their colleagues in a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department.  Further material is also contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2022, which was prepared by my Department.  I also wish to take the opportunity to acknowledge last week's letter from the Chairman in respect of the joint committee&rsquo;s recent Report on the Processes and Procedures Applying to the Appointment of Senior Executives in the Public Service.  I will of course answer any questions members of the committee may wish to put to me on that issue.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has presented unprecedented challenges for us all.  I welcome the recent unwinding of Covid-19 measures and the opportunity to return to what is euphemistically referred to as normal life.  I would add that while this has been a long and difficult journey, I hope that we can now focus our entire efforts on improving the quality of life and living for our people.</p> <p>  In an overall context, the 2022 total gross allocation for the public expenditure and reform group of Votes, which comprises nine distinct Votes, has increased by 5% on the 2021 allocation.  The gross figure for 2022 is in excess of &euro;940 million compared to &euro;895 million in 2021.  This is largely driven by a significant increase in the estimate provision for Vote 18 and Vote 43, additional EU funding, targeted and minor increases for the delivery of essential services and additional recruitment, and the meeting of additional salary costs.  At this point, I will briefly outline the individual Votes in a little more detail.</p> <p>  Vote 11 relates to my Department, which continues to have a wide range of objectives across two strategic programmes, public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform, which support the two strategic goals of the Department.  These are: to manage public expenditure at sustainable levels in a planned, balanced and evidence-informed manner in support of Ireland&rsquo;s economic, social and climate goals; and to drive reform and innovation across the civil and public service to improve service delivery to the public and to enhance strategic policymaking and public governance structures.</p> <p>  The principal element of the 10% and &euro;4.6 million increased 2022 provision is in respect of technical assistance across the subheads that manage EU funding.  Most of the &euro;3.3 million increase in the EU subheads will be refunded directly to the Exchequer by the European Union into appropriations-in-aid.  The most significant changes to the subhead budgets are: the special EU programmes body funding has more than doubled to &euro;4.9 million following an increase in EU funding for the new programme cycle; &euro;1.7 million for technical assistance and the provision of additional auditors to ensure sufficient auditing resources to match the increase in EU programme funding; and &euro;1.4 million to cover the cost of a small number of extra posts, pay increases and an expectation of a reduction of vacancies at the Department.</p> <p>  Turning to the other Votes in the group, the provision for Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, accounts for three quarters of the public expenditure and reform group of Votes allocation and an overall 1% increase over the 2021 provision.  The estimate I am proposing today for Vote 12 involves a gross provision of &euro;707.6 million and primarily provides for pension and retirement lump sums for civil servants, including prison officers, and pension payments for dependents.  I note that this Vote required supplementary funding in 2021 of &euro;34 million, which was offset from appropriations-in-aid and gave rise to a technical supplementary estimate of &euro;1,000.  This was sought as a result of a higher number of retirements than expected and was approved by the D&aacute;il last year.  Year-to-year variation in expenditure on this Vote is primarily driven by the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose years of service, and grade and pay level, are variable and uncertain.  The increase in gross expenditure is mitigated by an increase in contributions from the single public service pension scheme.</p> <p>  Other bodies under the aegis of the Department, such as the Public Appointments Service, the National Shared Services Office and the State Laboratory, provide important services to large numbers of clients across the civil and public service.  The State Laboratory, Vote 14, is the Government&rsquo;s principal analytical chemistry laboratory and provides a comprehensive analytical and advisory service to Departments and Government offices.  A 3% increase to the State Laboratory&rsquo;s 2021 Estimate allows the laboratory to continue delivery on their mandate, meet increased pay and recruit additional staff.</p><p>The proposed funding provision for the Public Appointments Service - Vote 17 - is reduced by 4% in 2022.  This reflects the 57% reduction in capital cost requirements in 2022 given the anticipated mid-year conclusion of the refurbishment of the service's Chapter House office, and a 50% increase in payroll costs with an associated increase on current staffing levels.<br/><br/>Vote 18, the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, is the shared services provider for the Civil Service.  The office has played an important role in the reform of public services in recent years, through the delivery of human resources, HR, shared services and payroll shared services to clients across the Civil Service and public service.  The National Shared Services Office continues to be in growth and investment mode and will commence its delivery of new services for the whole of government this year.  This significant growth is reflected in the additional provision of &euro;11.9 million and a total provision of &euro;73.45 million in 2022, a 19% annual increase in funding.  The proposed increased provision in the NSSO's 2022 allocation will facilitate the continued delivery of HR and payroll shared services and enable the office to progress the roll-out of financial management shared services, which is scheduled to go online in the coming months.<br/><br/>The Estimate provision for the Office of the Ombudsman - Vote 19 - and the proposed modest 1% increase will enable its various constituent offices to manage their respective operations; fund the additional costs arising from the pay restoration and increased salary costs; facilitate a continued investment in ICT modernisation; and fund the establishment of the proposed new protected disclosures office.  I also welcome the appointment of Mr. Ger Deering to the position of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner and I have no doubt he will build upon the excellent contribution of the previous incumbent, Mr. Peter Tyndall.  I wish them both every future success.<br/><br/>The State procures goods and services valued in the region of &euro;8.5 billion annually.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP - Vote 39 - leads our procurement reform programme by providing advice, guidance and systems to promote better public procurement and build capacity and capability across the public service.  The proposed 2022 allocation of &euro;19.8 million provides for the cost of staffing as well as the costs associated with recruitment of senior positions, as recommended in the organisation review.  The 2022 provision will <i>inter alia</i>support the OGP in delivering value for money, quality goods and services in compliance with national and European law; develop procurement arrangements for the delivery of improved procurement capability in the public service, which will yield financial, performance and risk management benefits to the State; and further develop the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland, including the promotion of social and green environmental considerations.<br/><br/>The State cannot fall behind the productivity gains that 21st century technology is bringing to industry.  The Civil Service renewal strategy, Digital First, challenges the Civil Service to deliver 90% of applicable services that are consumed online via accessible, integrated and customer-driven solutions.  The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO - Vote 43 - drives the digital transformation agenda across government while providing and developing pan-public service ICT infrastructure, service delivery models and cross-government applications.  The widespread adoption of the full range of build to share services, delivered by a single organisation, will address, in large part, the relatively slow pace of digital transformation in government by freeing up Departments and bodies to focus on transformation initiatives rather than simply keeping the lights on.  The OGCIO benefits this year from a very significant 90% increase in its &euro;43.3 million Vote.  This funding is bolstered by a &euro;23 million EU allocation over two years in respect of the recovery and resilience programme, with some &euro;18.5 million invested in 2022.  It will deliver a network that enables all of our State bodies to reap the benefit of 5G technology.<br/><br/>I draw the Deputies' attention to some changes in the presentation of administrative subheads in 2022, which arise on foot of the new financial management service system being introduced in some Votes.  This change will bring consistency of approach and allow for better comparisons between Votes.  An implication of this is that in 2022 there is some discontinuity between 2021 and 2022 figures.  I am happy to provide further briefing on any points of detail Deputies may wish to raise in this regard.<br/><br/>I am very pleased to present the 2022 Estimates for the Public Expenditure and Reform group, approval of which will allow the individual Votes to continue to operate and meet their responsibilities to deliver essential services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and I are both happy to respond to any questions that members may put.</p></speech>

I believe committees work better when witnesses are able to attend in person for the over-and-back discussion.  While I understand that this is not always possible, now that we are moving towards asking people to work from their offices, it would be better, when possible, to have the witnesses and Ministers in the committee room for the debate.  It is unfortunate that is not the case today.</p> <p>  As the Minister is aware, there is a large amount of information in the Votes, so I have a lot of questions I will try to get through.  I will first focus on the report and letter sent by the committee to the Minister last week.  We now know, as of yesterday, that the salary of the Secretary General of the Department of Health is now &euro;298,000.  This is a mind-boggling sum for all those who are struggling to keep their houses warm and the lights on.  I want to ask about the &euro;81,000 pay increase.  The Minister and I have had many an over-and-back discussion on this matter and he knows my thoughts on it.  The Secretary General has indicated he has now accepted this increase.  Will the Minister confirm if the acceptance of this increase relates to this year only or if it relates to last year also?</p></speech>

I appeared before the committee on another matter shortly after the publication of that report and we had an initial discussion on it then.  I have now had an opportunity to consider the report in more detail.  It is a very detailed piece of work, with 288 pages and a significant number of recommendations.  Having considered the matter carefully, it is my intention, as Minister, to propose the establishment of an independent external review panel tasked with a number of key objectives.  One objective will be to make recommendations to strengthen the recruitment process for senior public service posts, including at the top of the Civil Service and a number of key public service posts, and also to make recommendations on the process of determining the terms and conditions of employment associated with such posts  I am happy to go into that in more detail and to take the Deputy's questions.</p> <p>  On the specific question raised by Deputy Farrell, the issue of gifting a portion of salary is very much a matter for individuals.  I am not privy to the details of individual Ministers or civil servants as to when gifting arrangements were put in place or ended.</p></speech>

Is the Minister saying he only discovered that this was no longer being gifted when it appeared in media reports?</p></speech>

Under the Taxes Consolidation Act, section 483 deals with the issue of gifting of salary on an annual basis.  The application is made to the Minister for Finance and it is applied for any purpose or it can go towards the costs of which any public moneys are provided.  In other words, the use of the proceeds is a matter for government.  Gifts are accepted by the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Arrangements are put in place by the relevant Department with which the person works.  The Minister is then notified accordingly.  I would not be notified of that and, therefore, I do not know the precise dates when gifting arrangements were put in place or ended.  There is information published in aggregate form every year, as I understand it, but the tax affairs of individual employees and Ministers remain a private matter.  This gifting arrangement is anchored in taxation legislation.  That is the answer to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I must say that the issue of the &euro;81,000 increase has caused absolute public outcry and outrage.  As I have said to the Minister before, the decision to grant that increase was completely out of touch.  People are struggling at the moment.  It was of interest that over the past two weeks, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, raised concerns about wage spiralling when the impact of inflation on the rise of the cost of living was put to them.  It seems those concerns will impact decisions on whether lower paid workers will see increases in their wages.  I recall that the Minister felt that the increase for the Secretary General position was necessary in order to ensure international competition for the job. I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, said last week that he was concerned that increasing wages would impact our competitiveness.  It is ironic.  It seems to me that the Government is only concerned about wage increases impacting competitiveness and wage spiralling when it comes to low-paid workers rather than those at the higher end - the elites who already have vast sums of money coming into their pockets each month.  It is different for the ordinary person who is struggling to put food on the table and keep the lights on.  What is the Minister's view on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#C00300"><p>The salary that was sanctioned in December 2020 was for the post of Secretary General in the Department of Health.  As the Deputy knows, there then followed an open competitive process which was administered by the Top-Level Appointments Committee and the Public Appointments Service.  There were a significant number of applicants, including a number of international candidates who put themselves forward.  I acknowledge that the joint committee, along with a number of members of the Committee of Public Accounts, conducted a significant amount of work over the course of last year and furnished a report in November making a series of recommendations for consideration.  I have given some consideration to those at this point.  We have a public service pay deal, Building Momentum, in place.  It involves, in essence, three 1% increases over a two-year period.  That pay deal will end at the end of the current year.  As the Deputy knows, for both the increases in October 2021 and October 2022, we built in a proviso that there would be a minimum increase for those who are at the lower end of the pay scales across the public service.</p></speech>

We are aware of that.  The point here specifically relates to that &euro;81,000 pay increase.  I must say it is concerning that there is no clarity out there as to whether the lack of a waiver of that &euro;81,000 applied last year as well as this year.  I am fully aware of the public service stability agreement and the situation around it.  The point here is that we have a situation where somebody is earning &euro;298,000.  I would be interested to hear if the Minister is concerned there will be further pay claims from other senior and top civil servants.  One Minister has said that the &euro;81,000 increase was fundamental and was needed to recruit somebody.  Nobody is suggesting the process was not correct.  We are talking about the &euro;81,000.  We are not suggesting that the person who is in place should not be in place.  The point is that we are seeing an &euro;81,000 increase for one particular role.  Does the Minister think that as a result of all this, there will be further pay claims from top civil servants who will argue they are just as fundamental as the person in the role of Secretary General of the Department of Health?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#C00700"><p>To be straight with the Deputy, as I always am, no such claims have been made.  Whether we like the position or not, it is the case that the gifting of a portion of a person's salary, which I am happy to do because I think it is the right thing to do, is a matter for each individual.  Our public servants and civil servants are entitled to gift a portion of their salary.  The question of when exactly it was put in place and when it ended is not information I have or to which I would be entitled.  In the first instance, an employee of a Department completes the form, which then goes through the process within that Department and is ultimately conveyed to the Department of Finance.  I do not have that information, nor do I intend to seek it from any individual because it is none of my business, quite frankly.  My role is to ensure we have a robust system for the recruitment and selection of people to fill key posts in the Civil Service and at senior levels across the public service.  I am determined to do that.  I am going to set up an independent review panel.  I anticipate it will be completely removed from my Department.  It will advise on the pay determination process.  I note the recommendation that the Deputy and her colleagues made about reinstituting the higher remuneration review body.  That is not a step I am taking now but I am going to ask the independent panel to make recommendations on what it thinks is the best course of action to arrive at decisions relating to senior pay in the Civil Service and across the public service.</p> <p>  I think we need to be careful what we wish for, as I said to the Deputy in November when I had an initial exchange with the committee.  The higher remuneration review body was stood down in 2009.  In 2007, as the Deputy knows, that body made recommendations that Secretaries General would receive pay as high as &euro;318,000, the Taoiseach would be paid &euro;330,000 and Ministers would be paid &euro;280,000.  If we, as an Oireachtas, absolve ourselves of responsibility and if I, as Minister, absolve myself of responsibility and completely hand over control of this matter to a third party body, we may not like the outcome.  That is something we must also consider.  I am not committing today to the establishment of the higher remuneration review body, which is what the Deputy has sought.  We need to think this through very carefully.  The external panel I am setting up will advise me in the coming months as to what it thinks is the best course of action.  I will take that advice on board and make a decision.</p></speech>

There is reference to an almost 40% increase in costs related to travel.  The increase is from &euro;185,000 to &euro;257,000.  We have seen reports in recent times relating to the recommendation of the Garda Commissioner that some Ministers require Garda drivers.  Can the Minister confirm if the increase relates in part to that?  If it does not, where is this additional spending reflected?  I am talking about the increase in costs related to travel from &euro;185,000 to &euro;257,000.</p></speech>

It is important to make that point.  Was the Deputy asking if the cost of Garda drivers was included?</p></speech>

This issue arose after Christmas and a decision was made following a security review that was carried out by the Garda Commissioner.  As a result of that, a decision was made that three senior Ministers, including me, would be assigned a Garda driver or close protection officer.  The cost of that is not explicitly provided for here.  It was a decision that was made subsequent to the budget and subsequent to me bringing forward the Revised Estimates volume in the House.</p></speech>

As I have questions on that as well, that is interesting.  Have the civilian drivers who were replaced due to reasons of national security, as the Minister said, been redeployed or made redundant?  As the new drivers will have replaced civilian drivers, I am interested in that.  I am also aware there were a number of complaints about the recruitment process for drivers.  The Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA, reviewed the recruitment process and deficiencies were identified.  Will the Minister confirm that none of the complainants were appointed as drivers at a later date?</p></speech>

At the moment it is a very small number of individuals, namely, a handful of people who were previously working for three Ministers up to the end of 2021 but whose services are no longer needed.  I expect we will come to a decision on that in the next couple of weeks.  We are examining whether there are any redeployment options.

As I said, this is an exceptional circumstance in that this is a change that was not anticipated.  Certainly, as a Minister who was directly impacted by the outcome of that security review it is not something I was expecting but it is a decision that was made.  We must deal with the fallout from that which is-----</p></speech>

As I am conscious there are many other speakers, I wish to ask quickly about the new protected disclosures office.  Will the Minister confirm how many staff will be working there, if there is an average rate of pay and what qualifications are required for appointment?</p> <p>  In addition, will we be incurring a fine for not meeting the transposition deadline for the whistleblowing directive and how much will it be if we are?  We received a &euro;2 million for our failure to enact the EU's fourth anti-money laundering directive.  Does the Minister think it could be around that figure or could it exceed it?</p></speech>

We have kept the European Commission informed of the progress of this Bill right the way through.  As she knows, we sent the general scheme and heads of Bill to the committee and it conducted pre-legislative scrutiny.  That took longer than I would have liked.  I think it took about seven months.  The transposition deadline for that Bill was in mid-December, so we have missed it but, as I said, we have kept the Commission informed all the way through.  As things stand Ireland is one of a relatively small number of countries that have an established protected disclosures regime.  We will be adding to, strengthening and improving that through the new Bill.  The new Bill has now been approved by Government.  It will be published in the coming days and I look forward to engaging with the Deputy, her colleagues and all Oireachtas Members in detail on the progression of that Bill.  I have carefully studied the recommendations from the committee.  Some of them we have directly taken on board and others we will consider on Committee Stage.  There may be some we cannot accommodate but that is an issue for the Oireachtas in the course of the progression of the Bill.  That includes her questions on the number of staff, the budget and so on.  Those are detailed operational issues we will come to in the course of considering the Bill.  I hope Second Stage of that Bill can start within the next couple of weeks or so.  I look forward to it.</p></speech>

Will he be coming forward to deal with all the recommendations and give us a clear response to the report?</p></speech>

I am happy to do that and respond in writing to the report.  While we are still considering some aspects of it I have come to a view as to what needs to be done in respect of the main recommendations.  I am happy to commit to writing to the committee with my response, including a response to each of the recommendations made.  What I am confirming today is a significant move.  It is the setting up of an independent panel outside the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will provide secretarial and technical assistance to support the work of the individuals who will be on that panel.  I need to get the balance of the composition of that panel right in relation to private sector background, as well as public sector background.</p> <p>  I want the panel to do its work as quickly as possible.  Quite substantive issues must be considered here, namely, the selection and recruitment of people to fill the most senior roles in our Civil Service and public service.  I have already given a commitment to a review of the Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  That will now be folded into this review.  This will be part of that work as well.  It will look at the composition of TLAC.  I am aware the committee made a recommendation that there be a majority of people from a public service background on TLAC.  I take a different view.  Currently, TLAC has a majority of people from outside the civil and public service, which is a better overall balance, especially when we are trying to attract more people from the private sector into the civil and public service.  There is also the issue of pay determination.  As I said, I am not accepting at this point the committee's recommendation to set up a higher remuneration review body because having looked over the history of this matter, there are issues that would need to be carefully thought through.  I will ask the independent panel to come back to me with a view on that.  I will then make a recommendation to Government on that issue.</p></speech>

Is he saying TLAC and the Public Appointments Service, PAS, will be part of the work of that independent group to look at how these bodies function?</p></speech>

It will be the subject of this review with respect to its composition, role and the processes there.  On the PAS, it provides a service across the public service and if certain bodies are seeking to fill a position, such as head of the HSE or another public body, the PAS would very often be involved in that process.  The whole recruitment and selection process for senior positions in the civil and public service will be involved in this review.  Thus, it will involve TLAC at a central level and PAS at a certain level because it has a much wider remit in supporting the filling of vacancies at all levels across the public service.  I am not suggesting we review all aspects of the PAS's work because it does very good work but-----</p></speech>

There is also the critical issue of pay that I touched on there.  I will consider the committee's recommendation on the review body but I do not want to go straight to that because there are issues we must weigh up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#D01800"><p>As a final point, I wish to put something on record.  I have done so numerous times but do so again as Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell has raised it.</p><p>The decision to increase the salary of a particular individual or position by &euro;81,000 was a disgraceful decision taken quietly in some back room in Government Buildings.  There was the addition of &euro;3,000 and then the increase yesterday bringing it to &euro;298,000.  I disagree with the Minister in respect of the gifting.  He stated it is a personal matter.  Actually, this particular position is so outside the norm in terms of salary that it should be ring-fenced and treated separately.  If a person got an increase of &euro;81,000 in 2021-22, I cannot see the logic of him getting two further increases in 2022.  Surely because the person got an increase of &euro;81,000, any other increases that were agreed for those at that level within the Civil Service who are paid less should be withheld from that position because of the special arrangements that were made.  As I stated, there was no memo of the Cabinet.  I do not know from where it originated because, in spite of the 288-page report, the Minister was probably the most forthcoming of all Ministers in terms of the explanation.  The Taoiseach, however, was not.  Mr. Watt was not.  He sent us a copy of the press release.  His behaviour since then has been utterly disgraceful.</p><p> I question the level of payment he is now receiving.  I believe it should be ring-fenced and the two increases we are discussing should not be added on to that increase of &euro;81,000.  The Minister stated the gifting is a personal matter.  I believe it is but, in this case, the gifting was done publicly by press release.  We do not know when it started or when it ended.  It seems to have been down to one person to make this decision while blatantly ignoring the Committee of Public Accounts and the finance committee, thereby giving licence to anybody else to just not turn up to a committee and not be held to account by us.  The manner in which the increase and the appointment happened leaves a lot to be desired.  It did a disservice to civil servants and the public service.</p><p> The Minister said there would be no knock-on effects.  I am not saying this is a knock-on effect, but I want to compare it.  I refer to report No. 42 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service, on which the Minister gave us a comprehensive response, in respect of senior managers within the HSE, many of them retired.  They now are being put through another process to get what they have already been approved for by the Labour Court, yet for one man in one position it is a completely different matter.  The public are absolutely outraged, and rightly so.  These special arrangements have to stop.  If this was a special arrangement - obviously, it was - there should be no further increases.  The Minister should be suggesting to the individual who holds this position that it is special and separate, over and above what is there already, and, therefore, the increase should be treated differently.  That is what I am suggesting.  There has to be fair play here.  I said the public are angry.  Members of the D&aacute;il were furious about the way this happened - not just the appointment and the increase, but the total disregard for parliamentary procedure by elected representatives and senior officials.  I believe I have to make those comments because I have said things publicly and I wish to place it again on record as Deputy Farrell has raised the matter, and rightly so.  I have made my views known.  If the Minister wishes to comment, that is fair enough.  If not, we can move on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#E00200"><p>I will, of course, comment.  As always, I greatly appreciate the honesty and frankness of the Chairman.  He has made his views known on the issue quite consistently in recent times.  However, as a Minister answering questions such as those being put to me, I have to set out the legal position and I cannot go beyond that.  The truth is that when it comes to the gifting of a salary, it is anchored in taxation legislation.  Every person is an individual taxpayer and has a right to privacy, so it is not for me to declare, even if I had the information, which I do not, when any individual started gifting or stopped gifting.  I simply do not have that information and I am not actually entitled to it.  I have to present the facts whether we like them or not.  I do not always like the facts either but I cannot change them nonetheless.</p> <p>  The Building Momentum agreement involves three single 1% increases.  The most recent increase on 1 February was structured around a sectoral bargaining process.  There are several sectoral bargaining units that are still involved in a negotiation and may well not use that allocation of funding for a flat 1% increase.  They may use it to resolve what they regard as outstanding issues.  I expect several of those will come to a conclusion in the coming weeks and some of them will result in the resolution of issues that have been knocking around for quite a long time.  That will be welcome.  As regards the Civil Service, the sectoral bargaining units that were established have opted for the flat 1% increase under Building Momentum.</p> <p>  To correct the record because I do not wish to give the wrong impression, I think I misquoted at least one figure in the context of some of the recommendations made by the higher remuneration review body in the past.  It recommended salaries of up to &euro;318,000 for Secretaries General, &euro;310,000 for the Taoiseach, &euro;270,000 for the T&aacute;naiste, &euro;240,000 for Ministers and up to &euro;270,000 for the heads of various colleges and universities.  These recommendations were made back in 2007.  I make those points by way of context.  We have to think very carefully about the next steps.  I am clear what the next step should be from my perspective and that is to have this independent panel, removed from the Department, have a fresh look at this area and make recommendations to me.  I will be happy to engage with the committee again on the matter.  I will be bringing recommendations to the Government in due course.</p></speech>

The Minister can say "No" to a recommendation.  He can say "No" to the &euro;81,000 increase.  He could provide the figure for himself.  I will not go any deeper into that.</p> <p>  To whom are Secretaries General responsible?  Who is the boss after the Secretary General?</p></speech>

Under the Public Service Management Act 1997, the division of responsibilities is clear.  The Secretary General has responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Department but, essentially, takes policy direction from the Minister.  The Minister sits at the top of the Department in the sense of setting policy.  The Secretary General, in essence, is responsible for executing and implementing that policy in line with the functions that are laid out under the 1997 Act.  That is the hierarchy.  The question of dismissing a Secretary General is one for the Government as a collective.  At the moment, under the Civil Service Regulation Acts we have a system whereby for grades up to but not including principal officer level, disciplinary action is a matter for the Secretary General.  For an assistant secretary or a Secretary General, it goes to the Minister and, ultimately, in the case of a Secretary General, to the Government.</p></speech>

I have always been of the view, however, that co-operating with the work of Oireachtas committees is important.  It is very important for Ministers and it is equally important for civil servants.</p><p>We have to be held accountable, for good or ill, for the decisions we make and the actions that we decide on.  I am not going to advise the Minister for Health what he should or should not do but co-operating with Oireachtas committees is an essential part of our democracy.

The State Laboratory is under the aegis of my Department.  It is our principal analytical chemistry laboratory and provides a comprehensive analytical and advisory service to the Government, Departments and offices.  Its main clients include the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Revenue, the Coroner Service and the Office of the State Pathologist.

Last year, the laboratory significantly exceeded its output target and issued 4,633 statements to assist the work of the courts, including coroners.  The target was 4,000.  That was due to the large increase in coroners' cases.  It also provided expert scientific advice in 455 instances to their clients.  That was below the target but mainly due to there being fewer requests for tariff clarification advice from Revenue than anticipated.  That was as a result of the pandemic.</p> <p>  The laboratory was considered an essential service right through Covid-19.  It remained open throughout the pandemic although the number of food and feed samples submitted for testing reverted to pre-pandemic levels following a slight reduction in 2020.  The number of customs and excise samples submitted overall reduced further as Revenue officials were doing fewer on-site inspections last year.  I gave the figure for the Coroner.  We are seeing a significant overall increase in activity in the work it does.</p></speech>

The general thrust is that the procurement system is slow in general and clumsy in that it is unable to act quickly.  Is that true?  Is it slow in comparison with similar agencies elsewhere?  How do we compete or compare?  Is there an intention to make any improvements or updates to address the criticisms that we have all heard from time to time?</p></speech>

It is essential that we have rapid procurement but that we also manage to get good value for money, that we obtain goods that are high quality and that we do so in a transparent way.  We have to comply with European procurement law, first.  Public procurement is all about fairness and giving everybody equal opportunity to compete.  That means we do need to advertise and keep the competition open for a certain period.  However, it should be done as quickly as possible within those constraints.  That particularly applies now because we are in a period of inflation.  If a procurement drags on for too long the price will have gone up and the requirements of the project may change over time.  The last two years has been a really unusual period in procurement because of the pandemic.  The normal rules of procurement were effectively suspended over the last two years.  In a period where we had to obtain PPE in a hurry, for example, or anything related to the pandemic such as software to manage the vaccination roll out, while we tried to run competitive tenders they did not have to fit with the normal rules of procurement.  We used whatever exemption clauses were available in an emergency.  The procurement rules allow that when you have a general threat to public health, and when there is some kind of life and death emergency, you can speed up the rules.  I meet every quarter with representatives of small businesses to ask them how they feel the procurement process is working for them and if they have any suggestions how it can be improved.  We look at all aspects including Covid and Brexit procurement, disruption, inflation and so on.  The issue of speed is not something that has arisen during that time.  However, if there is someone the Deputy is representing or he has specific suggestions or an example of a procurement process that went very slowly, I would be happy to investigate if he sends details to my office.</p></speech>

So there is a suggestion that it should be stored.  That is an IT system shortcoming.  We are in the process of obtaining a new e-tenders system.  The system for tendering, eTenders, is quite old at this stage.  We have been tendering for a new tendering system.  We are at an advanced stage on that.  I expect that will deliver a better experience, less cumbersome approach and a more up-to-date way of applying to bid for a Government contract.</p></speech>

I have a particular IT focus myself.  There was a lot of consultation with the people who take part in tenders to ask how they would like it to be done better.  Any suggestions for improvements were incorporated in the terms recommended for the new tendering system.  I think it will be something that is much faster and easier to use when applying for a contract.  I take the Deputy's point about it being cumbersome to apply and not very user-friendly.  I genuinely think that will be addressed in the new system.</p></speech>

In general, over the course of the Estimates process, we agree a budget for a particular Vote or area for the following year.  That involves detailed negotiation, initially at official level, going through all the various subheads and looking at the needs of that particular body or Department.  It is then negotiated at ministerial level and adopted as part of the budget, although it is fleshed out further if necessary in the Revised Estimates Volume for the year ahead.  That is what we do.  It is really a matter for the relevant Accounting Officer to properly account for the expenditure under his or her area of responsibility and ensure there is full compliance with the public spending code and value for money is secured at all times.  Those are some of the key pillars on which our expenditure management strategy is based.</p> <p>  Despite what people might think, we do not micromanage everything from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is extensive ongoing contact between my officials and the officials in relevant line Departments.  There are reporting requirements and channels used on an ongoing basis.  If any issue of concern came to our attention or was raised by my officials, we would intervene.  In general, however, it is a matter for the Accounting Officer of the relevant budget head to manage the expenditure, including on advertising.</p></speech>

It is not the preserve of any one Minister and it should be right across government and the public service.  The first point to make is we want to see ongoing reforms and new initiatives coming through all the time.</p> <p>  We co-ordinate this to an extent in my Department.  For example, we have set up a public service innovation fund and we reward the bodies coming forward with ideas that we believe will have real impact and significant potential.  We had a public service innovation week in November last year, which is one of a number of important initiatives that we facilitate under the implementation of the overall public service innovation strategy.  I firmly believe that innovation does not come from one document or us telling people they must innovate.  People need to identify solutions to problems we are facing and seek continuous improvement in the delivery of services for the general public.  A core objective in my Department is to ensure we have good quality public services over a period.</p> <p>  Innovation is a constant but I am happy to provide any information the Deputy needs on the innovation strategy.  I am also happy to provide examples of the projects we have funded under the public service innovation fund.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an mbeirt Air&iacute; as teacht anseo chun labhairt linn.  To begin with I will speak to a report and I commend my colleagues on the EU committee on the good and detailed report that was considered and developed a number of weeks ago.</p> <p>  It is startling how there are two classes of people in the country today, the insiders and the outsiders.  Most citizens have experienced approximately 31 separate price hikes over 2021 alone.  Farmers have experienced a tripling in the price of fertiliser and home energy costs have increased by 50%.  Inflation in November was at a 20-year high.  In real terms, the vast majority of citizens have seen their income and purchasing power reduced over the past 12 months.  These people have suffered in real terms.  The Government has refused to deal with that income reduction by postponing the increase in carbon tax.  It has refused to go to the EU to seek a VAT derogation on fuel, etc.  It has instead offered people approximately &euro;100 to deal with the staggering increases in the cost of living.</p> <p>  On the flip side there is another class of people, including a Secretary General who has seen an income increase of nearly 40% in the space of a year.  That income has gone from &euro;211,000 to &euro;298,000.  It would be a dream of most people in the country for that increase of almost &euro;90,000 to be their total income.  The report is quite clear that this was done and a figure was plucked out of the air without process or any international comparators.  The Government had no system that could be verifiable or comparable and which could be measured or challenged in any way.  The court of public opinion would see this as insiders very clearly looking after insiders.  Is the new salary of the Secretary General in question a benchmark for other salaries in the public service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#G00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will first comment on his earlier remarks and acknowledge that so many people across the country are really feeling the pressure of the inflation cycle we are currently experiencing.  It is higher than was envisaged and it is likely to remain higher for longer than anticipated.  In the budget last October, the forecast of the Department of Finance was that inflation would average approximately 2.2% across 2022 but it is now likely to be higher than that.  As we know from recent Central Statistics Office and EUROSTAT figures, it is well in excess of 5% in the most recent measurement.  That is a concern.</p> <p>  The Government responded in the budget, with the information we had at the time, with a package of well over &euro;1 billion on tax reductions, which many people across the House did not support.  It is one way of giving workers more money back in their pockets.  There were also targeted social welfare improvements.  Both measures amounted to well over &euro;1 billion, and many measures on the welfare side in particular were targeted, including the change that came into effect immediately on budget night extending the eligibility to the fuel allowance.  There were some very welcome changes to certain carer's allowances means tests and so on that had not been changed for well over a decade.</p> <p>  We made changes that will help but if the question is whether they go far enough, I believe we can never go far enough now given the current level of inflation.  We are conscious of it and it is why we are bringing forward the electricity credit of &euro;113.50, including VAT.  We will continue to keep that under review because we know people are feeling pressure now.  The issue is actively being examined and kept under review.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about a report and I acknowledge the work that went into it, as well as its findings.  The Deputy will have heard what I said earlier by way of action points that I am instituting as Minister, having considered the issues.  I relayed some background on this a year ago when I came before this committee on the matter.  There was a failed attempt to recruit a chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive in 2018 and the process had to be aborted because it was not possible to get a candidate.  The salary at the time was over &euro;300,000.</p><p>As the Deputy knows, it ended up being increased further for the present incumbent who successfully came through the process.  On the question of it becoming a reference point, I do not believe this is the case, nor have I seen evidence of it across the Civil Service or public service over the past 12 months.  I do not view it as a reference point.  A decision was taken given there was a vacancy in the Department at a time of national crisis.  The previous Minister and then Secretary General departed the Department of Health on the same day.  In the summer of 2020 there was a leadership vacuum.  There was no easy way to fill it or address it.  The view was arrived at that we wanted to go to the market to get the best candidate who put himself or herself forward.  It was agreed there would be an increased salary for the position of Secretary General in the Department of Health.  We know what happened subsequently.  We had the open competitive process.  Some months later an appointment was made.  It is important to make these points by way of context.</p></speech>

The Minister said he could never go far enough but he did go far enough for Robert Watt and his wage.  It is very interesting and quite startling that he said this will not form a benchmark or a reference point for other salaries in the public service.  What he is saying is that the figure is not part of any process.  He is saying it is independent of any system or reference point and it is a personal deal.  The Minister is saying it is not possible to use this as a benchmark in future.  He is saying that if people argue their salary should be 90% of this salary he will not agree because this is a personal deal with a particular individual in a particular role that is insulated and isolated from the role of everybody else in the Civil Service.  By doing this he is simply underlining and reinforcing the whole point the committee has made that this is an individual wage for an individual person.</p></speech>

This was a decision made on the salary for a post.  That post is the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  That decision was made.  The post went to an open public competition advertised in Ireland and internationally.  The selection of the successful candidate was recommended by the Top Level Appointments Committee.  I do not think the Deputy should call into question the character or good name of the people involved in the process.</p></speech>

I am sure the Chair will give the Deputy loads of time to respond.  When it comes to the question of the case being made by others that this is the benchmark or anchor for future public pay policy, people make cases all the time for pay increases.  Pay claims come in constantly.  I ask the Deputy to point to an example where the salary associated with this post has led to wage inflation elsewhere in the system.</p></speech>

We have four tiers or levels of Secretaries General.  It is an issue I will examine in drawing up the terms of reference for the independent review panel.  There is merit in looking at the respective tiers.  We have had significant transfer of functions in recent years.  We need to have a fresh look at this whole area.  It is not about bringing anyone up to a certain level or to have a benchmark we are working towards.  This is not my mindset.  I assure the Deputy that anyone making the case he or she should get an increase in pay because of the post of the Secretary General in the Department of Health will not get a good audience from me.</p></speech>

I will not ask an independent review panel to examine figures and make recommendations to me on pay levels.  This is not what this is about; what it is about is examining the process.  It can make recommendations.  The Deputy and his colleagues have already made a recommendation that we would set up a higher remuneration review body.  I am not clear whether the Deputy's intention is that such a body would decide on pay and, therefore, that the legislation underpinning the power I or future incumbents in this role have to make a decision would be removed and given to an independent body outside of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy might wish to provide clarity on this.  Is he saying that such a body would make a recommendation to the Minister?  Under the law it is the Minister who makes the decision.</p></speech>

They relate to each other.  They are not independent of each other.  In answer to the question I asked on this particular salary the Minister said this particular salary is fully independent and isolated from all other salaries and will not be used as a benchmark or a tool by anybody to look for salary increase in future.  This underlines and reiterates the points in the report and the public concern about this.  This salary debacle was independent of any process or system and independent of other people's salaries.</p></speech>

This is certainly the basis on which I operate and run my Department.  It is in a spirit of collaboration.

The leadership of the Department of Health and the leadership of the HSE have a deadly serious job of work to do now to fix that and to support those families in any way they can.  However, linking that to a reduction in someone's salary is just not-----</p></speech>

The Minister for Health convened the meeting and explained to those present, including me, the Taoiseach and the Secretary General to the Government, that there was a need to appoint a Secretary General to the Department of Health.

Did the Minister, in his role, question that figure?  Did he ask why it was not &euro;51,000 or &euro;101,000 as opposed to &euro;81,000?  Was he happy, on the basis of the information that was brought to his attention, that &euro;81,000 was a fair increase to be sought for this position in the context he has outlined?</p></speech>

There is no point in just firing questions at me and not allowing me the scope to answer them.  There was a very open and frank discussion at the meeting to which I referred a moment ago.  I believe the minutes of that meeting were provided to the committee and have been published.  A number of options were looked at at that time as to how the issue could be faced up to.  We were dealing with a global pandemic.  The Department of Health was under enormous strain and there was a leadership vacuum there.  Somebody was acting up and doing the very best they could, but there was a need for a permanent appointment.  The collective view arrived at was that in order to attract a top-quality candidate, there would be a need to go beyond the normal terms.  We discussed previous examples of that and the history of it.  As I said earlier, there was, in 2018, a failed attempt to recruit a CEO for the HSE on a salary that, I think, exceeded &euro;300,000.  That was the reality.  One of the options that was looked at was whether anyone from among all the existing Secretaries General would be interested in going into the role on a permanent basis.  In the round, however, the collective view was that an enhanced package was warranted and that there should be an open, public competition.  I was particularly keen, especially if we were to offer an enhanced package, that everyone should be given an opportunity to apply for the position.  That is subsequently what happened when that process took place in the subsequent months.  There was a lot of interest in the role, as one would expect, including a number of international candidates.  The candidates selected came through the top-level appointments committee process and through a number of interviews, and the Minister for Health was offered one name out of that process.  He then brought that name to the Government for approval.</p></speech>

I have asked him two questions so far, neither of which have been answered.  I wish to make that point.</p> <p>  As for the rationale the Minister and some of his colleagues have given for approving this salary level, the first, which the Taoiseach outlined no later than an hour or so ago when I raised this with him in the D&aacute;il, was that the Department of Health and our health services are in need of substantial reform and improvement and, therefore, the person at the helm would want a significant salary package.  Does the Minister agree with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.566" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#J01600"><p>I agree about the centrality of the role of the Department of Health, not just during a global pandemic.  Of course, there will be an aftermath, a legacy and consequences of the pandemic.  Unfortunately, the immediate consequence is increased waiting lists.  The person sitting at the top of the Department of Health, working with the HSE, will be instrumental in meeting the Government policy objectives, one of which is to have a fit-for-purpose, single-tier health service and to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have provided a record budget, as the Deputy will know, of over &euro;22 billion to make progress in that regard.  There is an enormous body of complex, challenging, difficult work that needs to be done in the Department of Health to improve the Irish health service, and I and my colleagues across the Government regard that as a key priority in the coming years.</p></speech>

Is there a mechanism in place that would allow for a reduction in the salary of the Secretary General?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#J01800"><p>I do not have the contract with me, but I imagine, in the absence of a renegotiation of a contract, that that is very unlikely.  As I said, I do not have the contract here.  I cannot give the Deputy a definitive answer to that question, but a provision in a contract providing for a downward revision for a Civil Service appointment I would regard as unlikely.  However, I would have to check that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#J01900"><p>I agree with the Minister on that.  A substantial salary package - the highest ever awarded to an Irish civil servant and, in fact, one of the highest packages available to any civil servant in the world - is attributed to a position on the basis of the importance of the job the holder of that position has to do.  The Minister mentioned the policy objectives: the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, reform of the health services, addressing waiting lists and dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic.  Nevertheless, the Secretary General could fail in all those respects.  He or she could oversee growing waiting lists, continued mismanagement and a move from one fiasco to another in the health services, but the Secretary General's salary would continue to grow and his or her pension entitlements would continue to be locked in regardless.  Does the Minister see that as a failure of the contract that was put in place for this position in that it undermines the credibility of the argument the Government has put forward?</p></speech>

The responsibilities of the Secretary General are clear under the legislation.  It is about day-to-day management of responsibility, while the Minister has overall policy responsibility and makes decisions in respect of policy.  The relevant Minister in each Department must ensure that there is adequate performance measurement.  I have such a process in place and I have no doubt every other Minister does too.  It is important, when we are agreeing on the plan for the Department for the year ahead, that we clearly define the goals and milestones and what we expect to be achieved.  The removal of a Secretary General is a matter for the Government, although it is not something that is countenanced lightly, as would be expected.</p></speech>

Is that something the Minister agreed with as part of the rationale?</p></speech>

When a post is advertised in open competition, we never know who will apply.  For a position of that importance for the State, we certainly want the best people in the world to apply.  Having a revised salary was certainly an attraction for people to apply.  A number of international candidates applied to the process and, ultimately, the members of the Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, conducted the interviews with the support of the Public Appointments Service and arrived at a single name.  One name was provided to the Minister for Health and he brought it to the Government.  It is up to TLAC to provide up to three names.  In my case, for example, as Deputies will be aware, I decided on an open competition for a successor appointment in my Department and I was given three names by TLAC following that open competition process.   It was then a matter for me to consider the options and to bring one name to the Government, and that is what I did.</p></speech>

They committed &euro;81,000 of taxpayers' money to get the best in the world, and, lo and behold, the best in the world was here all along.  In fact, he was actually in the Minister's Department, which is responsible for the prudent management of public finances, all along.  Did nobody think of asking Mr. Watt whether he would be willing to take on the role permanently at his existing salary?  Was that question ever asked?</p></speech>

In filling the post, the decision was made to hold an open competition.  When there is an open competition, the Minister no longer has control of the outcome.  He or she must trust, quite rightly in my view, the integrity, competence and professionalism of the people involved in the selection process.  We are fortunate to have really good people serving on TLAC.  They are given a mandate and they go about their work.  They went about their work, narrowed down the applicants, interviewed a range of candidates and made a recommendation to the Minister for Health.  That was the outcome-----</p></speech>

I am not sure how any business person could consider himself or herself as such after that.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that, on top of the &euro;81,000 pay rise that has been discussed, the Secretary General of the Department of Health got a subsequent increase, in November, of almost &euro;3,000.  He got a further increase of &euro;3,000 yesterday.  Did the Minister sign off on, or have any role in agreeing to, those two wage hikes?</p></speech>

It applied last year and again applies this year.  As part of that, there are three separate 1% pay increases, in October of last year and February and October of this year.  The February increase, which has just occurred, is slightly different for some public servants because we offered an opportunity to form a sectoral bargaining unit.  Instead of using the money for a flat 1% increase, it could be used to settle outstanding grievances.  A number of sectoral bargaining units are continuing to negotiate in that context and I expect that will conclude in the coming weeks.  In the Civil Service, none of the sectoral bargaining units decided to use the envelope for anything other than a flat 1% increase, so that has been applied in accordance with the circular that issued to implement this element of the pay deal.</p></speech>

Did it not strike anyone as sensible to ensure, contractually, that these pay hikes would not be applicable to this position given its unique and bizarre nature and the fact we had already, through the Minister's good offices, approved an &euro;81,000 pay hike?  Did nobody say the position did not need a further &euro;9,000 within a 12-month period from November of last year?</p></speech>

The employees are represented by the unions, which are affiliated to ICTU.  What is negotiated is a collective agreement that applies to everyone who comes under it across the public service and the Civil Service.  What is not done in a collective, national agreement that covers about 360,000 people is to seek to carve out one cohort, or perhaps the Deputy is suggesting one individual.  That is not the way a collective agreement for public service pay is negotiated.</p></speech>

The Minister was asked earlier about the position of waiving salaries and he mentioned that I, as a Deputy, will get an increase at some stage this year.  I will waive it, in the same way the Minister does in respect of a portion of his salary.  He said something that I thought was strange.  He stated it was none of his business whether people waive a portion of their salary.  Am I not correct in stating that when anybody within the public sector waives a portion of his or her salary, that goes back to the Exchequer to be spent on other areas?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in stating the money I give back every year, and that which the Deputy and others give back, comes into the central Exchequer and is used accordingly for all the purposes for which we spend public money.  My point was that the mechanism for waiving the money, or actually gifting it back to the Exchequer, is through the Taxes Consolidation Act; it is anchored in taxation legislation.</p><p>It is a fundamental tenet of our tax system that people do have a right to privacy, so I do not have a right to know how much an individual is gifting back every year.  People can make a voluntary declaration if they so wish.  On the other hand, they do not have to.  I am just outlining what the factual position is.</p></speech>

I do not get a report on it.  It is not the case that I am sitting on information that I am not prepared to give to the Deputy.

The Government press office and the press office of the Department of Health issued a statement on the day of Mr. Watt&rsquo;s appointment as permanent Secretary General in the Department of Health.  The statement that was issued through a public body stated that Mr. Watt was delighted to take up the position and that he was waiving the increased portion of his salary for an unspecified amount of time.  This is my final question in this regard.  Does the Minister think it would be helpful in the interests of transparency and accountability if Mr. Watt were to outline in a public fashion the period of time he waived that portion of his salary?</p></speech>

I do not want to get into the space of calling on someone to do anything.  I am a Minister and I have legal responsibilities in regard to the functions I have to discharge in the Department.  I always believe in being as open and transparent as possible.  I, as a Minister, and senior civil servants are accountable.  We are accountable to relevant Oireachtas committees.  As the Chairman acknowledged, I co-operated fully with the work this committee did and with the Committee of Public Accounts.  A year ago, today, I appeared before the committee on this issue and I also provided as much documentation as I had regarding it.  What I cannot do is go beyond the legal parameters.  It is very much a matter for each individual.  I am happy to declare I have made a substantial gifting of salary.  I am happy to do so, but I am not going to call on anybody else to declare what their own personal intentions are in that regard.</p></speech>

The salary for that particular post has not been increased.  We went through a process with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and NewERA on this.  Because it is a commercial State body, my own role as Minister in this regard is to give consent or choose not to give consent to a salary level that is being proposed by the Minister.  There was contact over a number of months between the two Departments.  My Department requested further information from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to it.  We would have requested a business case.  A business case was prepared and assessed by NewERA and it recommended the salary level that ultimately was agreed upon.  It fell to me then as Minister to give consent, which I did.  In that particular case the level of salary was at the same level as the previous incumbent in that post.</p></speech>

We have already held one round of public consultation and we had more than 1,200 submissions, so there is a huge amount of interest in it.  In the coming months I hope to bring proposals to the Government for legislation to reform, modernise and update our freedom of information system.  The FOI unit within my Department does not process FOI requests that go to all of the Government, it only deals with the ones that come to the Department.  It also provides support and policy advice at a central level to all of the other FOI officers that are across the system.  It is important to be clear on what we do.  We do manage and have responsibility for the overall policy on FOI, but the FOI office in my Department only deals with the freedom of information requests that come in to us.</p></speech>

I am talking about the policy itself.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about the review that is ongoing.  In a bid to be helpful, my own party colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, has published legislation in this regard.  I understand it is being brought to the D&aacute;il tomorrow evening.

It proposes to publish the names of certain individual recipients of pensions, but the way it is drafted copper-fastens the existing position.  I do not believe we should vote against the Bill, as I understand where it is coming from but the comprehensive Bill that we are preparing will be the best vehicle to bring about the reforms that are needed to the freedom of information system.  We will have the proposals finalised in the coming months.</p><p>Is it not a pattern though that when legislative proposals for reform are being brought, Government either rejects them, nods them through with no intention of proceeding or, in this instance, puts forward a timing amendment to kick it down the road?</p></speech>

In the weeks ahead, for example, I will be going through a detailed legislative process with Deputy Farrell and others on the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2021.  I am open to amending that Bill.  I am open to accepting Opposition amendments.  I am not precious about these things at all.  I am very pragmatic.  If I believe a Bill moves things on in a positive way, I will embrace it.</p> <p>  We did, however, examine the Bill to which the Deputy referred and it does not do what it sets out to do; let us just say that much.  It would require an enormous volume of work and that is work we are doing anyway in the context of our own Bill.  I felt it was a much more efficient and better use of our resources to work on the Government Bill.  If there are amendments, as I said, I will certainly consider them on their merits, wherever they come from.</p></speech>

There have been a number of high-profile incidents where Ministers, in particular, have not been following the guidelines set out in the Freedom of Information Act 2014, particularly with regard to backchannels of communication or the deletion of private messages.</p> <p>  The Minister's Department sets guidance that I believe dates back to 2015, which states that public bodies must advise individuals when a "person who without lawful excuse and intention to deceive destroys or materially alters a record".  Do those requirements and provisions apply to Ministers and their special advisers?</p></speech>

I am aware of one of the provisions in the Private Members' Bill to which the Deputy refers that provides for a referral to SIPO.  One of the issues that arose when we examined that was it was not clear what SIPO would do with that or what powers it currently has.  That issue could not just be dealt with amending the freedom of information legislation.  One would also need to look at the accompanying ethics legislation and the legislation underpinning the workings of SIPO.  That just gives an example of the complexity of it.  Certainly, to my knowledge, no one is exempt from the requirement that a person should not destroy records to deliberately avoid FOI requests.</p></speech>

The salary that was sanctioned did not represent an increase relative to the person who previously held that position.  I assume that is where that article got the figure from.

I am raising this to clarify the issue.  Deputy Carthy brought it up in his first question.  The article goes on to state, "The contract also said a car allowance of &euro;13,150 along with reasonable mileage would be paid to the new chief executive."  It would appear that at some stage, this increase was sanctioned and that an allowance for a car and mileage was also sanctioned.  It was for the person taking up the office of chief executive.  There was, therefore, an increase.</p></speech>

Certainly, the information at my disposal was that the salary for the incumbent CEO of HRI at that time was the figure that has been quoted of a little over &euro;190,000.  I will examine that and read the article to which the Chairman refers.</p></speech>

I do not know whether that is true or false.  I do not know whether Government sanctions that.  It is just to make sure from the Minister's perspective and the work of this committee that whatever information is out there is correct or is misleading.</p></speech>

Is it true that some car company sponsors the car?  I do not know that.  I am asking because we are asked as we go about our business in our constituencies.  The Minister might come back on that.</p> <p>  He mentioned collective agreements.  We could call the pay increase for school secretaries a collective agreement.  Presumably, it had to be cleared by the Minister's Department.  That has not been paid yet.  Is that being held up by the Department?  Is it in the process of approval?  Where is it at?  If he does not have the answer, he can come back to me.</p></speech>

I will certainly check it out once again and come back to the Chairman.  With regard to the provision of a car to the CEO of the HSE, my understanding is that was consistent with the package that was agreed in 2019.</p><p>We will drop the Chairman a note on that although it is primarily a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></speech>

I believe that there was a hearing in the past week, ten days or so.  There is a further outstanding issue in relation to pay or pay during periods of leave.  I will seek an update on that from my officials and from the Department of Education but I am anxious to have that issue resolved.  We all hold in high regard the work of our school secretaries and, indeed, our caretakers.  I will follow-up on that and see what the current state of play is, but that is my understanding of where it currently stands.  It has been before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and there is now that outstanding issue that needs to be resolved.</p></speech>

Each of us would be aware of the amount of money that can be spent or racked up by legal firms in relation to the Department defending a case or other.  For example, the victims of Thalidomide have their 25th Minister for Health in the course of all of this issue being debated publicly and in their efforts to seek a solution, and it is tied up in court.  I wonder on issues like that if there are specific procurement rules with which each Department must comply with regarding the appointment of legal representatives and who keeps control on them.  Who says, for example, in the middle of the debate around the Thalidomide issue, "That is enough, because we will spend too much on legal fees, and let us reach an agreement"?  Is there any common sense applied as it goes along?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.640" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#N00500"><p>For a start, the question is, does one have to use the frameworks for legal services or do Departments have to use the centrally agreed arrangements.  It is Government policy - it is a decision of Government - that all divisions of Government need to use the available arrangements where they apply.</p> <p>  There are frameworks for legal services.  There are some that are specialist and niche covering particular areas and then there are general frameworks.  One is meant to draw on those unless there are exceptional circumstances where one can show why one should not use them.</p> <p>  I think the Chairman's specific question is, is it possible to negotiate outside of that to get better terms.  Is that what the Chairman is asking, where there is a particular circumstance that this would apply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#N00600"><p>No.  Where one enters into a procurement process, one has one's legal team representing one and the case drags on.  Is there any way within that procurement process where somebody can step in and say that one has racked up huge amounts of money here in terms of costs and fees and what one should be doing is finding a resolution to the problem?  At what stage in the procurement process can one call a halt to what is going on and negotiate the outcome rather than be on the steps of the court?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.642" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#N00700"><p>It is sensible always to use arbitration options where they are available.  One cannot opt out of the legal process.  If somebody wants to take one to court, he or she can.  It is not always clear who is to blame in those cases when there are two parties and one cannot dismiss somebody, for example, as a candidate for a bid, because we have spent so much money on legal services or because we are having a fractious relationship.  I agree that where a negotiated or arbitrated form of decision or arrangement can be made, the courts should always be avoided.  That is usually the case.  Most people avoid litigation where they can.</p> <p>  There is a commercial skills academy which is provided by the Office of Government Procurement to train up procurement officers across the public sector so that they will have the skills to be able to carry out the negotiations that are required on large public sector contracts.  Of course, the goal is always to avoid the legal option.</p> <p>  Where there is a protracted legal dispute, it is not always clear who is to blame, who is in the right and who is in the wrong on that case.  It is important that our procurement staff are properly trained up.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that it has all gone wrong.  Was it that the procurement process itself was weak, was it that the contracts are weak, or what has caused not only that problem but others across the various Departments?  Is the Minister of State examining that because some paperwork within all of this process has failed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#N00900"><p>When one has a procurement that ends up in protracted litigation, that certainly is a bad outcome.  It is an expensive outcome for all sides and it is not something that anybody wants.  When that happens, it is important to examine, carry out an inquiry and find out what is the cause of that.  I guess that is why the report on the children's hospital was commissioned to see how things could be done differently.  I do not want to comment on that particular case but the Chairman has extended it to the more general case.</p> <p>  When people end up in litigation when they are in a contract with each other, it often comes down to a failure to disambiguate the terms at the start of the process and to make sure that people are not at cross purposes over what services or goods will be delivered and when, and that the contract is fully disambiguated as well.  I guess there is a learning for the Government and there is a learning for State agencies, and there is a learning as well for people who are bidding for contracts, in that.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked me what has been done to avoid that.  The commercial skills academy is an important part of that.  It is important that the specification of our projects in future is carefully done.  We have a number of new structures that have been put in place in the past couple of years to monitor very large procurement projects.  It has been a particular interest of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, to make sure that the very large projects that are included in the national development plan have monitoring processes in place to keep track of those projects and to make sure they are on track and that they do not drift off and move into protracted litigation.</p></speech>

Are there Departments or agencies that are particularly bad at using the system?  Is there a monitoring role in the Department to show up these weaknesses?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General goes in and compiles a report to see what proportion of contracts are non-compliant or non-competitive.  Sometimes it is possible to have a non-competitive contract which is compliant.  There are cases where a competition is not warranted and the contract is still in compliance with the law.  For example, if there is only one person who can offer that particular service, then there will not be a competition.  The result of that is the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes that report and it goes to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If one wants to compare across the different Departments and agencies, one can see who has the highest level of non-competitive contracts or non-compliant contracts.  I suppose that provides an opportunity for Oireachtas committees, such as this one, to invite in the Accounting Officer to ask why he or she is not complying or is purchasing goods and service for his or her Department without going through a competitive process.</p></speech>

They do not hold them anymore, because a bigger firm has gotten it.  They may be used as part of the delivery chain.  What words of comfort does the Minister of State have for the SME sector?</p></speech>

We have done a lot of work with the SME representative bodies to make sure that they are included in these contracts, that they are fairly treated and that they are not pushed out by larger, better-resourced organisations that might then deliver a worse service to Government.  We are therefore keen that we get small firms that successfully tender for business.  The majority of the spend on public procurement in Ireland goes to SMEs.  Most of it goes to companies that are situated within Ireland.</p> <p>  I regularly meet with representatives and I ask them what changes they would like to see in the procurement framework and in the way that we do our procurement.  They come to me with specific problems.  Over the last year, they have come to me with questions about inflation, professional indemnity insurance, Brexit, emergency procurement during Covid-19 and how they can bring contracts, for example, during the pandemic.  I meet with people who represent all of the different sectors.  For example, the Construction Industry Federation is there, as is the Small Firms Association, ISME and IBEC.  We have a co-operative relationship.  I am rarely unable to help them in their requests.  We work together to make sure that Irish companies get a fair share of the pie and they can competitively obtain contracts.</p> <p>  One of the things that I particularly want to do is to make sure that smaller, high-tech companies can win contracts for software services in Ireland.  This is because many of the most innovative companies tend to be fairly small.  We managed during the pandemic to award contracts in an emergency process to smaller companies.  We are looking at, for example, the strategic platforms for innovation and research in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and seeing if within that mechanism we can include more smaller high-tech companies in Government contracts.</p></speech>

He mentioned a further Act of 1997.  We would welcome any background materials that he might have regarding those Acts, how they were changed or how the Minister might like to see them changed or reformed in the future.  This is because most of what we are talking about goes back to accountability and responsibility.  It is time that many of those Acts, as well as other amending Acts, were taken and examined in the context of modern HR management and of the responsibilities of senior people within any organisation, just as we are doing with the senior executive accountability regime and the banks.  Of course, it is always a point of interest for me that I clock in every day that I come up here.  Does the Minister think that the Secretaries General should clock in, the same as everyone else, or are they an exempt breed?</p></speech>

It takes no account of the work we do elsewhere.  As part of reform, Members of the House do not like to talk about it, because the media gets upset over it.  However, I firmly believe that it is time that we show some respect to Members of this House.  I do not mind accounting for anything and everything.  I believe that that should be the case.  However, it is how one does it and who is excluded.  We have to work and do our business by example.</p> <p>  That brings us to the end of this part of the meeting.  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their attendance, as well as for the attendance of their officials.  I also want to thank both of them for going beyond what was on the agenda in terms of the questions they were asked, and for participating fully in the meeting in an open and transparent way.</p> <p>  For the information of the House, we have concluded our consideration of the Revised Estimates, Votes 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 39 and 43, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform grouping.

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that they be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, Dublin, to participate in public proceedings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  We have before us the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2022 for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan and his officials.  Members will have received the briefing document provided by the Department that was circulated in advance of this meeting.  The purpose of this meeting is to consider the Revised Estimates and performance information regarding the outputs and impacts of programme expenditure.  The programme-based structure of the Estimates should allow the committee to focus on what the OPW is committed to achieving in terms of actual outputs and outcomes; to consider whether the performance targets included in the Estimates are a sufficiently complete description of the service provided by the OPW; to determine whether those targets strike the right balance in terms of the needs of society; to consider whether the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services; and to consider whether these allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.</p><p>I call the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020200002#Q00200"><p>I am pleased to appear before the committee to present the 2022 Revised Estimate for the Office of Public Works.  The gross allocation for 2022 is just shy of &euro;597 million, which comprises &euro;143 million for flood risk management and &euro;454 million to be invested in estate management.</p> <p>  Given the recent easing of restrictions by Government, I pay tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works who maintained a full service for client Departments and the public during the pandemic.  Parks and heritage sites provided much-needed relief from the restrictions and the building and engineering services allowed Departments and local authorities to continue to deliver critical functions throughout the pandemic.  The OPW now stands ready to move forward in 2022 and I will now set out the investment priorities for the coming year.</p> <p>  The structure of the OPW Vote remains unchanged.  However, in line with the Government&rsquo;s infrastructure investment programme of &euro;165 billion under the National Development Plan 2021 to 2030, the OPW Vote has seen a 30% increase in its capital allocation.  This funding will contribute to the ambitious plan for a greener, more efficient, connected Ireland as part of our climate goal to cut emissions by 50% by 2030.</p> <p>  While the OPW funding allocations, projects and scope of work continue to expand, the two main strategic programmes of work on flood risk management and estate management have grown in parallel.  Since I last addressed this committee, the threat of climate change has been reinforced at events such as COP26.  It is clear the State needs to introduce measures to decarbonise but it also needs to introduce measures to adapt to the impacts of climate change.  As I have highlighted regularly, Ireland is an island and the sea is rising around us.  This is one of our greatest risks.</p> <p>  Under its flood risk management brief, the Office of Public Works continues to co-ordinate Ireland&rsquo;s whole-of-government approach to managing Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk from rivers and the sea, the primary source of Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk.  The OPW's core objective is to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the impact of flooding to the families and businesses in those communities known to be at significant risk from flooding.  I have seen at first hand the damage flooding can cause.</p> <p>  The flood risk management plans launched in May 2018 give evidence to support the Government&rsquo;s investment in flood risk management over the lifetime of the national development plan.  This investment supports the progression of some 150 flood relief schemes.  As Deputies know, delivering flood relief schemes is a very complex process, involving the following distinct stages: understanding the source and extent of flooding, identifying the preferred option to protect at-risk areas, securing the relevant consents and planning permissions, and constructing the scheme.  Throughout all stages, public consultation and detailed assessments of the environmental impacts are key to informing a flood relief scheme for a community.</p> <p>  Tomorrow, I will be visiting Bantry, County Cork, for the contract signing to appoint engineering and environmental consultants to progress a flood relief scheme for the town to protect 198 properties.</p> <p>  The prioritisation of schemes means work is now under way to protect 80% of at-risk properties with proposed solutions for the other 20%.  Flood risk projects require expert input and knowledge from engineers in hydrology.  As we progress future schemes, the Office of Public Works will continue to make the most efficient use of all available resources, including these specialised and limited personnel.</p> <p>  One of the greatest challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk comes from climate change.  In designing and building all our schemes, provision is made to ensure schemes can meet the risk posed by climate change.  The Office of Public Works assessment of that risk is fully supported by the evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p> <p>  Outside these major schemes, local authorities can address local flooding issues through funding from the OPW&rsquo;s minor floods mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  This provides 90% of the funding required by local authorities and, since 2009, has protected some 7,500 properties.</p> <p>  In addition to the major and minor flood relief schemes, the allocation of &euro;143 million to flood risk management in 2022 will allow the Office of Public Works to maintain some 11,500 km of channels and 800 km of embankments as part of its statutory maintenance duties.  This maintenance provides drainage outfall to 650,000 acres of agricultural lands and a level of protection from flooding to urban areas and critical infrastructure, including some 20,000 properties.</p> <p>  The second major OPW programme, estate management, continues to fund the design, upkeep and modernisation of a significant number of properties within the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  These include heritage sites, Civil Service office accommodation for all Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many State agencies.  In all, the OPW manages more than 2,500 properties on behalf of the State, which include some of Ireland&rsquo;s most significant heritage properties, monuments, gardens and arboreta.  Properties range from Leinster House to Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l and office buildings.  This management role includes the curation and presentation of 30 major historic properties and 700 national monuments as well as the State&rsquo;s art collection, artefacts, plants and trees.  This work makes a significant contribution to the health, enjoyment and well-being of the public, particularly in recent times and for which the OPW is quite rightly recognised.</p> <p>  I was especially pleased with the impact of the Government decision to waive entry fees to heritage sites in 2021.  Indications are approximately 8.5 million people visited our sites throughout the country over the past 12 months.  The initiative has reignited an appreciation for our heritage assets and refocused the idea of staycations.  This year the Office of Public Works will continue to be instrumental in the State commemorations marking the decade of centenaries with many events at OPW-managed sites, including the recent commemoration event at Dublin Castle, which was a tremendous success.</p> <p>  In 2022, Office of Public Works heritage sites will play a key role in the return of Ireland&rsquo;s tourism economy particularly with the opening to the public for the first time of Annes Grove gardens in north Cork and newly refurbished visitor exhibitions at the Blasket Centre in Kerry and C&eacute;ide Fields in Mayo.</p> <p>  In the context of office accommodation, the OPW is charged with designing the workplace of the future for the Civil Service.  It aims to deliver accommodation that allows more agile ways of working to meet our future needs.  Across 890,000 sq. m of office accommodation, the OPW continues to undertake the maintenance and constant updating of a diverse and complex portfolio of accommodation.</p> <p>  Deputies will be aware that, as a consequence of Brexit, physical infrastructure is required for customs, social protection services and health check controls at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport.  The Office of Public Works, on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Department of Transport, has delivered infrastructure at these ports and airports in the past two years.  The OPW will continue this important work in 2022.  The additional allocation of &euro;1.8 million in current resources will progress the project at Rosslare Europort under a new subhead funded by the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p> <p>  A gross sum allocation of &euro;454 million has been provided for estate management within the 2022 Revised Estimate.  A total of &euro;64 million of this has been allocated as part of the EU national recovery and resilience plan.  This funding was made available to Ireland to contribute to climate action projects.  This will ensure the Office of Public Works is well positioned to continue to contribute towards Europe&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives and support the recovery of the tourism sector and the wider economy.  Protecting the environment is at the heart of everything the OPW does in all aspects of our work, whether that be maintaining our national heritage sites or arterial drainage works.</p> <p>  I have only referred to a small section of the work of the OPW.  It goes without saying the scale and complexity of the OPW&rsquo;s responsibilities in the delivery of its two infrastructural programmes have a considerable impact nationwide and are dependent on its people.  The nature of the work of the OPW requires the input of a dedicated team of professional, technical and administrative staff, working in multidisciplinary teams, across a wide range of property management and engineering functions.  The roles cover professional managers, valuers, architects, engineers, mechanical and electrical specialists, surveyors, planners, financial advisers, property economists and project managers, supplemented by various other specialists as required.  These staff play a vital role in protecting, promoting and sustaining rural and urban areas.</p> <p>  I can say with confidence that the OPW stands ready to deliver key programmes for Government as outlined in 2022.  I would be happy to take any questions on the OPW&rsquo;s Revised Estimate requirements for 2022.</p></speech>

It is great to see him appear before the committee.  As I said earlier, I need to attend another committee after this and, unfortunately, I will need to leave after I ask my questions.</p><p> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, for appearing before us.  He will be aware of recent media reports that a former senior civil servant and valuer with the OPW has written to leaders of different parties.  In a letter, he described a system that he called "dysfunctional and wasteful" and that he claimed had led to hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money being wasted.  He stated that the "exposure of persistent gross mismanagement" of the portfolio in recent years had "achieved nothing in the way of change".  He listed a number of noteworthy examples: the overpayment of &euro;10 million by the State for the rental of the Department of Health's headquarters; the series of missed opportunities that saw the Garda missing out on, and being forced to vacate, its command headquarters on Harcourt Square in Dublin at a potential loss of over &euro;100 million; significant unutilised investment, notably a Georgian office complex on Merrion Square in Dublin that was purchased for &euro;23 million in 2007 and left vacant for seven years; the Hammond Lane site in north Dublin, which was purchased in the late 1990s, has never been used and has recently been earmarked as a site for a much-delayed new family courts complex; and the "inexplicable" way in which the OPW became involved in the children's science museum project on Earlsfort Terrace in central Dublin.  At the start of this week, there were media reports about a whistleblower who had made a protected disclosure to the Minister for Justice alleging that Legal Aid Board property leases worth millions of euro were "unlawful".  An allegation was also made about the use of an OPW building in County Kerry.</p><p> I wish to raise these matters with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, because he is before the committee.  I have a few questions on them.  In light of these claims in the media, the general conversation and the problems with the management of State properties as identified by a former senior civil servant in the OPW, what has he done to ensure that they do not arise again?  That is important, given that these are State assets.</p></speech>

Some of them were circulating in the media prior to my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW.  None of the allegations that have circulated recently is new and many of them are historical.  Most have been the subject of internal audits within the OPW.  Some do not involve the OPW at all despite being attributed to it.</p> <p>  I have answered questions on Miesian Plaza in the D&aacute;il.  The question of how two different measurement standards, for want of a better term, were attached while the lease was being negotiated has been well documented.  In the time since my appointment, the OPW has taken a proactive approach to engaging with the property owner on trying to make good, from the public's point of view, our long-term relationship with the owner while acknowledging that the owner has done nothing wrong.  Within the next number of weeks, although possibly longer than that, I hope that we might be in a position to bring forward some positive news about a different relationship between the OPW and the property owner.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced Hammond Lane and the family law courts.  The Courts Service, which is a separate entity to us, hopes to move forward with a planning application.  The Deputy also referenced the National Children's Science Centre.  It is an historical issue that somehow wound up with the OPW.  It is part of an arbitration process, so I am limited in what I can say.</p> <p>  Most of what has been raised in media commentary about property management is historical.  Some of it does not even relate to the OPW but the OPW has wound up with it and is now dealing with it.  Since my appointment, there has been a proactive response by the chairman, the commissioners and the senior staff in the organisation to dealing with legacy issues that have been left to the OPW's current management.  I am confident that procedures are in place to ensure such situations cannot arise again.  The team in the OPW must ensure safeguards are in place, in particular double-checking and cross-checking, because this is the public's money.  We are trying to ensure that we provide good office accommodation for our public services, not only in Dublin but the rest of the country as well, that there is a good blend of owned office and rented office accommodation, and that the organisation has the necessary skill set to do this.</p> <p>  Some of the issues that the Deputy raised have been aired on television or in the broadsheets.  I have answered parliamentary questions on most of them.  Some have been addressed at the Committee of Public Accounts and others have been addressed on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  Some of the issues have been closed out and we are making progress on some of the others.</p></speech>

I will take his word about there being historical issues and how some others do not fall under the OPW.  Those of us in the public eye are aware that issues like these that are in the media could cause reputational damage to any organisation.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to cross-checking and double-checking.  What are the new procedures that the OPW has introduced to ensure issues like these do not recur?  Will the Minister of State provide details in this regard?</p></speech>

I am not the Accounting Officer.  The day-to-day operation and management of the organisation are matters for the Accounting Officer.  He has been before the Committee of Public Accounts dealing with, in particular, the steps that have been taken as regards valuations.  In the immediate aftermath of the Miesian Plaza issue, he answered questions on how there were two different measurement standards to ensure that cross-checking could be brought into force and how that was being reinforced within the organisation.  More has been done to beef things up.</p> <p>  From our point of view as an organisation, we must take the public's trust seriously.  The OPW has a very strong brand, not only in terms of the flood alleviation work that we do in the Deputy's constituency and other constituencies, but in providing accommodation across the country.  We maintain 2,500 properties on behalf of the State.  There have been issues with a very small number of those - I believe the Deputy identified five.  We have a portfolio in every town and village in Ireland amounting to 2,500 properties.  Invariably, we will have issues relating to vacant properties and so on, but we have shrunk them down to a handful.  That is still too many, though, and we will reduce the number even further.</p></speech>

As he said, there are 2,500 properties.  At that time, just over 80 buildings were vacant.  How many are vacant now?</p><p>If the Minister of State does not have the exact figures, that is fine.  I do not expect him to have the parliamentary question from 2020 in front of him or to have all the answers.  A few of those were of interest of me.  Three were listed as sale agreed and 14 were being prepared or considered for disposal.  I am looking for an update on that.  Have they disposed of?  We have seen other ones retained for strategic purposes.</p></speech>

We have made a lot of progress with local authorities in particular.  When I was appointed, I was very keen to engage with local authorities and other public bodies so that if there was a vacant property, we would give local authorities and other public bodies first refusal and ultimately get to community groups if community groups had a viable interest and could demonstrate that with the support of a Leader company or local authority, it would not become a burden on a local community.  In other words, community groups would not come looking to us for grants.  Only as a last port of call, would we put a "For Sale" sign on it.  At the moment, 4% of properties are vacant so the number has decreased considerably.</p></speech>

Of those, 36 are Garda stations.  They represent 36 of the 139 that would have been in the original number that had been closed as part of the consolidation of Garda stations.  The number has dropped considerably.  We have a plan for all of them in terms of the number of properties that are unoccupied.  In other words, we are working through them.  By the end of the year, we estimate that the number will have decreased even further.</p></speech>

Of the sites, seven are decentralisation sites, one is a Coast Guard site, five are customs sites and one is a former Met &Eacute;ireann site.  There are 17 other sites bringing the total to 99 properties.  We have a plan for each one of them.  Most of them are being worked through local authorities.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are many issues relating to title because many Garda stations predate the foundation of the State.  Some Garda stations were taken off old estates.  They were barracks prior to the formation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so many of them do not have clean title.  Even if community groups or local authorities want to take them, many of them do not have clean titles.  In such circumstances, we have to establish title.  This means that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and others must try to establish title, which can take years because we are going back through defunct estates and it can take an awful lot of time.  While a local authority might want to take these buildings off us for a house, we cannot transfer them for no value because it is against the law.  We must get the actual purchase price and to do that, we need clean title and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is finding it extremely difficult to establish that title.</p></speech>

I know he visited there in November.</p></speech>

I was glad to get the perspective of the engineers from the city council, our own people on the ground and some local people.  Many people have many different perspectives about what should or, more importantly, should not happen.  You will always hear about what should not happen.  We know it is a very vulnerable part of the coast line, particularly around the Spanish Arch.  This area has many very old properties and residents and is really vulnerable.  The situation is not going to get better any time soon.  Great credit must go to Galway City Council for the interim measures it deploys, which work.  However, they only work up to a point.  The design consultants were appointed in November 2020.  It is due to go into planning permission in the second quarter of 2024.  If everything goes to plan, it will commence construction in 2025.</p> <p>  My view is that a massive overhaul of the planning legislation around not only flood relief schemes but major public infrastructural projects is needed so we can deliver them faster.</p><p>The reason being that if we do not, as the Deputy knows as she represents a coastal community, the climate will be changing faster than how we, the OPW and Galway City Council, are able to respond to those communities.  How many more storms like Storm Barra will lash the west of Ireland?  The opportunity falls to the Oireachtas to decide which is more important.  Is it the legislation that we are saying is not up for negotiation by way of say, for instance, judicial review, or the communities whom we claim to represent?  I think that that is going to be fundamental to the people we represent.  We must grapple with that because I have with me the files of the flood relief schemes and the bulk of them are stuck somewhere in a court somewhere in Ireland.  That is not sustainable.</p></speech>

If it is delayed then how much time does he think we have in, for example, Galway city?  How long will the current plan be sustainable for?  If the situation progressively worsens with climate change does he think such a scenario will have an impact?  If the scheme is delayed further than 2025, how much time does he think we have?</p></speech>

We are playing Russian roulette with these communities unless we can get on and deliver to them.  However, we cannot deliver to them and pretend that the legislative basis on which we have been asked to deliver to them is fit for purpose.  It simply is not.  I know that people will cry foul of the Aarhus convention and all of that.  That is all very well and good when one has the Atlantic Ocean coming through your front door when you are living in the Claddagh.  There is no one going to say protect the Aarhus convention when there is a wave coming bursting through the front door in Salthill so we have to get real.  We cannot continue in the way that we are going.</p> <p>  As Minister with responsibility for the OPW, I must be honest with people.  I cannot protect the communities that I am being asked to protect while I have the legislative basis on which I am being asked to deliver on.  I ask my colleagues, as a Member of this House, to please bail me out.  The way that I need to be bailed is that I need a new legislative basis in the planning Acts.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, says that he is talking about a judicial review for housing that sounds like manna from heaven to me because everything that I am trying to get delivered across the country at the moment is tied up in court and the only beneficiaries that I seem to hear at the moment is not the people who must use pales to get water out of their houses but people who are in courtrooms.  The only people who seem to benefit from the work done by the OPW are the people who seem to be getting largesse out of courts and that is not sustainable.  It is not sustainable where we have communities waiting 20 years, and in some cases more years, for flood relief schemes, especially when we know that the sea is rising at the current rate.  A 1 metre rise in the Atlantic Ocean will wipe out whole communities on the west coast.  If I am saying to people in the Deputy's constituency, and in my constituency up the Shannon estuary, that they have to wait 20 years then they may as well start asking themselves if they are better off moving now because we will not be able to protect them.  This Oireachtas must respond in a positive way to climate change.  I do not mean to start saying how much emissions we will claim to cut and clapping ourselves on the back saying we are great for cutting emissions by 30% and 40%, and that means absolutely nothing.  I am talking about how are we actually going to deliver physically to these communities, and I do not mean cheques to barristers and solicitors who are the real winners at the moment.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, we need to do everything to protect communities in the Claddagh, and the businesses around the Spanish Arch and Salthill, that are so affected by flooding every time there is a storm.  As the Minister of State said, these storms are becoming ever more frequent and that causes a huge amount of anxiety and stress for the people of that area.  Indeed, we have seen that in other parts of country, as he has outlined.</p> <p>  I wish to ask one final question before I must leave to attend my next committee meeting.

I will ask a couple of questions in the meantime.  I have an ongoing interest in the work for which the Minister of State is responsible and I congratulate him on the work that he has done.</p> <p>  On buildings at risk such as period houses, castles etc. up and down the country, is the progress sufficient to address the multitude of such cases in the shortest possible time?</p></speech>

Every building is different and we have a mixture that are in our custody.  Over the last two years, the same as every element of construction, work has progressed on a stop-go basis due to Covid and we had to meet social distancing requirements but luckily now that has all stopped.  Yes, is the short answer.  We have our own limitations.  We would like to have more outdoor staff and more craft workers.  We have the apprenticeship programmes that the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, resurrected when he had my role.  We definitely would like to have more such programmes, particularly stonemasonry as it is a craft for which the Office of Public Works is renowned.  Anybody who travels through the properties that the Office of Public Works is responsible for is in awe of the restoration works done by OPW staff.  The Vice Chairman need only look at sites in his own constituency to see an example of the work that the OPW can take pride in, whether it is historic properties, the national monuments or any of the buildings.  One does not need to go outside the four walls of this building to see an example of the work done by OPW staff and the pride they take in it.</p> <p>  Yes, is the short answer.  We would always like to have more resources.  Skilled labourers are very difficult to get.  We must compete with the private sector in the form of the construction sector.  We have a very good story to tell in terms of new entrants.  When one joins the public sector one joins an organisation with a lot of pride.  It is like a family and there is career progression.  Also, there is a great opportunity not only to progress in terms of skilled labour but to progress into other elements of the organisation and to train and develop in different forms of careers.</p><p>The OPW affords opportunities and flexibility at that level to those who join it.  Whether it is in Castletown House, Kilkenny, Leinster House, Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l or elsewhere, we have in our portfolio some of the most iconic buildings in the world.  We are very proud of them.  Our workforce is limited.  We would like to take on more and to do more.  We would like to be able to expand our ambition for 2022.</p></speech>

There are still many stately homes and residences that have fallen into disrepair.  A prominent one, with a large acreage attached, was purchased in the past few days.  It is great to see such properties being purchased because it means they will be retained and refurbished.  Does the Minister of State's Department keep an ongoing watch to identify such properties and deal with them on the part of the State?</p></speech>

Private owners of listed properties have an obligation to ensure that they look after them to a given standard.  There is an obligation on us to look after them to a standard.  We receive properties into our possession on occasion.  I mentioned in my speech Annes Grove in County Cork.  I was there during lockdown.  Its story is one of lockdown, really.  It will be open shortly this year.  It is one of the newer properties in the sense that it is new to our portfolio.  Properties do come into our portfolio from time to time, but perhaps not as often as I would like.  Then again, we are not a bank.  We do not have deep pockets.  They are certainly not as deep as I would like to have.  However, where the attention of the State is drawn to particular properties, the chairman and the commissioners always evaluate them and make a decision in the best interest of the State.  When they make such a decision, they do so having weighed up the asking price and costs in the best interest of the State.  They routinely acquire property for the State.  It is the commissioners who make the decision, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but having regard to the need to achieve the best value for the State.  Adding value and assets to the State's property portfolio is the right thing to do, but only at the right cost.  As I stated, we are not blank-cheque merchants and we add to the portfolio only where it is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

The Minister of State referred to all of them in his opening remarks.  I just want more elaboration and meat on the bones.  The first point, which is pertinent, relates to commemorations and the important calendar of events over the past two years.  The events were held in very difficult circumstances.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could elaborate on the impact that Covid-19 has had on the commemorations in respect of his Department&rsquo;s need to be flexible.  Were additional costs incurred or savings made?  What was learned that can be taken forward into 2022, remembering that the pandemic has not completely gone away, although we hope we are out of the worst of the emergency phase?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the OPW is an agency that supports the Department of the Taoiseach.  In many cases, we do much of the back-of-house work or donkey work for the commemorations.  We do all the heavy lifting and get none of the recognition, for want of a better way of putting it.  Most of the commemorations happen on properties run by the OPW.</p> <p>  May I use this opportunity to thank the OPW staff because it is they who do all the heavy lifting and the putting together of the nuts and bolts for many of the commemorations?  They bring in the outside bodies to put the events together.  Without them, we would not have what we see on television, namely showcase events that in many cases involve military precision.  The back-office teams at many of those events are the men and women of the OPW.  I pay tribute to them.  The events are routinely held in historical properties run by the OPW, most notably Dublin Castle.  Covid limits the number of people who can attend them.  Invitations are sent out primarily by the Department of the Taoiseach.  It would have the protocol people but we would have the people who do the heavy lifting in respect of the mechanics.</p> <p>  The years 2022 and 2023 will see the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department that is headed by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, leading the commemorations.  We are getting into the more difficult and sensitive commemorations, involving the outbreak of the Civil War and the events at the Four Courts.  We have a role in that we have already finished the restoration of the cupola at the Four Courts.  There will be a role for the OPW in future commemorations.</p> <p>  With regard to the party political element of commemorations, it is important to point out that I recently took the opportunity to remind political parties that there are State commemorations on State properties for a purpose.  I have asked them to be mindful that we would like State commemorations only on OPW properties and that we will not entertain party-political commemorations on them.  This is because the OPW properties are the properties of all of the people of the State.  They are the properties of people who vote for my party, every other party and no party.  For that reason, I wrote to all political parties and asked them to respect the fact that the properties are to be used to facilitate State commemorations and, in some cases, commemorations led by local authorities.  I asked them to respect these commemorations only and stated we will not be facilitating party-political commemorations.  That goes across the board.</p> <p>  The easier commemorations, covering the period from 1916 to 1919, when the First D&aacute;il was established, are now over.  It gets more difficult from now on.  That is why the staff of the OPW, in particular, must be respected by individuals of all political parties and none.  Events should be run in conjunction with the Department of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the local authorities only.  Everything else should be outside the gates, precincts or curtilage of the national monuments or State properties operated by the OPW, because they are the property of all the people regardless of who they vote for.</p></speech>

There is heavy lifting in the literal sense and every other sense.  It is a credit to the men and women in the Minister of State's Department.</p> <p>  I would like to move on to an extremely topical issue to which the Minister of State referred in his opening remarks.  It relates to the construction and installation by the OPW, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs and Excise, of Brexit infrastructure, be it at Rosslare Europort or Dublin Port.  It is hard not to refer to the really disappointing announcement made only in the last hour by the North's agriculture Minister that checks at the Port of Belfast are to be halted.  Those behind the announcement are daring the British Government to renege once again on an international treaty.  The work of the OPW to which I have referred is ongoing.  This work is not done only once in that constant modifications will be needed, particularly considering the much-needed and planned expansion of traffic through Rosslare Europort but also the potential for expansion at Dublin Port and possibly the Port of Cork and other ports.</p><p>I would appreciate if the Minister of State fleshed out the expected timeline the Department, in co-operation with Revenue, has for expected additional infrastructure.  Last week, I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in a discussion on Estimates and expected staffing requirements for Revenue.  It will be the same for the OPW.  What further work is possibly required?  Is this issue something that receives ongoing updated analysis?  As we have seen even today, things can change rapidly.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right.  We have an ambitious programme for Rosslare Europort.  The Deputy is also right that this is not an insignificant investment that we are about to embark on.  It involves the OPW, Irish Rail, Wexford County Council, the local community, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Revenue Commissioners and a host of local agencies.  The investment is enormous by local standards.  It is worth &euro;150 million.  It represents a site of 10,700 sq. m. made up of 19 buildings that will provide a new border control for the country.  We have seen the traffic into and out of Rosslare Europort in recent months.  The additional new services operated in the port dictate we have to provide additional new services for hauliers coming in and out of there.  The OPW has been charged with this.  The spend to date by our Brexit unit on a range of measures is &euro;81 million.  This is capital spending across all of the headings provided for.</p> <p>  In his question the Deputy mentioned the work we have done on Dublin Port.  Our short-term ambition for this set of Estimates is focused on Rosslare.  We see the potential for Rosslare to be an additional node into the country and the additional border control point we need given the traffic being generated through the port.  We know remote access from the port causes difficulties in terms of time delays.  It is about ease of access out of the port.  Wexford County Council, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the hauliers will provide support in terms of anecdotal evidence, as will Revenue and other port users, as to the final design.  This will be supported by the European Union and will represent a massive investment into County Wexford.  The Deputy has seen the scale and finished product of what the OPW did in Dublin Port.  Other Deputies may not have seen it.  The manner in which we were able to turn it around and the speed with which we were able to turn it around are a credit to OPW staff, including our internal architects and engineering staff.  We were asked to do it in a very short period of time.  The same will be able to be accrued in Wexford.</p></speech>

It is a massive investment but one that will lead to a return for the State particularly in Rosslare Europort, with the increase in traffic and the increase in opportunities.  As the Minister of State rightly said, essentially it is doubling the capacity.</p> <p>  I have another set of questions on an issue the Minister of State touched on briefly.  It is an issue I raised with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, last week.  It is on remote working and encouraging a move in the Civil Service to achieve 20% of staff working remotely.  The Minister of State referenced it briefly in his remarks.  The detail is quite important with regard to how it can be achieved and how the Civil Service can be a model for the semi-State sector and the private sector.  This is something worth pursuing.  It is doable and affordable.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would elaborate on the strategy for remote working being co-ordinated in terms of being facilitated by the OPW.  While the Estimates for this year are set in stone, is this an area that will grow in terms of funding requirements and the amount of work required?</p></speech>

It is up to every Department to identify how it will manage it.  It is then up to us when asked how we will support it.  We already support not only our own staff to work from home but we have also supported other Departments in this regard.  There will be fundamental questions on office accommodation in this city.  If we are going to have hybrid working environments there will be a requirement for the Government as an employer to have discussions with our employees on the type of working environment we will have.  If 20% of people will be in a different type of working environment there will be a question as to whether we will own the buildings or lease the buildings.  There will be different types of conversations not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  Someone in Longford or Sligo may be working for the Department of Social Protection.  Wherever people are they will be in an OPW-owned, operated or leased building.  This will happen organically over a period of time.  It will require conversations between us and the parent Departments once the parent Departments have worked out what hybrid working looks like for them.</p> <p>  I have had this discussion with our internal management board and the chairman.  We need to start looking at other elements of the public sector, such as local authorities and other State agencies.  We have begun to look at partially filled buildings that house local authority buildings, semi-State companies or public agencies.  We are looking for Civil Service gaps to be filled by people working in a different environment, such as somebody who might be looking for a remote working environment in Stillorgan.  We know the local authority does not have full capacity in that area.  We need to start seeing the Civil Service and public sector as "Ireland Inc." rather than two different entities.  We need to start looking at how we can collaborate all of our working environments as one "Ireland Inc." working environment.  We need to make sure we maximise all of these working spaces before we start looking at building any more.  This is very important.  It is something the OPW has already started to do in regional Ireland.  We need to see whether workspace is available from local authorities, the HSE and other State agencies before we start going off entering into leases, buying buildings or building buildings.</p> <p>  This is what hybrid working and various forms of working will look like as well as working from home.  People have jumped to a conclusion that hybrid working will be working from home.  It will also be about remote working and working in a local authority office but being a civil servant or being a local authority employee working in a Civil Service office.  We have to be open to change.  A motor tax official for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council could be working beside somebody from the Department of Social Protection.  We are all working for "Ireland Inc." and we should be prepared to look at these models and not be so protective of the type of offices we are working in.</p></speech>

Many of my questions deal with flood risk management.  In the capital allocation for 2021, &euro;88 million was allocated for flood risk management.  In 2020 it was &euro;88 million.  Back in 2019 the chair of the Office of Public Works made a pitch to the Department that the funding needed in 2019 was &euro;103 million, in 2020 was &euro;112 million in for 2021 was &euro;114 million to continue to provide existing services and implement the flood protection schemes in 30 areas in the CFRAM proposals.  The allocations provided to the OPW were &euro;70 million less than this over the three years.  Will the Minister of State explain this?  I am conscious of planning issues but I am also conscious of the fact that if the Minister of State does not have the money he cannot authorise a scheme to go to the next stage.  Even before a scheme can go to planning or somebody can object to it, the design will need to be done.</p><p>I am sure there are many schemes in my constituency, and the constituencies of others, that have not been able to go on to that stage because the funding was not required.  Will the Minister of State explain why the request of the OPW at that time was left &euro;70 million short in respect of flood risk management? </p></speech>

The main issue we have is planning-related.  These are major schemes so when we anticipate, as we do, we plan on the basis of a forecast that things will move along smoothly and, naturally enough, we will build into our capital plan a sufficient amount to allow for that.  For instance, the profile for 2019 to 2021 combined Crossmolina, Glashaboy, Enniscorthy and the River Poddle.  When the four of them are put together, there is a combined underspend coming in of approximately &euro;75 million.  All of those schemes are at different stages.  We could get into each one individually to see where they are or, more important, where they are not.</p> <p>  We have to build into our profile each year a sufficient money for each one of them to be able to proceed because we do not know what is out there on the horizon, or what rock one of them will hit, during the planning process.  We have to build a sufficient amount of capital into our profile to allow them to move on.  We hope and anticipate that they will move smoothly.  Unfortunately, some of them are fairly big in scale, such as Enniscorthy, a town with a population upwards of 10,000 people.  These are not small schemes but major ones.  We are carrying over capital for fairly substantial population bases.  We do not want to carry over that capital, but we are doing so due to factors outside our control, primarily judicial review.  As I said to the Deputy's party colleague earlier, I hope that as part of the upcoming legislative review in this context we will get to a situation where we will not have towns throughout the country that are waiting more than 20 years for flood relief schemes.</p></speech>

That is a very genuine issue, which we have discussed previously.  I acknowledge that issue, but it has nothing to do with the fact that funding requested by the OPW was left &euro;70 million short over those three years.</p> <p>  Let me give the Minister of State an analogy.  If ten schemes are approved and, as he said, funding has to be profiled for those schemes, and we then hit roadblocks from judicial reviews and all the rest, and half the funding cannot be spent in a given year, for example, the problem is there are no other schemes that can pick that up.</p></speech>

There are a load of schemes in the station that cannot get on the train because, unfortunately, the judicial review process has a knock-on consequence.  There is a finite and limited number of staff who can work on all these schemes, whether they are in the engineering or environmental elements of them.  We do not have people sitting around doing nothing.  All our people are tied up all the time.  When the schemes run into judicial review, people do not just sit back and do nothing.  They move on to the next scheme, whether it is Ennis, Limerick, King's Island, Morrison's Island, any of the ones in Kilkenny, Ballyhale, any of the ones the Minister wants, Donegal or any of them.  The pipeline is continuously being filled. This year, for instance, we are moving to construction for seven schemes; Douglas, Springfield, the River Morell in Deputy Durkan's constituency, the River Dodder, Templemore, Ashbourne and Athlone, all of which are swallowing up at various stages some of what would be regarded as part of that underspend.</p></speech>

Some &euro;157,000 was approved in 2018, but what we have is not in the first phase.  He gave a response stating that it was not in stage one and he talked about some schemes potentially being moved up to stage one, but it appears Donegal town was not in that.  He said: "...Donegal town is not in the first phase of projects to be progressed, the OPW and DCC are working closely to ensure that it will be commenced as early as possible in the current programme of investment".  Has there been any movement on the commencement of this work?  Has a date for commencement been chosen?  I am not the person crying.</p><p>The people of Donegal town are screaming out for this time and again.  I outlined to the Minister of State regarding the floods that if it was not for the work of public officials, who did tremendous work the last time around, many other houses would have been at risk.  What is the date for commencement for these works in Donegal town?  There are no judicial reviews involved.</p></speech>

I hope to have a clearer picture then of where the flood relief scheme in Donegal town stands.  From our perspective, and I wish to make this point very clear, because I know the Chairman of the committee is concerned with issues in Kilkenny as well, there is not an issue with schemes being held back or anything like that.  We have been clear we will progress flood relief schemes that need to be advanced, and we are anxious to progress them.</p> <p>  We must, however, also be upfront with people.  I will need a clear legislative reform agenda to be advanced by this Oireachtas if we are to make progress.  I had a good discussion with Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, concerning the situation in Galway.  This type of problem is not unique to any part of the country.  It was the same situation when former Deputy Moran held this portfolio.  The problem has been going on for years.  I refer not just to a problem with flood relief schemes but also to major public infrastructure projects.  It does not matter who is in government.  We must deal with the planning system in respect of the delivery of major public infrastructure projects and how quickly they can be realised.</p> <p>  I refer to the planning system, and the OPW is no different from any local authority or any public utility in respect of how quickly it can negotiate the process.  I also want to make it clear that this is not an issue with money.  I have more than &euro;1.2 billion profiled for spending out to 2030.  We are anxious to spend that allocation in my county, in Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s county, in the Vice Chairman's county and elsewhere.</p></speech>

I am not going into the planning issues because I agree they exist.  Let us take the scheme in Donegal town.  It is a simple scheme.  Houses are at risk of flooding and people have been in tears.  The Minister of State mentioned that aspect.  What stage is that project at and what is required to take it to the next stage?</p></speech>

Funding of almost &euro;400,000 was allocated in 2019 by the OPW to Donegal County Council to carry out minor works there.  It is part of an overall &euro;2.5 million approved for Donegal County Council since 2009 under the heading of minor works.  I hope to visit there in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I would like to see the details of the joint authority Donegal County Council shares with the OPW, which the Minister of State has said he has referred to on five occasions, and how that process works.  I ask that because if the block is in Donegal County Council, then we need to know that.</p> <p>  Regarding Ballybofey and Stranorlar, a start-up concerning that project was held by the OPW and Donegal County Council.  More than &euro;157,000 was approved back in 2018, and the total budget is more than &euro;1.92 million.  A total of 59 properties are at risk.  Where do we stand with this project?</p></speech>

The estimated spending to date has been just less than &euro;207,000.  Consultants were appointed by Donegal County Council in April 2021.  The scheme is at stage 1, and it is due to move into the planning phase early next year and into the construction phase in early 2025.</p></speech>

Regarding the situation in Lifford, when I raised this project with the Minister of State last year, he explained that consultants had been appointed at the design stage and that the public exhibition stage would begin in early 2022.

My officials and the officials of Donegal County Council, every county council and the OPW - those responsible for the north west are sitting in the Gallery - are at pains to point out that they are often in people's houses when they are flooded.  They have to brush out the faeces, the urine and the excrement at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.  The officials in the Gallery today from the OPW are not in any way holding back anything, in any county in the country.  I can assure members of that.</p></speech>

However, that does not mean nobody is at fault because some projects are delayed or not given approval.  Sometimes that approval is not given sufficiently quickly.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the River Clady, where there was flooding and serious damage.  Kevin Boxer Moran came out to visit the site, which is in Bunbeg, County Donegal, and tried to work through this issue with the residents.  I am not sure if Donegal County Council and the OPW ever progressed the application for funding for upstream flood mitigation.  Will the Minister of State look into this?</p></speech>

I appreciate that.</p> <p>  I have raised another issue in the same vicinity with the Minister of State previously.  Numerous Garda stations have been closed down by previous Governments and some are lying idle.  One of them is the old Bunbeg Garda station, which was hit by lightning.  It was not actually closed down by the Government; it was hit by lightning.  It is in a bad state.  Is the OPW open to providing that site to the nearby primary school, which has an issue with car parking?</p></speech>

There have been a number of auctions.  Deputy Farrell queried us about disposals earlier.  She had previously raised the issue of reducing the amount of properties on our books.  We have been at pains over the past 12 months to try to reduce those.  There is a date assigned for the former Garda station in Bunbeg, and that is in July of this year.</p></speech>

There is an issue across the road from that site.  This small Garda station was hit by lightning and had serious damage done to it.  I am not sure what other use it could be used for.  There is a school across the road.  The Department of Education approved an extension because of the increased pupil numbers in the school.  There is no car parking facility whatsoever.  This is one potential remedy, although not completely suitable.  I strongly urge the Minister of State to engage with the Department of Education and the board of management of the school to look at this option before it goes to public auction.  There was a willingness in the Department to offer this site, as it has done with other sites in the past, to community groups.</p></speech>

One of the things we have been doing in the OPW is that we have exhausted local authorities, community groups, Departments and bodies such as the HSE.  I served on the Committee of Public Accounts, as did Deputy Doherty.  One of the things we cannot do is dispose of State assets for anything above the market value.  If we were to do that, no doubt somebody else would be writing a report about it.  Deputy Doherty would probably be the first person to be very critical of me for doing that.

However, we cannot operate on a <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>basis.  I know the site.  The former Minister of State, Dinny McGinley, is a good friend of mine so I know it.  We cannot leave derelict sites in the middle of villages.  If we do, Deputy Doherty will be on to me to say there is a clapped-out former Garda station in the middle of the village.  The local Tidy Towns committee will be asking for it to be cleaned up, and the Deputy will be writing a different letter to me.  We are damned if we do, and damned if we do not.</p></speech>

Currently, people park on that site we are discussing.  I was not aware of its planned sale in July, which will increase the problem in regard to parking and road safety in that area, even before the school is extended, as already approved by the Department.  This is a genuine issue.  There has always been an openness in this respect.  The OPW was willing to lease it to a community group in the past.

We do not have many deep sea ports in Kildare.  We have quite a number of harbours, albeit canal harbours, but they are still there.  In regard to the development of facilities for educational and tourism purposes, however, we have quite a number of historic houses, some of which are under the guidance of the OPW already.  Moneys have been spent and continue to be spent.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the Morell River drainage scheme was held up by judicial review.  I understand it is now going ahead.</p> <p>  As one drives around the country, there are houses that catch one's eye.  A few of them are in County Kildare.  Is there a mechanism for houses that might be at risk of disappearing into decay and disrepair?  Some of them may be on private property, which creates a problem.  Some of them may be on public property, which does not create a problem.  What mechanism might the Minister of State have, create or avail of to deal with them in order to protect them?</p></speech>

It is an anomaly that probably should be corrected at some stage.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage actually owns many of the properties that we have responsibility for maintaining.  It is not ideal but it is what it is and we have to get on with it.</p><p>It is a legacy from a bygone day when somebody above our current paygrade decided to split them and leave them in the current legislative lacuna.  It is probably best to raise that issue with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p><p> The Vice Chairman will be glad to know that the eastern division is making considerable progress with the Morell.  It is a big project which will be finished in 2025 and will cost about &euro;10 million.  Many homes in the Vice Chairman's part of the world will benefit.  It is being done in conjunction with Kildare County Council.  It has had its problems, but luckily those are behind us now.  All going well, completion will be in 2025.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to provide an update on our national response to Covid-19.  I am joined by the deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn, and Professor Philip Nolan, chair of the Irish epidemiological modelling advisory group.</p> <p>  While we are clear that the pandemic is not over, the epidemiological profile of Covid-19 nationally provides a broadly positive outlook.  A range of data indicate that incidence is high but has reduced from its peak, and demand for testing and PCR test positivity in the main have also reduced.  The number of confirmed cases in hospital has also decreased, with the average number of newly confirmed cases in hospital also reducing.  The total number of confirmed cases in ICU, daily admissions and cases requiring mechanical ventilation have decreased.  The number of Covid-19 patients in receipt of advanced respiratory support in hospital settings outside of ICU has also reduced.  The evidence in relation to Omicron, as well as our experience of it, indicates that the burden of severe health outcomes appears reduced compared to previous waves of infection.  In addition, overall Covid-19-related mortality remains relatively stable at this point.</p> <p>  We are in this much improved situation as a result of the population&rsquo;s engagement with the vaccination programme, and the booster programme in particular, and high levels of adherence to public health measures, as well as the reduced virulence of Omicron.  Given this, on 20 January, NPHET recommended a fundamental change in the approach to the management of Covid-19 in its advice to Government.  In broad terms, a transition from a focus on regulation and population-wide restrictions to a focus on public health advice, personal judgment and personal protective behaviours was recommended and the Government was advised on the removal of the majority of the remaining public health measures.</p> <p>  In advising that social and economic restrictions could be removed, NPHET stressed that the pandemic is not over and that, with a significant level of infection nationally, Covid-19 still poses a risk to public health.  In this regard, there will be an ongoing need to retain some of the public health measures that are still in place for the month of February and those will be reviewed towards the end of this month.  Protective measures should remain in place in primary and secondary schools, masks should continue to be worn in all settings where currently regulated for, and we must continue to encourage everyone to complete their primary and booster programmes of vaccination.  In this regard, I would urge anyone who has not yet received their booster dose or completed their primary course of vaccination to do so as soon as possible.  The main purpose of vaccination has always been to prevent serious illness and death.  Covid-19 vaccines continue to prove remarkably effective in this regard, especially for those who have received their booster.</p> <p>  Masks will also continue to play a key role in reducing transmission of Covid-19.  It is important that people wear the mask that is most appropriate to them and the circumstances they may be in, ensuring it is well fitted and worn correctly.  It remains critical that if people have symptoms of Covid-19 or any respiratory or viral infection, they must self-isolate immediately.  Those who are identified as a close contact of a confirmed case need to follow the appropriate public health measures for them.</p> <p>  It is recognised that the removal of restrictions, while very welcome, will cause anxiety for some people.  In particular, this may be the case for people who are immunocompromised or more vulnerable to the severe effects of Covid-19.  I wish to reassure those who may be anxious that the risks associated with Covid-19 are greatly reduced through vaccination and that, with appropriate caution, they can go about their daily lives.  At a societal level, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted upon the physical and mental health of many.  It is important that people are assured that, while the pandemic is not over, it is safe to return to the activities we all enjoy in terms of socialising, exercise and travel.</p> <p>  While, as I said, the outlook in Ireland is positive, the global epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by the emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant, continued decline in the prevalence of the Delta variant and a very low level of circulation of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants, which are the early ones we had in this country.  The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can be expected to continue, Omicron is very unlikely to be the last variant of concern, VOC, that we will have to face and the global public health risk remains very high.  Therefore, we must remain vigilant and ensure that our response is agile and flexible, with an ability to respond rapidly and appropriately to any emerging threat that might arise.</p> <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to make an opening statement.  We are happy to take any questions committee members might have.</p></speech>

Are the witnesses satisfied at this stage that sufficient leeway has been made in terms of upping the resistance to this particular variation and any others that might come, given the level of boosters already in the field and given the fact there are still a number of people out there who have not vaccinated at all, and do not intend to, but may at this stage be contributing to beating the virus?  That is the first question.  How satisfied are the witnesses that we are in the safest possible position?  Any of the witnesses can answer.</p></speech>

In broad terms, we are satisfied.  When we look at where the country is by comparison with other countries regarding vaccination, we see a very high uptake.  There remain pockets where the vaccination level is below what we regard as acceptable or safe for certain groups.  The HSE has a number of different measures in place to try to raise the vaccination rate among what might be called hard-to-reach groups.  In broad terms, we have seen a very good uptake under the booster programme.  There can be a delay in the booster programme, as members will know, because people have been advised to wait for a period after an active infection before coming forward for the booster.  It has been necessary to delay the booster dose for some people, which means we will continue with the programme for a period and slowly increase the uptake.  The data we see provide really strong evidence and support for the view that vaccination and boosting give the best protection one can have in preventing the infection from becoming severe to the point of landing one in hospital or intensive care, or an effect that is even more serious.</p><p> A significant proportion of people in intensive care, even though their number has been falling over recent weeks, still comprises those who are not properly and fully vaccinated and boosted.  Even though the majority of the population, or well over 90%, have had their primary course of vaccination and we have seen a significant uptake of the boosters, we still have some way to go in getting the message across to people who are not yet vaccinated.  We are not resting complacently on the basis that we are doing much better than many other countries in this regard; the message still has to go out to each individual that the best thing that can be done to be protected is to get vaccinated.  We can see that we have very high levels of infection, and our view is that these high levels are likely to continue for some time.  Therefore, as people go about activities that are now possible and that perhaps were not possible over recent weeks and months, there is a chance they will encounter this virus.  They should assume they will, even if it is inadvertent.  If they are not protected through vaccination and a booster, the disease is still very serious-----</p></speech>

We will continue to monitor what might happen to the trends for the disease.  As we gave this advice to the Government just about two weeks ago, we did point out that a number of countries that had begun to ease some of their measures saw an increase in the transmission of the infection.  We will keep monitoring that.  We have seen a slight increase in recent times among those in the age group from 19 to 24.  We will keep a close eye on that.  We are not expressing major concern about it at this point, but changes like the one in question are consistent with changes we saw and referred to in the earlier advices provided to the Government.  We will have to continue to advise based on what we see in respect of any change in transmission and the question of what any given level of transmission might have in terms of conversion to hospitalisation or admission to intensive care.  At this point, we are not seeing anything to give us any reason to express concern.</p></speech>

In the weeks running up to that period, we saw a very significant uptake.  That has slowed but, that said, there is a variety of reasons.  Taking the proportion of people who have been boosted and the proportion who cannot be boosted because they have recently been infected and who are waiting for a booster in a month or two, we estimate that 80% of all those eligible to be boosted have been boosted.  That compares very favourably internationally but, again, there is a proportion of people who have not taken the opportunity.  We have to take every opportunity we can to reiterate the importance of being boosted  It is very clear from data from the US that the risk of infection among unvaccinated adults, by comparison with those who have been boosted, is five times higher.  Their risk of death is 50 times higher.  We are aware that the risk of infection from Omicron among those who are boosted is approximately 50% lower, and they are 90% to 95% protected against severe disease, hospitalisation and death.  Therefore, boosting really does have a significant impact in protecting people from severe illness.  While our uptake of boosters is excellent overall, there are pockets of people who, for whatever reason, have not yet come forward, but of course it is not too late.  We encourage everyone to come forward in the weeks ahead to get themselves protected.</p> <p>  Importantly, given where we are with the easing of measures at present, we will all be coming into contact with people around us who are potentially older or vulnerable, so there is an onus on us from that perspective to protect ourselves from infection so we will not pass an infection on to others.  While vaccines do not provide absolute protection against transmission and perhaps do not protect against transmission at the level we anticipated this time last year, they are still effective.  Compared to all the other measures we have, they are probably the most effective we have against transmission and the most effective in reducing the possibility of infection for an individual.</p></speech>

Hopefully, the disease will be reducing in prominence, but, since people will have it much less on their minds, it will be important for us to remind them to take the opportunity to be boosted when they become eligible in the post-infection period.</p></speech>

We were very lucky to have the teams we have had in dealing with this virus.  They have done very well.  The fight is not over yet, however.  The next battle will go into another area, that of enabling the health services to combat the waiting times and problems that have backed up during Covid and that were backing up before that.  We do not have the luxury of being able to wait for four or five years.  The health services in general, therefore, have a serious issue on their hands, that is, to devise a plan to deal with the backlogs quickly, particularly in respect of acute conditions such as scoliosis.  It is really embarrassing that they remain on our radar screens and continue to emerge.  I have every confidence in our health services despite the fact that they get a lot of criticism.  I have every confidence that they are capable of dealing with the issue but the plan must be drawn up very quickly.  If drawn up quickly, the response will be dramatic.</p></speech>

I join in the comments commending them on their work over the past two years.  We all know it was a very difficult period for everybody, but NPHET, in navigating through it, had to impose or recommend restrictions that had a huge impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  It was all about keeping people safe.  The vast majority of people recognise that and would commend the witnesses on their work.</p> <p>  My first question is one that I hope the witnesses will not take personally and that they might have anticipated: when are we likely to see a winding down of NPHET?  Is it likely, and what is the timescale?</p></speech>

What I can say is that we still have work to do.  We have a further meeting of NPHET to consider the ongoing need for the restrictions still in place, including in regard to schools and mask wearing, under the regulations.</p><p>We indicated we would give consideration to that and give further advice through the Minister.</p><p> What might happen beyond that is something the Minister and the Department will give consideration to.  I can say we will still need advice.  We will need advice that is multidisciplinary in nature and that is capable of informing the decisions Government ultimately must take.  They are difficult and balanced decisions that must, in the first instance, reflect public health considerations, which has been our role, and then all the other considerations the Government must have on measures that either have been advised upon in the past or might need to be advised upon in the future.  We will not be able to obviate the need, if we end up in a situation, for example, with a further variant that causes the kinds of concerns we have seen with variants in the past where good-quality, rapid, multi-professional advice focused on managing that public health issue and any resultant impacts-----</p></speech>

What does he believe will be the level of public health surveillance that will need to be kept in place for the next while?  There are questions about what testing and tracing will look like.  Is it anticipated that there will be annual vaccinations for some time to come?  Is that something that can even be answered at this point?  We need to consider what the public health surveillance will look like in the time ahead.  Are we likely to see again a winding-down of that testing and tracing capacity and so on?  Is there a sense of what that might look like in the months and years ahead?</p></speech>

We expect the ECDC will be giving guidance on that.  The emphasis in that guidance is likely to be on transitioning from a response very much focused on transmission as well as reducing the severe impacts of the disease to one focused on managing and limiting the severe impacts of the disease based on all the experience but especially the experience of Omicron.  Much of the emphasis on that is going to be on, as the Deputy said, what is the right kind of surveillance, what role do things like contact tracing play, who should be tested as part of the surveillance system and then obviously the maintenance of testing for the purpose of clinical decision-making.  We still need to test people for clinical purposes to inform clinical decision-making.  We are doing some specific work on that as part of the work of NPHET at the moment.  We expect to be in a position to give further advice on those matters to Government in the coming weeks through the usual mechanisms and informed by some of the work happening at an international level.  Just as his question is suggesting, I think the Deputy will see a move in that general direction.  We do not anticipate we are going to continue to be advising the need to test every individual irrespective of severity of symptoms and irrespective of, let us say, how vulnerable he or she might be individually to the disease itself.</p> <p>  On the question of vaccination, the Deputy is anticipating that may arise because these considerations are happening in every country.  I wrote to NIAC more than two weeks ago to ask the committee to start to consider what the future of vaccination will be, given we have got to where we have got to in terms of both primary vaccinations and boosters with this programme.  What is the continuing need for vaccination?  What will be, based on the primary objective of protecting people from severe infections, the need for vaccination on an ongoing basis?  Certainly one of the possibilities - and I am not anticipating what advice NIAC will give yet - is we could end up in a less frequent vaccination situation whereby the topping-up, as it were, of one's vaccination is for the purpose of preventing severe infection.  It may well be that recommendation is not focused on the whole population but people with particular vulnerabilities.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Holohan.  From his perspective, given he was in the thick of responding to Covid, what lessons would he take from how the State was prepared to deal with the pandemic, with respect to both the health service itself and the public health infrastructure?  From my perspective, many people stepped up to the plate.  I am referring to people in the health services, public health departments, testing and tracing and the vaccination roll-out.  We had ripples along the way but, by and large, we had a very efficient system and people working in the system stepped up to the plate.  However, surely there are lessons to be learned.  I ask the CMO to spend a minute outlining what lessons he feels should be learned and what action needs to be taken to ensure those lessons taken on board.</p></speech>

I would be positive about this - and am not suggesting the Deputy's question is otherwise - in the sense that much went well in the stepping up to the plate he referred to.  I will pick a couple of examples.  We did not have the capacity to do the kind of modelling work we have had and we did not have a plan to create that, even though we had good systems of pandemic preparedness in place.  We had to respond on the hoof to try to create that capacity almost overnight.  The work Professor Nolan led to develop a capacity with all the best mathematical and analytical brains in the country to put us in a situation to be able to better understand what might happen with the disease is just one of the examples of the stepping up to the plate.  A huge amount of that work was done on a voluntary basis, in addition.  It was done off the sides of desks by many of these people, whose names are not known at all.  They were in mathematics departments and various different places around the country.  I offer that one example.  For me, it shows when the need arises and the ask is made, people respond.  That is one of the really strong characteristics.  That <i>esprit de corps</i>was in evidence right the way through the pandemic.  When people got tired, including ourselves as two years has been a long time for everybody, that has very much been the hallmark in this country in the way it has not in others.  Of course, there are things that can be improved upon and that will be the trick, that is, as we continue to go forward we improve-----</p></speech>

Will there be a report from NPHET looking at what we did right - and a huge amount was done right - but also at the lessons to be learned?</p> <p>  As we are tight on time I have one final question for Professor Nolan.  The most recent meeting we had, and the CMO was on that call, was before Christmas with Opposition Oireachtas Members.  It seems on the face of it the hospitalisations we saw in January were on the more optimistic side.  Can that be confirmed just so people have a sense of that?  Maybe Dr. Holohan will respond very quickly to whether we are going to see a report from NPHET looking back at all of that and the lessons to be learned, as well as what was done right?</p></speech>

The vaccines did not offer a whole lot of protection against getting infected with Omicron but exceeded expectations in their protection against people getting severely ill and requiring critical care.  Thus, the cases tracked our more pessimistic scenarios.  Hospitalisations were actually around the central scenario.  We peaked at in excess of 1,000 people in hospital but the most important thing was that with critical care admissions and deaths, we were well ahead of the optimistic position.  We could not have known that in advance.  It would have been foolishly risky to imagine that might happen but we were not only fortunate as it was a critical step when Omicron was coming that the decision was made to accelerate the booster programme.</p><p>That protected a significant number of citizens and then those boosters turned out to be more effective than we expected in preventing people requiring critical care or dying.

It is hard to measure it in time.  It has entered into common language but it is really a technical epidemiological term.  The features of this disease that we would expect would allow us to describe it as something that was endemic are where its patterns and behaviours were very predictable, we knew when it would surge, we knew when it would not, we knew the conditions that would make it surge and the interventions to take in response to those surges.  It has not really begun to emerge yet in that way.  We have seen surges of infection occurring at various different times of the year and that sort of pattern that, let us say, influenza might follow where we kind of know roughly when we expect to see peaks, when we expect to see troughs, what the thresholds to set might be to declare the flu season having commenced, etc.  We are still not quite at the point, in terms of our global understanding of this disease, as to what its predictable behaviour will be.  It is still a new infection.  It is adapting to the host and learning new and better ways to transmit itself as between humans and, possibly, also animals.</p></speech>

There are a couple of previous ones that we would point to.  The last significant flu pandemic was the swine flu one in 2009-2010, but it was occurring against the background of a population where we had a certain amount of immune memory.  There was some level of immunity within the population.  We had some drugs available to us that could deal with influenza, Tamiflu and Relenza, and we also had influenza vaccines that were capable of being adapted quickly.  From a standing start, we were in a very different position.  In the coronavirus pandemic - this one - we had none of those kinds of features in place.</p> <p>  We did not know very much about it.  While much work happened internationally around pandemic preparedness, much of the focus of that was on influenza - the presumption being that at some point we would see a much more severe, in terms of virulence, form of influenza such as the avian influenza that you might have heard of developing the potential to pass from human to human - but in the event we have seen a further coronavirus pandemic to add to the two that we have previously seen.  We had the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, in 2002-2002, but it did not have the transmission potential that this one had.  It eventually disappeared in response to some of the measures that were put in place, principally in South-East Asia.</p></speech>

I favour that too.</p> <p>  There were some popular voices who assisted in the transmission of information and who helped to build up a body of public confidence.  The obvious one, I suppose, that comes to mind is Professor Luke O'Neill.  It has always intrigued me as to who made it on to National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, what the process was, whether someone such as Professor O'Neill was ever considered and whether there was interaction between NPHET and people such as him, Professor Jack Lambert and Professor Sam McConkey.</p></speech>

We were worried at that point about the potential.  We had a certain amount of engagement over the course of a number of weeks to try to determine what was happening, largely among the public health and virology community such as Dr. Cillian De Gascun, Dr. Glynn and I, and a number of senior colleagues in the HSE, and then, when we got to assess that this was something that was not going to go away and we were concerned about it, the formal decision to establish the NPHET was made.</p> <p>  The membership of NPHET has been added to somewhat over time.  In broad terms, there are four people from the infectious disease community -  one of the individuals the Deputy mentioned comes from that specialty - already.  These are consultants in that individual specialty.  We have people from microbiology, virology and elsewhere.  When the need has arisen in the past, or has been identified, either by us or the Minister, or, indeed, by Government, to add an expertise to that we believe we need, then we have done that.  That is the process that has pertained in the course of the two years.  It has grown, but proportionately, in response to what has been an unprecedented public health emergency.</p></speech>

I have always been interested in that.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan will not have time to answer this.  I do not want him to answer it but I would like a written response.  It will form part of the evaluation.  I will not call it a change of mind over antigen tests.  By the way, I had an experience over Christmas, and many people did, with a particular brand.  All I could think of was the "snake oil" reference and I thought there was some truth in that.  The information on antigen testing has now been uploaded onto the HSE portal.  However, there are legitimate questions to be asked about the delay in seeing antigen testing as having a role to play.  I do not want Dr. Holohan to answer it now because I am limited in time but that is something the public would like to have answered.</p> <p>  On masks and children, I have had quite a number of queries with links to reputable medical websites and information that is kind of contradictory.  Briefly, could Dr. Holohan say something about masks and children and the efficacy of same and what is underlying NPHET's decisions around that?</p></speech>

The difference is their use at a point in time depends on the breakdown incidence of the disease.  Antigen tests are useful when the disease prevalence is high, particularly when there is a constraint on PCR capacity.  They are useful in situations such as outbreaks.  We have always advised that.  That is why they are in use now but were not being advised, let us say, when the disease incidence was much lower, such as last summer.  We were concerned that people were using them and then using the negative test as a licence to do something that they would not have otherwise done and it was not safe, and about green light use.  We stand over our advice and it has not changed.</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy at a personal level, I would far prefer at times to be giving different advice and to find ourselves as a country being able to live with different measures.</p> <p>  Going back to the very first time that I had to engage with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, because the Taoiseach was out of the country at the time, to advise on the closure of schools, universities and a range of things such as that, that was a very onerous and heavy burden of responsibility.

Most of those calls that we made, both in terms of the advice and the decisions that the Government made based on that advice, have been good calls.</p></speech>

I previously tried to answer the question briefly in general terms.  I apologise for using up so much of Deputy Lahart's time in answering the question, but it is important that we get the opportunity to articulate our position.  We have given that advice on antigen tests.  They have a particular sensitivity and specificity.  An antigen test is not as good as a PCR test, which is regarded as the gold standard.  However, it has the advantage of being rapid, easily accessible and so on.  In the hands of healthcare professionals, their use is better than in the hands of the public.  Certain tests have been evaluated for their use as self-care tests, so it is based on that.<br/><br/>In general terms, the advice we give is that antigen tests are useful in certain circumstances.  They are useful, in particular, in the circumstance of high incidence.  Where what we call the &ldquo;pre-test probability&rdquo; of the disease being present is high, meaning the chances of the person in the first instance having the disease, the results of the test can be trusted much more in those kinds of situations than in a situation where the disease incidence is low.  <br/><br/>The behaviour that we have always been concerned about and that has given us reason to express concern - and we have some data to back this up - is the situation where somebody does the test, particularly a person who is symptomatic, gets a negative result, concludes that means they do not have Covid and then goes on about their business without restricting their movements and so on, thereby putting other people at risk and contributing to disease transmission.  That is the use - members may be familiar with this categorisation - as a &ldquo;green light&rdquo;.  In other words, somebody does the test to give themselves permission to do something as if the test result is negative.  We have always advised against their use as green light tests, and I think most international authorities advise against this as well.  <br/><br/>The real value of an antigen test is in a high-incidence situation when a person does the test, gets a positive result that they would not have known about otherwise and decides not to go out to the pub, to work, to a wedding or whatever it might be.  That is the real value.  We have evidence through the Am&aacute;rach tracker, which is a survey we do every week and have been doing over the course of the pandemic.  The committee might be aware that we do this .  We ask different questions, depending on what is topical at a point in time.  When we go back to about three or four months ago, we see that where a significant portion of people who had symptoms were using an antigen test and had a negative result, that was not being followed up in a number of people by a restriction of movements and a confirmation through PCR, which was our advice at the time.  <br/><br/>The public health messaging was focused on trying to improve that performance, and we did see an improvement in that performance.  However, the most recent set of data that we have from earlier this week -  and I can share these figures with the committee - shows us that about 30% of the adult population report using antigen tests in the previous week.  That was as high as 55% or so in the first week after Christmas.  Of the 30% using the antigen tests, many of them are in the situation where they have symptoms, and then when they have a negative result they are reporting that they are not self-isolating.  I am generalising because I do not have the figures in front of me right now, but this happens in a significant majority of circumstances.  We know this situation was also happening in schools, where people using the antigen test when children were symptomatic and a negative result was used as a basis to send children back into school.  That is exactly the concern. <br/><br/>It is not about the antigen test <i>per se</i>, but the way in which people interpret and use the result.  When it is used in the right circumstances and the interpretation of the result and people's resulting behaviour is appropriate, then we do not have a concern.  Our concern is that it must be used in the right circumstances, where disease incidence is high, and then the interpretation of both the positive and negative result needs to be right and inform people's behaviour.  As I said, for a period time we can see that a substantial portion of the population with symptoms were using the test inappropriately and then using the negative result to not self-isolate.  That is the reason we have expressed concern about their use.</p></speech>

We have had discussions among the membership of NPHET this morning, but of course there is a very wide membership on the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, expert advisory group, which also feeds in with a range of expertise.  I would point people back to its report in September.  Many of the key findings of that report still hold true.</p> <p>  Ultimately, we have said all along that antigen testing was most appropriate in high-prevalence settings, outbreak situations or where PCR testing capacity was constrained.  All of those scenarios played out over recent weeks, which led to the recommendations that were made on antigen testing.  However, the underpinning advice on the use of that modality has not changed over time.</p></speech>

I just thought it would appropriate to elaborate on it.  A number of people have told me that, particularly around the Christmas period, they were concerned about meeting elderly people and whatever else.  They were starting to use antigen tests and it was an element they felt was part of the safety process.  However, I can understand what Dr. Glynn and Dr. Holohan are saying in that it is not the be all and end all.  Yet, they were helpful for many families and those who used them appropriately.</p></speech>

I apologise, as I am competing against this bell.  There is nothing I can do about it.</p> <p>  Two years ago, we were in the throes of a general election and the vast majority of people in the State had probably never heard of Covid.  Obviously, we got to know Covid very well over the past two years.  It has left a huge mark on this country and issues that will probably take a long time to heal.  It has been a very traumatic two years for many people.  Hopefully, things are looking brighter than they have been in the past two years.  Looking at the figures of the people who died of Covid, they are staggering.  Some 10,000 people on the island of Ireland, nearly 1 million people in the US alone, and 6 million people worldwide - and counting - have died of Covid.</p><p>It is incredible how many people this awful disease has killed.  It is not over by any means, but certainly in recent weeks there has been a sea change in people's thinking regarding us being over the worst of the pandemic for now.  We must, however, be cautious and adhere to the guidelines.</p><p> Turning to another issue, already touched on by Deputy Cullinane, I wish to ask Dr. Holohan about something that struck me when he was making his statement.  Perhaps he cannot comment on this aspect, but I ask him to take his doctor's hat off, and, looking back over the past two years, tell us what NPHET could have done differently during the pandemic.</p></speech>

I say that because we are still in the middle of something that is still ongoing.  While we are not predicting that we are going to see the kinds of impacts we saw previously, we must still be prepared for something else to happen and to happen quickly.  As the Deputy knows, the first reports of the Omicron variant began to emerge in the last days of November, and we were then in a very different situation as a country by Christmas.  That is an example of how quickly things can happen.  We must be ready and we must ensure that we will be able to respond as quickly as that if something were to happen in future.</p> <p>  Compared with other countries, one of the things that has worked well here is that trusted public health advice, and I am not just talking about advice from me but from right across the board, and including colleagues in the HSE, has been to the fore in the response.  The public health voice, particularly in the context of the health service and the leadership of the health service, and how the public health message is articulated is the key measure on which we have some further progress to make.  There are plans to strengthen that aspect as much as we can.</p> <p>  Every public health system in the western world has been challenged by the scale of this pandemic and, as the Deputy rightly said, its mortality impact.  It has been on a scale that we have not seen in many decades.  We must now go through a process where we try to figure out how we can do better in anticipating, preventing and responding in this type of context.  We will be doing that work assiduously in the coming weeks.  We cannot wait until this pandemic is over to do it.  We cannot wait until we get to a point when concerns about the potential emergence of new variants have abated.  We must try to apply these kinds of measures and try to continually improve our response in this regard.</p> <p>  We have seen a large-scale operational response from the HSE to do some impressive things.  We are all aware of the instigation and ramping up of the vaccination and booster programme, the testing and tracing capacity, etc.  As we move forward, we must now also ensure that we build all those aspects into a regionalised public health response capacity which is intelligence-led and that will ensure we will have good quality public health data available to public health teams on the ground to enable them to respond as quickly as they possibly can.  In general terms, it is a correct principle to say that the earlier it is possible to intervene in the case of the emergence of a new outbreak, the better will be the chance to mitigate the impact of any such infection.  I refer to the capacity to spot something unusual happening at a local level and to put in place good measures to try to mitigate the phenomenon developing and to prevent it becoming established as a wider-spread infection.</p> <p>  In addition, given what we know now about Covid-19, I refer especially to the measures to be put in place to protect people who are vulnerable and most impacted by this disease.  Unfortunately, we have seen that impact in the case of older people and those with significant underlying morbidities.  We must put measures in place as fast as we can to try to protect them in future.  Considering the speed at which this variant has shown it is possible for the disease to move, if there were to be new variants of concern, then there is every reason to believe they could move as quickly as this variant.  We must be able to respond rapidly and appropriately to any such an occurrence.  As a result, we would not claim in any way that we have no room for improvement.  Every country in the western world can clearly see there is significant room for improvement in how we can all respond in this regard.  That is what we will be trying to do from here on in.</p></speech>

Many people in the State, especially in the past six to seven weeks, have got Covid-19.  Some people who get it are fine afterwards.  How prevalent, though, is the experience of long Covid and, from a clinical point of view, how concerned is Dr. Holohan with its legacy in the context of public health?</p></speech>

To be honest, we do not have a firm view on it yet.  It is clear that most people who contract Covid-19 will recover quickly.  They will have a form of the illness that will not require them to end up in hospital or intensive care, and they will recover relatively quickly in the weeks following the acute infection.  A proportion of people, however, will go on to suffer longer-term symptoms for weeks or months following infection.  Much work is being done on better understanding the prevalence of these symptoms in Ireland and internationally.  The HSE is instituting an approach to ensuring that people who need access to care for these symptoms will have it.  In broad terms, then, it appears that approximately 10% of people may experience symptoms for a prolonged duration beyond the acute period.  The rate among children and adolescents, though, seems to be much lower.  Unfortunately, we do not have a fixed figure.  This topic is the subject of significant ongoing research and evidence synthesis.</p></speech>

That is a lot of people.  I am not sure that is absolutely scientific as an estimate, but if the prevalence is near that rate of 10%, and, bearing in mind that it is probably difficult to quantify the time it takes to make a full recovery, then it is concerning.  I refer to a perfectly healthy adult possibly having symptoms of long Covid three to six months after contracting the virus.  What would Dr. Glynn consider the classical symptoms of long Covid to be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.953" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#G00700"><p>We cannot say there is a classical picture for the symptoms of long Covid yet.  I also express caution regarding the estimate of a 10% rate, because it could be as low as 2.5%.  A major study in the UK suggested that 2.5% of adults aged between 35 and 70 experienced symptoms of long Covid after contracting the virus.  Equally, the estimated rate in children decreased to 0.3% 0.4%.</p> <p>  The common symptoms mentioned are fatigue, shortness of breath and some problems with cognition.  Again, however, the duration of those symptoms and how those affected recover over time remains an area of significant research.  I take this opportunity to again drive home the key message that long Covid is a risk for anyone who gets infected with the virus.  That is a reality.  It is for this reason that we have been doing all we have been doing during the past two years and it is why we continue to emphasise the need for people who have not been vaccinated or those who have not availed of the booster vaccine to come forward and get the jab.  At a population level, it is true that most people who get infected with Omicron will not end up in hospital or severely unwell.  It is also true, however, that a proportion of people who do get infected will end up in those situations and another percentage, albeit we cannot accurately quantify it yet, will end up with long Covid-type symptoms.  Again, therefore, I urge anyone who has not been vaccinated already to get vaccinated now.  It is never too late.  There will be no judgment if people come forward at this stage and say that while they were not sure previously, they have now decided they want to get vaccinated.</p> <p>  We say that from the perspective of dealing with the Omicron variant now.  We do not know, however, what may manifest down the line.  We do not know if a new variant that impacts more people more severely will emerge in the months to come.  Therefore, although we are moving out of this stage of the pandemic at the population level and the picture is relatively optimistic, we do not know what is ahead.</p><p>It therefore remains very important that people protect themselves insofar as they can.</p></speech>

We have always said that vaccination is not a silver bullet, but is there any medical reason such a person would still be suffering from symptoms of Covid after six months?</p></speech>

Beyond that, however, I cannot really give more detail on individual cases, unfortunately.</p></speech>

Their daily press conferences, when they carried them out, were extremely informative, and when they moved to a weekly basis they were still informative.  It has been very difficult, and it is important that the work they have done is recognised.</p> <p>  One side of this pandemic - Deputy Kenny spoke about it earlier - is long Covid.  Has NPHET a plan regarding long Covid or specific advice as to what the Government now needs to do to help people with long Covid, that is, people who have the symptoms of Covid for a long period?  I do not know if there is proper research or information available in numerical terms.  Dr. Glynn spoke about specifics.  I know of cases in which people have been severely affected by long Covid.  What is the witnesses' view on what is being done in that area?  Is enough being done?  Does more work need to be done, perhaps?  The witnesses might comment on that.</p> <p>  I have always been very interested in the weekly research that is carried out and the information NPHET gleans from it.  I think Dr. Glynn spoke about it earlier.  It is very interesting.  I agree, from the bit of knowledge that I pick up when out and about, that when people got negative antigen tests they assume they are free to go, essentially, particularly children in school.  I know that the research NPHET did showed that as a particular problem.  I would be interested to know what research it is doing at this moment in time.  What are the questions it is asking?  What are the areas it is concerned about and on which it is doing research in terms of public attitudes and what the public are doing?</p> <p>  Would Dr. Holohan mind answering those two questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.958" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#H00600"><p>I will respond to the latter question first and then Dr. Glynn might come back on the question about long Covid in a moment.</p> <p>  There is a weekly survey ongoing.  We are looking, as we speak, at the question of the periodicity of that and whether we need to keep that going weekly at this point in time.  It is just another feature of all the measures we have in place that we might need to look at. We look at many features of the response, the public attitude to the disease, the level of worries, the views on restrictions and whether people feel that further or fewer restrictions are needed.  Those are general questions we have asked all the way through the pandemic.  Then, from time to time, we ask more specific and focused questions that might be relevant to a particular set of measures at a point in time.  That is where we have been looking more closely at antigen tests and these behaviours.  I will give the Senator the precise data because I did not have them in front of me when I spoke to this subject earlier.  For the most recent week for which we have data, which was the survey done on Monday of this week, 31 January, 30% of adults said they had taken an antigen test in the past week.  Some 14% of the population told us they had symptoms consistent with Covid in the previous week.  Of those 14% who took an antigen test and received a negative result, 8% went on to arrange a PCR test and only 22% reported that they self-isolated, which is very low.  Therefore, of those people who had symptoms, who then got an antigen test and received a negative result, only one in five of them, in effect, self-isolated.  That number has dropped.  The number reporting that they had self-isolated was a good deal higher a number of weeks ago.  We have tracked that as one important measure.  That is what I was referring to briefly earlier.  I am happy to give Senator Conway a copy of the full set of questions.  We can arrange to make that available to the committee and Senator Conway if that would be of interest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.959" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#H00700"><p>That would be great.  We have seen what I consider a very worrying situation with the antigen tests.  Is there any way around that?  Is there any messaging that can be done to get self-isolation back up to an acceptable level?</p> <p>  Also, I think mask wearing is becoming a problem.  I travel by train all the time coming up to and down from Dublin because I do not drive, and I have noticed in the past two or three weeks in particular the number of people who are just not wearing their masks, which is very worrying.  A train is a very confined space and I would consider it very high-risk.  I am not blaming Irish Rail or anything for that because it is impossible to police everything, but it is reflective of a change in attitude among the public.  As we move out of the pandemic, there is a challenge in terms of the final public health measures that are in place.  How do we communicate and sell the message in an effective way such that people actually listen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.960" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#H00800"><p>That is a very fair question about antigen tests.  Dr. Glynn might reflect on the masks when he responds to the question about long Covid.  Regarding antigen tests, we have to continue to do what we can to try to raise public awareness and understanding of the way in which they are used.  A lot of the discourse, I know, has been about whether NPHET is in favour or not in favour of antigen tests.  We are in favour of them being used in the right circumstances and used properly.  We know that there is room for improvement in public understanding of that.  To the extent that any of us can influence that, we all have a role to play.  The other thing I will say about this is that, as I think the Chairman said earlier, antigen tests are not a silver bullet.  There is no one single measure that is a solution to this disease.  That is true of antigen tests as well as everything else.  We need to try as much as we can over the course of the weeks and months, as we begin to transition in our response, to shift the emphasis away from the test that people get to what people do as the correct measure when they have symptoms.  If an individual has symptoms and responds appropriately and self-isolates, that will have a benefit not just in respect of the transmission of Covid but also in respect of the transmission of many other respiratory viral infections and other viral infections.  There has been too much emphasis on tests, as though the test itself is the thing that prevents you from getting Covid.  The test is only a means of informing your behaviour.  Your behaviour and the measures you take as an individual are what is important in protecting you.  That will have to be the emphasis as we move on from the very significant volume of both PCR testing and antigen testing we currently have in place, not just in this country but across the world.  Does Dr. Glynn wish to come in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.961" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#H00900"><p>The HSE is developing a model of care around long Covid at the moment.  We can provide a written update on that if that would be of use.</p> <p>  Regarding masks, the advice is still clear that anyone 13 years or older who has a case of Covid or is a close contact of a Covid case should wear a medical-grade or FFP2 mask and that children aged nine to 12 should wear a well-fitted mask.  As Dr. Holohan rightly said, it is inevitable over these few weeks that we will see a reduction in compliance with some of the core measures as people sense that we are moving on.  Equally, however, I reiterate that those measures were left in place over these weeks because we feel they have a very significant role to play as we try to transition out of where we are at the moment and to get to a more stable level of incidence across the population.</p><p>On the Senator's question on weekly testing, another point that is perhaps not that well known is that throughout the pandemic, in addition to the weekly service that we did at population level, we also did very regular focus group work with all the various groups impacted in different ways by the pandemic.  All of that qualitative information, whether from parents, older people, younger people, people with disabilities or people in particular vulnerable groups, was fed in, as well as the results of the surveys that we did on a weekly basis.</p></speech>

At the outset, I wish to join others in thanking Dr. Holohan, his colleagues and everyone in NPHET for their stellar work over the past two years.  They have all become household names for good reasons.  They have been on our televisions every night shepherding the nation through what has been a national crisis.  Some people refer to the pandemic as our Second World War.  It certainly was a national crisis.  We have had two years of bedding into it.  Thankfully, heads are now starting to poke up out of the ground again and we are getting back to some degree of normality.  I wish to thank the witnesses for all their efforts in that regard.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Dr. Holohan a question, which concerns mask-wearing in schools.  I ask him to forgive me if he has answered it already; I have been in and out of meetings.  Prior to my election to the D&aacute;il, I was a teacher.  Certainly, many second level schools embraced mask-wearing when they reopened.  It has been very successful.  I know that it continues to be a bit of a struggle in primary schools.  I know also that there is strong guidance on mask-wearing at this point; it is not so much a rule.  I ask Dr. Holohan to outline the guidance on mask-wearing.  When does he anticipate that it will not be a feature of the primary school classroom?</p></speech>

At the time, we made a commitment that we would review that recommendation in February 2022 with a view towards either continuing with it or stepping it down from the time the children go back after the midterm break.  We are in the process of reviewing the evidence at the moment.  We will consider it over the next ten days and make a recommendation on that in line with the other recommendations that will be made at the NPHET meeting on 17 February.</p></speech>

Dr. Glynn is coming to this from health perspective.  Everything NPHET has done over the past year has been through the health lens.  As a teacher, I must say that mask-wearing is very difficult.  So much language is not just about what comes from the voice box; it is about the facial expressions, how the mouth moves and how words are formed.  I know that many teachers and indeed, pupils, are struggling with this.  I ask that the phasing out of mask-wearing might be expedited.  If people look at their local bar or restaurant, they will see people are unmasked and they are wondering why the children should have to continue to wear masks.  I know it is being reviewed but I think it could be expedited.  It is inevitable that mask-wearing in schools will stop.  If that is the case, as a teacher, I ask for it to be expedited and for some degree of normality be brought back to classrooms.  Is there any room for it to be expedited or brought forward a bit?</p></speech>

It is clear that many have.  More than 100,000 children have been vaccinated to date.  On the basis of the timelines that are there, every child who wants to, can have the opportunity to be fully vaccinated by the time they go back to school after the mid-term break.  That was the rationale underpinning that recommendation.  It is true that you can go to the pub, but everyone in the pub beside you has had the opportunity to be vaccinated, boosted and fully protected.  That is a key difference.  The vast majority of the 100,000 vaccinated children have only received one dose.  They will get their second dose over the next two to three weeks.  Hopefully, many others will come forward and get vaccinated in the interim.  Hopefully, at that point we will be in a position to update the recommendation.</p></speech>

It is a point that I raised around 12 months ago.  Obviously, Dr. Holohan is the Irish number one in terms of public health advice, but he has opposite numbers in each European country.  All of them are receiving data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC.  It has really concerned me right throughout Covid that the ECDC has 290 staff and an annual budget of &euro;60 million.  It covers a European-wide population of 500 million people.  Looking at the United States, its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, has an annual budget of $11.1 billion and 15,000 staff.  The ECDC has been in existence for 17 years.  It still has not been significantly beefed up during the Covid pandemic.  Does Dr. Holohan have concerns about that?  Has he articulated those concerns to his opposite numbers across Europe?  Does he anticipate that we will see improvements in that regard?  We are very reliant on Dr. Holohan, but he is very reliant on mothership Europe.  It seems to me that the cogs in the wheel are working, but only working, and Covid was the ideal time to increase budget, staff and beef up this organisation.  Is Dr. Holohan concerned, as we slowly come out of Covid, that this entity still lacks firepower?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.972" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#J01100"><p>Obviously, I have been on the ECDC board for a short time over the Covid period.  Each member state of the European Union has a position on the board and on the advisory council.  We participate in that way.  The ECDC mobilises a lot of the expertise of institutions around Europe.  As I said in public before, one of the changes I have certainly noticed is the absence of the UK expertise.  The UK is a large country, but in the space of public health, even as large country, it has always punched above its weight in terms of what it contributes to international thinking and capacity around management of public health.  I have noticed the absence of that from the ECDC mechanisms, as I am quite sure colleagues around Europe have.  We continue to dialogue through the different mechanisms that the ECDC has in place and we must not forget the Commission.  The ECDC is not the only instrument that exists at Commission level to respond to pandemics.  There is the Health Security Committee as well as all the formal political arrangements that exist between member states.  The European Union is in the process of establishing, under a new board, and new entity called the European Health Emergency preparedness and Response Authority, HERA.  It is about learning the lessons and applying, first of all, bigger budgets and stronger decision-making to measures that are taken as a community at a European level.  The first emphasis in all of this is on co-ordinating on what are called "medical countermeasures".  There is a board that is made up of members from each individual member state.  I am the Irish representative as things stand.  We are two meetings in and the next meeting of that organisation is due to take place early next week.  We need to also factor that into our response capacity at a European level.  Yes, the ECDC is an enormous organisation with a very high repute, and justifiably so.  We always a keep close eye not just on what happens at the ECDC, but on what comes through the UK authorities, the CDC and the WHO.  All of those kinds of things inform our responses.  We are not in any sense dependent, if you like, on one source of guidance and advice.  Yes, there are probably European lessons that can be learned about how we can mobilise expertise and guidance and advice quickly.  There have been stages during a pandemic at which we have been very much assisted by the process of rapid risk assessments that the ECDC has in place.  There is no question that on a few occasions, we would have liked to have had some of them sooner.  That is not a criticism.  I am quite sure, as Europe looks at the measures that can be taken to try to strengthen its own defence against pandemics like this, this will be part of its assessment, for the reasons the Deputy outlined.</p></speech>

I have praised NPHET  which has done a lot of good work.  However, there are some areas in which NPHET and, indeed, the other cogs of public health could be accused of tardiness over the past 12 months.  There are two that I wish to reference, in particular, and I hope Dr. Holohan can comment on them.  The first is the report compiled by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health on addressing vitamin D deficiency in Ireland.  We undertook a significant body of work.  Expert witnesses appeared before the committee and strong recommendations were made in the report.  The report went to NPHET and I think it is with the Food Safety Authority at the moment.  The second was the report of the Covid-19 Rapid Testing Group on antigen testing.</p><p>Again, it was a Government report - Professor Ferguson's report - and NPHET dismissed elements of it.  They were two critical pieces in our national armoury against Covid that I believe there was tardiness in introducing.  Will Dr. Holohan offer some commentary months later on the reason for the tardiness and if NPHET has any regrets about the lack of progression on those two areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.975" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#K00200"><p>I will make an initial response to the question on vitamin D and Dr. Glynn might be in a position to respond further.  In general terms, NPHET has no difficulty and never did with the measures recommended by the committee.  They are incorporated into the general advice and guidance on the use of vitamin D and the promotion of that as an issue, in particular among some of the people who were at risk in that regard.  We have no issue about that.<br/><br/>On the Ferguson report, the Minister decided to establish a separate process and asked Professor Ferguson to oversee the group he appointed to advise in relation to that, of which Dr. Glynn was a member.  We were always fully informed of what was happening in relation to that.  In the interests of time, I will not go back over some of the things I previously said about antigen tests.  The question for us was never one of whether an antigen test was a good one or not.  We knew, within reason, the different performance levels of different tests that were approved and available.  It was always about the circumstances in which they were applied, and then also how the result of the test was interpreted by the person who did the test.  We were concerned in particular about the circumstances and the level of incidence of the disease.  I refer to doing tests that work well in a situation where you have got high incidences of the disease like in outbreak situations or in the kind of high prevalent situation we have had in the course of recent weeks.  They are not tests that work well and that we should rely upon when the disease incidence is very low.  It is not so much about the tests but about how the test is used and in particular then how people understand that test.  I shared some evidence that we have from our weekly survey earlier to show that a very significant portion of people throughout the pandemic who have symptoms use an antigen test and get a negative result and then do not go on to follow the basic public health advice around self-isolation.  Self-isolation when you have symptoms is the public health measure that will prevent transmission.  Our concern is that some people interpret it in a way that a negative result means that you do not have Covid, and you can go about your business.  That is the reason that we have a concern about that, rather than having any difficulty <i>per se</i>with what Professor Ferguson had to say.  Dr. Glynn was a member of that group.</p></speech>

Our expert advisory group, through HIQA, did an evidence review and it found no evidence to support the view that vitamin D could either prevent Covid in the first instance or was associated with a reduction in severe outcomes for those who were infected.</p> <p>  I am fully on board with supporting vitamin D more broadly, but we have to be careful about how we then extrapolate from that to suggest that it might have a preventative effect for Covid-19 when the evidence does not support that to date.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with long Covid, which is an issue other speakers have already raised.  I was looking at the progress being made in the UK on this, and my understanding is that there are now more than 80 NHS clinics specifically dealing with long Covid.  What is the proposal for setting up specialist clinics in this area?  I am not sure if the witnesses touched on that earlier.  Perhaps they did and I missed it.  There is evidence from several European countries.  In one survey, for instance, 40% of patients had persistent fatigue 60 days after first being diagnosed with Covid.  Sixty days later, another 30% were suffering from breathlessness.  Do we need to set up specialist clinics to deal with this issue because there are many people who have long Covid?</p></speech>

The HSE is developing a model of care around providing services for people with long Covid.  The incidence of long Covid is being debated across the scientific community at the moment.  In the UK there is another survey, for example, that suggests that approximately 2.5% of adults aged 35 to 70 years have suffered from long Covid, and it appears that it is much less than that in children and adolescents.  The key message to get across is that the best way to prevent long Covid in the first place is to prevent yourself getting infected, and the best way to do that at this point is to come forward and get vaccinated if you have not already.  That must remain our key message.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's other point, the HSE is developing a model of care around this, and we can furnish details.</p></speech>

From Dr. Glynn's information, has there been any indication of the number of young people who have been adversely affected and who are still having to deal with long Covid?</p></speech>

One can extrapolate out from that in terms of the total numbers that have been impacted over the course of the pandemic.  I am not seeking to minimise the impact of this for individuals; I am simply making the point that we need much more research to better understand the spectrum that is long Covid, exactly what symptoms people are suffering, how long they are suffering with them and what they can do to bring about resolution of those symptoms over time.  The HSE is working on this, but much more work needs to be done.</p></speech>

One is hospitals coming back to providing services.  I recently spoke to someone who is working in a hospital operating theatre.  In the past two weeks they had a full complement of theatre staff and they had to do a particular operation because it was urgent, but they were not able to do their elective list which they normally did on a particular day in the week.  They had a full complement of theatre staff and of staff in the wards and there were empty beds on the wards.  What is being done now to get all of the hospitals back up and running and doing elective surgeries given the significant backlog of elective surgeries in every area, including orthopaedic and paediatric surgery?  What is being done in that area to get every hospital up and running in respect of those services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.985" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#K01200"><p>There are very significant plans that both the Minister and the HSE have in relation to it.  NPHET is not a part of the planning of all of that.  The HSE in the first instance must put in place plans to begin to re-establish services, as Deputy Burke rightly said, as quickly as it reasonably can.  That is necessary given the significant volume of activity because of the backlog that will have developed, of necessity, in terms of access to some services while capacity within the hospital system was impacted both by dealing with Covid and the need to maintain measures to try to prevent transmission of Covid.  As I am sure Deputy Burke knows, the Omicron variant we have dealt with, and are still dealing with, has much greater capacity for easy spread in hospital environments, so-called nosocomial transmission, so the HSE has had to maintain a very high standard of infection prevention and control measures to protect patients in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.986" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#K01300"><p>Where there is capacity in a hospital to do elective surgery, and there are empty beds, are we then not making the waiting lists longer in hospitals?  This is occurring in hospitals right around the country.</p><p>What can be done to use beds that are empty and theatre space that is available to make sure we deal with people who require urgent care?  Surely we can put in place enough mechanisms to protect people coming in and at the same time deliver the service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.988" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#L00200"><p>That is exactly the intention.  The question now is on the measures that need to be in place in healthcare environments.  These are measures on infection prevention and control to be put in place, considered and overseen by national guidance and locally applied guidance for each individual hospital or healthcare site.</p></speech>

The approach that seems to be very much entrenched at this stage is that elective surgery cannot be done and people cannot be brought in unless it is urgent.  This is what is being applied in many HSE hospitals throughout the country.</p></speech>

People are contacting us because they have been on a waiting list for elective surgery for six, 12 or 18 months and nothing is happening.  Consultants and nurses as well as administrative staff are being contacted on a constant basis and being asked where people are on the list.</p></speech>

The Irish College of General Practitioners came before the committee recently.  One of the issues it raised was that it had concerns about the level of support for GP practices and funding for support staff in practices.  It also raised the issue of the number of GPs who will be retiring in the next five to ten years.  It made a proposal for the establishment of a high-level working group with the Department of Health, the HSE, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Medical Organisation and patient representative groups.  What is the view of Dr. Holohan on the establishment of this group?</p></speech>

I will take this opportunity to say the body of general practice has been a critical part of our response.  In particular I will mention some of the individuals who have led the response in general practice, such as Mary Favier and Nuala O'Connor.  There are plenty of other individuals I could identify, including those who established and lead the GP buddy system.  Our GP community in this country has been exceptional in how it has stood up.  The public has seen this in the enormous volume of vaccinations GPs were able to get through, in particular stepping up with the booster campaign in the weeks running into Christmas.  We have seen it all the way through in how GPs have dealt with being on the front line of the response.  I am, of course, fully in favour of anything at all that in principle would facilitate constructive input and dialogue with general practice as a key component of the healthcare system.</p></speech>

They have been providing reassurance, explanations and guidance to their patients who are among the vulnerable people we expressed concern about.

I had business in the D&aacute;il where the Social Democrats had tabled a motion so I had to drop out of the meeting for a while.</p> <p>  I join others in paying tribute to all of the work done by NPHET.  Personally and individually the witnesses must be absolutely exhausted at this stage.  On behalf of my constituents and many others, I thank them very much for their enormous work over the past two years.  This meeting is really an update on the lifting of restrictions.  It is very welcome to hear the upbeat projections forecast by the Chief Medical Officer.  We are all greatly relieved and looking forward to getting back to normality in our lives and doing things we have missed for so long.  This is a great tribute to everybody involved in the national effort against Covid.</p> <p>  I want to raise questions about the cohort of people who are not able to start going out and are not necessarily celebrating the lifting of restrictions.  I am speaking in particular about the very sizeable cohort of people who are immunocompromised.  To a large extent they have been in the dark, and they are still in the dark, with regard to plans for their protection.  I want to raise several issues.  Obviously there is the question of another booster and a fourth vaccine for them.  They do not know what the plan is.  How will they find out where will they get the vaccine and when it will be rolled out?  Does Dr. Holohan have information for this group of people?</p> <p>  We know from the work Rachel Lavin did that there are in excess of 109,000 people in this category.  This is a substantial number of people.  To a large extent they feel more vulnerable and more exposed now that restrictions have been lifted.  All kinds of issues arise for families who have an immunocompromised member.  What about children going to school now that things are more relaxed?  There is a greater danger of the virus being brought into the home.  Can Dr. Holohan shed any light on this?  When is this cohort of people likely to receive their booster in a fourth vaccine?  When is it likely to be rolled out?  When will they be notified of this?</p> <p>  My next question is on antivirals in situations where people who are immunocompromised contract the virus.  In the UK there is a clear plan for the roll-out of antivirals for such patients if they contract the condition.  There does not seem to be any plan here.  When is the plan likely to be announced?  What role will NPHET have in this?  I would appreciate responses on these issues.</p></speech>

A fourth dose has already been recommended and many people will be due it because there has been an interval of three months since they had the third dose.  If it has been three months or more since immunocompromised people had a third dose they should avail of a fourth dose.  Honestly, I do not have the detail here on how these people are being communicated with but I can follow up on this afterwards and get Deputy Shortall a written response if that is helpful.  I can do it quickly.  I just do not have it to hand this morning.</p></speech>

People who are campaigning in this area, especially cancer patients and blood cancer patients, are completely in the dark.</p><p>That is a serious problem.  We have the vaccines.

I do not have the details on the channels through which it is doing that and how many people are already eligible.  I will follow up on this and get the Deputy that detail.  I reassure her that it should be a proactive process.  It should not come down to the individual to identify himself or herself as being ready.  The HSE should reach out to those people to tell them they are due their fourth dose and ask them to come forward.</p></speech>

That number, which may be 100,000 - a figure I would not dispute - will be very heterogeneous as the Deputy knows.  It will be important for individuals in that group, some of whom have specific reasons for being immunocompromised, to also talk to their individual clinician.  Many of them are under the care of expert hospital-based clinicians in that regard.  Vaccination for people who are immunocompromised is an ongoing question that arises on a clinical level for the individual, often more so than as a public health measure generally.  As Dr. Glynn said, that advice is already there and the HSE is in the course of that.  We will give the Deputy an update on that and what the actual progress is on the numbers.</p> <p>  On the question of antivirals, work is under way to set out what those pathways of care would be for those people and what role testing would play in that to ensure that the people, often those in the higher risk groups, who might benefit from the supply of antivirals we may have will be identified quickly in their disease course and given access to those antivirals to match those plans and arrangements that are in place in the UK, as referred to by the Deputy.  That work has been undertaken through Dr. Colm Henry's office in the HSE to put those models of care effectively in place and to inform the use antivirals.</p></speech>

The absence of a plan for the roll-out of antivirals adds to the sense of insecurity and vulnerability of people who are immunocompromised.  It heightens the fear of picking up the virus.  Given the fact that we have ordered considerable supplies, why is there not a roll-out plan?  Is it possible to get an update on that?</p></speech>

There will be a plan but I am not going to put a timeline on it on his behalf.  That work is under way and we are in discussion on it.  Our discussion between the HSE and NPHET has been twofold: on the need for the HSE to put those plans in place for the reasons outlined by the Deputy and on the measures we need to take, either as part of a joint procurement arrangement or a direct bilateral agreement with the companies involved to get access to the appropriate supplies of these antivirals.  When we look at this, it is not just the experience with Omicron.  Some will conclude that Omicron, as a less severe disease, might draw less on a potential quantum of antivirals.  However, we need to maintain a focus on the potential value of a stockpile of these kinds of drugs as we had in the past with Tamiflu and Relenza for the purpose of influenza.  To all intents and purposes, it is there as an insurance policy for people who might benefit from access to antivirals in the event that we have a further variant.  If might be particularly important if there is vaccine escape in the context of a new variant.  That is where our focus has been.  We will ensure that Dr. Henry's office gets the Deputy an update on precisely where the HSE is at in regard to pathways of care.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Holohan for that.  I asked a question about the time lag between the recommendations and the roll-out, as outlined in the case I just mentioned.

We are not alone in that regard.  Across the EU, approximately ten countries have decided to offer boosters but that means that the majority have not yet made that recommendation.  NIAC has been in touch with us in recent days.  It is actively looking at this matter but obviously there is a lot to weigh up.  We will wait until we hear further from it.

What work, if any, has NPHET done to date on that?  Has there been a look back and a learning of the lessons, be they good and bad, from the experience of the past two years?  Is that under way or when is it likely to happen?  What are the mechanisms for drawing down those lessons?</p></speech>

The Government has decided on the basis of the Minister's proposal to establish a group led by Professor Brady that will be focused on strengthening our responsible public-health point of view and its focus will be on public health.  The extent to which we can be of assistance to that group, we will try to draw on whatever lessons we can from the objective data and our performance relative to those.  We are doing some work to compile that and any other lessons that NPHET might be in a position to assist that group with.  Professor Brady and most of the members of the group have been selected as people from outside the country or outside of our immediate pandemic response to provide a one-step-removed assessment of the issues that need to be addressed to strengthen our response so that we can have a level of independence.</p></speech>

There are potentially many different levels and I do not want to take up too much of her time.  On the response to a new emergent variant, let us take the Omicron variant as an example.  It was only a matter of a day or two from the international reports to the point at which we had a series of meetings over the course of a weekend, which culminated in measures that the Government agreed to put in place.  In the first instance, they were focused on border measures and increasing the possibility of our testing systems and public health system to catch and control the spread of this variant when it arose.  That response was very rapid.  They are the kind of actions one will see again if there is an emerging variant and we will continue to keep a focus on that.  We have that set of arrangements in place; watchful waiting in anticipation of and then mobilising based on that advice.  I will not say that is easier to do but the contingency challenge at the other end of the spectrum is where the HSE has to figure how to respond to what might occur in the future in the footprint of the vaccination programme, putting in place a staffing and contractual set of arrangements to provide the facilities and the wherewithal to deliver those vaccines within short periods.  That is a very complicated task based on the advice we will give and work on with the HSE.  NPHET will be doing that work in the next period.  I am just using vaccinations as an example.</p><p>We will apply exactly the same thinking to what will need to be in place in the future with regard to testing and contact tracing.  We can ensure that we have something which is focused on what we think is proportional to what the disease is throwing at us, but is capable of responding much more rapidly than we might have been able to respond as a country.  That is not a criticism of anybody, given that everything that we experienced was new.  There was a need to provide enormous capacity for testing, tracing, surveillance and vaccination in short periods when that need arose.  That work is ongoing at present.  Some of it is in the Department and some is in the HSE.</p></speech>

Dr. Holohan said they should be reasonably safe and that they should be able to live their lives, but there certainly still is a significant amount of fear abroad.  It is possibly quite reasonable, since we have come through a very difficult two years.  The messaging about people who are immunocompromised has been quite clear.  What do we need to do about that?  We have students who are unable to attend third level institutions because they are immunocompromised and feel that they cannot do that.  We have people who are concerned about work.  Could we tease out exactly what the messaging for those people is or what we need to communicate to them about their well-being and safety?</p></speech>

As I said, clinical assessments, as well as public health assessments, will be important for those individuals with regard to the measures to be taken, such as vaccinations, medicines, how they respond to symptoms when they have them, and measures that other members of their households might have to take, because there is a requirement for their household members to limit the possibility of them picking up this infection and transmitting it to those individuals.  A number of those measures will be required.  Many immunocompromised people doubtless have a high degree of understanding of the nature of their immunity and the things they need to do to protect themselves from a range of infections that were already there.  Many common respiratory viral infections have similar potential for severe illness from their point of view.  They would be practised and familiar with the kinds of things that they need to do to manage and mitigate their own individual risk.  It is a matter of adding Covid to those kinds of considerations in order that as they get out and about, they will be conscious of the necessary basic protective measures.</p> <p>  If the immunocompromised people are the concern, the basic protective measures that limit transmission will still have value for them, including social distancing, staying away from crowds, avoiding indoor environments and meeting up with people who are not from their own household, particularly in environments where there is a risk of transmission, and use of the high-grade masks that have been recommended for those individuals.  Dr. Glynn covered the point earlier about the importance of those people being vaccinated when their time comes, which will be three months after their third booster.  For them, that continued topping up of a vaccine is a question which is different to the topping up and boosting of vaccines for the rest of the population, because of their specific vulnerabilities.</p></speech>

Members get many queries about that.  People are afraid.  After the last two years, that is understandable.  It is useful for us to know how to communicate and respond to those concerns.  I have two other questions.  Does Dr. Holohan think that there should be more public provision of antigen tests, medical-grade masks and so on?  For the past two years, people have obviously been buying all these things themselves, but there is a recommendation regarding high-grade face masks.  Is it NPHET's opinion that this should be more readily available and provided by the State?  It is expensive.  We are hopefully coming out of the other side of this but we will still hope that people will continue to use masks and antigen tests for the next while, to make sure that they are well and safe and that they stop the spread.  Does Dr. Holohan think this should be made more available by the State?</p></speech>

The consideration of those matters and how these materials are paid and provided for is generally a consideration which is separate to our work.  We recommend the who, when and how, but not about payment.  There will be some exceptions to that, such as when we are talking about cases and contacts, since the HSE has a provision to supply antigen tests to those individuals because we had specific advice about how to move from testing contacts through PCR testing to testing contacts through antigen testing.  We wanted to ensure there was not an impediment to the take-up of that because it was putting substantial pressure on our PCR system.  That is why we made that recommendation.  Free provision of those tests for those reasons was important to take the pressure off the PCR system in the weeks running into Christmas.  There have been other attempts at measures to make some elements of the pandemic response that the Senator mentioned more affordable.  NPHET has not got into making advice on the question of payment for some of these things outside of its guidance.</p></speech>

I want to get his views on the next vaccination strategy and what that will look like.  I understand that a new vaccine will be ready for March.  I am not an epidemiologist, a doctor, or anything like that but these are just some things that have been said to me.  Given that we know there is maybe a seasonal element to this disease, in the way that the flu has a seasonal element, does Dr. Holohan think that we would be better off waiting until later to start rolling out a vaccination in order that people have immunity from the vaccination going into the winter rather than waiting until October or November, when the virus would likely begin to spread again?  There is a matter of long-term planning.  Will Dr. Holohan explain, since I do not understand, how he plans to line up the next round of vaccinations or boosters with the seasonal element of this disease?</p></speech>

I have a fair sense of what I think is in play.  There is increasingly recognition at European level, with the Omicron variant having helped in this advance in thinking, that we have a high level of immunity in populations across Europe, which is certainly true in this country, having done so well with vaccinations and boosters, and also given the high levels of infection.  We have seen the performance of the vaccines, which have held up so well in preventing an infection from becoming a severe infection.  We have shifted our emphasis from one where we attempt to control transmission and severe impacts of the disease to one where we focus on controlling the severe impact of the disease.  That question arises for every element of our response to the pandemic, including our vaccination response.</p> <p>  Almost three weeks ago, I wrote to NIAC to ask it to begin to consider what the long-term plan might be.  We have not yet arrived at a point where we can say that this is endemic to the point that we know we will see a seasonal pattern of this infection occurring in the wintertime, receding as winter recedes and so on, in the way that we see with many respiratory viral infections, particularly flu.  That has not yet been established.  As I pointed to earlier in the meeting, we see a small uptick in the number of infections detected in the 19 to 24-year-old age group.  We will keep a close eye on that.  I am not expressing any concern about it but simply am making the point that we have observed this.  As other countries have eased measures in the last weeks, they have observed an increase in transmission, which the Senator might have seen.  We do not know exactly what the pattern will be.  We will have to wait and see as our understanding improves.</p><p>I refer to the possibility that we end up dealing with a disease that creates a greater challenge for us in winter than at other times of the year and our emphasis would be much more on protecting the people who are most at risk from the severe effects of the disease.  That might have a significant impact on the nature and structure of a vaccine programme.  As the Senator stated, companies are in the process of developing new formulations that are more specifically targeted at Omicron and so on.  As to how many, if any, of those might become part of our response, these are still the questions that we and every other country in Europe are seeking to try to answer.  We need to keep working to ensure we are able to shape the response, if one likes, based on the answers to those questions.  They are all very good questions.</p></speech>

I thank them for all the work they have done in the past two years.</p></speech>

In the context of the work that is going on, obviously the elderly are particularly vulnerable to Covid.  I refer to the importance of the vaccination programme and booster campaign for the elderly.  In the context of flu, which is of particular concern every winter, what lessons can we learn and extrapolate from Covid?  I am thinking of HEPA filters in schools, for example.  Should such filters be used in areas where elderly people congregate, such as small community rooms used for get-togethers on Friday mornings or funeral homes, which are generally small rooms.  Funeral homes are often attended by a significant number of elderly people when a relative passes away.  They may be there for two hours or two and a half hours.  Are there lessons from Covid in terms of the continued use of hand sanitisation and possibly the use of masks by the elderly or immunocompromised in such settings?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.1034" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#O00400"><p>In principle, the answer is "Yes".  Many of the measures that are and have been important in limiting the transmission of Covid will continue to be important measures either for us to recommend or for individuals to decide to take on for themselves.  The benefit of some of the measures - the Senator identified some of them - is not going to be just in terms of transmission of Covid; it may also have benefits in terms of transmission of a range of respiratory viral infections and possibly other viral infections.  I refer to the basic point on hand washing.  It is one of the things that has been emphasised in the context of Covid, but it has benefits in terms of transmission of other respiratory viral infections.  It also has benefits in the context of transmission of gastroenteritis of one kind or another, as well as food-borne illnesses and so on.  To the extent that we can all up our game, so to speak, as individuals and keep our hands washed in all circumstances, that is a general benefit in terms of transmission.</p> <p>  Mask wearing is something people will choose to do.  I expect and hope there will be a good level of understanding in the population that even if we move away from recommending the continued use of masks as a regulatory measure in defined circumstances, it will still be a sensible choice for individuals if they are out and about, such as in the circumstances referred to by the Senator, where there may be a predominance of elderly people in close contact.  It might make sense for those individuals to wear a mask, particularly at times when there is a very prevalent level of infection from a respiratory viral infection such as flu or Covid.  At those times, we may recommend that it is a good time for people in a vulnerable situation to choose to wear a mask when in close contact.  If you know you will not be able to maintain social distance, particularly in an indoor environment, and you are vulnerable, wearing a mask in those situations will continue to be sensible because it will protect you from many things other than just flu, particularly, perhaps, in winter.  These kinds of sensible behaviours will be dialled in to the culture and what we expect to see.</p> <p>  In the context of masks, it is important to point out that at the moment anybody who is a case between days 7 and 10 can resume their activities if they are symptom-free so long as they wear a higher grade mask.  One can expect to see people out and about wearing masks who have been cases.  People who are boosted close contacts will no longer have to restrict their movements.  There will continue to be advice on mask wearing in particular situations but we expect many people to appropriately choose to wear a mask as a way of protecting themselves into the future.  Those are basic lessons - I think the public has learned them as well as we have - on measures that can help in terms of population transmission of many common viral infections.</p></speech>

The COVAX facility has received surplus from this country and other countries for distribution in developing countries.  If another variant or threat arises, is it likely to occur in a country with a low vaccination rate at present?  Is that further evidence of the importance of the COVAX facility and assisting countries with low vaccination rates?</p></speech>

Several factors contribute to the risk of the emergence of a variant.  One factor is the total volume of infection, that is, the number of opportunities the virus has to transmit.  That gives it an opportunity to mutate each time.  The more transmission, the more such opportunities there are.  One thing we do not yet fully understand is whether the virus is passing in and out of certain animal hosts, which might be giving opportunities for variants to emerge.  In areas with low vaccination uptake, the opportunity for the virus to spread is much greater and that certainly might contribute to that risk at a global level.  There are circumstances in which chronic infection in people who may have certain immune deficiencies can present the virus with opportunities to mutate.  It is a general principle in the context of global control of this disease as well as our protection of our population in this country that the more people we can get vaccinated with vaccines that we know work, the more of a contribution we are making globally as well as locally to protecting ourselves from the effects of this disease.  In principle, the answer to the Senator's question is "Yes".</p></speech>

That decision was publicised, so I am sure there will be demands or views expressed by the general population that we should follow suit.

We anticipate guidance and advice from it in the near term in respect of measures countries should be considering taking in response to emerging from the significant challenge of Omicron that we have experienced in recent weeks.  We will be considering that.  Second, we have a well-established system run through our colleagues in HIQA.  On our behalf, they do a detailed ongoing analysis of measures in place in countries across Europe.  We have that available to us for major decisions.  We had a detailed account of that available to us in making the decision to give the advice we issued for 20 January.  That will be reviewed and updated for the next meeting of NPHET for exactly the reasons suggested by the Senator.  That meeting is due to be held on 17 February.  The restrictions and advice that are currently in place will all be reviewed at that time and available to us will be an updated assessment of what exactly is in place in all European countries as part of the considerations we will undertake on the advice we will give to the Government after that meeting on 17 February.</p></speech>

In response to an earlier question, I said consideration is to be given by the Department and the Minister to whether there will be a follow-on from NPHET.  However we manage to establish ourselves in responding to this disease, there will always be a need for multidisciplinary public health advice to inform any decisions the Government has to take.  The decisions every government has to take in response to Covid are multifaceted but independent public health advice is a key component.</p> <p>  We have been lucky in this country that we have been able to maintain the public health advice.  In other countries, the extent to which clear public health advice has informed decisions that have been made has not been as evident or as strong.  I expect there will be a desire here to maintain that, and whatever mechanism is in place will still have to have all the relevant disciplines and will still involve the Chief Medical Officer.  That is the future of the advice in that context.  The details of it will be a matter for the Minister.</p></speech>

A few issues struck me during the meeting.  The virus has been changing and there are different variants and so on.  This may be an obvious question, but is there a process whereby the vaccines will at some stage be changed to strengthen people's immune system against the latest given variant?  How long will that take and what is the process?  At what stage will the various companies respond with a modification of their vaccines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.1042" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#P00300"><p>The companies do exactly that.  They try to reformulate the vaccines to respond to changes in the virus.  As the Chairman may be aware, some of the newer vaccines are based on this new mRNA technology, namely, those from Pfizer and Moderna.  They are very targeted, if I can put it in that way, so if the virus figures out a way of escaping some of that protection, there may be a requirement to reformulate the vaccine in response to that new viral challenge.  That work is happening at the moment.</p> <p>  A number of factors are then taken into account.  The vaccines will be reformulated by the companies and they will then have to go through a process of authorisation.  There will then have to be a process of decision-making within each individual country as to whether we can use them, and whether there is a need for us to shift from one type of vaccine to another, something on which we would get advice from NIAC.  We have seen a change in the profile of this disease in respect of its virulence, so we continually have to assess the questions of to whom we target the vaccines, what type of vaccines are used and at what frequency they are given.  An important question in that context will relate to the basic purposes of our response, which in the first instance will put a greater emphasis in future on protecting people who are at the greatest risk in respect of the disease from severe infection and consequences, rather than controlling transmission.  That is likely to have an impact on the shape of vaccine programmes into the future, irrespective of where vaccine companies go with the formulation of their vaccines.</p></speech>

Does NPHET foresee a second round of booster doses for the general population in the next six or nine months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.1044" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020200002#P00500"><p>That is one question on which NIAC is advising and it probably would not be wise of me to guess, but there was a strong case for boosting the entire population in the way that we have.  It looks to us as though the third dose that people got as a booster was important in restoring, in particular, some of the lost protection against severe infection.  We think that is likely to hold up pretty well now and the same case may not exist for boosting the entire population.  It may well be the case there will be a focus on people who are vulnerable, although I am not predicting that.  NIAC will be independent in respect of the advice it gives us but, as the Chairman suggested, there is a likelihood we might move on from that recommendation that informed the first booster campaign and not necessarily assume there will be another round of booster doses at a defined interval.  That is exactly the question on which NIAC is focused at the moment.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to encourage people not to wait for that but to come forward and get the booster that is currently available.  Another example of how impactful our current vaccines are is that yesterday, fewer than 20 people who had been boosted were in our intensive care facilities.  There have been hundreds of thousands of cases over recent weeks, yet yesterday fewer than 20 people who had been boosted were in critical care.  Obviously, we want nobody to be in critical care but that statistic points to the effectiveness of our current vaccines in preventing serious illness.</p></speech>

I think the figure was 48 or 49 last week.  Was that over a long period?  If it had been announced a couple of months ago, this would have been a headline figure but this was just buried within a newspaper article or statement.  The figures did not seem to have the same impact.  How important is that message in respect of reminding people that the virus is still a danger and that people are continuing to die from the disease?</p></speech>

We report deaths on a weekly basis and 49 is the total.  The total number of deaths reported thus far is 6,136.  The Chairman is correct that this has been a fatal disease for some people, even if we can see that the protection against mortality as a severe outcome of infection is significant for those who have been boosted, whereby a real protection can be seen arising from that.  There will be people who are at risk, particularly those who have not been vaccinated or boosted or who have significant underlying medical conditions or vulnerabilities.  We know, because we have been examining some of this, that the excess mortality rate in Ireland compares well with that in many other countries in what we have observed over the course of the pandemic.  That is one factor that will be taken into account when we stand back and assess the nature of the response here.</p></speech>

Many of our population are now afraid of crowds and there has been a psychological impact in moving from being in lockdown to being able to freely enter pubs, restaurants and everything else.  It is as though that is now all behind us but that psychological impact remains for many people.  Young people say they are still nervous about hugging their granny, shaking hands and so on.  When will we hear the message officially, whether from politicians, NPHET or whoever else, that it is now safe for children, in particular, and adults to hug their granny, father, mother or loved ones?  Do our guests have a view on whether we are getting to the day when that positive message will be put out there?</p></speech>

It has never been our advice not to hug your granny or whatever.  The measures people have been asked to take have related to cutting down on social contact between people who are vulnerable and others who might infect them.  People were asked to stay apart from one another over the past two years.</p><p>This has limited many of these opportunities.  People can now conduct sensible risk assessment for themselves on their own individual risk.  They should ask themselves whether they have symptoms, whether they are properly boosted, whether the people they are meeting are vulnerable, what are the circumstances in which they are meeting and whether it is indoors and well ventilated, whether they are using face masks appropriately when recommended, and whether they are using hand sanitiser and so on.  When people are following the recommendations and interactions are taking place between people who are not symptomatic, we have not said they should not be hugging.  Interactions between grandchildren and grandparents are important for all sorts of reasons.  It is not that there will be a day when we say it is okay to hug grandchildren again.  If people are following all of the basic public health advice and doing everything they can to limit the risk of transmission then it is appropriate in that context for people to consider those kinds of interactions as part of how they live their lives.  It is important that we get back to these basic measures and interactions between people.  Common sense will have to apply.  If one of the grandchildren has a runny nose, they should stay away that day.  It is these basic measures we are trying to promote for the whole population.  If people can observe these basic measures I see no reason people should not resume this type of interaction.  It is perfectly normal, natural and understandable between grandparents and grandchildren.</p></speech>

It is important that we have this conversation and this message.  It has been said during the meeting by many members but as Chair of the health committee I thank the witnesses for the work they did, for their accessibility to the committee, for their voices and time and for the commitment they made collectively to keep us all safe.  As one of the members said, they have navigated us through a difficult period.  This period is still not over but hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I know that hard and difficult decisions have been made.  Many of the witnesses have been personally targeted for having made decisions that, ultimately, were made by politicians and not by the witnesses.  I thank them.  The contributions at today's meeting have been very helpful.  As someone suggested, I look forward to seeing a slimmed-down version of NPHET.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.</p></speech>

People will form their own judgments.  We have always done our best and tried to make the calls as honestly as we could and did so in good faith.  I believe I am speaking for everybody involved in NPHET - and there are 32 of them to answer an earlier question - when I say it is a privilege to be involved in a position such as this and to be able to influence and provide some support and help.  We take seriously the job and the opportunity to speak to the committee and have our voices out there, not as an end in itself but as a means for the public to be able to hear and inform themselves on the risks they take.

On how this decision was arrived at or what the inputs were, I cannot elaborate as I was not there.  On the Commissioner's appearance before this committee last May and his commitment to strengthen the Irish language, I submit that he has made extensive efforts to progress that.  Since then, as outlined in the opening statement, there is a strategic Irish language group he chairs.  There is a working group that I chair.  That has sat seven times since its inception.  We have developed our Irish language strategy and implementation plan.  That was due to be launched prior to Christmas but we had to postpone it because of Covid.  The plan is to launch it during the two-week Seachtain na Gaeilge.  That is a very significant development.</p> <p>  There are many actions in the plan that aim to increase the awareness of Irish language in the organisation as well as support and underpin our statutory obligations in terms of the Irish language.  It also recognises that the Irish language is very much a community language.  It contains three different pillars: recruitment and workforce planning, which is about our staffing and how we make sure the Gaeltacht areas are sufficiently staffed with people who are sufficiently trained and meet the standard of fluency required; Irish language development and awareness raising, which takes on many forms, including the development of online courses, one of which has already been done, in addition to supporting people if they want to go to external service providers to upskill etc.; and the f&aacute;inne, which comprises three strands, including everything from the c&uacute;pla focal all the way to the gold f&aacute;inne.  These are initiatives in the strategy and they illustrate the organisation and the Commissioner's desire, understanding of the obligations, and commitment in progressing the Irish language.</p> <p>  In addition, there is the Irish language promotion and engagement.  In so far as the Irish language is a community language, we want it to be a community language within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well.  That is one of the reasons the c&uacute;pla focal f&aacute;inne came into being.  There was an understanding and acceptance that many of us had quite a lot of vocabulary but perhaps did not have the confidence to engage and use it and improve.  That commitment is from recruit garda&iacute; all the way to the Garda Commissioner and Garda staff throughout the organisation.  There is no doubting the commitment of the organisation and the Commissioner in meeting our obligations in terms of the Irish language.</p></speech>

Following a series of studies, reviews and reports, the consultation surrounding that new package has been going on for a number of years with extensive engagement, as has been said, with the various stakeholders in the policing administration, including the Garda Commissioner, his representatives, the Policing Authority, and Garda associations.  There has also been input from the Public Appointments Service, PAS, on some aspects of the process but not the aspect we are discussing today because PAS will not be involved in managing the test as it will no longer exist.</p> <p>  That process went on for a number of years and culminated last summer in the making of regulations, which is a ministerial power under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and which needs to be done with the approval of the Government after consulting the Garda Commissioner and the Policing Authority.  That was the decision train.  When one looks at the regulations, there is an extensive range of changes around all aspects of the promotion process.  It was very significant change and this forms one part of it.  It was a lengthy and complex process of consultation.</p></speech>

The important thing, particularly in respect of this particular topic, is that the eligibility to compete is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While we would administer the mechanics of a recruitment process, the eligibility criteria are assessed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We do not, therefore, have a role in that part of the process.</p></speech>

We do not usually get involved in internal promotions.  We have had ongoing discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On foot of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland&rsquo;s position, there was a sense that we needed to look at the promotion process more so than the eligibility piece.  We went in and worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do an assessment of the competencies required for the role of modern policing.  We designed a process for this and supported the organisation by running its internal promotion processes for it.  The issue of eligibility was not part of that discussion.</p></speech>

I was not privy to the discussion in respect of who made that exact decision and I cannot answer that.  From the Public Appointments Service's perspective, this was not something we would have sought or around which we would have felt particularly strongly.  We can understand the rationale and perspective that was put forward to us in that regard.  Mr. Collins covered this quite well in his submission, as did Ms McMahon.  It was about ensuring there is an aspiration that the people who work in the public sector are reflective of the society of which they are members.  In that vein and certainly from our perspective we would not have an issue and do not see this as diminishing-----</p></speech>

That is the decision trail.  Clearly, anything that proceeds to the Government from the Minister will do so on foot of a memo our Department has prepared in which the various issues that arise are set out.  As has been said, there were a great many issues involved in bringing forward this change and that would have been set out as part of its proposal.

There are many steps, however, that have been taken and I have outlined the development of the strategy which will be the cornerstone of how we progress, develop and achieve our statutory obligations on the proficiency of all Garda members and those who are serving in the Gaeltacht areas.  I would point to that as one of the key pieces of work that has been achieved since the most recent visit of the Commissioner here.</p> <p>  In addition to that, it is important to point out that one of the key recommendations - and this has happened since last May - of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga was the establishment of an assessment within the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages whereby we could stand over the actual standard of Irish.  That was developed in 2018 but the assessment was conducted with all of those serving in the Gaeltacht stations in 2020.  That is a significant step in having an organisational picture of the standard of Irish available to the public in the Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>In addition, we have identified 60 stations we would call Gaeltacht service stations.  They are not in the Gaeltacht but are used by people in the Gaeltacht areas.  We aim to increase the proficiency of Irish in those areas as well.</p><p> There is not a clean sentence, if I can put it that way, in terms of whether we are achieving all our milestones.  We are working very hard on them and are committed to continue this work.  The fact the Commissioner is chairing the strategic group is an indication of his commitment to the Irish language and the very robust statutory obligations with which we have to comply.  It is not an easy fix.  We have the Irish language stream, which did not yield the results we would have liked, but there is also work for us to ensure all those who come through the Irish stream go to the Gaeltacht stations.  We very much need to keep that work on the cl&aacute;r.</p><p> Our recruitment campaign will be launched next week which will have an Irish stream.  We will engage in extensive outreach across the board in terms of that campaign but the Irish stream will be a particular focus.  We have numerous ads.  Some of our Gaeilgeoir colleagues will hold information sessions and there is an extensive outreach programme in the hope we attract as many people as possible who are able to speak the language fluently.</p><p> Later on this year, we will have a reserve competition that will, for the first time, as far as I am aware, focus on attracting reserve candidates from the Gaeltacht areas by using that outreach initiative.  There are many moving parts and work going on, but we have a hill to climb and there is no getting away from that.</p></speech>

That in itself is a concern and one I recognise.  The core of this set of regulations is an attempt to identify selection techniques which will assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in identifying future supervisors and managers.  The work was all around looking at what one test for and look for.  The conclusion which was arrived at was that having an Irish test score slightly higher than that required to be a Garda in the first place was not central to the decision as to whether a person would make a good supervisor or manager.  That was the analysis.</p> <p>  The essence of the new regulation is all about making the promotion process better, on the one hand, for the organisation in order that it knows it can select the best people for the jobs and, on the other hand, for the applicants to have very clear criteria they understand and which are clearly linked to the needs of what is a very important role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  I understand the point the Deputy made about slighting the language and that was certainly not the intent.  As the Deputy Commissioner has said, a very significant volume of work is under way in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address the question of language service provision, which has the full support of the Department and the Minister.  We hope we could point to that as evidence of our good faith with regard to the status of the Irish language.</p></speech>

That assessment is the same as the one I spoke about just a few minutes ago in terms of the implementation of the recommendation by the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga to set robust standards for how we measure the ability to speak Irish of those to be stationed in Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>I would argue that the standard will increase for those stationed in particular areas because they will not be assigned there unless they reach that standard.</p><p> With regard to our appearance here in May and the change in regulations, it was an omission on our part that we did not address that at that point in time.  The focus of the discussion on that date was the report of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and our focus, or lack thereof, on meeting those recommendations.  It certainly was not on the agenda for that meeting and at that point in time, most of us attending were not aware of the change or privy to the finer points of any discussion around the Irish language.  I apologise for that.  On reflection, it is something that should have surfaced.</p><p> The strategy is ready.

A great deal of research was done around that.  From my review of it, that does not include a huge analysis of the language question.  By its absence, I think the process was identifying what is needed to identify whether supervisors could be good at their job and what skills and competencies were needed.  In that work, having a slightly better Irish language skills than those needed to become a garda in the first place was not identified as a need.  That said, we recognise what the Deputy has said about the need for those skills in some parts of the country and there is a separate track for that.  I cannot point to any particular research on the subject of the language per se but the decision was a consequence of the core analysis of the supervisory competencies required for this role.  Similar changes have been made to the promotion process for the more senior ranks, although I am not aware that there was ever an Irish language requirement for those ranks.  There certainly is not now.  Again, there are similar promotion competitions around the public service generally.  Other than where there is a very specific job that clearly requires Irish on some regular basis, I am not aware of other promotion competitions in which we require somebody to demonstrate a language skill alongside the general competencies for the supervisory role.</p></speech>

There was a revision, as was already alluded to, of the regulations regarding promotion to the rank of sergeant.  That took considerable time.  In fact, it is over three years since we had a competition.  We are currently in the process and are almost at the end of the first phase of the first batch of sergeants.  They will come on stream in the next week or so, or imminently in any event.  In terms of recruiting sergeants who specifically speak Irish, to the best of my knowledge, that was not an issue and it was not a driving force in the changes that emerged.</p></speech>

There were a lot of problems with the promotion regulations.  When we came to do all the review work and build the new regulations, we built them on an objective basis on grounds that are linked to the skills one needs to be a good supervisor.  I am not aware that anyone particularly felt the Irish language requirement was acting as a barrier to people going forward.  One could construct scenarios where perhaps there may be people who might be dissuaded if their Irish was good enough to meet the basic standard but not the 50%.  The reality is that there would probably be very few people in that mix.  The point is that in a contemporary promotion competition process, the competency criteria we think are essential to general supervisory work are included, noting that there are some parts of the country where specialist skills will be needed.  In general, one is looking to hire good supervisors based on the competencies that pertain to that sort of work.  That is essentially the problem that was looking to be solved.</p></speech>

To add to the Deputy's comments with regard to the jigsaw and the crisis we all face, in addition to what the Deputy has raised - and we welcome the opportunity to engage with her in respect of the forthcoming Irish language strategy - the research and evidence base with regard to Irish and many other areas tells us that some of the solution lies in considering the earliest stage at which individuals choose a career, profession or vocation.  The evidence base suggests we should look at this issue as early on as preschool and school age.  That is something we are very keen to progress in the context of the strategy.  It is at that stage that children start to consider what they would like to do for a profession.  To that end and with regard to outreach, we intend to do much more with regard to our schools liaison, particularly within the Gaelscoils.  In addition to that, in our outreach, we are very much focused on how to assist young people to think of us as a great place to work in the future.  There is clear evidence to suggest that does assist.  In moving through some of the programmes of work we are looking at, particularly the forthcoming Garda trainee competition to which the deputy commissioner referred, we need to be diverse in the ways we reach out to young people and individuals starting to think about what change in career they might like or, if they are in school, the vocation they may wish to take on.  For this particular process, we are doing much more than we have ever done.  The deputy commissioner chairs a group on outreach.  We have engaged with colleagues from across the organisation, particularly colleagues in the Gaeltacht areas, on the point we are discussing today.  We have been looking at all of the opportunities colleagues have in communities to speak to, meet, reach out to and attract individuals to apply in the first place.  I will mention one more thing with regard to the evidence base and research.</p><p>As part of the strategy, we will also try to understand within the communities we serve, particularly within the Gaeltacht, the key barriers and challenges, in addition to the opportunities, to people applying locally and being based locally in those areas.</p><p> In addition to what has been raised about the renewed focus within the organisation in terms of the importance of the Irish language and the training of such within the Garda College, including the f&aacute;inne we spoke about, we will be delivering on all the key important strategies over the forthcoming years.  One of the most important pieces we will be investing in, for future generations and future Irish speakers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is early outreach.  That is what I wish to add.</p></speech>

It was never a requirement that one had to have Irish, as was previously said.  It was English or Irish or another language.  In terms of the status piece, we believe it gives Irish a status that would perhaps appeal to a broader candidate pool.  That is the first piece I wish to speak on.</p> <p>  So that people understand from a process perspective, candidates can apply through the general stream as well as the Irish stream.  They can compete in both.  From that perspective, we hope that we will see &ndash; I note we are only testing this &ndash; a situation where candidates will go for both streams who may not have the level of fluency that is required to come through the Irish stream but will come through the general stream and have a level of proficiency in Irish that they can enhance through their training and the various schemes the Garda is putting in place.</p> <p>  We are very committed in the Public Appointments Service to the running of Irish competitions.  When we run Irish streams, they can be quite focused as a campaign and allow us to focus our marketing and outreach efforts.  We know from the various Irish competitions that we run that when we run Irish streams, we attract candidates who have a good command of the language.  We also believe that when Irish speakers compete through the Irish competitions, they statistically do better than others insofar as the candidate pool is bit smaller.</p> <p>  It is a challenge in terms of providing all public services through Irish.  We are all very aware of the commitments under the official languages legislation.  From the Public Appointments Service's perspective, we look forward to working on the national advisory committee that is being set up to look at strategies that can be put in place to help all public servants and public services to reach their commitments to provide their services through Irish by 2030.</p> <p>  It is quite right in regard to what comes through from the Irish stream.  We have seen a lot of attrition where people believe their proficiency is at a fluency level that it is not.  The numbers that come through are very small.  It is fair to say that unless some action was taken, we were not going to get anywhere with this.  We hope that through the combined efforts of what we are doing and what is happening in the Garda, we will see some traction and improvements.</p> <p>  I refer to Yvonne Cooke&rsquo;s point on reaching out to young potential public and civil servants.  We recently launched our public jobs schools kit, which is a pick-up-and-teach resource for transition year teachers to go through with their classes in order to give them an introduction to the public service and the Civil Service and plant that seed for them to consider pursuing careers across the public service.  These resources that were recently launched are available in both English and Irish.  Efforts are being made.  It is fair to say that we are not going to achieve those targets by focusing on the recruitment element alone.  As the members will know, more than I do, that there are a multitude of challenges facing us in driving up our participation rates of fluent Irish speakers in public sector organisations.</p></speech>

We have quite a number of people in the organisation from other countries, and other European countries in particular.  They have been of enormous benefit in various investigations.  I absolutely agree with what the Deputy is saying with regard to the richness that brings to the organisation.  The same thing applies to the Irish language.  As has been stated many times, it is not just a nice thing to have; we have obligations and we are acutely aware of them.  At the risk of repeating myself, we are trying on multiple levels to improve our proficiency.  A key part of the Irish language strategy will be working with the language planning groups in the various Gaeltacht areas and Gaeltacht service areas and with Irish language officers.  There will be a lot of engagement there with regard to the percentages required in light of the make-up of those communities.  There are many areas in which we have an awful lot of work to do.  As I have said already, it will not be done overnight.  The clock is ticking.</p></speech>

A team within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that was researching barriers to recruitment and inclusivity across all aspects of diversity undertook international research involving benchmarking against other police services.  This team identified a number of areas, some of which were very pertinent to what we are discussing today.  For example, issues such as educational attainment, language proficiency and nationality were identified as barriers for certain groups.  In addition to what Ms Comerford raised earlier on, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did engage with the Irish Traveller Movement.  A key issue it raised with us related to challenges in respect of the requirement for languages that existed before this regulatory change.  Research was undertaken and cognisance was given to opening up eligibility as wide as possible.</p></speech>

T&aacute; ceist agam maidir le feachtas earca&iacute;ochta d&iacute;rithe ar Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.  An raibh feachtas mar sin ann roimhe seo?  N&iacute; cuimhin liom aon fheachtas d&iacute;rithe ar mhic l&eacute;inn i nGaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; timpeall na t&iacute;re n&oacute; i gceantair Ghaeltachta nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar scoil agus n&iacute;or chuala m&eacute; faoi cheann &oacute; shin.  Muna bhfuil feachtais earca&iacute;ochta d&iacute;rithe ar Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; amach anseo, n&iacute; thiocfaidh siad.  T&aacute; poist eile ann d&oacute;ibh seachas a bheith sa Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Beidh An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ioma&iacute;ocht leis an St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s ina hioml&aacute;ine agus le gach uile phost eile.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n post ann do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; anois san Eoraip a &iacute;ocann a l&aacute;n airgid.  T&aacute; jab m&oacute;r le d&eacute;anamh.  Chuala m&eacute; cad a bh&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; faoi dhul isteach an-luath, fi&uacute; sna na&iacute;scoileanna agus mar sin, ach caithfear d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na me&aacute;nscoileanna ach go h&aacute;irithe i leith feachtais earca&iacute;ochta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; beagnach r&oacute;dheireanach d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta i mbliana.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil ach t&aacute; siad ag smaoineamh agus ag l&iacute;onadh a n-iarratais CAO.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh siad l&iacute;onta acu inn&eacute;.  T&aacute; deis ann ach caithfear a bheith d&iacute;rithe.</p> <p>  Caithfidh garda&iacute; le Gaeilge dul isteach sna col&aacute;ist&iacute;, sna scoileanna agus sna col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh.  Caithfidh siad a bheith feice&aacute;lach ag na h&oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute; sin agus iad ag labhairt Gaeilge.  T&aacute; a fhios agam gur ualach &eacute; sin ar na garda&iacute; le Gaeilge.  Uaireanta, n&iacute;l siad ag iarraidh a bheith mar an token Gaeilgeoir.  Tarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin go minic.  T&aacute; siad ag iarraidh a bheith ina ngarda&iacute; agus an obair sin a dh&eacute;anamh seachas a bheith mar oifigigh earca&iacute;ochta Gaeilge.  Caithfidh siad a aithint go gcuid&iacute;onn s&eacute; &oacute; thaobh na hearca&iacute;ochta de m&aacute; t&aacute; siad ag dul timpeall ag labhairt na Gaeilge le ch&eacute;ile n&oacute; le dreamanna Gaeilgeoir&iacute; n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht, ach freisin i gceantair i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, srl.</p> <p>  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil mo ch&eacute;ad cheist eile freagartha ag na finn&eacute;ithe cheana.  N&iacute;or cuireadh muid ar an eolas faoi seo ach an oiread.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go raibh s&oacute;rt feirge ar an gcoiste nuair a chuala muid go raibh athr&uacute; eile ann i m&iacute; na Nollag nach raibh luaite linn nuair a bh&iacute; an Coimisin&eacute;ir os &aacute;r gcomhair.  Is trua nach raibh s&eacute; luaite go raibh daoine ag smaoineamh ar an athr&uacute; seo, c&eacute; nach raibh an cinneadh d&eacute;anta ina ioml&aacute;ine, toisc go bhfuil an cuma ar an sc&eacute;al gur &iacute;sli&uacute; c&eacute;ime eile don Ghaeilge at&aacute; ann agus muid ag triail le hard&uacute; c&eacute;ime a thabhairt di, n&oacute; comhionannas a shroicheadh ar a laghad.

With regard to the changes in the regulations, there were numerous changes with regard to the promotion regulations.  The whole process changed from being an internal one to an external one.  The entirety of that process has changed.  With regard to the recruitment regulations, to the best of my knowledge, that was the only change.</p></speech>

They are very technical changes.  We used an outdated term in asylum protection law.  The law has moved on so the regulation has to be updated to use the correct term so that people with certain protection statuses can enter the Garda.</p><p>I cannot see how any of them would have any bearing on the interests of the committee and its work.</p></speech>

It will be launched on 10 February.  There is an extensive outreach plan in place and that will include going into the schools, using ads as Gaeilge and doing information sessions as Gaeilge in addition to other avenues in the general sense of the competition.  This is the most extensive outreach programme we have ever embarked on in a recruitment campaign.  We will be promoting the fact that we have an Irish language stream and we will be using every opportunity to promote that once the campaign is launched.  It will be a six-week campaign so we have quite a bit of time but we have been planning that since before Christmas.</p> <p>  I refer to the question on not being notified.  I have already alluded to the fact that this was an omission on our part.  In terms of the promotion regulations it was not something that was to the fore in our minds when we were last here.  The decision on the recruitment campaign was not made at all at that point.  The proximity of our visit to the committee to the change in the promotion regulations is quite short.  I accept that we should have brought that up on that occasion.</p></speech>

We will continue to do outreach before competitions and to have a longer term plan.  On the issues the Deputy raised, in schools and colleges when people are thinking about what they will put on their CAO forms, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should always be to the fore as a career or vocation option.  There are a few ways in which we will do that in addition to what we have already discussed.  I mentioned liaison in schools but for people who are moving into their teens and really thinking about what they want to do, we have launched an internship programme this year and part of our Irish language strategy plan is to have a bespoke or specific programme for the Gaeltacht areas.  Individuals who speak Irish should have an opportunity to come into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, experience what it is like to be in the organisation and consider if it is a career, job or vacation for them going forward.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned token Gaeilgeoir&iacute; and we have many Gaeilgeoir&iacute; across the organisation.  With the outreach programme we are running we have had so many people come forward and say they would like to be visibly present within it, in particular within the Gaeltacht areas.  There is that lovely saying that if you can see it you can be it but with the Irish language it is a case that if you can hear it you might consider this as being a place for you for the future.  The onus cannot always be placed on Gaeilgeoir&iacute; within the organisation to advocate for the Irish language.  It is incumbent on us all to do so.  The opening address mentioned our focus on the f&aacute;inne.  Over 1,000 individuals within the organisation have varying levels of Irish proficiency.  The committee has heard today about our attempts to speak the language and that needs to continue.  We want to create a gr&aacute; or love of the language and to be seen to do so within the organisation.  We all have a role to play in that in our leadership and I say that to make the point that it is not just a responsibility for the Gaeilgeoir&iacute;.</p></speech>

That is part of our day-to-day business in our community policing, outreach and efforts to build up good relations with the whole spectrum that makes up any community we work in.  That is ongoing and important work and a lot of energy is going into that.  There are many strands to our diversity outreach.</p></speech>

We wanted to speak to the new communities in that.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, we were not trying to teach them Irish, communicate with them through Irish or anything like that.  We were trying to get them to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to let them see and recognise that it was an attractive proposition as a career.  Once any of the recruits were in Templemore, the Irish language training was a compulsory part of the BA in applied policing and one which they must pass.  I have already outlined the two modules that specifically relate to the Irish language.  They would have undergone that particular process in the same way as all other recruits.  In addition to that, there were other online supports available to all recruits, not just those from new or diverse communities.</p><p>That is how I would answer your question.</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il has ordered that the Revised Estimates for Public Services in respect of the following Vote be referred to this select committee for consideration - Vote 42 - Rural and Community Development.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Rural and Community Development, Deputy Heather Humphreys, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and their officials to the meeting.  Members will have received the Estimates briefing document provided by the Department and the supplementary briefing from the secretariat that was circulated in advance of the meeting.  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Revised Estimates, and the performance information regarding the output and input impacts of programme expenditure.  The programme-based structure of the Estimates should allow the committee: to focus on what the Department has committed to achieving in terms of actual outputs and outcomes; to consider whether the performance targets included in the Estimates are a sufficiently complete description of the services provided by the Department, and whether those targets strike the right balance in respect of the needs of society; and to consider whether the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services and whether these allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.  I now invite the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

We have a huge amount in common in terms of priorities, and both the Our Rural Future policy and the five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland provide a clear sense of direction for the development of these areas.</p> <p>  When it comes to resources in general, and the budget in particular, there is always the challenge of prioritising within limited resources.  I have given a lot of thought to this during the budget settlement to ensure that the resources provided to my Department are put to best use.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that the Department's functions are delivered across three programme areas, namely, rural development including the islands; community development; and charities regulation.  Gross expenditure of &euro;378.6 million is budgeted for 2022, which consists of &euro;186.6 million in current expenditure and &euro;192 million in capital expenditure.  My Department also has a capital carry-over of &euro;16.86 million from 2021 into 2022.  As for the split across programme areas, &euro;202.3 million is allocated for the rural development and the islands programme area, with &euro;11.86 million of the capital carry-over also intended for use in this area; &euro;171.7 million is allocated for the community development programme, with &euro;5 million of the capital carry-over also intended for use in this area; and &euro;4.6 million is allocated for the work of the Charities Regulatory Authority.</p> <p>  The &euro;202.3 million provided for the rural development programme, including islands, is made up of &euro;169.2 million in capital funding and &euro;33 million in current funding.  Capital funding is of particular importance for the rural development programme, and through the revised national development plan we have secured increased capital funding out to 2025.  For the Department as a whole, capital funding is increasing from &euro;169 million in 2021 to &euro;192 million in 2022 and then to &euro;205 million by 2025.</p> <p>  I believe that this positive outcome to the review of the national development plan reflects the impact this funding is having on the ground.  Schemes such as LEADER, the rural regeneration and development fund, town and village renewal, outdoor recreation, CL&Aacute;R, and the local improvement schemes are playing a vital role in revitalising our rural areas and ensuring they remain attractive and vibrant places to live and work.  These schemes are now embedded as vital supports for rural areas and our communities and the Revised Estimates will see funding for all of these schemes increased.  For example, LEADER funding will increase from &euro;44 million to &euro;48 million; the town and village renewal scheme funding will increase from &euro;20 million to &euro;22 million; CL&Aacute;R funding will increase from &euro;5.5 million to &euro;7 million, and the outdoor recreation fund will increase from &euro;12 million to &euro;15 million.</p> <p>  The capital funding also provides us with the capacity to deliver the necessary investment for our islands over the coming years.  Throughout the pandemic we have also shown how this Department can be proactive and dynamic with capital investment.  By investing in connected hubs and streetscapes, we are helping rural Ireland to adapt to, and benefit from, the changes to how we work and live.  These types of investment can also play a significant role in meeting climate action goals and improving quality of life, reducing commuting, helping people to work and shop locally and allowing people to spend more time with their families and communities.</p> <p>  The pandemic made us focus on these issues more than ever and I am pleased that the increased level of funding available for my Department in 2022 will help to support improved quality of life across rural Ireland.  The Revised Estimates also provides enhanced current funding for the rural development programme, increasing from &euro;26.7 million in 2021 to &euro;33 million in 2022.  This increased funding will support continued implementation of Our Rural Future, including, for example, an additional &euro;2 million to support the walks schemes and rural recreation in general, and &euro;2 million to support implementation of the town centre first initiative.  Overall, this planned investment of over &euro;200 million in the rural development programme will be vital in supporting the economic and social development of rural Ireland, and making rural Ireland an attractive place to live and work.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the community development programme area, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, is here today with me to discuss this area.  The Revised Estimates will see a funding allocation of &euro;171.7 million for this area in 2022, which consists of &euro;148.9 million in current funding and &euro;22 million in capital funding.</p><p>This represents a core funding increase of &euro;13 million compared to 2021.  The community services programme, CSP, and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, are the largest schemes within the area with combined funding of almost &euro;100 million planned for 2022.  Funding for the CSP is being maintained at &euro;48.9 million for 2022 while funding for the subhead which includes the SICAP will increase from &euro;45 million in 2021 to &euro;51 million in 2022.  This will allow a 10% increase in funding for the SICAP to approximately &euro;44 million per annum.  It will also provide new funding of &euro;2 million for a new empowering communities programme which will implement a community development approach towards tackling extreme area-based disadvantage.  </p><p> The Revised Estimate also provides additional funding of &euro;800,000 for the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, increasing that allocation up to &euro;6.7 million for 2022.  </p><p> An additional &euro;5 million is being provided within the community enhancement programme area to facilitate the establishment of a grant scheme for community centre upgrades which is committed to in the programme for Government.  I anticipate huge demand for that fund so I am discussing with my officials a plan to use some of our capital carry-forward in order that we can increase the funding available for community centres. </p><p> I have said before that this might be a small Department but that it is making a big impact.  The increased funding for 2022 will help to ensure continued strong implementation of Our Rural Future to support communities right across the country and to make sure that we support a recovery that improves quality of life for people and communities.  In allocating the resources provided to my Department I have targeted them where they can have the greatest impact.  This aligns with many of the priorities identified by this committee, for example, strong funding for the LEADER programme, increased CL&Aacute;R funding, capital funding for important islands infrastructure, the establishment of a grant scheme for community centre upgrades and increased funding for the SSNO.  Approval of this Estimate will ensure further strong progress in delivering on rural and community development in 2022. </p><p> I thank committee members for their time and along with my colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, I am happy to answer any questions they may have. </p></speech>

We will now go through the individual programmes and corresponding subheads for Vote 42 for 2022.  The total Vote is &euro;325.298 million which is a 6% increase on 2021.  Programme A covers rural development, regional affairs and the islands.  The budget here is &euro;202.255 million, which is a 14% increase on 2021.  Do members have any questions on programme A?  There are no questions from members as yet but I have a question.  The Department asked the ESRI to conduct a review of the evaluation of the rural and community development programme in terms of the targets that the Department set, including benchmarking those targets.  The report by the ESRI is very positive about the overall high-level targets that the Department has set and is quite complimentary of the work being done by the Department.  However, on the enterprise area it did point out that the evaluation, not just in this Department but across Government, is not as rigorous in terms of enterprise supports as it is in other areas.  There are substantial enterprise supports within this particular Vote.  The report goes on to say that measuring the impact of community and rural development programmes tends to be more complex and typically requires the use of mixed methods, which combine data analysis with qualitative approaches, to gain an understanding of the programme impacts which are often multidimensional and complex.  I accept that it is not easy to have a simple measure on the enterprise aspects of this programme but based on the ESRI study, what alterations is the Department making to the evaluation of these particular programmes?</p></speech>

The regional enterprise development fund sits with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and we have a role in complementing that in terms of providing infrastructure.  The committee will be very familiar with the remote working hubs and we have been making a lot of investment in town centres.  In particular, there has been investment in a number of enterprise centres which are mainly community-owned or local authority-driven.  We work closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make sure there is no overlap and that we get the best value for money.</p> <p>  I have not actually seen the particular ESRI report to which the Chairman referred but we will continue to evaluate and make sure that we are getting a good bang for our buck, as they say, in terms of the investment we are making in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I ask her to direct her officials to revert to the committee on that question and to outline the specific measures that have been taken.  Deputy Kerrane has a question on programme A.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.1219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022020200002#B00500"><p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.  I have a quick question on programme A which includes the LEADER programme.  I know from my engagement with a number of LEADER companies that the funding they received for the transitional period, which was to cover 2021 and 2022, has run out and we are only at the start of 2022.  Would the Minister consider engaging with the LEADER companies across the State to see where they are at with funding?  There has been a huge emphasis on Our Rural Future in the context of funding for LEADER and the importance of it in all of our communities.  Obviously the funding of &euro;250 million is standstill funding but when we takes out the transitional period, we are looking at an amount of &euro;180 million across five years which is a fairly long time.  I urge the Minister to engage with her own local LEADER companies, although I am sure she probably does that anyway because there is an issue whereby LEADER companies literally have no funding left and we are only at the start of February.  Will the Minister engage with her local LEADER company on that?  I am concerned that we will have only &euro;180 million to cover the five-year period from 2023 to 2027.  In a lot of places, including Roscommon, LEADER is growing at a powerful rate and companies want to do more but they are being stymied because we are at a standstill in the context of funding.  There will be problems this year in particular because the transitional funding has run out in a lot of cases.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.1221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022020200002#B00700"><p>I thank Deputy Kerrane for her question.  First, I want to acknowledge the good work done by LEADER companies.  The budget for 2014 to 2020 was &euro;250 million and the budget for the next seven-year programme is the same, at &euro;250 million.</p><p>We have matched a portion and come up with additional funding of &euro;70 million.  The LEADER companies specifically asked for that.  They said that they did not want what happened in 2014 to happen in 2021, where the companies had to wind down their operation to some extent and they were concerned about their future.  I told them that we wanted to support them and as this is part of the LEADER funding, we allocated the &euro;70 million.</p><p> Much other funding is coming into rural Ireland.  LEADER is not the only show in town.  As the Deputy knows from this Vote, much money is going in through the town and village, rural regeneration and outdoor recreation schemes.  There are many other funding sources.  It is important that we all work together to make sure that we have the most impactful investment in our towns, villages and rural areas.</p><p> There was &euro;65 million of total transitional money for the projects and administration, with extra funding to bring it to a total of &euro;70 million altogether.  Roscommon was allocated &euro;2.6 million.  The total value of projects approved as of 23 January 2021 was 44.1%.  In fairness, it had nearly 50% of its money allocated, which one would expect, because it is a year into the transitional programme.  We are confident that the transitional budget is sufficient.  Some &euro;65 million of the &euro;70 million is available for projects and administration costs and to date, 35% has been assigned to approved projects.  There is a big difference between areas.  South Cork has allocated 70%, while Kilkenny has only allocated 3.4%.  Roscommon is spot on, at 44%, or nearly at 50%.  We have never been found wanting in supporting good projects.  I commit to the Deputy that that will continue.</p></speech>

The spending is really felt in communities.  It delivers much public good.  I acknowledge that we are bringing a degree of policy coherence.  The Our Rural Future document and the town centre first policy that we expect to arrive shortly are bringing a level of policy coherence that draw together the different strands of what we need to support, particularly rural development and towns and villages.</p> <p>  One thing that jumped off the page was the big drop in spending on office premises.  It ties into the idea of regional economic development.  Are we investing enough in rural broadband and providing remote working hubs?  This Department is uniquely well placed to engage in decentralised work.  I know that the offices are not in the big smoke.  I have a question about the town centre first funding.  Some &euro;2 million has been allocated.  Portlaw in my constituency was earmarked for &euro;100,000.  That is labelled as capacity building.  Can the Minister provide more detail as to what that means?  While there is a thriving community in Portlaw that will be well able to take up the funding and run with it, are there more structured guidelines than that?</p> <p>  As for the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, the Minister came to launch St. Declan's Way with us in Waterford.  We brought the good weather with us that day.  We were happy to see the Minister.  It is outstanding tourism infrastructure.  The Waterford greenway has proven the value of this type of tourism.  It is sustainable.  It is slow tourism that brings tourism spending outside of large urban centres.  With the development of the walks scheme and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, is there any opportunity to overlap with the active travel output?  St. Declan's Way, where it goes over the Comeragh Mountains, is not necessarily answering an active travel brief but some of that walk, between Cahir and Cashel, perhaps has an active travel pay-off.  Is there an opportunity for synergy between the Minister's Department and that of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to develop that further and drive it on?</p></speech>

We have to be specific.  They are not bread rolls, but blaas.  The Minister is on dangerous ground there.</p></speech>

I will recommend that the bread be brought in for the committee members.  It would help them for the day.  It was very nice.  I thank the Deputy.</p> <p>  Regarding our spending on office premises, our staff in the Department of Rural and Community Development have embraced remote working.  Over 90% of staff are able to work remotely and worked effectively during the Covid pandemic.  Half of our staff are in Ballina.  We have managed to do that effectively and we will continue to promote that and to find the balance between remote working and working in hubs.  I am a big supporter of remote working hubs.  It gives the security of a workspace.  People are able to go in and meet colleagues.  They have a starting time and a finishing time.  When people are sitting at the kitchen table, their work lives can easily blend and take away from their home lives.  It is important that we have work-life balance.</p> <p>  Regarding broadband, we have been promoting the national hub network.  We have developed a strategy and funded the Western Development Commission to roll out the connected hubs network.  We are getting more and more remote working space and more employers and workers are coming on board with us.  That is working well.  As the Deputy knows, the Government is committed to the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  It is essential.  It allows us to change the way we live and work in rural Ireland.  On top of that, we have the broadband connection points.  We have invested right across the country in helping communities where there is a poor broadband connection.  We have been able to get high-speed broadband into their community halls.  We have given them funding to upgrade facilities to facilitate people to work from home.  As we embrace this further, we will have e-health and e-learning.  A bright future is ahead but we must have connectivity to enable us to be part of it.</p> <p>  Regarding the town centre first capacity building, we have allocated this &euro;100,000 to these towns to help them to come together with a co-ordinated plan.  We want to encourage people to come back and live in the town centre.  People bring that vitality and energy back into our towns.  It applies to cities as well, not just the towns.  We saw during the lockdown that there were very few people around the centre of the city here in Dublin.  We want to encourage people to come back in, so they can walk to school and to work.  That is very much what we are about.  We have to incentivise people to do that.</p><p>I work very closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke; the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien; and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  We were all working very closely together on the town centre approach.  The &euro;100,000 is to help these towns have a strategic plan.  As the Deputy knows, in most towns there can be a number of different committees that all have different ideas and it is putting all of that energy together.  That is what the &euro;100,000 is for.  This is only the first phase of it.</p><p> The way I see the outdoor recreation scheme is that in rural community development, we do the small schemes.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does the big stuff in his Department.  We complement each other well.  We work very closely together and we all know there are synergies between us and between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which helped to fund the outdoor recreation scheme as well.  We have &euro;4 million per annum and those discussions continue with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Therefore, there is joined-up thinking in that regard.  </p><p> We all know the wonderful amenities that we have.  We have enhanced them considerably.  During Covid, people were able to get out and about and there is a greater appreciation of what we have in this country.  As the Deputy noted, I was down in Waterford, and St. Declan&rsquo;s Way is an amazing facility to have.  Indeed, I was in Tipperary on another day as well.  They have fantastic walks along the river and they are connecting the towns.  It is something that we can continue and we can continue to invest in.  What we have at our own doorstep is amazing.  We want to make sure that people are able to enjoy it to its maximum.</p><p> I believe I have covered all of the questions there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.1230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022020200002#D00200"><p>My first question is on the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF.  There is an idea floating around that we need to do something very strategic with that money.  It is quite a significant amount of money over a number of years.  One of the ideas we are exploring is that an application would be sent in under the RRDF by Mayo and Galway county councils to part-fund the reopening of the western railway corridor.  As RRDF funding already has been made available for a passing loop between Athenry and Galway, it seems railway lines are not out of the reckoning.</p> <p>  Further, I would be totally supportive of the Minister using this same process, not for railway lines in Monaghan, but the Ulster Canal.  I do not know if she got any RRDF money for the Ulster Canal but it is the kind of strategic development we need in rural Ireland.  If we are talking about rural development, this is it.  This is it on a big scale.  We can be doing town renewal and all the rest until the cows come home, but it will not have the impact of some of the bigger infrastructure projects such as the Ulster Canal, which the Minister knows I am a great supporter of, and the railway line connection that the Minister of Transport felt reluctant to let go of.  What would the attitude of the Minister and her Department be if we could use some of our call here, as Galway and Mayo county councils make the pitch that this is what the priority of the people on the ground is? </p> <p>  The second question I wish to raise is CL&Aacute;R funding.  The intent is to widen the number of programmes, because it is fairly constrained at the moment.  In particular, and I have made this point to the Minister before, there was a group order top-up scheme.  Basically, groups of houses that still are reliant on wells and so on could join up with public schemes.  Sometimes, in the more remote areas there are five, ten or 15 houses that were never joined up to any scheme.  There was a top-up scheme there previously.  It was very effective in making these affordable and giving price certainty.  Would the Minister look at reopening that?  </p> <p>  My next question is on the local improvement scheme, LIS.  Can the Minister let us know when the people will be told to get their applications in and when allocations will be made to the councils?  I do not know why it does not happen in the back end of the year rather than the beginning of the year, once the Estimate and the budget are fixed.  Even now, can the Minister tell us when people can apply to the councils?  Second, this committee recommended last year that the farmer rule be abolished.  The farmer rule for the LIS relates to an Ireland that no longer exists.  Of the vast majority of people in rural Ireland - there an awful lot of people in rural Ireland - there are only 120,000 herd owners.  Therefore, only about 10% of the people are farmers.  Thankfully, we have diversified economies, and we have always had diversified economies.  When one looks back in the 19th century, there was the gr&eacute;asa&iacute;, the si&uacute;in&eacute;ir, and all the different people with the different professions living out in the countryside.  Will the Minister consider getting rid of that anachronistic rule on farmers being required for that scheme?</p> <p>  I have a number of questions on the islands.  I note the capital money has gone up to &euro;4.644 million, which one would welcome, but behind the figure, there is a story.  I presume that was to commence the work on Inis Oirr Pier.  However, what I am hearing now is that due to foreshore licences, that will not happen.  What will the Minister do with that money to make sure it is spent on the islands?  I am told that there is a new environmental process to go through.  This is for a pier that got planning permission in 2008.  It has my head done in.  If is going ahead and the Minister cracked that nut, I applaud her.  However, if it is not going ahead, can we spend the money on something else and carry it over at the end of the year and not give the money back?   Similarly, there is a need an tine a chur faoi chosa na Roinne agus na comhairle contae.  We need to put fire under, at every level, to make sure that these piers progress fast and that Inis Me&aacute;in, as well as that, progresses fairly fast. </p> <p>  My annual plea to the Minister is on the fine airstrips in Inishbofin and in Cleggan.  The cost of providing the service from Na Mine to Cleggan and Inishbofin would be about, I am told, &euro;600,000 per year which, in the greater scheme of what the Minister is spending on islands, is not an awful lot of money.  Would the Minister consider providing that necessary link?  As I have pointed out time and again, Inishbofin is much further from Galway and much further out than the Aran Islands.  The Minister knows the advantage of the air service on the Aran Islands as she has availed of it and she knows how handy it is.  Can the Minister imagine how it takes an hour and a half to two hours to drive to Cleggan, and then one has to get a 40-minute boat?  From the island, the aeroplane could have her in Na Mine, where she got the aeroplane from, in about 20 to 30 minutes.  It could be for a very modest fee because the aeroplanes, the servicing, the pilots and all the other things are there.  The pilots are not busy all day.  Would the Minister consider going ahead and making Inishbofin air service operable, based from Na Mine, in order that she is doing it on an additional cost basis?</p> <p>  On the Cleggan airstrip, I understand there is an application in with the Minister&rsquo;s Department to come to some arrangement with her Department on using part of the site in Cleggan for a museum of transatlantic history.  This relates to aviators John Alcock and Arthur Brown.  It will be a great attraction for Connemara and it would bring people into the Cleggan peninsula.  Could the Minister arrange for her officials to meet the people who contacted the Department about that and see what the possibilities of progressing this are?</p> <p>  My final point is on the broadband hubs, which are fine.  I hear what the Minister is saying about remote working.  I agree with her that not everybody wants to work at home all of the time.  Particularly, if one lives in a smaller house in an urban setting, that will become a very big issue.  In rural areas at least, most people have half-acre sites, so they can find some corner to put in an office that is a little bit more remote than it would be in a standard three-bedroom urban dwelling.  That said, they are important.  Even though it is not directly under the Minister&rsquo;s remit, we have to stress again, related to the temporary broadband hubs while we are waiting for the roll out of broadband, that what the people want in the first place is fibre in their houses.</p><p>I hope the Minister will take back to her Cabinet colleagues the message that it is sop in &aacute;it na scuaibe -  a straw rather than a brush which, as the Minister will know, would not clean a floor too well - to be telling people that they already got their broadband hubs.  They are not interested in that.  They are interested in remote working.  They are interested in using hubs on occasions, but the number one demand from adults, children and older people is fibre to the home.  For the adults, this is for work and pleasure; for the young people it is for study and pleasure and for the older people it is for pleasure and, in many cases, because of the new technologies in terms of cameras and so on it enables families to monitor their elderly loved ones and to be aware of any falls etc., even when the latter are on the other side of the world.  I am begging the Minister to do what she can to persuade her colleagues of the need to get this done faster than it is being done now.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-02a.1233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022020200002#E00300"><p>I will try to cover them as best I can.  On the rural regeneration and development fund, we have been funding many town centre projects, enterprise centres and the restoration of old buildings, including various items of infrastructure within towns around those projects.  I take the Deputy's point about the western rail corridor.  I am sure it would make a huge difference to Mayo and Galway.  The issue is it would be a massive expenditure.  If I allocated all of the Department of Rural and Community Development's funding to one major project, I would have very little left for anything else but we can work on it with other Departments.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the Ulster Canal.  I was delighted that we were able to announce funding of &euro;13 million for the Ulster Canal project, which was made up of funding from the Department of Rural and Community Development and money from the shared island fund.  It is about working together, similar to the work being done around outdoor recreation and active travel.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Department of Rural and Community Development has big ambition but it does not have a massive budget.  The Department of Transport has a significant budget.  Only two weeks ago, it announced &euro;280 million plus for active travel.  That allocation is in excess of the Department of Rural and Community Development's capital budget.  It is about how we move in that direction.  Under the rural regeneration and development fund, there are category 2 projects, which is about providing the funding to put the plans together.  It is about creating the big picture and putting in place the proposals which can then be brought to other Departments in the space of transport, which in respect of rail is the Department of Transport, to see if they could come up with funding for those projects.  That may be an area where we could help.  There is a joined-up approach.</p> <p>  On CL&Aacute;R funding, last year I extended the three categories to four categories.  I am reviewing the fund with my officials to see if there are other areas that we can tap into.  In regard to the water and sewerage, but particularly the water, Irish Water has responsibility in this area.  I am familiar with the rural water schemes.  I am one of those people who falls between two water schemes, one of which is a group water scheme and the other being a county council water scheme, which is now owned by Irish Water.  I know well the issue the Deputy raises.  Investment in water is within the space of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I will pushing that Department to look for those grants, in particular for the extension of the group water schemes in order that people can connect into them.  Wells are fine when there is plenty of water.  In the summer time, many of them have no water.  I am very conscious of the issue the Deputy raises.  I will see what I can do to give them a prod in the right direction.  </p> <p>  On the local improvement scheme, the Deputy made the point that the farmer rule should be abolished.  To be honest, if I could clear some of the list that we have across the country, I would certainly look at it.  This is about roads.  As the Deputy will be aware, I increased the allocation this year for the LIS by &euro;11 million.  Last year, I brought it up to &euro;22 million, which I know was welcomed across the country.  It helped to clear some of the backlog, but there is a serious backlog still.  If we could break the back on that I would be happy to expanding the scheme further.  If I expand it now, the result would be a very lengthy list.  </p> <p>  On the islands, the Deputy mentioned Inis Oirr Pier.  It is expected that work will commence in late 2022.  The &euro;2 million in additional capital funding has been allocated in this context for 2022.  The application for a foreshore licence has been made as part of the preparatory work for the tendering stage.  Galway County Council has informed the Department, following its meeting with officials in that unit, that updated surveys need to be carried out.  Subject to the pre-construction issues being finalised, a preliminary timetable has been discussed by the development committee providing for a tendering process of approximately nine months, after which construction will advance in stages.  The finalised plan is likely to take a number of years to complete, taking into account weather and sea conditions.  The cost to date of the Inis Oirr Pier development since the commencement of the project in 2004 is &euro;978,713.  The estimated cost of the project, barring any unforeseen circumstances that may arise, is &euro;20 million approximately.  I am committed to the project.  I visited the islands, which the Deputy will know because, I am delighted to say, he was able to accompany me.  We are committed to moving the project on.  At this point in time, the matter is with Galway County Council.  We need to keep the pressure on and keep it moving.  </p> <p>  On the pier at Inis Me&aacute;in, as the Deputy will know, as part of the preparatory works, the National Maritime College of Ireland was instructed by Galway County Council to develop a modelled simulation for the harbour.  That will inform the business case options for the development.  It is very difficult to get agreement on how this work should be done, but we are working with people in Cork to find the best way forward.  A lot of money was spent on this in the past, but it did not work.  We have to try to figure out what way it should be done.  I met the Deputy during my visit to the island.  The local people are not too sure what way the project should proceed.  As I said, the experts should be able to give us a good idea as to what we need to do there.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Inishbofin air service.  I will have to come back to him on that question.  As far as I know, there are no plans for an air service from Inishbofin.  The Department will keep in touch with the community with regard to transport services to ensure the islands have access.  The Deputy mentioned a two and a half hour drive and that it could be shorter.  I take on board his point.  On the Cleggan airstrip, I have met the gentlemen concerned on a number of occasions.  I met one of them as recently last week.  We bumped into each other and during a chat he again set out the proposals.  The Department officials also met recently with the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Department of Transport to discuss plans for the coastguard station, which the Deputy mentioned.  This matter requires full consideration before any further discussions on plans for the museum.  We need to deal with the coastguard situation first.  I am happy that officials will meet them again to get an update.  I take on board the Deputy's point that it is a good idea to put this museum in place.  The Deputy knows the history of the Cleggan airstrip a lot better than I do.  We paid a fairly substantial amount when we bought it.  If we were going to release part of that property we would have to bear in mind the taxpayers' investment in it.</p><p>There is some work to be done in that regard.</p><p> The Deputy is right about fibre in houses but we have the plan, the contract is signed and National Broadband Ireland is out there.  Covid has had some impact, of course, but the Government is committed to rolling this out as quickly as we can.  No matter how quickly we do it, it will still not be quick enough because everyone wants it now.  That is why I pursued broadband connection points as an interim measure, in that they give something at least to those who do not have broadband or mobile phone coverage.  As the Deputy knows, we have reconstituted the mobile and broadband committee - I do not know its name off the top of my head but I will think of it in a minute - and we will examine whatever roadblocks there are with a view to progressing matters as quickly as we can.</p><p> I will be announcing the Department's schemes shortly.  They will be open earlier in 2022 to support the most efficient use of funds in communities across the country.  It is intended to publish the schedule of schemes shortly in order to allow local authorities to plan for the preparation of submissions with full information on our entire suite of schemes.  We have many schemes and I want to show local authorities the entire suite.  They can then decide which projects fit into which schemes and make their plans on that basis.  Sometimes, authorities say that they did not know this or that scheme was coming.  We will do it together this time; it will be a joined-up announcement this year.</p><p> I believe I have covered all of the Deputy's questions.  If there are more, I am happy to answer them.</p></speech>

There are figures of &euro;60 million and &euro;70 million flying around the place.  Nationally, it is a small project.  Projects with a higher cost come in at approximately &euro;200 million.  Lower-cost projects come in &euro;140 million or &euro;150 million lower than that.  It would be useful if a survey was done, allowing for a physical plan.  That would cost a few million euro.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has already put aside money for restoring a bridge.  If we could get that much in place, the rest would follow.  There might be modest top-up funding, but such funding is a great carrot for Departments.  I admire what the Minister's Department has done with the Ulster Canal.  It shows the kind of ingenuity that I would like to see applied to the western rail corridor so that, when the Minister leaves the Department, she can say that she made the Ulster Canal and the western rail corridor happen because, without her facilitative input, the line Departments might not have done the job.</p> <p>  I will put another question to the Minister in a moment.</p></speech>

If I could get it well on its way, I would be happy.  These projects take a long time.  Category 2 of the RRDF targets this type of funding.  It is about doing the groundwork, looking at costs, finding out what work needs to be done and carrying out surveys.  I suggest that people make an application when category 2 is open again.  Obviously, the application will have to stand on its own merits, as does every application, but category 2 is where it needs to be made.  We should do that.</p></speech>

Recently, a project in Scarriff received more than &euro;500,000 under category 2.  It is an exciting project transforming a derelict building in the centre of the town into an innovation and engagement hub.  Dramatic improvements in the public realm will also happen and it will provide a tourism offering.  I congratulate and thank Mr. Urban McMahon, an official in Clare County Council, for his work on this.  The Minister would know him well, having visited the county a number of times.</p> <p>  Two category 2 applications were not successful, though.  They were in respect of Loop Head lighthouse in west Clare and the maritime training centre in Kilrush.  It is disappointing that they were not funded.  Having engaged with junior officials, I understand why.  I am following up on the projects with the Minister and hope to have some engagement on them.  Where projects fall down, could the Minister explain something about the feedback from officials?  It is important that community groups, local authorities and LEADER groups understand where an application fell short and whether it is possible to improve the application so that it can be submitted for another call, be it category 1 or category 2.  Is there a formal feedback process?</p> <p>  I have raised a matter regarding the LIS a number of times.  Clearing the lists is key.  They are significant in counties Clare, Cavan and Monaghan and all across the country.  The Minister and her predecessor, Deputy Ring, funded this scheme, but that is actually unfair because the Department of Transport should have a role.  The Minister has engagements with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I ask her to re-engage with him on this.  She could have a substantial scheme if the Departments of Rural and Community Development and Transport and local authorities each provided one third of its funding.  Without proper financing for this essential scheme for rural Ireland, the lists will not be cleared.  Although work has been ongoing in Clare for the past number of years, we are clearing only a handful of roads.  Will the Minister re-engage with her ministerial colleague?  I also ask that this committee write to him and recommend that he put his hand in his pocket and provide some funding from the Department of Transport to finance this vital scheme.</p> <p>  A number of schemes in County Clare are reaching a conclusion.  I am thinking of Lahinch Seaworld and Leisure Centre, where wonderful work was done there under the RRDF, and the river walk in Ennistymon, where work has been completed under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, providing a wonderful amenity for the people of Ennistymon and further afield, particularly during Covid.</p><p>I invite the Minister to County Clare to perform an official opening of these two wonderful facilities.</p></speech>

Scarriff received &euro;524,000 for a project under the rural regeneration and development fund that has just been announced.  There are projects that have not been successful and I know people are disappointed.  Sometimes the projects do not just fit into the criteria.  Perhaps there are other sources of funding that are more suited for certain aspects of projects.  My officials are meeting applicants who were unsuccessful in the category 2 call.  They are happy to meet them, go through all of it with them and find out where the applications fell down.  When these applications come in they are assessed by an independent panel.  Some of them are multipurpose applications that have various aspects and some of those aspects are outside my remit.  For example, they may fall into the tourism category and they do not hit the bar or meet the criteria.  What I would say to anybody who has been unsuccessful is not to lose heart.  They should go back to the officials and speak to them and look again at the application.  On many occasions I have seen where an application can be tweaked and changed to make it a much stronger application.</p> <p>  I compliment Clare County Council.  I visited it last year.  It launched a digital strategy and Urban McMahon was hugely involved.  I have been saying that it is an example for other county councils to follow.  It is a wonderful digital strategy.  It encompasses everything.  Clare is probably ahead of the rest of us in terms of what it is doing in this regard.  I will be happy to go back down.  The Deputy mentioned a few projects including Lahinch Seaworld and Leisure Centre and the walk in Ennistymon.  I will certainly be back to visit Clare.  There is no doubt about it.  I would love to be going in the summer but I will have to let the officials decide when it will suit or when I should go.  Certainly I will be happy to go back down.  I had a very busy day the last time I was in Clare.  There is a lot happening.  I compliment everybody involved.  Whether they are in the local community or local authority they are certainly not lacking in ambition when it comes to submitting applications.</p> <p>  With regard to the local improvement scheme, the former Minister, Deputy Ring, reopened the scheme.  It had been closed.  Fair play to him, he reopened it and we have been able to fund it.  There is no doubt that it is about roads.  I will follow up again with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Perhaps he can give us a bit of help.  It would all add up and it would mean that we can get rid of the very long list.  If the committee saw fit to write to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, it would be useful.  If he were able to match some of the funding I am providing it would make a big difference.</p></speech>

Having finished with programme A we will move on to programme B, which is community development.  It has a budget of &euro;171.68 million, which is a 2% increase on 2021.

I acknowledge an extra &euro;2 million in funding was provided two years ago but it is staying static this year.  I am concerned because of the increases in the cost of living we have had over in recent years.  The increase in the cost of fuel has a knock-on effect for heating and other bills.  It is acknowledged that many of these centres were closed for pretty much the entirety of the past two years and are only getting themselves up and running and on their feet again.  Why has there not been an increase for them to reflect the increase in the cost of living?</p> <p>  The community enhancement programme is to be supplemented by a &euro;5 million capital carry-forward.  Does this mean that &euro;10 million will go towards the community centres?  Have the terms of reference for the allocation of the funding been announced?  If not, how close are we to it?</p></speech>

We could have an all-encompassing approach for projects.</p></speech>

I will speak about the community centre fund, which I will be announcing very shortly.  Community centres and facilities are funded from a number of streams across Government and local government.  I am aware there is no dedicated stand-alone funding stream for capital works for community centres.  Within the Department, funding streams such as LEADER and the community enhancement programme provide opportunities for community centres to obtain grant funding.  They are fairly small grants that are rolled out through the local community development committees, LCDCs.</p> <p>  The pandemic has shown us the need for more investment in community facilities.  The Department has secured an additional &euro;5 million for the community enhancement programme subhead.  I am looking at using some of the capital carry-forward from 2021 for this purpose also.  I do not have a huge amount of money but I will get it started this year.  It is a new scheme.  It will take some time to finalise it.  I hope to make the announcement very shortly.  The Deputy can be sure there will be a community centre grant fund.  This is important.  It will be available throughout the country.  Communities have not been able to fundraise and structural defects have appeared in these halls.  We need to support them.  It is vital that communities have a community centre.  I will pass over to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.</p></speech>

The core allocation is the same as last year.  As the Deputy is probably aware, it is closed to new entrants at present while we are restructuring the scheme.  This is being done in consultation with the steering group, which has representatives from the sector.  What is not reflected in the figures is that we developed a support scheme of almost &euro;9 million specifically to get the community services programme through Covid.  This is because community services were lacking income because they had to close community halls and were not generating traded income.  You can add &euro;9 million to the total, as this is the amount spent on keeping them going over the past year or two.  We hope to open the programme later this year.  It is not as soon as we had hoped simply because the unit that has responsibility for it also has responsibility for the stability fund.  There have been a couple of rounds of the stability fund and the unit's time was taken up by this, the support fund and generally working to keep the community and voluntary sector going during Covid.</p><p>That is why there is a delay to reopening the CSP.  Approximately 15 are in the pipeline that had gone through the expression of interest process before we closed the scheme.  We hope to make announcements about them at the end of this quarter or, if not, in quarter 2.</p></speech>

That relates to defibrillators that are funded through the Department.  The difficulty, as a result of that High Court judgment last year, is that if defibrillators are not being checked, if the pads are not replaced, if they are not housed in heated defibrillator cabinets or if they are out of warranty, community groups could be found liable should someone die when they look to use a defibrillator.  Community groups and sports clubs either have to become legal limited companies to get around this or the volunteers themselves will become personally liable.  There is a second option, which is to expand some of the existing community emergency response systems so that they would effectively take over liability of these issues in a more cost-effective way.  </p> <p>  I will send a note to the Minister of State's officials.  I would ask that he would examine this issue.  We need operational defibrillators throughout this country.  I do not want to see a chilling effect on foot of this court decision.  The Department, as well as the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, needs to be far more proactive in ensuring that we can find a workable solution to this problem.</p></speech>

It is important that if a community organisation is going to invest in a defibrillator, it should be in a position to maintain it as well.  To my knowledge, it has been supported under the community enhancement scheme previously to some extent.</p> <p>  I look forward to getting the Chair's submission on it and I will bring it up with officials.</p></speech>

There is &euro;4.06 million, which is not a change on last year's allocation.  Nobody has a comment or question on that allocation.  Members are happy enough with that.</p> <p>  While there has not been an overall change in the budget, there has been a transfer of moneys within the subheads.  Can the Minister of State explain the reason for that?</p></speech>

The total sum is &euro;53.25 million.  No member wishes to comment on that.  Do members wish to put any final questions or make a comment on the Vote before we conclude?  Members are happy; that is great.</p> <p>  Does the Minister wish to make any closing remarks?</p></speech>
