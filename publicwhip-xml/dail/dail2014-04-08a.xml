As the Minister knows, the banks are coming before the finance committee this week to give an update on how they are handling the mortgage arrears crisis.  The purpose of this question is to have a debate on the impact of any future possible interest rate increases on mortgage holders and on the economy generally.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800003#A00800"><p>As the Deputy is aware, I have no statutory role in mortgage interest rates charged by regulated financial institutions.  It is a commercial matter for the banks concerned.  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  The general point raised by the Deputy is an important one and worthy of ongoing review by Government.  The country does not have control of monetary policy; that responsibility rests with the European Central Bank.</p><p>  Changes in interest rates over recent years have, by and large, been downward, reaching the current historic low levels, not just in the eurozone but also in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere.</p><p> For some time the focus of interest rate policy has been aimed at providing a sustainable environment for economic recovery in the eurozone and beyond to take hold.  The current low rates have been beneficial for households in Ireland where the excesses of the previous decade have left a legacy of indebtedness without parallel in the history of the State.  The Deputy has no need to remind me of the significant fiscal adjustment required in recent years, much of which has been borne by households across the country.  Income reductions, increased taxes and new levies and charges have been necessary to restore order to the public finances.  The reduction in key ECB interest rates has served to moderate some of this burden, particularly for those holding tracker rate mortgages.  Recent Central Bank analysis confirms that some households have been in the fortunate position to use this low interest rate environment to deleverage and pay down debts.  Where other families have been faced by mortgage distress, a comprehensive framework to support these households through their difficulties has been introduced.  Reform of the insolvency legislation has been introduced to allow those unable to find a solution to their indebted circumstances the types of option expected in a modern, functioning economy.</p><p> Speculating on the magnitude and timing of future interest rates movements is a hazardous exercise and one in which I do not wish to engage.  My focus and that of the Government is on implementing the necessary policies to promote and foster economic growth.  Ultimately, a return to economic growth will underpin sustainable public finances, increase employment and improve incomes, thereby protecting households as interest rates inevitably rise at some future point.  For now, however, as the president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi, confirmed at the ECB press conference last week, the key ECB interest rate remains unchanged at 0.25%.  According to the ECB, incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with its previous assessment.  However, the ECB also expects that there will be a prolonged period of low inflation.  Against this background, the key ECB interest rates are expected by commentators to remain low for some time.  We will, of course, keep all of these matters under constant review and adjust policy as circumstances evolve.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800004#B00200"><p>This is an important issue worthy of debate.  Considering that the average ECB rate since the introduction of the euro is approximately 2.5% and that the rate went as high as 4.75% approximately 12 years ago, we can see that today it is at an historically low level of 0.25% and it may even come down a little further to deal with the issue of deflation in the eurozone.  As night follows day and the Minister has acknowledged, it is inevitable that over time the interest rate will increase, with a direct impact on tracker mortgage holders and a possible indirect impact on variable rate mortgage holders.  When considering the mortgage crisis we face and the number of people in arrears, we need to bear in mind that we are facing a potential timebomb as a country.  Nobody is expecting the Minister to have all the answers, as he does not control monetary policy or the interest rate policies of the banks.  I accept this fully.  Nevertheless, we must debate the issue and get a handle on the potential impact on mortgage holders and the general economy if interest rates increase.  As that is inevitable in the medium term, we need a policy response to be prepared at least to respond to such a scenario.</p></speech>

Given that the trajectory of interest rates by the European Central Bank is still downwards and with low inflation being the primary concern rather than increasing inflation which would require raised interest rates, it is reasonable to agree with commentators who almost universally expect interest rates to remain low for some time to come.  Certainly, there is a signal in that respect.  Perhaps the more appropriate action would be for everybody with a borrowing problem to use the low interest rate period to improve their position.</p><p>We will assist mortgage holders, as we have been doing, by continuing to press organisations that provide mortgages to make these mortgages sustainable, if they are not sustainable now.</p></speech>

There is a cohort who can do that.  For many it is not an option.  Rates are likely to remain low for tracker mortgages for the foreseeable future.  Inevitably, however, they will begin to increase.  As well as stress-testing the banks, the Department of Finance needs to stress-test mortgage holders and the impact on the economy of the likelihood of interest rates rising over the next two- to five-year horizon.  Will the Minister at least give a commitment to examine the issue?  The historically low interest rates are a key risk for the economy.  They are great for those on tracker rates, many of whom can pay additional sums, but many are not even able to keep up with their repayments at the current rate, let alone face the prospect of an increase in the tracker rate.  It is a risk facing the economy and the Department needs to examine it even though it may not crystallise until the medium term.</p></speech>

The European Central Bank's setting of rates is one of the primary factors in establishing mortgage interest rates and we have no control over that.  The action we can take is limited even though, like the Deputy, we foresee the danger.  One of the traditional responses would be to compensate through the tax system, but the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government abolished mortgage interest relief.  I extended it in our first year in Government for a further year.  That cushion has been taken out of the system as well, or will be in 2018.  I do not see what a general review of the position is going to achieve.  If the Deputy has specific solutions to suggest I will have them evaluated.</p></speech>

Is the Minister satisfied with the pace at which the banks are offering and agreeing long-term solutions to mortgage holders in serious distress?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800005#C00700"><p>The Government is aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations, and the Deputy will know that a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem is now in place.</p><p>   A key component of this is the Central Bank mortgage arrears resolution targets - or MART - framework, which set out quarterly performance targets for mortgage arrears resolution by the six main mortgage lenders.  These lenders - AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank Ireland - are required to meet targets for both proposed and concluded sustainable solutions in relation to their principal dwelling and buy-to-let mortgagees which are in arrears of more than 90 days.  In that context, a sustainable solution has been defined in the Central Bank's published MART document as one of the following: an arrangement, concluded in accordance with the CCMA, in which the borrower is co-operating under the MARP process and the bank has satisfied itself that the arrangement provides a sustainable solution which is likely to enable the customer to meet the original or, as appropriate, the amended terms of the mortgage over the full remaining life of the mortgage; a personal insolvency arrangement effected under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012; or, if an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case, voluntary sale of the property securing the mortgage loan or, failing that, any situation in which the bank takes possession of the property, including by way of voluntary agreement with the borrower, or by court order or otherwise.</p><p>A range of sustainable solutions have been utilised by each of the lenders to date.  These include but are not limited to term extensions, split mortgages, permanent interest rate reductions and voluntary solutions.  </p><p> In regard to performance to date, lenders have reported to the Central Bank that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target in the second quarter of 2013 and the 30% third quarter target.  In respect of the third quarter, lenders reported that they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 90 days.  Furthermore, last December the Central Bank stated its expectations for the quarter ending June 2014 were that sustainable solutions offered to customers would reach 75% for accounts in arrears for over 90 days and that concluded solutions would reach 35%.</p><p> According to the latest information published by my Department, in the case of private dwelling homes, some 54,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.  This is to be welcomed.  In our ongoing regular contacts with the banks my officials and I have clearly indicated that all possible restructuring options should be fully considered for co-operating borrowers who are in difficulty and that legal action to address a mortgage arrears case should only be used as a very last resort.  It is accepted that the issue of mortgage arrears is a major problem that needs to be resolved not only for individual borrowers and lenders but also for the long-term benefit of the country.  The roll-out of the MART process is providing momentum to resolve mortgage arrears cases and the outcome of that process, as well as the wider strategy framework, will be kept under close review by the Central Bank and the Government.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800006#D00200"><p>I am sure the Minister has not answered my question.  I asked him whether he was satisfied with the pace of providing long-term sustainable solutions and, in particular, avoiding the danger that people would lose their homes in the coming months.  We know that the rate of repossession has been ramped up.  Last week the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform met representatives from agencies working on the front line with people in mortgage distress.  To a person, they told us the system was not working.  They were critical of the banks and the Government.  Some were also critical of the target focused position that the banks had taken.  On the face of it, the banks are reaching their targets, but the Minister is not telling the public that 21,000 of the 43,000 mortgage cases he cited involve legal letters or voluntary surrenders.  I again ask him whether he is satisfied with the pace of provision of long-term solutions for people who want to stay in their houses.  Between the four institutions in question, AIB, Ulster Bank, Permanent-TSB and Bank of Ireland, more than 50% of the actions taken to meet their proposed solution targets have involved either issuing legal letters threatening repossession or forcing homeowners to surrender voluntarily.  These are family homes, not buy-to-let properties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800006#D00300"><p>We set targets and I am satisfied that the Central Bank has advised me that the targets are being met.  The quantum of permanent restructuring is increasing each quarter.  The latest information available to me indicates that 54,000 mortgagees have had proposals for permanent restructuring.  That is progress.  The details of whether the restructuring holds up when audits are carried out by the banks concerned obviously give rise to issues.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to consider the details from the banks' perspective when their representatives come before the joint committee.</p><p>  It is an exaggeration to say a primary tool of restructuring is repossession.  For example, the Department of Justice and Equality has advised the Department of Finance that the number of new civil bills issued for the first two months of 2014 is 450.  The latest Central Bank statistics for the quarter ending 2013 show that legal proceedings were issued in 1,491 cases to enforce the debt security on a principal dwelling house.</p><p>The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the MARP, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort, and every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.  I am not satisfied that legal letters threatening proceedings against borrowers are satisfactory solutions, if that is the key point of Deputy Pearse Doherty's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800007#E00200"><p>It is a key point of my question.  On 20 February, the Minister told me:<blockquote>I have informed the Deputy previously that letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets ... .</blockquote>In November last, he stated:<blockquote>I have previously informed the House that letters threatening repossession or legal action could not, in my opinion, be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets process and should only ever be considered after every possible avenue for a solution has been exhausted.</blockquote>These banks are not exhausting every option because these banks do not even offer some of the options that are available.  As the Minister owns nearly the entire shareholding in AIB, let us give him the detail of AIB.  I ask the Minister to tell this House whether he is satisfied with the bank, of which he is nearly the sole shareholder on behalf of the State.  At the end of last year, AIB had made just over 14,000 proposals, of which 6,702 were letters threatening legal repossession and 1,573 were with regard to voluntary surrender or abandonment.  Of the 14,000, around 8,200 proposals would have either forced borrowers out of their houses or placed them in a position in which they would be badgered to give up their houses.  Is that something with which the Minister is satisfied?  When will he tell AIB that it is not acceptable to use repossessions to meet the targets?  Not one bank would have met its targets if it were not for legal letters threatening repossession.</p></speech>

What I have said to him is that we set targets and in any reasonable process over an extended period of time, once the targets are set by the Central Bank, I am reasonably satisfied if the bank informs us that those targets are being met.  Of course we would like if it were moving at a faster pace, but it is moving at a satisfactory pace at present and significant progress is being made, with 54,000 mortgages having been restructured.</p><p>  The amount of repossession taking place is very small.  According to the last statistic I saw, it was a couple of hundred, and more than half of those were voluntary.  This scare about people being put out of their homes in large numbers is simply not true.</p><p>  It is true that if the possibility of repossession is not available in the legal system of a country, nobody in that country will ever get a mortgage, because the property is the security for the loan.  If there is not a legal possibility of enforcement, then the mortgage sector moves out of that country.</p></speech>

This is confirmed by Douglas Newman Good's survey last week which shows that, unbelievably, a property bubble is developing again, just as I told the Minister it would approximately six months ago.</p></reply>

This includes the development of an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.</p><p>In terms of residential property prices, when assessing the recent pick-up in house prices it is important to remember that residential property prices fell by just over 50% from peak to trough and residential property prices nationally are still 47% lower than at their highest level in September 2007.  While much of the attention of late has focused on the Dublin market, prices in the capital are currently close to 50% lower than at their peak in early 2007.  It is against this background that the recent appreciation in house prices must be assessed.</p><p> It should also be noted that the previous housing bubble was accompanied by a dramatic increase in mortgage lending.  The same cannot be said of the recent increase in house prices, in that the indications are that a large percentage of transactions are taking the form of cash purchases.  Figures from the Irish Banking Federation show the value of mortgage lending for house purchase in 2013 stood at just &euro;2.4 billion, or just 8% of the value of mortgage lending in 2006.</p><p> In terms of residential rents, according to the consumer price index, private rents rose nationally by 6% in 2013, following from an increase of 2.5% in 2012.  However, this follows a fall of over 25% between 2008 and late 2010.  On that basis, private rents are now at approximately the same level as in January 2003.</p><p> In terms of output, while the demand for housing is a function of a number of economic and demographic factors, current levels of housing output are running below estimates of medium to long-term requirements, as projected by the ESRI and others, based on underlying demographics and other factors.  As I outlined in my budget 2014 speech, I am conscious of the supply limitations in certain urban areas.  In light of this, I introduced several measures in that budget to help increase the supply of suitable residential housing stock.  These included, subject to state aid approval, the extension of the living city initiative to include Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin and the broadening of eligibility criteria to include all buildings built prior to 1915.</p><p> NAMA has adopted a phased and orderly approach to the disposal of loans and assets in Ireland.  This means that the release of assets for sale in the Irish market is being done in a manner that takes account of the market's capacity to absorb them.  NAMA's approach since its inception has been vindicated by the significant improvement in the Irish property market over the past 12 months.  This has enabled NAMA to sell substantial asset and loan portfolios at very competitive prices and, in so doing, NAMA is reducing the contingent liability that its senior bonds represent for the Irish taxpayer.</p></speech>

It is not just about absolute levels of property prices or rents; it is about the dramatic increase in property prices over the past few months.  Property prices in Dublin have risen by 23% in the past 12 months, by 12.9% in the past three months and since 2012, when the market bottomed out, prices have increased by 36%.  I do not have figures for rent but the homelessness crisis, where six people declare themselves homeless every day, is indicative of the dramatic rise in rent taking place in Dublin.  Two years ago, the Government told us this would not happen and said that cuts in rental allowance could lead to a reduction in rent.  The Government has been spectacularly wrong in its approach to this sector and, unbelievably, it has introduced property-based tax incentives such as real estate investment trusts, REITS, and changes in capital gains tax that encourage a massive speculative surge from big vulture funds that have accelerated their investment in this area.  It is causing a dangerous property bubble.</p></speech>

If a house drops from &euro;300,000 to &euro;200,000, it is a reduction of 33.3% but if the house increases from &euro;200,000 to &euro;300,000 it is an increase of 50%.  Moving away from percentages and looking at the actual amount of money by which house prices are rising in Dublin, the prices are still 47% to 50% below where they were at the peak of the boom.</p><p>It is very good news for people who have invested a lot of their savings in houses, particularly those in negative equity, that the housing market is re-establishing itself, of which I am in favour.</p><p> Of course, there is pressure on rents, but part of it is due to the fact that the economy has entered a growth phase and more jobs are being created than even the Government had anticipated.  Many young people are being sucked into Dublin and looking for rental accommodation.  The vulture capitalists the Deputy deplores so much are the ones who are helping to solve the problem.  They will buy whole blocks of apartments and invest to upgrade them.  They are investing in the economy and providing the accommodation we need.  NAMA is playing its part also.  The collapse was so profound that it will take a while to get the housing market back on an even keel again.</p></speech>

Does this not concern the Minister or for that matter the Taoiseach in going to New York and talking about how property investors should come to Dublin because they could make a killing in the Dublin property market?  To start to treat and incentivise speculation in property after the economy was beggared precisely because of that activity seems crazy beyond belief.  One of the consequences of this, as I am sick of pointing out, is an absolutely massive housing and homelessness crisis.  Even the Irish mortgage brokers association has stated it cannot and will not provide social housing for people on low and middle incomes.  It will not do it.  That is why we say rent allowance is not accepted.  On the one hand, we again have speculation in this area and, on the other, we have a homelessness and housing crisis.  When will the Minister wake up?</p></speech>

Key issues affect the credit union sector as it is going through a transformation phase.  There  is much consolidation and credit unions are struggling under onerous lending restrictions.  The Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, is doing its work in restructuring credit unions.  I hope the Minister can give the House an update on the financial health of the sector as per the latest Central Bank assessment.</p></reply>

There were 388 credit unions at the end of December 2013 with total assets of &euro;13.9 billion.  Total members' savings for 2013 amounted to &euro;11.6 billion.  Loans to members have decreased by almost 13 per cent from December 2012 and currently stand at &euro;4.3 billion, with the sector average loan-to-asset ratio at 32%.  Approximately &euro;778 million in total provisions for bad debts were reported for 2013, compared with arrears in the sector of approximately &euro;756 million.  These figures show that just over 100% of arrears are currently being provided for.  A total of 18 credit unions had a reserve ratio less than the required 10%, with a combined deficit of &euro;11 million.</p><p>The Commission on Credit Unions recommended a range of measures to support the credit union sector.  A key recommendation was that the sector be restructured on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis.  The Government contributed &euro;250 million to the credit union fund to support this process, which is being overseen and facilitated by the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo. ReBo has assisted in two credit union mergers recently - the merger of Balbriggan, Skerries and Donabate credit unions to become the Progressive Credit Union, and the merger of Baltinglass and Castledermot credit unions.  ReBo has engaged with more than 300 of the 388 credit unions to identify their willingness to participate in the restructuring process.  Currently, ReBo is assisting 96 credit unions in 47 projects.  ReBo is working to the timetable set out in the commission's report and is expected to complete its work by the end of 2015.   </p><p>The commission also recommended that a statutory stabilisation fund be established to support credit unions that are under-capitalised but are otherwise viable.  The statutory basis for stabilisation is in place and the Department of Finance has published a consultation paper on the introduction of the stabilisation levy of &euro;5 million per year towards a total funding need of &euro;30 million.  At the request of credit union representatives, this consultation process has been extended until the end of May.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 implements more than 60 of the Commission on Credit Unions' recommendations, including those related to governance and regulatory reform.  The Central Bank is currently consulting the sector on the introduction of a tiered regulatory approach under the Act.</p><p>In terms of regulatory interventions, the Central Bank has advised me that about 58% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions.  Of the credit unions with lending restrictions, more than 69% can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member. </p><p>I am satisfied that these measures, together with governance and regulatory changes introduced on foot of the commission report, will underpin a stable credit union sector into the future.</p></reply>

It is a question of bringing about the restructuring that is required in order that the weaker credit unions can be supported by the stronger credit unions, and to have such consolidation ideally on a voluntary basis.  One of the issues to the fore is the lending restrictions that are in place.  The Minister's figures underline the point that the loan-to-asset ratio is 32%.  The credit unions to which I have spoken have buckets of cash but they are simply not allowed to lend it at present because they are working under very onerous lending restrictions imposed by the regulator under the Central Bank, and that is causing a very real problem, not only for the credit unions - because they cannot put members' savings to work - but for the economy generally, because credit unions have always been the option of choice for many consumers who do not have a relationship with the banks.  I am afraid we will lose that connection, which has historically been the bedrock of support for credit unions in communities around the country.  In tandem with the restructuring, I would like to see the Central Bank ease off on the very heavy lending restrictions that are currently being imposed.</p></speech>

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.</p><p>  I have been informed that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in individual credit unions where there are regulatory concerns about their operation and the resultant risk to members' savings.  The criteria assessed to determine the imposition of lending restrictions include, but are not limited to, prudential returns, which are unaudited returns, submitted by the RCU; financial ratios which cover levels of arrears and provision coverage; and the governance framework within the credit union.  Decisions on regulatory restrictions, which are imposed in the form of directions under the Act, are made by the registrar.  Other regulatory restrictions may be imposed as part of an ongoing supervisory engagement.  These may be dealt with by the registrar but they may also be dealt with by a member of the management team, depending on the issue.</p></speech>

The credit union representatives have withdrawn from the Central Bank initiative because of what they regard as an imbalance in the treatment of secured and unsecured lenders.  In their view it vests inappropriate control in the banks and lacks fairness and transparency.  In light of the very slow start, to say the least, the Insolvency Service of Ireland has made on secured and unsecured debt, does the Minister agree this issue needs to be resolved because ultimately it is in everybody's interests if agreements can be reached without recourse to the statutory insolvency procedures?  It is regrettable the credit union representatives have felt the need to withdraw from the Central Bank's initiative.</p></speech>

The pilot helped to highlight factors which assist, as well as issues which prevent, borrowers with multiple debts from finding mutually acceptable informal solutions with their lenders.  Any further initiatives arising from the pilot framework findings are a matter for the Central Bank.  The Central Bank facilitated the scheme in co-operation with the lenders and the operator, StepChange.  Most lenders, including some credit unions, participated in the sample cases.  The pilot scheme has demonstrated to lenders the variety of solutions which can be applied to debtors in distressed debt situations.  Of course statutory insolvency frameworks which deal with secured and unsecured debt are in place and available to any insolvent debtor to propose an arrangement for his or her creditors to restore him or her to solvency.</p><p>  The information which the Central Bank gleaned was of benefit.  Like Deputy McGrath I would like to see more progress being made under the Personal Insolvency Act because it was major legislation processed through the House over a lengthy period of time.</p></speech>

Will the Minister consider responding positively to the calls of workers and trade unions for wage increases?</p></reply>

Indeed this improvement in economic conditions is evident from the fact that certain firms throughout the private sector have recently agreed to pay increases to their employees.  However, other firms, reflecting their own particular circumstances, are not in a position to agree to pay increases.  This reflects the diversity of firms in the economy.</p><p>  In my view, wage negotiations are best conducted at a local level, where individual enterprise or sector specific competitiveness and profitability issues can be taken into account.  For this reason, a return to some form of centralised national wage arrangement does not appear appropriate in current circumstances.  A centralised deal would inevitably result in wage increases that were either too high for some sectors or, in others, lower than would be justified by productivity and competitiveness considerations.</p><p>  In principle, increases in wage rates in profitable enterprises and or sectors that reflect improvements in productivity and that are consistent with competitiveness requirements are welcome.  It is crucial however, given our goal of full employment by 2020, outlined in the medium-term economic strategy, that increases in wages do not come at the cost of lower employment.  While moving in the right direction, unemployment remains unacceptably high and the priority from a labour market perspective must be employment growth.  All of the Government's economic policies are designed with this in mind.  As a small, open economy, long-term sustainable growth in Ireland depends on the health of the internationally-traded sectors.  This requires that costs in the traded and non-traded sectors evolve in a manner that, at a minimum, maintains the economy's competitiveness.</p></speech>

Moreover, 10% of those in which two people are working are suffering deprivation.  Consequently, in addition to the hundreds of thousands who have no work and are suffering poverty and deprivation, there is the significant phenomenon of the working poor, that is, those who are working long and hard but still remain in poverty.  On that level, there is a necessity to shift from wage cutting to wage increases to alleviate such deprivation.  However, it is also extremely clear that taking money out of the pockets of working people, as has been done in the past five years, has absolutely destroyed domestic demand on the high street for small shops and businesses.  Ghost towns are developing nationwide, which is hitting employment because people have no money in their pockets to spend.  While the Minister might have a point about considering this issue on a sector by sector basis, does the Government intend to shift policy and begin to examine ways to push up the wages and disposable incomes of low and middle income workers?</p></speech>

I suppose the biggest contribution has been made by those who lost their jobs.  There is a trade-off between the general level of pay in an economy and the number of new jobs one can provide.  The priority of the Government is focused on creating new jobs.  However, that is not to state there are no profitable sectors within the economy, as, of course, there are.  The Government encourages the profitable sectors to give wage increases to their employees, which also forms part of Government policy.  I understand that in 2013 approximately 40% of firms in the private sector gave wage increases.  While I cannot provide a statistic for the Deputy, I understand this trend is continuing and strengthening into 2014.  However, the Government is not disposed to return to centralised wage bargaining.  It considers the best way to do it is for those showing increases in productivity or profitability and which have the wherewithal to provide modest wage increases.  However, competitiveness within the economy must be maintained.  It is because Ireland has become quite competitive that the economy is now producing up to 5,000 extra jobs per month.</p></speech>

Employee compensation as a percentage of total operating costs in Ireland stands at 22%, one of the lowest anywhere in Europe.  It is considerably less for workers than is the case in Britain, France, Germany and most other European countries.  Workers in this country, frankly, are being screwed against a backdrop in which productivity is high and profits are rising.  The collapse of the joint labour committees and the lack of legislation on collective bargaining, thereby giving workers trade union rights, mean employers are not disposed to give people wage increases, even where they are making profits.  What proactive measures will the Government take to ensure workers get a share of the profits they are producing to deliver them from deprivation, as well as to give a boost to the economy which could lead to the creation of jobs?  There is no trade-off involved as if workers are paid a little more, they will have more to spend and it could create more jobs.</p></speech>

Many of the wage rates for comparative work in the United Kingdom are about the same or lower.  However, if one looks towards eastern Europe, the countries of which compete with us frequently, there are much lower pay rates.  I recall that in my own home town of Limerick the reason the manufacturing end of Dell was transferred to Poland was Polish wage rates were far lower than those which prevailed in Ireland at the time.  Consequently, when one talks about Europe, one should recall that there are 28 member states and that it extends far to the east.</p></speech>

It is seeking to use many of the benefits of growth to create additional jobs because there are high unemployment levels and many students are coming out of schools and colleges.</p><p>However, at the same time we know that there are companies that have had productivity gains and gains on profitability, and we think wage increases are justified in those circumstances.</p></speech>

I support this worthwhile initiative, but the figures for the drawdown thus far have been disappointing.  The expectation at the time it was announced was that in the first year the additional amount would be approximately &euro;100 million, and that the yield would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years.  I understand the actual amount raised, however, is about &euro;25 million thus far.  Has the Minister any plans to review it or to broaden the scope to make it more attractive so that more people will avail of what I think is a worthwhile initiative?</p></reply>

The provisions also apply to AVCs made to personal retirement savings accounts.  Administrators of AVC funds, including PRSA administrators, are required to provide within 15 working days of the end of each quarter, commencing with the quarter ending on 30 June 2013, certain statistical information to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to AVC and PRSA pre-retirement transfers or encashments made during the quarter in question.  The tax deducted from the aggregate value of transfers made in the period to 31 December 2013 - the latest date for which details are available - was close to &euro;26 million.  The yield from this measure was estimated in budget 2013 at &euro;100 million in 2013 and &euro;200 million in total over three years.</p><p>  Pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs is allowed on a tax-neutral basis.  The contributions were tax-relieved at the individual's marginal income tax rate on the way in and are taxed at the individual's marginal income tax rate on withdrawal.  The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant, with transfers or encashments running at an average of &euro;22 million per quarter up to the end of 2013.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that this is a measure which was designed to enable rather than to incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions.  It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and it would appear that most individuals with AVCs have, to date, decided to preserve their AVC pension savings for this purpose.</p></speech>

The issue of early access to pensions raises its head every now and then.  It is an important issue that needs to be debated.  The scope of what the Minister introduced in budget 2013 was quite narrow.  For example, employer-paid contributions were excluded, as were regular employee contributions, self-employed personal pensions, normal PRSAs and AVCs which were made for the purposes of purchasing notional added years.  I agree there cannot be a free-for-all situation.  It is important to continue to support people who are saving for their retirement, and there has to be a limit to the circumstances in which people are allowed early access to their pension savings.  However, there is a need to examine other scenarios such as cases of critical illness or over-indebtedness, or cases in which a person's financial position could be greatly improved if early access was allowed.  Has the Minister any plans to review this initiative with a view to possibly broadening its scope?</p></speech>

I realise the importance of making proper provision for pension purposes; however, if people are absolutely financially stuck they might need access to savings they have put away in AVCs.  Certainly the drawdown was less than I expected.</p><p>I would have thought, as a result of the advocacy by different groups and the personal representations made by Deputies on all sides of the House, that there would be a bigger take-up.  That said, the Finance Bill provided for a three year wind-down starting in June 2013.  I will look at the issue in the context of the next Finance Bill and, in particular, take into account the suggestions made by the Deputy to see if we will let it run, as initiated in the last Finance Bill, or modify it to make it more attractive, as the Deputy would describe it.  I do not want to incentivise it.  It is tax neutral.</p></speech>

In very narrow circumstances we could allow people to access a proportion, not all, of the money they have put away because in the circumstances I have outlined where there is loss of employment, a critical illness or they are simply drowning in debt, the money would be of far more use to them than it will be in ten or 15 years time when retirement is on the horizon.  There are limited circumstances in which the economy, as well as the individuals concerned, would benefit and it might encourage more people to join a pension scheme if there was a little flexibility.</p></speech>

If there was access to AVCs to meet debt, the banks would force people to forgo their future for the present.  That is the problem and the issue needs to be dealt with.  We are in a broken system, but there are ways by which the issue of debt should be dealt with in a humane way.  However, allowing one's bank to rob one's future should not be on the cards.  I strike that note of caution.</p></speech>

They have stated a crisis that was in abeyance for the past few years because of uncertainty is now ready to explode, particularly for the 33,000 families over two years in arrears.

As I mentioned, these lenders are Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank Ireland.  They are required to meet targets for both "proposed" and "concluded" sustainable solutions for their principal dwelling home and buy-to-let mortgagees who are in arrears for more than 90 days.</p><p>In that context, a sustainable solution has been defined in the Central Bank's published MART, mortgage arrears resolution targets, document as one of the following: an arrangement, concluded in accordance with the CCMA, code of conduct on mortgage arrears, where the borrower is co-operating under the MARP, mortgage arrears resolution process, and the bank has satisfied itself that the arrangement provides a sustainable solution which is likely to enable the customer to meet the original or, as appropriate, the amended terms of the mortgage over the full remaining life of the mortgage; a personal insolvency arrangement, effected under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012; or, if an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the property securing the mortgage loan has been voluntarily sold or, failing that, any situation where a bank takes possession of the property, including by way of voluntary agreement with the borrower or by court order or otherwise.</p><p>Regarding performance to date, the lenders have reported to the Central Bank that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target in the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% third quarter target.  Regarding the third quarter, the lenders reported they had issued, in total, proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears of more than 90 days.  Furthermore, last December, the Central Bank set its expectations for the quarter ending June 2014 which requires that sustainable solutions be offered to customers to reach 75% of over 90-day arrears and for concluded solutions to reach 35% by that date.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The CCMA applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his or her primary residence.  The CCMA requires lenders to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender.  Such alternative repayment arrangements may include reducing the principal sum to a specified amount and-or an alternative modification of the mortgage such as interest only repayments on the mortgage for a specified period of time; permanently reducing the interest rate on the mortgage; an arrangement to pay interest and part of the normal capital amount for a specified period of time; deferring payment of all or part of the scheduled mortgage repayment for a specified period of time; extending the term of the mortgage; changing the type of the mortgage; adding arrears and interest to the principal amount due; equity participation; and warehousing part of the mortgage, including through a split mortgage.</p><p>However, it remains the case that it is at the discretion of each lender, including, as provided for in the relationship frameworks, those banks in which the State has a shareholding interest, which alternative repayment arrangements it offers to borrowers in arrears.  These are operational decisions for the individual lender having regard to the circumstances of individual cases.  In this context, however, the CCMA requires a lender to document its considerations of each option examined, including the reasons why the options offered to the borrower are appropriate and sustainable for his or her individual circumstances and why the options considered and not offered to the borrower are not appropriate and not sustainable for the borrower's individual circumstances.</p><p>In order to improve transparency for borrowers, provision 14 of the CCMA also requires that a lender must detail, in its MARP booklet, which is issued to borrowers in arrears of more than 31 days and must be published on its website, the alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender, including how they work, their key features and an outline of the lender's criteria for assessing requests for alternative repayment arrangements.</p></reply>

Lenders are not seriously implementing the mortgage-to-rent scheme, for example, which would be a way of dealing with people in real repayment difficulty.  There is significant inconsistency across the banks because the Minister gave them the veto in the personal insolvency legislation.  Banks are being banks.  That is what we were told in the finance committee.  Banks will always behave with their best interests at heart, not in the best interests of distressed mortgage holders.  The Minister&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure consistency and fairness for the tens of thousands of people in mortgage distress.</p></speech>

Term extensions and arrears recapitalisation are the dominant permanent restructure types, comprising 60% of the total.  It should be noted there has been an increase in the number of split mortgages to over 7,100 from approximately 2,500 at the end of August 2013.  This includes split mortgages on a trial basis, pending the completion of a short period of successful payments.  Temporary restructures have fallen over the period, as a greater focus is being applied to permanent restructures.  Total restructures of accounts more than 90 days in arrears are around 21,000.  The proportion of these that are classified as permanent is increasing every month.  Regarding buy-to-let properties, a key point to note is that receivers have been appointed in respect of 3,721 accounts.  Progress is being made across the range of options that are being applied to restructured debt.</p></speech>

In the last two months of 2013, there were 3,331 proceedings for repossession, a significant increase the finance committee was told last week.  As I already pointed out, there has been no serious effort to offer the mortgage-to-rent option for people on the lowest incomes.  Instead, for much of the time, the so-called long-term solutions are just demands for voluntary surrender.  There is radical inconsistency across the banks.</p><p>Does the Minister intend to let the banks carry on doing what they want to do or does he propose to improve fairness and consistency in this area by intervening more in the process?  That is what we called for last week at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

I understand the joint committee will have the banks before it shortly and individual cases can be raised with them.  The information we in the Department of Finance have got from the Department of Justice and Equality advises that the number of new civil bills issued for the first two months of 2014 was approximately 450.  The Deputy knows well that the issuing of a civil bill is a long way back from repossession.  Usually, many of these bills just sit there and are left unprocessed, as there is little repossession in the Irish system.  I am glad of that.  We do not want houses to be repossessed.  It is untrue and it upsets people to suggest that the banks are on a rampage now and are into tens of thousands of repossessions.  They are not.</p></speech>

We also made clear that we fully expected that any purchaser of the IBRC mortgage portfolio would service the loan books in accordance with the CCMA.  This expectation has been met in recent days with the conclusion of the sale of the IBRC mortgage portfolio.  The two purchasers of the residential mortgage loans, Loanstar and Oaktree, have both committed to servicing these books in accordance with the terms of the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA. </p><p>  The Department's legislative programme includes the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill, which will address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the Central Bank's CCMA after loan books are sold to unregulated entities.  In preparation for this legislation, my officials have been considering how best to ensure that the protections under the CCMA and other codes continue to apply when a loan book is sold to an unregulated entity.  The complexities of this issue have been discussed at meetings with officials in the Central Bank, and the Attorney General's office has been kept informed of progress.  Draft heads of the legislation have been sent to the Central Bank for its consideration in advance of more detailed engagement with the Attorney General's office.  I do not consider it appropriate to discuss the details of these draft heads now, because we are at a very preliminary stage and the heads have not been cleared from a legal viewpoint.  However, I hope that whatever changes are made will also include giving these mortgage holders access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p></speech>

It is not my job to give out legal advice, but I believe that when there is a serious agreement between two people, even if they only shake hands on it, there is a contract.  Some of the guarantees we saw before the sale were transmitted by way of e-mail and in written form.  Therefore, I work under the assumption that there is a contractual obligation.</p><p>Lone Star and Oaktree are reputable organisations and I do not think they would welsh on their commitments.  There is a tranche of loans which may be transferred to NAMA.  We also have guarantees from NAMA that it will implement all of the protocols agreed with the Central Bank.  To make doubly sure, I am preparing legislation.  As I described, although we have sent the heads of the Bill to the Central Bank and are consulting the Attorney General's office, we are at a preliminary stage.  There are complex issues which will take time to work out.  We will work through them and underpin the voluntary agreements made with legislation in due course.</p></speech>

Is all of this not putting the cart before the horse?  Why did the Minister not introduce the legislation first and make the sale second, rather than making the sale first, leaving people vulnerable and then trying to bring forward the legislation retrospectively?  They are two specific and separate questions.</p></speech>

It will take some time to bring it to a conclusion.  The other reason is that we had guarantees from the potential purchasers that they would honour the codes of practice set down by the Central Bank.  They are reputable organisations and there is no reason to doubt them.  Where other loan books have been sold to other organisations, nobody has run into any difficulty with the codes of practice.  While the sales were made some time ago, nobody has come forward to say there was a lack of compliance with the codes of practice.</p></speech>

I have said we will be generous in facilitating the passage of the legislation to protect mortgage holders.  What is its legal standing?  Was it a spit in the hand and a firm handshake between somebody from the Central Bank, Lone Star and the other companies that bought these loans?  Was it agreed to by e-mail?  The Minister seems to suggest that although the loans of thousands of mortgage holders were sold a number of weeks ago, he is still completely in the dark as to whether there is a contractual agreement or it is just somebody in an office sending an e-mail to the Central Bank with a nod and a wink agreeing that the institutions will comply and telling the Central Bank not to worry.  Is the Minister not concerned whatsoever?  Should he not take some interest in this issue and find out if the e-mail correspondence which seems to give the only assurance that they will comply with the CCMA is of a contractual nature?</p></speech>

It also talks about the damage done to other charities because of the serious issues raised regarding the operation of Rehab.  Many issues have emerged recently, in particular the necessity for the former CEOs Mr. Frank Flannery and Ms Angela Kerins to ensure they appear again before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The issues are serious and involve the expenditure of a considerable amount of public money and the organisation paying for the lobbying of Departments, including the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection.  The organisation, allegedly, paid its director Mr. Flannery for lobbying the Government on a range of issues, including the charitable lotteries issue and National Learning Network.  Given that Mr. Flannery had unparalleled access to the Government, the Taoiseach in particular - he enjoyed a pass from Fine Gael to enter Leinster House unhindered - the issues are serious.  Was the Taoiseach aware at any stage that Mr. Flannery was being paid by Rehab to lobby Ministers and Departments?  Does he agree with me that there is a serious question mark over the ethical correctness of such action?  Does he believe it is correct and proper that a section 39 body such as Rehab, that enjoys regular engagement with the Government and Departments because of the nature of its relationship with the State, should pay its director to lobby Ministers and Departments?  I do not, but I would like the Taoiseach's view on it.  Does he accept that it is extremely important that Mr. Flannery and Ms Kerins respond to the request from the Committee of Public Accounts and appear before it to ensure full transparency on all of these issues?</p></speech>

My only engagements with the man the Deputy mentioned have been purely political in terms of elections and constituencies.  That is why we are introducing legislation on freedom of information, whistleblowers and lobbyists.  It is only right and proper that there be full accountability and transparency about these matters.  I have no information on whether organisations were paying personnel to meet people with political responsibility.  For a very long time my belief has been that anybody involved with a section 38 or section 39 organisation should appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, as that would be in the interests of charities.  We have already agreed that when people make donations to their charity of choice, they need to feel happy that all of that money will go for the purposes for which it is intended.  That is why the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has introduced a regulator which will change the nature of the perception of charities for the good of everybody.  When the regulator is <i>in situ</i>, auditing the accounts of charities, people will know everything is as it should be.</p><p>My view for a long time has been that everybody associated with section 39 organisations should of course be prepared to go before the Committee of Public Accounts and deal with any questions that may arise.</p></speech>

The other question was whether it is right and ethically correct for an organisation such as Rehab to pay one of its directors to lobby Ministers and Departments.  Does the Taoiseach believe that is right, given the very regular access that such bodies, like Rehab, would have to the Government?  Department officials meet representatives of these organisations on a regular basis to discuss service plans and a range of service level agreements.  Does the Taoiseach believe it is right that these organisations should pay directors significant sums of money for the purpose of lobbying Departments and Ministers?  This case is unique, as the Taoiseach has stated the individual concerned had unparalleled access to Ministers, particularly with this Government.  He had a pass for Leinster House and so on.  To put it mildly, one's reaction would have been one of some surprise when it emerged that this was the case, as reported by <i>The Irish Times</i>.  A body such as Rehab should not in any shape or form have to pay anybody to lobby Departments, and the Government should be clear in instructing such bodies that they should not pay people to lobby the Government, particularly when the Government normally enters into relationships by means of service plans etc.  There is something amiss in that respect.  Does the Taoiseach believe it right and ethically correct for an organisation like Rehab to pay a director to lobby Departments?</p></speech>

We also know this is part of a journey and much more needs to be done on the ground in the North and between both parts of the Ireland, particularly with the issue of rights.  There are great possibilities and much potential in all of this, which needs focus and commitment from everybody.  All identities across the island, whether Irish, British or other, must be given respect on the basis of equality.</p><p>  The participation of Mr. Martin McGuinness is another sign of positive commitment by Irish republicans to engagement with our Unionist neighbours - she represents all the people in the North - and a new relationship with Britain based on equality and mutual respect.  This is all very much work in progress and the State visit should be an incentive for us to look beyond this week to build the peace and continue this journey to finish our unfinished business.  Does the Taoiseach agree the occasion of this week's State visit, which is wonderful in itself, should also focus minds on the need for political leaders to resolve all the outstanding issues in the peace process?</p></speech>

President Higgins will fulfil his duties admirably and set out in his own unique fashion the range of historical, academic, educational, social and cultural connections between the people on the two islands.  This goes back to the point raised by the Deputy about whither the peace process.  I am reminded of the words of former US President Clinton in Derry when he said we had to finish the job.  The five groups in Northern Ireland party to the Haass talks must get to grips with a position where young people in Northern Ireland have found the political process is a blockage to the future, as it is tied to the past in a way in which it will not let go.  We all understand it is not right and proper to forget what happened in the past but there is a way of dealing with it.</p><p>  I expect the President, in his comments and engagement with the Irish diaspora over the next few days, to set out in his own unique way another platform by which this engagement can take place.  It was in July 1593 go ndeachaigh Gr&aacute;inne N&iacute; Mh&aacute;ille thall go Londain ag caint le Banr&iacute;on &Eacute;il&iacute;s a hAon.  N&iacute; i mB&eacute;arla n&oacute; i nGaeilge a bh&iacute;odar ag caint, ach i Laidin.  A second formidable personality from the west of Ireland was the first to make the connection in Buckingham Palace and there was a third formidable personality in the form of former President McAleese.  This is an occasion for everybody to reflect on where we can go from here.</p><p>  Perhaps it is a pity the Deputy First Minister did not visit Dublin Castle when the Queen was here just a couple of years ago.  I do not want to sound a discordant note but the importance of the issue then was equal to now.  In any event I hope the occasion in Britain will be outstanding for the Irish diaspora and people, as well as the connection between our two people and Governments.  I noted Deputy First Minister McGuinness's comments about being invited to the Queen's house.  It is some house.</p></speech>

We need to celebrate peace on the streets as well as in the big houses and palaces.  It needs to be felt in loyalist hinterlands and republican communities.  It needs to be felt along the Border corridor.  This is a journey and, uniquely, there is an all-island dimension to this, with Mr. Peter Robinson, Mr. McGuinness, an Uachtar&aacute;n and the Taoiseach having been there.  That is essential.  Many times, when commentators in this State speak about the nation, they mean the Twenty-six Counties.  When they speak about "nationally", they mean across the Twenty-six Counties and when they speak about Ireland, they mean the Twenty-six Counties.  We need to think in an all-island way, and when I looked to frame this question, I wanted to do it in a way that considered the possibilities of which a Government here could avail.</p><p>The Taoiseach should forget about the British.  What can the Government do to seize and build on these opportunities?  There is a series of initiatives that could have a real impact on communities in the North and along the Border corridor.  I am 100% sure the President and Sabina and all of our other representatives will do us proud this week.  We should, however, consider the potential and possibilities beyond this week and build on them.  Let us remind ourselves that it took 93 years to put this visit together.  It did not take Martin McGuinness 93 years to do it, rather it took the State and the British Government 93 years to put it together.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the real significance of this state visit will be realised in a lasting way only if we continue to build the peace, transform and complete the journey we are all on?</p></speech>

I also agree that this is an opportunity to take another step forward.  It might be a very good idea if everybody could get together and say Dr. Haass made genuine attempts to move the process forward and ask could we not come to agreements on a range of issues about the past, parades and flags.  As I have said before to the Deputy, when one meets the people from Ballymurphy, one taps into the reservoir of raw emotion because the matter was never concluded.  When one talks to the survivors of the Kingsmills massacre, there is the same emotion for people on the island of Ireland who feel the issue has never been satisfactorily concluded in the sense of finding out what happened.  I have also said on many occasions to the Deputy that there is the question of the families of the disappeared who have not had closure.</p><p>  Everybody could take from the visit of President Higgins to Britain an opportunity to reflect again on what we could do for young people, North and South, who would see the excitement of being able to conclude issues arising from the past and look forward to the adventure of the future.  Politicians have that responsibility; that is what they were elected to do.  The Government will work tooth and nail to bring about that sort of understanding, but we cannot forget about the British, with whom we have a very close, unprecedented relationship, through economics, business and in many other ways.  The Good Friday Agreement speaks for itself.  We need to move to have it concluded and fully implemented, with the Weston Park agreement, and deal with the other issues that affect people every day of their lives in fragile communities on either side.  I hope that from this will come an opportunity to move the process forward.</p><p>  The Deputy cannot blame the Government of the Republic for everything.</p></speech>

I again refer to what former President Clinton said in Derry: &ldquo;I came here 20 years ago.  I am back again.  Finish the job.&rdquo;  The job can only be finished by the politicians, the elected leaders of the people across the spectrum, and this requires understanding, tolerance, compromise and a capacity to say, "I might not have got everything I looked for, but let us move on."  I hope the President&rsquo;s visit to the house of the Queen today and in the next few days and his engagement with the Irish Diaspora will bring about a new understanding of what we can achieve together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800019#R00700"><p>The negative equity generation has fared very poorly under the Government which refuses to make child care affordable, while reducing child benefit.  It forces people to pay property tax on their debts, while claiming it is a tax on wealth.  It taxes on the double those who have become accidental landlords.  It denies families the right to bid on their own mortgages, while selling these mortgages to US-based vulture funds.  To date, the insolvency service has processed only approximately 50 cases because the Government gave the banks a veto over all proceedings.  The result is that over 175,000 mortgages are in arrears.  For three years the Government has allowed the banks to ride roughshod over these individuals and families.  The only thing it has done is set targets for the banks to make offers of &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; restructures, but it has let the banks define &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;.</p><p>  In advance of the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform this week, the banks have submitted their latest figures to the end of the year for these so-called sustainable restructures.  The good news is that they have hit the Government&rsquo;s targets.  The bad news concerns how they have done so.  As of 1 January, approximately 57,000 offers had been made, of which a total of 52,000 do not include any financial concession from the banks whatsoever, in spite of the people making &euro;7.5 billion available to them to deal with the mortgage crisis.  Approximately 18,000 of the offers made will increase the amount the mortgage holders will pay to the banks over the course of the mortgages.  Approximately 5,000 are so-called voluntary surrenders.  As of 1 January, approximately 22,000 of these so-called offers of sustainable restructures were the subject of legal proceedings.  That figure will have increased significantly since 1 January.  I recall Fine Gael stating during the general election campaign that it would help the negative equity generation.  Instead it has abandoned it.  It has hiked people's taxes to pay for the sins of the bankers, while allowing the banks to squeeze those in mortgage arrears for every cent they have.  When they do not have any more, they go into arrears and the Government lets the banks do as they please.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied with these targets, with how the banks have hit them and that 22,000 cases of legal proceedings count as sustainable offers of mortgage restructuring?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800019#R00800"><p>No, I am not happy that people are still in mortgage distress because of the catastrophic economic situation and I will not be happy until everybody has received a workable and practical offer that is not just related to interest-only repayments.  The total number of permanent restructures, those that work in a sustainable way, has increased to approximately 54,000 accounts.  Term extensions and arrears capitalisations are the dominant permanent restructure type.  They comprise approximately 60% of the total.  There has been an increase in the number of split mortgages to over 7,100 from 2,500 at the end of August last.  This includes split mortgages on a trial basis, pending completion of a short period of successful payments.  The targets have been set by the Government and the Central Bank for the banks to achieve.  It is down to the relationship between the borrower and the lender and how they avail of the suite of opportunities available to work out a solution in each individual case.</p><p>  The Deputy commented that we had said we would help those in negative equity.  What should we do, except strive to make the economy more competitive, productive and strong?  There is growth in the economy.  We have managed to pull the country back from an economic abyss.  We created 61,000 jobs last year.  Interest rates have fallen from 15% to less than 3%.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, can go back into the international bond markets with a sense of confidence and be in a position to raise finance to meet most of its financial requirements in 2015.  That helps to create the opportunity for an increase in house valuations and property prices again, but it is uneven.  There is pressure to have significant numbers of houses built in the greater Dublin area and other cities and so on.  The rise in property values and prices has not touched all parts of the country.  When the Deputy asks me to help those in negative equity, the best answer is that we rectify the public finances and get people working.  That is what stimulates confidence, growth and jobs in the economy and prosperity.</p><p>Were we to continue in the position in which we found the country, we would be paying back another &euro;3.1 billion on the promissory notes today.  That would give cause for raising a variety of questions here, I should think.</p></speech>

The problem lies in the Taoiseach's answer.  He stated that recapitalisation of arrears and term extensions account for 60% of the offers made to date.  Recapitalisation of arrears and term extensions are not sustainable for people who have too much debt.  Both of those so-called solutions increase the total payments made over the lifetime of a mortgage.  He asked what does he do besides creating jobs.  It is great that the jobs figure is rising.  I will tell him what this Government needs to do for people who are in mortgage arrears.  It needs to focus not just on the quantity of offers made but also on the quality of those offers and the consistency of offers across lenders.  Last week the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform met representatives of organisations supporting mortgage holders.  These are the people who are on the ground helping mortgage holders.  They stated that providing figures for targets approved is counterproductive because the focus is on the target and, therefore, not on the individual.  Representatives made the following observations:<blockquote>Over 3,000 people contacted FLAC last year through our centres and telephone lines in utter frustration at the lack of professionalism in the way they were being dealt with...<br /><br />The helpline has handled 11,000 calls since its establishment.  Of those calls, approximately one half was made after the people had already received a final offer from their lender and two thirds of those were sale or repossession.  That was the only offer on the table...<br /><br />We have a crazy situation, whereby it is alleged that repossessions take place only as a last resort but there is no front-end supervision or monitoring and no rules to ensure that is the case...  It is like the Gaza Strip. Individual lenders can do anything... The Central Bank confirmed to us in July that it does not have the power to compel lenders to offer specific products... The only language that these guys understand is legislation.  The only thing that is going to work is firm, strict, unambiguous and crystal clear legislation.</blockquote>In light of the overwhelming evidence for the benefits of a sustainable set of mandated solutions for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of men and women in terms of ensuring consistency, quality and fairness, will the Taoiseach consider introducing legislation that mandates a single set of solutions for mortgage holders?</p></speech>

There are people who do not want to engage with lenders in the first place.  That only makes the situation worse because if a solution is to be found, it will take two to work it out.  The task before the Government and the facilities available to the Government, the Central Bank and the banks - the finance committee can help on this - is to work out sustainable solutions for everybody so that, as the economy improves and negative equity declines, those who have felt this distress for quite a long time can have it removed and go back into the economy to play their part as the country develops.</p></speech>

This was a modification of what he said earlier, when he made it clear to the House that individual householders would know their water bills before the local elections.  He subsequently modified that to "the average".  He told the D&aacute;il: "[T]he Government will, before the local elections, produce, publish and debate the financial and business model dealing with the structure and running of Irish Water."</p><p>He stated that it would provide the regulator with the policy framework it needs to proceed with setting the pricing structure, and that involved four key items: the free allowance, the level of public subvention, the first fixed policy, and low-income household supports.  That was in February.  Despite repeated questions, the Taoiseach has not yet given a firm answer as to when we can expect the production and publication of that model.  The only degree of precision we can get from the Taoiseach is that it will be in the next few weeks.  For many weeks, we have heard "the next few weeks" emanating from the Taoiseach.  One would be forgiven for suspecting that the Government is playing politics with this and that, essentially, it wants to hide or prevent the proper cost of water charges emerging before the local elections.  That, in essence, seems to be unfolding.</p><p> Despite what the Taoiseach earlier stated, the Regulator is now saying it will be June before he will get it and August before he will be able to do the prices.  Many out there are asking how much the water charges will be, and they cannot get an answer.  Can the Minister indicate when the Government will be prepared to publish and facilitate the debate on the financial and business model dealing with the structure and running of Irish Water so that people will get some sense of what lies ahead in terms of the level of water charges they might face in the last quarter of this year?</p></speech>

On upcoming legislation, the Government has accepted the need to appoint a Garda authority and I want to ask when the Government intends to bring forward its amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This is a proposition for which we have long argued, especially given our experience in the North and the positive role of the police authority there.</p><p>  I was trying to figure it out in my own head.  The policy authority in the North appoints the chief constable.  Is it the Government's plan that the Garda authority here appoint the Commissioner, or does the Government intend to do that in the meantime?  This is a particularly important issue as the Government comes to deal with this.  When can we expect the Government's amendments and when would the Minister expect the process to be completed and the amended Bill to be passed?</p><p>  I want to raise the Walsh and Murphy reports.  In July last, the Taoiseach told us that the Walsh report on symphysiotomy would be published soon.  The Minister, at that point, had it two months earlier, yet almost a year later it is still not published.  In November last, Judge Murphy was asked to examine the issue of symphysiotomy to bring closure to the many women who have suffered from that barbaric practice.  That report was to be completed in eight weeks, and I understand that the Minister now has it.  When will the Government publish these two reports?  Equally importantly, I suppose, when will the Government publish its proposals to end this nightmare for the women victims of symphysiotomy?</p></speech>

That committee has been established today.  It is hoped that substantial progress will be made by the end of this year but, obviously, its work will have to depend on the progress made.  The Taoiseach will report to the House on a regular basis the progress that is being made in the production of that legislation.</p></speech>

The Minister is determined to reform that, and it is clearly the direction in which the Minister is seeking to reform the health service.  We have always recognised that such reform is a lengthy process, and widespread consultation will now be undertaken with a view to implementing that reform over the period to 2019.  Health legislation will be introduced as part of the implementation of that reform but the Deputy will have ample opportunity to make a submission on the development of that reform in the health service.</p></speech>

Cattle born in Ireland but finished in Northern Ireland or Britain have no home.  They are nomads and not recognised under law in Britain.  We can export cattle to Benghazi but not to Birmingham.  This is undermining the Common Market and the livelihoods of Irish beef farmers.  In the context of Statutory Instrument 484 of 2013 in respect of the Common Market, the regulation will becomes law from 13 June.  May we have a debate on it prior to its enactment and will the Minister, given his responsibility for protecting the Common Market, ensure we will be able to export cattle from this jurisdiction north of the Border in order that they can be slaughtered and enter the food chain?  This is undermining the livelihoods of farmers and communities throughout the country.</p></speech>

In many cases, if they were in a position to purchase the properties, they would pay less than the rent they are paying to local authorities.  Given that capital values have fallen, there is an opportunity for local authority tenants to acquire their properties and they are most interested in doing so.

Eimear suffers from a very aggressive and rapid form of motor neurone disease, MND.  Her symptoms first became apparent in January 2013, and she received her diagnosis last October.  Between January last year and now she has completely lost the use of her feet, legs and lower back.  Her arms are now weakening and her ability to speak and swallow have severely diminished.  She wrote to me a couple of weeks ago, telling me:<blockquote>To assist with my breathing I am now on non-invasive ventilation at night.  The amount of time I require to be on this machine will increase in the near future.  The progress of my disease means that when the MND reaches my chest, my ability to self-respirate will deteriorate and ultimately fail.  This is the stage at which I can be kept alive using invasive ventilation.  All of this will, and can happen, despite my mental faculties and all of my senses being in 100% working order.</blockquote>I have some questions on which I hope the Minister of State can shed light.  First, how much would it cost the HSE to provide invasive ventilation for someone with motor neurone disease living at home?  What Eimear is really looking for is a detailed breakdown of the costs involved in invasive ventilation.  She said: <blockquote>The only figure - plucked out of the air - that I have ever heard is &euro;300,000 per year.  From our research, we cannot get anywhere beyond a cost that is a mere fraction of this figure, for care that is tailored to me, in my individual circumstance.  I need someone to sit down with me and go through how much a package of home care, unique to me and my personal situation, will cost.</blockquote>I understand there are currently two people in Ireland with motor neurone disease who are living at home on invasive ventilation.  Could the Minister of State tell me how that is funded?  Is he willing to meet with Eimear to discuss her situation?  It appears that money is the main issue.  I accept the Government does not have an unlimited supply of money but this woman&rsquo;s life is at stake.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800023#V00200"><p>I thank Deputy Wallace for raising this issue.  Motor neurone disease is a complex and challenging condition.  The diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals with motor neurone disease requires input from a wide variety of services, ranging from GP and community services through to acute hospital and specialist disability services.</p><p>  I understand that the individual at the centre of this case has complex needs.  I am familiar with the case raised by the Deputy.  The HSE has advised me that numerous multidisciplinary meetings have taken place to try to ensure appropriate care for Mrs. Lynch-Rowe.  She is currently receiving continuous positive airway pressure therapy at night time provided by HSE community services.  The HSE is continuing to explore all options for this patient's future care.  The HSE remains available at all times to discuss these issues directly with the individual and her family.</p><p>  The HSE advises that the question of whether a patient can access home ventilation therapy, whether invasive or non-invasive, is not purely a financial issue but must be considered across a number of dimensions, including: First, a proper discharge care plan, which is discussed between the hospital consultant team and the appropriate primary or community care team, needs to be agreed and activated to ensure the appropriate set-up is in place and can be sustained to meet the care needs of the patient over time; home ventilation needs appropriate equipment, trained staff and both patient and family education as well as arrangements for the upkeep and maintenance of such ventilation equipment; nurses supervising such patients at home need to be appropriately qualified and competent to supervise the patient clinically; and, a commitment to provide the necessary financial resources to support the care arrangement into the future.</p><p>  As I mentioned earlier, the patient is currently using non-invasive ventilation therapy in the home and I understand that there is currently no clinical indication for full mechanical ventilation in this case.  However, the HSE has advised that this case will be kept under review and should a requirement for invasive home ventilation therapy be identified for this patient in the future this matter will be considered by the relevant hospital and community services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800023#V00300"><p>My second question related to a breakdown of the cost.  I accept there are many issues at stake.  The Minister of State referred to equipment and trained staff and where the financial resources would come from.  Has anyone estimated the potential cost to provide such a service in the home?  Does the Minister of State have even an approximate figure?</p><p>  Is it the case that the HSE will meet with Eimear and discuss her care needs?  It is possible that with co-operation and goodwill a care package could be provided at a lower cost than some might fear.</p><p>  Members are aware of a recent case where a woman wanted to end her life because of illness but the State did not allow that.  That is currently the rule of the land so Eimear would not be allowed to take her life either.  The issue is whether the State could take the decision to allow her to die.  If the State cannot find the money to provide the necessary care then, in effect, it would be making a call that an individual is not allowed to make.  That might appear stark and I hope it would never come to that but the issue is complex and it would be great if there was serious co-operation to explore the ways to resolve matters.</p></speech>

I am assured that is the case.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy that there are complex issues involved.  In deference to the individual concerned I wish to move away from the case that has been raised because Deputy Wallace is touching on the broader ethical question of how such decisions are made in terms of cost.  I agree with him that such issues are enormously difficult and complex, ethically and otherwise.  They deserve a lot more debate in society and perhaps in this House.  We should try to find a context where we would debate that.</p><p>  To return to the individual situation under discussion, it is not the case that it is reducible to the question of cost.  As I indicated, there are a number of different factors and according to the expert medical opinion available to me and the HSE I am advised that there is no clinical indication for full mechanical ventilation in this case.  That having been said, I do not wish for a moment to indicate to the Deputy that I am in any sense dismissive of the issue he raised.  I am aware of the particular case.  The HSE will discuss the issues directly with the individual concerned and her family but in these circumstances it would be wrong to draw the conclusion that this is in any way reducible simply to the question of cost because there are clinical considerations as well.</p></speech>

David Garvey is a young man, he is only 33 years of age and he suffers from a very complex condition called locked-in syndrome, which leaves him completely paralysed apart from control of his eye movements.  He cannot move or speak and his only form of communication is through blinking or eye gaze. Despite this dreadful affliction, David is fully conscious and able to think and reason normally.</p><p>His condition requires a high level of medical attention.  He is currently receiving care from the excellent staff in Beaumont Hospital, but his fervent wish is that he be allowed to leave hospital and be nursed in his home in Dundalk.  In January, David was delighted to hear that the HSE had approved this request and the required funding of &euro;200,000 to &euro;250,000, which would enable him to go home.  However, this was, in effect, overturned and the HSE now claims that the cost would be in the region of &euro;400,000 to &euro;450,000.  I am interested to find out how we can have two such wildly varying figures in the space of a few weeks, and which figure is accurate.  I believe the Minister of State would acknowledge that David's case is quite a tragic and sensitive one and deserves the most sensitive care and attention we could possibly give it.  </p><p>Perhaps we should reflect on David's own words to the HSE, which he wrote with the aid of his family, holding up an alphabet chart and which I wish to put on the record.  He wrote:<blockquote>Can you please close your eyes and imagine lying in bed not being able to move a muscle and being hooked up to a life support machine?  Imagine when you open your eyes the first thing you see is a ceiling, and you will see that same ceiling for the next few hours until a nurse comes and move your head.  When your head gets moved, your next view is a wall with a mirror and sink.<br /><br />Believe me, this will be the highlight of your day until your family comes at 3 p.m. to visit.  Now, imagine you have an itch and you can't move to scratch the itch and you can't tell anybody because you can't talk!<br /><br />You can't even wipe your eyes if they get sore or dry, you can't move your legs if you get a cramp.<br /><br />Your family will try to keep your spirits up and try to make you laugh.  They will read the paper and tell jokes and tell you about their day. That's the hardest part.  Knowing that you are not part of the family any more.<br /><br />When they leave, you try and not let them see how upset and miserable you are. That's when your tears will come. You can't even wipe your eyes until a nurse comes and does that for you.<br /><br />I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.<br /><br />Please let me go back to my family for somewhat of a normal life.  Let me plan my wedding.  Let me have happiness.</blockquote>It took David one week to write this letter that has taken me one minute to read aloud to the Chamber.</p><p>I believe that David Garvey, his family and his fiancee are entitled to some happiness.  Surely it is not beyond the ken of the system for this matter to be brought to some kind of a satisfactory conclusion whereby he can allowed to go home.</p><p>I know the family are very appreciate of the support they have received from the HSE and from Beaumont Hospital, which I also want to put on the record.  I ask for this to be brought to some kind of a satisfactory conclusion where commitments that were previously made can be honoured and David can be allowed to come home to be cared for by his family and by the staff of the HSE.</p></speech>

The individual at the centre of this case raised by the Deputy has displayed tremendous tenacity and bravery in dealing with his condition.  I must also acknowledge the devastation of his family and of his fiancee at his diagnosis and their incredible commitment to him on a daily basis.</p><p>  Locked-in syndrome is a challenging condition in which a patient generally retains cognitive function but requires constant clinical care, treatment and supports, such as ventilation.  It must be acknowledged that in this case the individual's needs are particularly complex and patients with such needs are generally cared for in an intensive care setting.</p><p>  His post-discharge care would involve the provision of appropriate medical devices, such as a ventilator, which are essential to his survival, and 24-hour specialised intensive care unit nursing care.  Given the complexity of his care needs, to be cared for at home, he would need an extensive home care package, including 24-hour specialist nursing care with clinical governance by an appropriate consultant.</p><p>  I understand several multidisciplinary meetings have already taken place at local level between the family, the HSE and Resilience Ireland, a company which specialises in specialist advanced home care management.  I have also been assured that there has been significant engagement between Beaumont Hospital and the local community care services in an effort to find a solution appropriate to this patient's needs.</p><p>  While it may be possible to provide such a solution, the equipment, staffing and resources required are likely to be very substantial and would have to be accommodated within the overall resources available to the HSE for disability services.  This case must also be considered in that context.</p><p>  The Department of Health has discussed this case with the Health Service Executive and a meeting between the family and senior officials in the HSE has been scheduled for early next week to discuss and consider the patient's request to transfer home from Beaumont and the significant complex issues associated with such a transfer.  The HSE will continue to explore with the family all options for future care, including alternative community service providers or the individual's possible move to a hospital closer to home and family. </p></speech>

I am glad to hear the HSE has committed to meeting the family next week, and I want to record at the outset the family's thanks for the support it has received to date from the HSE.  Local HSE officials are on record as stating that "there is a national fund for emergency cases", which I understand the national director of social care will utilise over the next 12 months.  That is a direct quote from a letter received by the family from a local official.  To give the Minister a timeline in terms of the way things have changed, the same local official went on to say that "the process to access the funding has not yet been agreed".  He further insisted that he will continue to advocate for David and for the family at national level.  However, in a subsequent note to me from another official, who is acting in the same capacity as the official to whom I referred previously, it appears the cost of bringing David home and having an appropriate home care package to fulfil his needs seems to be oscillating between &euro;400,000 and &euro;450,000.  Notwithstanding the reference made in letters from the HSE to the family about the existence of a national emergency care package or that funding stream, I recall the Minister of State stating in his contribution that the budget for the care of David would need to be met through the disability service budget available to the HSE.</p><p>  That official also made the point that David's care at home would have to be led essentially by a respiratory care consultant attached to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  As I understand it to be the case, that respiratory consultant is no longer in that position.  That further complicates matters from the HSE's point of view.</p><p>  Responses are needed to two fundamental questions, and I appreciate the Minister of State may not be in a position to respond to those today.  First, will the HSE locally and nationally commit to providing the funding necessary under the emergency care scheme to David and, second, if it is the case that there is not a respiratory consultant in place currently to deal with his care needs, will that respiratory consultant be appointed shortly to meet David's needs, and the needs of others in the Louth-Meath area?  I understand and appreciate that he may not have the answers to those questions today.  I appreciate also that I am sure he will be as moved as I was by David's story and the challenges involved.  If the Minister of State is not in a position to answer those questions today, I accept and appreciate that, but I ask him to commit to having the HSE correspond with me and the family in the coming days to outline the process regarding the emergency care fund, and the position on the appointment of a respiratory consultant who could potentially look after David's needs.</p></speech>

They are not unreasonable questions but I am not able to respond to him at this point in the kind of detail he would wish, particularly in regard to the various personnel involved.  I repeat the Department of Health has discussed Mr. Garvey's case with the HSE with a view to senior officials having an early meeting, as I mentioned, with the family to develop a plan for their son's future care.  A commitment has been made for such a meeting to take place next Tuesday, 15 April, and it is intended that it would be attended by Mr. Pat Healy, the relevant national director of the HSE, a very senior official in this area.  It seems that would be an appropriate opportunity for the family, Mr. Garvey and perhaps the Deputy on their behalf to seek perhaps more specific responses on the questions the Deputy raised.  There is no doubt there is a significant resource commitment associated with the proposed move.</p><p>I am not aware of the existence of the two different estimates the Deputy outlined.  This is also something which could be pursued.  As has been acknowledged, the needs are complex and generally in circumstances such as this a person is cared for in an intensive care setting.  Therefore, what is proposed here needs to be pursued in detail with the HSE, and next Tuesday's meeting is the right place to do this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800025#X00200"><p>I am grateful for this opportunity and I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I welcome and compliment the Minister on the announcement of &euro;2.5 million for community groups, albeit a reduction on what was announced in 2013 and 2012.  I wish to speak about the unfairness, inequity and inequality of the scheme announced for the child care system that is in place.  We must be realistic about the model that exists.  A total of 70% of all services are privately operated and the State depends on these services.  If we introduce policies that are inequitable towards the largest part of the sector we run the risk of these becoming unsustainable and closing down.  If this happens, who will pick up the shortfall?  Will the Department explore the trend over the past four or five years regarding the number of community not-for-profit operators and private operators that have commenced and ceased trading?  It would be interesting to note the figures.  I am not speaking about large chain operators.  I am speaking about small service providers such as Waddlers and Toddlers in Rathowen in County Westmeath or On Cloud 9 in Mullingar, where the owner operator is in charge.  I could give a range of other examples from my constituency and I am sure such services also exist in the Minister's constituency.  Private operators are essential in the communities where they operate because no community facilities exist.  These small private operators are expected to adhere to the same standards as community operators, and rightly so, with regard to the adult-to-child ratio, environmental issues and health and safety issues.  All regulations must be adhered to and rightly so.  However, these operators cannot avail of community employment schemes or the community child care subvention scheme and they cannot fundraise to make up the shortfall.  They compete with non-regulated private services such as childminders, and it seems the Minister has no intention of regulating these, so they are at a disadvantage.</p><p>  We must remember that when the State made significant investment in the services it did so proportionately.  Is it the case, despite the fact the State depends on these services, that they make up 70% of all services nationally and that the State has already significantly invested in them, that we will no longer support them?  This policy runs the risk of driving up the cost of child care at a time when we speak about what policies we can implement to reduce its cost.  Is it empty rhetoric on the Government's part about supporting parents who wish to return to work and reducing the cost of child care?  This policy flies in the face of it.</p><p>  I do not suggest private operators should qualify for the same level of funding as community operators, but they should be eligible for a proportionate amount of funding based on the size of the service they provide.  The State depends on the services they provide.</p></speech>

I wish to put the facts on the table.  All capital funding for child care services was cut in 2008 and no new child care capital funding was made available in that year, 2009, 2010 or 2011.  It was not made available until 2012 and 2013 when I reopened the child care capital funding schemes.  Absolutely no capital went into child care in recent years.  Fortunately I was able to reverse this situation two years ago.</p><p>  Given the extensive infrastructure that existed, it was absolutely clear there would be a need to provide capital support to public and private child care providers, which is what I have done.  In 2012 I provided &euro;6 million in capital grant funding to 290 private and community not-for-profit child care services.  The 2012 funding provided support to child care settings to address remedial maintenance, renovation work on buildings, and equipment for early education and child care services.  It was very much welcomed by public and private providers.  In 2013 I provided &euro;2.75 million in capital grant funding to 671 private and community not-for-profit child care services.  This covered small grants for accessibility, maintenance work, natural outdoor spaces and critical works to ensure buildings are fit for purpose under the child care regulations.</p><p>  Having operated different schemes in 2012 and 2013 addressing different areas of need, and having learned from each scheme, I decided that for 2014 we would focus on another area in need of help, namely, the repair, maintenance and upgrade of community and not-for-profit child care services, which clearly needed support.  On 12 February Deputy Troy tabled a parliamentary question asking me to introduce large-scale capital grants for child care, particularly for the community sector.  The Deputy recognised that the community sector needs capital funding, and there is no question about this.</p><p>  In introducing various capital programmes I had a range of different criteria for each year.  This year I am focusing on community child care services, which play a major role in ensuring that disadvantaged and low-income families have access to high-quality and affordable child care as they provide access to the community child care subvention scheme, for which the Department provides approximately &euro;45 million.  We need to invest in these facilities to ensure they can be maintained in the necessary way.</p><p>  I have announced that later this year I will launch another scheme for next year.  This announcement will include the public and private sectors.  I am aware of the difficulties experienced by providers in the private sector, but at present it is vital that this funding is directed towards addressing the immediate issues in the community sector.  As I pointed out, there is considerable investment in the sector already and we must protect it so the service is maintained for those who are dependent on it.  Later this year I will announce further capital investment, which will be open to both sectors.</p><p>  I received feedback from the sector following the disbursal of the capital grants last year that amounts were needed to deal with structural issues in the community child care sector and that it would need this type of investment to ensure the facilities were up to the standards we expect.</p></speech>

As she started at the downturn in 2008, she failed to acknowledge the huge capital investment made in both community and private facilities.  Moreover, investment in the latter was made on a proportionate basis.  I accept and no one questions the need for support for community services.  I am well aware that I submitted the parliamentary question in question - I was the person who submitted it - but my question is, why has there been a deliberate change of policy away from supporting the private services that make up 70% of all services providing child care in Ireland?  The Minister herself, by virtue of her inclusion of such services for the past two years, has acknowledged clearly the vital role they play in the provision of child care in the State.  While I welcome that the Minister is thinking about supporting such services later in the year for next year, if they are not supported in the future, they will become unsustainable.  If they become unsustainable, who will take up the shortfall?  Where will the State be able to provide services in advance of the closure of such private services?  I ask again, what was the rationale for the deliberate exclusion this year of private services from the capital grants?  I reiterate the services make up 70% of the overall provision of services within the State.  What does the Minister hope to achieve this year by the exclusion of the private sector in this regard?</p><p>  While I do not expect the Minister to have this information to hand, I seek information on the trend over the past four or five years in respect of the numbers of openings and closures of community not-for-profit groups versus the numbers of openings and closures of private groups.  When deliberating on eligibility for the scheme, did the Minister consider the trends over the last number of years by ascertaining which sector has experienced closures and openings in the largest percentage terms?</p></speech>

If I may, I will reframe the manner in which the Deputy is describing the scheme by stating the Government is targeting a sector that requires support this year.  Clearly, over the past two years, where there was capital investment, the schemes were targeted at particular areas.  It has been identified that refurbishment is needed in the community sector in particular and that there should be a targeted scheme for this year.  That is what this is.  It is not a question of seeking to exclude any particular sector but is about targeting as resources are available.  Were unlimited resources available, clearly one would be able to do everything all at once.  However, given that this is not the case, the Government has targeted the money available this year to support the refurbishment of the community public sector, based on the needs in that area at present.  However, I certainly am not excluding in any way the provision of support at a future date to the private child care providers, as I provided during the first two years as well.</p></speech>

It is now 15 years since the Equality Authority was established and 14 years since the establishment of the Human Rights Commission.  In that time, the demographic, social and economic fabric of the State has continued to change profoundly.  The commitment and professionalism of the members and staff of the Equality Authority and of the Human Rights Commission over this period are to be commended.  However, these bodies have overlapping roles and it has become increasingly obvious that there is a compelling need for a more comprehensive approach to the protection of human rights and equality and to institutional arrangements in that regard.</p><p>  Drawing together in a single, leaner and more streamlined body the main strands of the vital equality and human rights agendas will positively strengthen the ability of the new commission to effectively, efficiently and cohesively promote a culture that respects the human rights and equal status of everyone in our society.  The promotion and protection of human rights is at the heart of Ireland's domestic and foreign policies and Ireland has been active and continues to be active in this regard both in Europe and further afield.</p><p>  During our Presidency of the Council of the European Union last year, I raised with EU justice Ministers how we could encourage effective action and enhance co-operation between justice systems in countering hate crime, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia.  The Irish Presidency's concern, in particular, was about the apparent rise in extreme forms of intolerance, including racism and homophobia, within the European Union and the failure in some cases to respond adequately.  We were also concerned that justice institutions - the courts and police in particular, should function effectively so that fundamental rights are protected.</p><p>  The reality of continuing intolerance in Europe was starkly illustrated by a report on anti-Semitism published last November by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.  A shocking 76% of Jewish people surveyed across EU member states felt that anti-Semitism had worsened in the past five years.  Over half of the respondents had encountered first-hand experience of Holocaust denial within the previous year and one third had suffered some form of anti-Semitic harassment within the previous five years.  Among those surveyed, 29% stated they were considering emigrating from the EU member state in which they and their families were resident.  In Europe, the economic crisis has spawned new parties and revitalised pre-existing parties of the extreme right whose anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric is both corrosive and dangerous.</p><p>  Our Presidency discussion on the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights led to Council conclusions adopted by the justice Ministers in June 2013.  These conclusions essentially were designed to offer guidance to the Commission on how to take the debate forward and the types of consideration to be taken into account.  The Commission published a communication on the rule of law on 11 March 2014 as its response to the debate on fundamental rights and the rule of law initiated under our Presidency.  I welcomed this communication, as it reflects to a large extent many of the themes of our work in this area.  The proposed three-stage framework is a very solid response to the issues that we and others, including the European Parliament, raised and will be considered in detail by our partners in the Council.</p><p>  Along with several other member states and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, Ireland is involved in a co-operative project to identify a methodology that will enable us to measure adherence to the rule of law and our shared EU values across all member states.  I believe that this work has a vital role to play in protecting the fundamental rights of all EU residents and in tackling extreme intolerance across the European Union.  Extreme intolerance and flagrant abuse of human rights is also evident on the wider international stage.  As Ireland prepares for a</p><p>constitutional referendum on marriage equality for same-sex couples in 2015, in contrast, certain states are working hard to restrict the rights and fundamental freedoms of gay people.  In Russia, for example, there are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and the anti-LGBT propaganda law enacted there last June sparked international condemnation.</p><p>New anti-homosexuality legislation recently enacted in Uganda requires citizens to report suspected homosexuals to the police.  According to Human Rights Watch, 38 African states criminalise homosexual conduct.  In Iran homosexuality is deemed to be a crime punishable by imprisonment, corporal punishment and, in some cases, even execution.  Israel is the only state in the Middle East with an annual gay pride march.</p><p>Our contributions to the protection of human rights in Europe and internationally would carry little weight without robust protection of human rights and equality here at home.  We cannot and should not ignore issues that must be addressed within our own state.  As a state, we have to make sure we deal in an entirely proper and fair way with, for example, persons of Roma ethnicity, members of the Traveller community and others from minority communities who reside in the State and not allow prejudice or lack of familiarity with specific cultural traits result in flawed assessments of situations and bad decision making or lead to unfair outcomes for individuals or discrimination.  We must, in particular, ensure neither racial prejudice nor racial profiling is ever tolerated in the State.  In what we say or do we must never lose sight of each individual's value and our common humanity.</p><p>The types of training the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission can provide are very important in giving front-line staff the insights and background they need to avoid prejudicial behaviour when dealing with members of minority groups.  I will come back to this issue.</p><p>The welcome extended to new citizens of Ireland at our citizenship ceremonies is in stark contrast to the racist slurs and verbal and physical abuse suffered by some foreign nationals who reside in the State and by some of our new citizens in the workplace, on the streets or public transport as they go about their daily lives.  In this context, I welcome and fully endorse the campaign launched today across the Dublin public transport network entitled, &quot;There's no room on board for racism and discrimination&quot;.  Too frequently passengers on public transport are victims of racist abuse.</p><p>As a member of a minority in this country, these are issues of which I am particularly conscious.  In recognising the huge benefit of the web and social media and the facility for individuals, from the relative anonymity of a keyboard, to comment on news stories reported on a variety of websites from traditional media outlet websites to the more recent emergence of media outlets such as <i>Journal.ie</i>I am concerned at the level of vilification, intolerance and extreme comment incorporated on a daily basis onto such websites, some of which is little other than an excuse for engaging in hate speech and racism which corrode and contaminate public discourse.  We must, both as a Parliament and a society, consider how to best address that issue.  This may be an issue the new Human Rights and Equality Commission could uniquely consider from the perspective of protecting the human rights and freedom of speech of individuals, while also ensuring new media are not used as a vehicle for hate speech and to undermine the values we cherish and share with our EU partners.</p><p>I want to make reference to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in detail.  The levelling of powers and functions, the introduction of a new role in supporting public bodies to have due regard to equality and human rights issues in its work and the creation of a sliding scale of possible interventions and powers which can be exercised in a nuanced way commensurate with the nature of the problem, including, as a last resort, an effective power of inquiry and powers to initiate court action, will all serve to make the commission a more effective body than its two predecessors combined.</p><p>The Bill is the outcome of a period of intensive consultation in which civil society, members of the public and all those interested in the future of human rights and equality in Ireland were canvassed for their views.  I laid the general scheme of the Bill before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for pre-legislative scrutiny in June 2012 and the committee undertook a further public consultation before responding with its observations.</p><p>The new body will also in due course seek accreditation with the United Nations as Ireland's national human rights institution.  This is of crucial importance to ensure it achieves the highest domestic credibility and international standing in respect of its independence and remit.  I have made strengthening the new commission and ensuring it complies unequivocally with the Paris Principles a personal commitment in preparation of the Bill and the merger process.  I am confident that the new body will maintain the high standing and reputation the Human Rights Commission has achieved internationally.  It should be noted that the new commission will take over from the Equality Authority as Ireland's designated equality body under the EU anti-discrimination directives.  The Bill will also amend the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003, most importantly to give effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the DG case by providing for an enforceable right of compensation in the case of unlawful deprivation of liberty due to judicial error in contravention of Article 5 of the convention.</p><p>I will now outline to the House some of the main features of the Bill.  Turning to Part 1, comprising sections 1 to 7, inclusive, these are mainly technical provisions.  Section 2 contains the necessary definitions, including a broad definition of human rights that ensures the commission is not limited to human rights recognised in existing Irish legislation in its promotion and awareness-raising work but can undertake work to promote human rights in the broadest possible sense.</p><p>Part 2 of the Bill comprises sections 8 to 28, inclusive.  Section 8 is a standard provision which provides for an establishment day for the new commission, replacing the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission.</p><p>Section 9 contains a number of provisions regarding the establishment of the commission as a body corporate with perpetual succession.  It also sets out that the commission will be independent and guided by best international practice in the area of human rights and equality.</p><p>Section 10 lists the detailed functions of the commission.  They include providing information for the public on human rights and equality, keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality, providing practical assistance, including legal assistance, for an individual under equality or equal status legislation, and carrying out equality reviews and action plans.  It also provides for the commission to appear before the High Court and the Supreme Court as <i>amicus curiae</i>in proceedings before either court that concern the human rights or equality rights of a person.  The section provides for continued participation with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in the joint committee as provided for under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.</p><p>The section is also a principles section and sets out the principles that underpin the functions of the commission.  These are central to the commission's work.  The commission is mandated to exercise its functions under the Bill with a view to encouraging and supporting the development of a society in which there is respect for, and protection of, each person's human rights; there is respect for the dignity and worth of each person; a person's ability to achieve his or her potential is not limited by prejudice, discrimination, neglect or prohibited conduct; each person has a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the economic, political, social or cultural life of the State; and there is mutual respect between persons, including classes of persons, based on a shared understanding of the value of diversity within society and on a shared respect for equality and human rights.</p><p>Section 11 is a technical provision.  It allows for the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the agreement of the commission, to confer additional functions on the commission.</p><p>Section 12 contains the provisions in regard to terms of membership of the commission.  Members shall hold office for a term not exceeding five years which can be renewed.  The commission shall consist of not more than 15 and not less than 12 members, one of whom shall be chief commissioner.  The section provides that the members designate who were appointed on 19 April 2013 shall become the first commission, with each member being appointed for a term of either three or five years in order to ensure continuity of expertise and experience for future commissions by avoiding a situation where the term of all members will expire at exactly the same time.</p><p>As Deputies will be aware, 14 members designate of the new commission were selected in April 2013 on foot of an independent selection process.  They were assigned to the existing two bodies on an interim basis pending publication and enactment of the Bill.  Once it is enacted, they will be formally appointed as members of the new commission.  In the meantime, they have progressed the practical arrangements necessary for the amalgamation of the two bodies and their functioning as a cohesive organisation.  I publicly acknowledge and thank them for their very substantial and valuable engagement since their appointment, including their constructive contribution to the development of the Bill.  I look forward to receiving their observations on the Bill as published.</p><p>The previous selection process was not able to recommend a person for appointment as chief commissioner.  This position will be readvertised by the Public Appointments Service very shortly and I am hopeful we will be in a position to welcome a new chief commissioner as soon as the Bill is enacted.</p><p>Section 13 outlines the selection and appointment process for membership of the commission.  Members of the commission will be appointed by the President, on the advice of the Government, following the passing of a resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.  The persons to be appointed in the future, including the first chief commissioner of the merged body, will be selected by the Public Appointments Service following a Paris Principles compliant selection process to be undertaken by the service.  To underpin the independence of the selection process, the section provides that the Government shall accept the persons recommended for appointment by the service, save in exceptional circumstances and for stated and substantial reasons.</p><p>Section 14 lists the conditions of membership, including the circumstances in which the Government may remove a member of the commission.</p><p>These circumstances are failure without reasonable excuse to discharge the duties of the office, incapacity to perform those duties or stated misbehaviour.  A member may only be removed from office with the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p> Section 15 provides for filling of casual vacancies on the commission, while section 16 outlines how the commission shall organise its meetings.  The commission shall meet not less than once every three months.  Subject to the Act, the commission regulates its own procedures.  Section 17 provides for the commission to appoint from its membership Ireland's representative on the management board of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights as is provided for under Council Regulation No. 168/2004.  This is a new provision, as previously the Government made this appointment.</p><p> Section 18 allows for the establishment of advisory committees and other formal methods of consultation with civil society.  Such committees and other consultations will allow for the commission to establish and maintain contact as well as co-operation with relevant agencies, non-governmental organisations and other civil society interests.  Section 19 is a standard provision providing that members of the commission will cease to be members of the commission when elected to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament.  Sections 20 and 21 provide for the appointment of a director for the commission and outline his or her functions.  In addition to the functions set out in the Bill, standard for a post of this nature, it is intended that the director will be the Accounting Officer for the commission and it will have a separate Vote.  Sections 22 and 23 provide for the accountability of the director to both the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.  These are standard provisions.</p><p> Section 24 provides for staff of the commission and their remuneration.  This section should be read in conjunction with section 45, which provides for the transfer to the commission of the existing staff of the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission.  The Bill provides for the commission to undertake its own recruitment in accordance with the standards set out in the procedures and codes of practice applicable to Civil Service recruitment generally.  This section also provides that staff of the commission, on transfer from the equality body and the Human Rights Commission, shall become civil servants of the State and that the commission is the appropriate authority in the meaning of the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956 and the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005 regarding its officers.  This is in line with the staffing arrangements of other independent organisations of a constitutional nature, such as the Ombudsman, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman, the Director of Public Prosecutions and other such institutions, including the Oireachtas.  As civil servants of the State, the staff of the commission are not amenable to instruction by the Government or by any Minister.  These arrangements are designed to ensure the independence of the commission in full compliance with the Paris Principles, which require that the national human rights institution be legislatively empowered to determine its staffing structure and to select its staff in accordance with national law.</p><p> It cannot be denied that both of the existing bodies suffered steep and disproportionate cuts to their funding up to 2011 and were particularly targeted in this regard by the previous Government.  They also suffered staffing reductions.  On appointment of the new members designate of the commission, I asked them, as a priority, to undertake a staffing needs review and submit a business case in that regard.  Following intensive negotiations with my colleagues in the Government, I was delighted to secure an increased staffing complement of 47 for the new commission, as well as an increase of &euro;2 million in its budget for 2014.  This staffing level represents an increase of 15.  There is an agreement that the ceiling will be further reviewed once these extra staff are all in place and in the light of experience of workloads in 12 to 18 months.  The commission has already started recruitment of the additional staff already approved, with the assistance of the Public Appointments Service, starting initially with the additional clerical staff identified as necessary.</p><p> Section 25 requires the commission to prepare a strategy statement not later than six months after the commencement of this section.  This statement will be for three years.  The commission will be directly accountable to the Oireachtas for its strategy statement.  The section also provides for the renewal of the strategy statement every three years.  Section 26 outlines how funding will be made available to the commission by the Oireachtas and contains a commitment that such funding will be reasonably sufficient to allow the commission to fulfil its mandate.  Section 27 sets out in what form the commission shall prepare its accounts and provides for such accounts to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 28 requires the commission to prepare an annual report each year to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Again, the commission will be directly accountable to the Oireachtas for this report.</p><p> In Part 3, comprising sections 29 to 42, inclusive, the commission's legal and enforcement powers are set out.  Section 29 contains several definitions relevant to this Part, including a definition of human rights that is appropriate to enforcement of rights guaranteed by the Constitution or otherwise given force of law within the State, including the European Convention on Human Rights and other international instruments that are ratified by the State.  Section 30 requires the commission to provide information to the public and keep under review the effectiveness of any legislation relating to the protection and promotion of human rights and equality.  Section 31 provides that the commission, at the request of the Minister, may prepare draft codes of practice.  Such codes shall address issues such as protection of human rights, elimination of discrimination, promotion of equality of opportunity in employment and promotion of equality of opportunity on matters covered by the Equal Status Act 2000.  The commission is required to consult widely, including with relevant Departments, prior to the submission of a code of practice.  Once signed into law by a Minister, a code of practice is admissible as evidence in proceedings before a court or tribunal.  I regard this as a power that may be of crucial importance in improving standards of compliance with best human rights and equality practice.  To date, only one such code of practice has been prepared and approved, the sexual harassment and harassment at work code.  I believe there is enormous potential for the new commission to break new ground here and to have a really substantial influence for the better by utilising this power to the full.</p><p> Sections 32 to 39, inclusive, are a continuation, with technical amendments, of provisions in the existing equality legislation.  Section 33 provides that, in connection with preparing either an equality review or an equality action plan, the commission may serve a substantive notice on a person to supply information with regard to an equality review or action plan.  Such a notice may also be served if an organisation fails to implement the requirements of an equality action plan as outlined in section 32.  This section provides an opportunity for an organisation to appeal such a notice.  Section 34 details how such a substantive notice may be appealed.  Section 35 provides that the commission may, of its volition or at the request of the Minister, conduct an inquiry.  This section retains in force the existing powers of the Equality Authority and of the Human Rights Commission to conduct inquiries, which have not been used in practice in the precise manner set out in the existing Acts.  To ensure the power to be vested in the new commission is a real one which can in future be invoked in practice, the inquiry power has been redesigned, modelled on that contained in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.</p><p> The detailed procedural and other rules for an inquiry are set out in Schedule 2.  It is intended that an inquiry may be carried out in respect of a public or private organisation, institution, sector of society or geographical area if there is evidence of a serious violation of human rights or equality of treatment obligations in respect of a person and the matter is of grave public concern.  Prior to conducting such an inquiry, terms of reference must be drawn up and laid before each House of the Oireachtas and then published in the national media.</p><p> Section 36 provides for the publication of an equality and human rights compliance notice following or in the course of an inquiry.  Such notices will specify the nature of the discrimination or violation of rights found and will require the persons on whom they are served on to act on the notice.  The notice will also outline the steps required to address the violation and specify the timeframe that applies.  Section 37 provides an appeal mechanism for persons served with an equality and human rights compliance notice.  Section 38 provides a register of all equality and human rights compliance notices.  Section 39 provides that, on the application of the commission, the Circuit Court may grant an injunction against a person who does not comply with a human rights and equality compliance notice.</p><p> Section 40 provides for the provision of legal and other assistance by the commission.  Such assistance may include the provision of legal advice and the provision of legal representation.  Prior to granting any assistance, the commission will consider whether such assistance could be obtained by the applicant under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 or the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962.  Section 41 allows the commission to institute proceedings in its own name seeking relief of a declaratory or other nature in respect of any matter involving the human rights of any person or class of persons.  This is a continuation of the power granted to the Human Rights Commission in section 11 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000.</p><p> Section 42 is a new provision which introduces a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality and reflects a commitment in Government for National Recovery 2011-2016.  The commission will assist public bodies in complying with the positive duty by producing guidelines and codes of practice, as outlined in section 31.  The idea simply is to create a positive duty on public bodies to conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with individual human rights and in reflection of the commitment contained in the current programme for Government.</p><p>As I have said previously, this model of positive duty is not the model found elsewhere.  The commission will have an important role in its development and in achieving a key tool which will be meaningful and effective in actively promoting equality and human rights across the public sector.  Training as well as preparation of codes of practice, which I referred to earlier, will be important elements of what the commission can offer. Currently, the Human Rights Commission provides tailored training to the Civil Service and public service in the field of human rights.  Training has been provided to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, local authority officials and civil servants.  This training is ongoing.</p><p> For example, just last December I had the pleasure of launching the Irish Prison Service's Irish Human Rights Commission human rights training programme.  What is unique about this particular initiative is that it is proactive.  The Irish Prison Service had itself identified a specific training need and in conjunction with the Human Rights Commission has developed a bespoke training programme specifically designed for staff working in our prisons.  This unique training programme, which was originally developed as a pilot programme by the Irish Prison Service and the Human Rights Commission was launched in December 2013 to coincide with international human rights week, which is fitting.  The original pilot was independently evaluated and subsequently formally launched as a human rights training course for prison staff which reflects best international practice.</p><p> By way of another example, the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office provides training and advice to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the need to be aware of the issue of racial profiling when carrying out their duties.  This training and advice focuses on the requirement on all members to carry out their functions and exercise their authority in a non-discriminatory manner in accordance with law.  I believe there is a need for this training to be expanded and further intensified and this is an issue for our new interim Garda Commissioner.  I might also mention that in December 2013, the Human Rights Commission hosted a conference in Dublin to highlight best practice in human rights education and training for civil and public servants.  The event was organised in co-operation with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p> The point I want to draw out here is that the work already undertaken by the commission, with its human rights education and training project across the Civil Service and public service is an excellent example of the soft and persuasive powers which I envisage will be influential in the development of this positive duty and in ensuring that our front-line public servants are properly sensitive to the specific difficulties that arise for example, in dealing with migrants to our shores.  This can be particularly important in ensuring fair treatment of people who may have been marginalised in their country of origin, may not speak English sufficiently to understand what is happening to them and may not have had in the past a positive relationship with the local police in their previous home.  The Fundamental Rights Agency's guide for law enforcement officials,  Towards More Effective Policing, refers to the danger of racial profiling taking place at an operational level.  It notes that at an operational level, profiling may occur where individual officials may apply stereotypes or generalisations based on race, ethnicity or religion.  This may be consciously motivated by personal prejudices, but it may not.  It simply may be that officers are not conscious of the degree to which they are applying generalisation and stereotypes.  I believe that this valuable guide should be required reading for all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of a changed and continually changing Ireland.  We should never assume that we in this State are immune from difficulties that have arisen elsewhere in the European Union.</p><p> I will move on now to Part 4, comprising sections 43 to 51 inclusive, which makes provision for a range of technical and transitional issues consequential on the dissolution of the existing bodies and to ensure continuity as between these bodies and the new commission which replaces them.  These are all standard provisions.</p><p> Part 5 comprises section 52 to 55.  Section 52 is a technical section, to provide a definition of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  Section 53 includes references to Protocols Nos. 11 and 14 in the definition of the convention in our domestic legislation.  Both protocols relate to the workings of the European Court of Human Rights.  The reforms in Protocol No. 14 are designed to address the problem created by the large number of inadmissible or repeat cases, so as to enable the court to concentrate on the most important cases.  Protocol No. 14 also made new rules concerning the terms of office of judges of the European Court of Human Rights.  The definition of &quot;convention provisions&quot; is also amended by including reference to Protocol No. 13, which relates to abolition of the death penalty.</p><p> Section 54 provides for a new section in the principal Act which will allow an enforceable right to compensation for a person whose detention is found to be in breach of Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights and where the detention was as a result of judicial error.  This is a requirement of Article 5(5) of the convention.  The background to this is that in 1997 it was decided that D.G., then a minor, who was considered to have a personality disorder and was a danger to himself and others, should be placed in a high-support therapeutic unit for 16-18 year olds.  However, in June 1997 the High Court decided, as there were no secure educational facilities available, that he should be detained in St. Patrick's Institution.  His detention was appealed to the Supreme Court, which held that a child could be detained in a penal institution for a temporary period until secure detention was arranged for the child outside this jurisdiction.</p><p> The Supreme Court decision was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which found that Ireland was in breach of the convention in that the detention was not for the purposes of educational supervision in accordance with Article 5(1 )(d) and that there was a further violation of the convention as there is no enforceable right to compensation in accordance with Article 5(5) in case of unlawful deprivation of liberty on foot of judicial error.  Ireland is required to execute this judgment.  This means ensuring that persons who are detained in contravention of the provisions of Article 5, no matter what the circumstances are, including by way of judicial error, shall have an enforceable right to compensation.  This amendment is the only remaining issue for implementation in regard to this judgment.  Currently, there is no enforceable right to compensation where the detention was brought about by a judge because judicial immunity exists in Irish law.  This provision addresses that issue.  Section 55 provides for the inclusion of the up-to-date version of the convention and of Protocol No. 13 as Schedules to the Bill.</p><p> Before concluding, I would like to emphasise the importance of this Bill in the context of the Government's commitment to strengthening the State's human rights and equality infrastructure.  In drafting the Bill, I have welcomed the contributions of the Oireachtas in the House and of the stakeholders and members of the public who have engaged in consultations on the general scheme.  I have an open mind on constructive suggestions for its further improvement and I look forward to our discussions on the Bill.  I regard this Bill as a landmark statutory measure with regard to human rights and equality.  It sets out an architecture of huge importance for the State and provides a modern, legal framework to ensure we have the best possible provisions in place in the context of our new human rights and equality commission.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members and to their co-operation in enacting this Bill in the best form possible for our statute books. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800030#CC00200"><p>Human rights and equality are core values of a modern republic.  The founding vision of our State is built upon a commitment to the principles of equality and universally accepted rights.  The Irish Human Rights Commission and Equality Authority have been to the forefront of advancing that vision in Ireland, often in adverse circumstances.  This Bill, however, jeopardises that role.  The amalgamation of the bodies is essentially based on financial considerations, rather than a strategic re-evaluation of how best to further the equality agenda.  This is a dollar and dimes Bill, not a human rights one.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has a number of concerns regarding the proposed legislation.  The Bill gives the Government significant control over the newly merged organisation, through a limited interpretation of human rights, control over membership and restrictions on what investigations the body can undertake.  The move fails to recognise that the two bodies have separate and distinct, but complementary roles.  The amalgamation will be detrimental to the respective missions and impinges upon the spirit of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that initiated the bodies.  It remains to be seen whether the new body will cut mustard with the UN Paris principles of independence, despite the Minister's confidence.</p><p>  The role of human rights and equality is a central one in public policy.  It is important that the Government maintains a commitment to this pivotal concern and does not seek to covertly control the bodies set up to protect these rights in the State.  Limited resources and constraints on freedom of action will tighten the Government's grip on the new body.  The experience of the interim bodies and the independent panel for appointments does not bode well for future Government action with the body.</p><p>  The Minister has pointed to international experience.  However, the Irish situation involves the merger of two independent statutory bodies with clearly defined mandates that have both been active for more than a decade in Irish public life. </p><p>In light of this ingrained experience, the argument for integration is far weaker than other examples may indicate.  There is no evidence for or against amalgamations internationally.</p><p> It is worth reflecting upon the work of the bodies and the role they play in public life before setting out how they should advance.  The IHRC is entrusted with the oversight and monitoring of human rights in Ireland.  It was founded as part of the Good Friday Agreement.  This joint, cross-Border commitment to human rights as the cornerstone of the entire island was ratified by a vote on both sides of the Border.  Human rights law in Ireland is drawn first and foremost from the provisions of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the fundamental law of the land.  This is further complemented by EU law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrined by the Lisbon treaty of 2009.  The IHRC is watchdog for these important bulwarks of rights on this island.</p><p> The Equality Authority was founded in 1999 and is charged with combating discrimination on various grounds such as gender, sexual orientation race or religion.  It has continuously fought the good fight for minority groups on the margins of society.  There has been a steady rise in people contacting the IHRC, from 512 in 2011 to 614 in 2012, driven by a sharp rise in economic and austerity cases, accounting for a third of all cases last year.  Civil and political rights accounted for 35% of cases, 212 cases, followed by economic, social and cultural rights cases, of which there were 203.  The body also offers opinions on new laws from a human rights perspective.  The Equality Authority deals with approximately 8,000 inquires per annum primarily focused on disability, gender and race discrimination.  Combined, the two bodies' roles have a distinct part to play in ensuring Ireland adheres to the highest ethical standards and lives up to its international and domestic legal and moral obligations.  This Bill casts a dark cloud over those roles.</p><p> The current structure fully adheres to Ireland's international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN's Paris Principles.  The new body will have to be resubmitted for re-accreditation under the Paris Declaration.  The UN Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions - the Paris Principles - are international principles that set benchmarks for national human rights bodies regarding their structures and functions to ensure effective, independent operation.  They emphasise the need for complete independence and a broad interpretation of human rights which the body must be empowered to pursue.  This independence is threatened by the limits placed on own-initiative investigations by the new body and the limited interpretation of human rights.  We will be pressing to have this strengthened on Committee Stage.</p><p> Ireland is accredited with an &quot;A&quot; rating in accordance with the Paris Principles.  This will be jeopardised in the upcoming review given the significant encroachment of the Government onto the IHRC's work with this piece of legislation.  This Bill does not meet those fundamental requirements of an autonomous body pursuing human rights free of government interference and restraints.</p><p> Previous experience has shown that the Government is not committed to respecting the independence of the human rights and equality bodies.  The announcement of the amalgamation came in September 2011 and has only now advanced to the legislative stage.  That interim period was marred by hostility on the part of the Department of Justice and Equality that undermined the IHRC.  Rather than uphold the autonomy of the IHRC, the Department systematically undermined it.  The selection panel headed by former Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly was stood down by the Department when it sought to expand the criteria for selection of a chief executive of the interim commission.  In a clear case of the Department exercising control over the organisation, the independent panel was firmly subjected to the demands of the Department which did not want certain personnel to apply.  This sets a poor precedent for future relations.</p><p> Financial resources are vital to the ability of these bodies to do their job.  This comes in the context of significant cuts and stagnation in funding until this year's increase.  However the funding issue must be separated from the structural changes proposed in the Bill that threaten the independence of the body.  Both the Equality Authority and IHRC experienced budgetary cuts in 2008.  In November 2008, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, announced cuts of 43% to the Equality Authority and 32% to the IHRC.  As mentioned, these cuts were heavily criticised at the time.  However the financial reductions reflected the severe budgetary constraints under which the country was operating.  Most important the reductions did not directly impact upon the structural independence of the bodies and their organisational capacity to pursue their objectives.  Fianna F&aacute;il did not move forward with a proposed merger idea.  The current Government did not address the issue and kept funding at that level until this year.  Adequate resources are obviously vital to the proper functioning of these bodies.  This should not be confused with organisational independence and integrity which ensure these bodies can do their job free of interference.</p><p> Human rights and equality are an expression of our best values, the fundamental principles of what we as a State strive to achieve.  Having a strong independent watchdog to uphold them is integral to breathing life into them.  The Bill jeopardises that.  We will be using Committee Stage to strengthen its weakest provisions to ensure that human rights and equality are not sidelined and neglected by this Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800031#DD00200"><p>I share the Minister's concern at the worrying rise of anti-semitism and the experience of much of the Jewish community in a number of EU member states.  It is deeply worrying when one considers the lessons of the Holocaust and the evil that was perpetrated at that time against Jewish people and Gypsies.  The Nazis slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Gypsies and Roma during the Holocaust and this is not often given the focus it needs.  We need to learn the lessons of that period and I condemn the dangerous morons responsible for some of the incidents against the Minister in recent days.  All right-thinking citizens utterly condemn such activity, particularly anti-semitism.  It must be dealt with and hopefully those responsible will be brought to justice.  I will focus on the issue of Gypsies and Roma.</p><p>We in this country are immensely proud of the boxer John Joe Nevin for his endeavours, bringing home gold and silver medals, and we wish him well in his professional career.  There is an article in today's <i>Daily Mail</i>newspaper in which Brenda Power users the opportunity of the attack on him to say:<blockquote>And the media is terrified of appearing critical of &quot;Traveller culture&quot; of which feuding is the principal expression these days.  When they're not beating their own cousins in family rows they'll also turn their hands to torturing and murdering old folk, and causing mayhem in school playgrounds as they set about one another with lethal weapons.</blockquote>That is what Brenda Power refers to as &quot;Traveller culture&quot; in a newspaper today.  I urge the IHRC to draw attention to that article.  It is right and proper to condemn the attack on John Joe Nevin and violence from any source in this State, but not to condemn an entire people for the behaviour of some.</p><p>This article is representative of dangerous viewpoints that still exist in the State, which must be condemned and confronted directly.</p><p> The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2014 has been planned since the Government took power in 2011, but has been surrounded by much controversy, ranging from the delay in getting it here today, three years later, to the concern around whether the legislation complied with the UN principles for such bodies and the appointments process.  My party and I are opposed to this legislation and this planned merger, and I am sure the Minister will understand why.</p><p> The Irish Human Rights Commission was established by the Human Rights Commission Act of 2000 and, for those who do not know, the establishment of the commission emanated from the Good Friday Agreement, which set up human rights commissions North and South.  The Good Friday Agreement obliges the Irish Government to put in place comparable steps to those in the North to safeguard the rights of citizens.  This included the obligation to &quot;establish a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within Northern Ireland as stated in the Good Friday Agreement rights and safeguards.&quot;  There are two issues arising from this that I will mention briefly.  The Irish Human Rights Commission in the South does not have the full range of powers available to the commission in the North, and therefore the equivalence obligation has already been ignored.  The fact that the Government in the South is proposing to amalgamate the human rights and equality bodies will result in a mismatch of powers and obligations, and again the equivalence obligations are ignored.  The Irish Government should retain the Irish Human Rights Commission as a sole body in the South and invest in it the broad range of powers available in the North.</p><p> This Bill is unpicking parts of the Good Friday Agreement.  The British and Irish Governments are co-equal guarantors of the Agreement and it was also endorsed by the vast majority of people across this island.  This Bill undermines the vote of the people and the political, democratic and peace process.  The Government's proposal in front of us today undermines the Good Friday Agreement as a whole by sending a message to any party to the Agreement that the possibility exists to hollow it out one component at a time, and we have no doubt there are those who would wish to do so.</p><p> The potential of the agreements have not been fully realised and elements have not been implemented.  This is the view expressed this week by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  By beginning to unpick aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, this Government will lose the moral authority to challenge those who want to unpick the Agreement or refuse to implement it.  We cannot afford to let this happen.  It has already been a struggle to get where we are, and we need the Irish Government, as a co-guarantor of this Agreement, to ensure that it is taken seriously, promoting and progressing it rather than removing the parts it does not like.  For what has this decision been taken?  It has come about because the outcome is a nominal saving in an agency's budget.  These savings could be realised elsewhere.  This Bill is ill thought out and a counterproductive proposal, and even at this stage I am calling on the Government not to proceed with it.  It is bad for human rights and equality in this State.</p><p> Since September 2011 my party has called on the Government to ensure that the merged bodies continue to benefit from the equivalency of human rights provisions set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  This Government must recognise that under the UN Paris Principles, the Irish and Northern human rights commissions hold an &quot;A&quot; status rating, meaning that they must be appropriately mandated and financially secure to enable them to conduct their work effectively.  The Good Friday Agreement provided for a joint committee of the two commissions to consider the development of a charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  Whereas the two commissions completed a draft of the elements to be contained in the charter, there is still much work to be done.  It is imperative that the new human rights and equality body is resourced and mandated adequately in order to carry on this work.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in, led by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, introduced a Bill to the D&aacute;il to strengthen the Irish Human Rights Commission following the Government's proposal of a merger with the Equality Authority.  This Bill would have the effect of increasing the Irish Human Rights Commission's remit and would have given it the protection and status it deserves as a crucial element of the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  What we see here today is simply a cover for cuts, and both of these organisations are already under-resourced.  I am particularly mindful of the resignation of Mr. Niall Crowley, who was chairman of the Equality Authority in 2008 when he was faced with a 32% cut in the authority's budget.  It was an unworkable position; he did the right thing and the stand he took at the time was admirable.  How could the equality infrastructure and citizens' rights be defended either in that authority or the Irish Human Rights Commission when their ability to do so is being worn away?  How could these bodies be a cornerstone of the democratic process and protect citizens' rights while holding the Government to account and ensuring that the State implements and meets obligations to international human rights conventions while resources are being cut time after time?  My party and I stand by the Human Rights Commission (Amendment) Bill 2011 as it is better for human rights in this State.</p><p> At this point I highlight as clearly as I can that the Labour Party was most vocal in its opposition to a proposed merger when Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party were in Government.  At the time, the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, accused that Government of &quot;trying to turn back the clock on the equality agenda&quot;.  He deemed such a merger an &quot;ominous&quot; proposal.  It seems the position is now different for both the T&aacute;naiste and the Labour Party.  This evening I urge them to make their feelings known on this issue to their Fine Gael Government partners.  How much longer can the Labour Party sit on the Government benches and bow down to Fine Gael?</p><p> This merger undermines the human rights provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and can only lead to a loss of focus and expertise.  If the Government is to live up to its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement - an internationally recognised agreement - then it must ensure these institutions are protected.  I call on all Members in this House to oppose the retrograde merger proposals of the Government.</p></speech>

I welcome this important debate, as we must be vigilant about human rights and protect our citizens at all times.  This Bill is relevant to what has happened in recent weeks, as we have regularly seen the rights of people being trampled on, whether the person involved is a whistleblower, a person with a disability, a victim of crime, a Member of the Oireachtas or a child in a preschool in Darndale threatened with closure because the Government cannot find &euro;100,000 to fund that fantastic child care service.  I stand for these human rights issues and the rights of these young children in particular.  If the Government is to put flesh on this Bill, it must focus on Government and public bodies that do not deliver on the human rights and equality agenda.  If this is not done on the ground, the Bill will be an irrelevant sham.  I urge the Minister to deal with the issue of delivering on human rights in this State.</p><p>  I previously mentioned children with special needs and those who need assistance.  There are 15,776 children waiting for speech and language assessment and, altogether, 1,639 children have waited for more than a year for an initial assessment for speech and language problems.  I raise the human rights of these children, who have waited months for assessment by a HSE speech and language therapist.</p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2014 provides for the establishment of a new body to protect and promote human rights and equality &ndash; the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  It dissolves two existing organisations, the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority.  Staff of the two organisations will transfer to the new body and be civil servants of the State.  I commend the fantastic work done by Mr. Niall Crowley on equality and human rights.</p><p>The Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, was established on foot of the Good Friday Agreement which requires the Government to ensure &quot;at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland&quot;.  The primary duty of a human rights body is to hold the State to account inupholding human rights.  All members of the Opposition should recognise that it is our duty to hold the State and the Government to account.  The IHRC is accredited with the highest A status by the United Nations which measures national human rights institutions against international benchmarks known as the Paris Principles.  We need to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full.  This is linked with human rights.  I am very concerned, however, that the Bill undermines the Agreement.  There has been horrific sectarianism in recent weeks in parts of Belfast where the minority is under threat.  Politicians such as Anna Lo and Naomi Long have been attacked and abused for the stance they have taken and the silence down here in many quarters has been deafening.  Even today there was an attack on the home of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  While the Minister and I would not share a political ideology, I totally and utterly condemn what happened at his home this morning.  It was unacceptable.  We all have political differences, but there is no room for threats, bomb threats, sectarianism or racism.  I unconditionally condemn and deplore the attack on the Minister&rsquo;s house.</p><p>In addition to sectarianism and racism, we must also consider age as a ground for equality legislation.  Many senior citizens feel believe they have done their bit, but they are being ignored and discriminated against.  Membership of the Traveller community is another.  There have been attacks on Travellers, young men and women, and houses burned out.  This problem is getting worse.  We are dealing positively with equality in respect of sexual orientation.  I commend the proposals and urge people when the referendum is held to implement what they believe in.  We want to build a modern, inclusive Ireland in which everybody is respected and enjoys difference and diversity.  That is equality. </p><p>Equality legislation must also take account of disability.  Tens of thousands of people with physical and intellectual disabilities are not yet part of mainstream society.  We have moved a long way, but that does not mean we should stop.  We have to ensure their rights and services are protected.  When we debate issues such as the carry-on at the Central Remedial Clinic or Rehab, we should not take our eye off the ball and forget people with disabilities.  We should not be distracted by others in respect of cuts to these services.  This should be part of the legislation.</p><p>The regulatory impact assessment of the Bill states the merger is expected to save in the region of &euro;500,000.  The Department has stated these moneys will be available to support the core work of the new commission.  I hope that will happen.</p><p>While it is important that the Bill cover the human rights of people with disabilities, gay people and senior citizens, we must broaden it out to the international level.  The United Nations was founded in 1945 after the Second World War and now has 193 member states.  According to its website:<blockquote>The UN has 4 main purposesTo keep peace throughout the world; <br /><br />To develop friendly relations among nations; <br /><br />To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people, to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect for each other&rsquo;s rights and freedoms; <br /><br />To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve these goals.</blockquote>We must also ensure these rights are included at international level.  Every independent state such as Ireland, with an independent foreign policy, needs to ensure it acts as an honest broker in conflicts.  I commend our soldiers and many extended family members and friends who have served in the United Nations and done a magnificent job of peacekeeping.</p><p>Section 12 sets out the membership of the commission and provides that it will consist of not more than 15 and not less than 12 members, a sensible number, one of whom will be the chief commissioner.  There must be equal representation of men and women and each member will hold office for no more than five years.  I welcome this because it ensures equality between men and women and five years is a sensible term.  Seven appointed members will be appointed for a three year term and the remaining eight members, including the chief commissioner, will be appointed for a five year term.  A person appointed to the Human Rights Commission on 16 April 2013 may be appointed a member of the commission.  Section 13 outlines the appointment process for membership of the commission.  It is important for it to be open and transparent and that high quality people join the commission.</p><p>We must examine closely our law and international law.  Ireland has a dualist approach to international law which treats domestic and international law as two different and separate systems of law.  This is provided for under the Constitution by way of Article 29.6 which provides: &ldquo;No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  I strongly support this Article.  International treaties signed and ratified by Ireland do not automatically become part of the domestic law of the State.  In order to be enforceable and binding at domestic level, such treaties must be domestically incorporated, either by way of an Act of the Oireachtas or as an amendment to the Constitution.  I like to see the Oireachtas take a strong view on this position. </p><p>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:<blockquote>The main purposes of the Bill are to:<blockquote>provide for the establishment of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission;<br /><br />to provide for the dissolution of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority [the issue of concern to some of us] and the transfer of their functions to the new Commission...</blockquote></blockquote>When the Labour Party was in opposition, it jumped up and down about this section, but it is very quiet now.  Its positive aspect is that it also aims to:<blockquote>strengthen and enhance the powers of the new Commission;<br /><br />introduce a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality. </blockquote>If we do even half of what is provided for in this legislation, we will have a chance to create a modern, inclusive, progressive country.  That is important for public bodies dealing with human rights and equality issues.  We should broaden it to include not only public and civil servants but also Members of the Oireachtas and city councillors.</p><p>The new commission is being established to be recognised by the United Nations as Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights institution and there are many good points in the legislation.  I have mentioned my concerns.</p><p>It is important to deal with human rights from a legislative point of view but we must also implement policies on the ground.  If we respect people from different backgrounds and create a society built on equality and respect for human rights, there will be a positive vibe within the State and violence and injustice will be reduced.  However, we must start at an early age.  I referred earlier to the pre-school in Darndale which is looking for &euro;100,000.  That is a classic example.  The school's 260 disadvantaged pupils need this service and an early intervention will cost the State less in the long term.</p><p> I welcome the debate on this Bill but I have concerns about certain provisions.  As I am aware that the Government has the numbers to pass it, I urge the Minister to ensure the positive parts of it are implemented at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800034#GG00200"><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2014 provides for the establishment of a new body to protect and promote human rights and equality, the Irish human rights and equality commission, IHREC.  It merges and dissolves two existing organisations, the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, and the Equality Authority.  The Bill also seeks to implement a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights by amending the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to provide for an enforceable right to compensation for a person found to be unlawfully deprived of her or his liberty as a result of a judicial act.  I welcome that provision in the Bill but, unfortunately, I cannot welcome the amalgamation of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority because it is a retrograde step.</p><p>  The Irish Human Rights Commission was established on foot of the Good Friday Agreement, which requires the Irish Government to ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as that which pertains in Northern Ireland.  The primary duty of a human rights body is to hold the State to account in upholding human rights.  The IHRC is currently accredited with the highest A-status by the United Nations, which measures national human rights institutions against international benchmarks, known as the Paris principles.  The standing of the commission is likely to be reviewed on foot of the passing of this Bill.  The Equality Authority was established in 1999 to replace the Employment Equality Agency.  The authority works towards the elimination of discrimination and promotes equality in employment and the provision of goods and services across nine grounds that have been well rehearsed in this House.  Among its other work, the authority advises individuals on how to pursue actions.  I wonder whether that provision will continue apply under the Bill now before us where an investigation is conducted by the new body.</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, stated that the reason for the merger is to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.  An impact assessment of the Bill projected that it would save &euro;500,000 per year.  The Minister also stated that he increased the allocation for the new commission to &euro;1.9 million last December.  While that is welcome, the new commission will have a shortfall of &euro;1.5 million in the funding available to it compared to the combined funding for its predecessors in 2009.  That will seriously impact on its ability to carry out its work.</p><p>  Equality advocates and human rights NGOs have expressed concerns about the Bill and there appears to be unanimous opposition to the merger.  The Equality Rights Alliance, a coalition of over 170 bodies and activists, is opposed to the merger and suggests that three separate statutory bodies are necessary, namely, the Irish Human Rights Commission, a reconstituted Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal.  I am aware that the Equality Tribunal is not affected by this Bill.  However, even though people who are involved on a day to day basis with issues of equality and human rights are opposed to the merger, the Government is proceeding with the Bill.  </p><p>  It should be necessary for the new body to treat human rights and equality issues fairly.  Following a similar merger in the UK, equality issues took precedence over human rights and funding was allocated in an uneven fashion.  International research has found insufficient evidence to indicate whether integrated bodies function better or worse than separate free standing national equality bodies and national human rights institutions.  That is something we need to keep under review after the Bill is passed.  </p><p>  The Bill provides two different definitions of human rights.  Concern has been expressed about this inconsistency.  Section 29 of the Bill sets out a different definition of human rights to the definition contained in section 2.  While the definition in section 29 is proposed to apply to the enforcement powers of the new commission, it will create problems for enforcement.  The narrower definition proposed in sections 29 requires that the human rights in question have force of law in the State.  This means such rights would need to be enshrined in legislation or at a constitutional level before they could be applicable to the functions and powers of the IHREC.  In practical terms, it is suggested that the IHREC would be limited in protecting human rights because it could only directly encompass consideration of the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights at a sub-constitutional level through its implementation into Irish law by the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, and existing domestic equality legislation.  The IHRC notes that as the State has a practice of not directly incorporating international treaties into national law, this would effectively exclude a number of significant treaties and conventions from consideration.  According to the IHRC, the inability of the IHREC to respond to alleged breaches of the fundamental rights protections contained in these treaties would significantly undermine the credibility of the new body.  If the Government is serious about human rights it will give the new commission powers to enforce the provisions contained in treaties to which this country has signed up.  This issue could have significant implications from a human rights perspective.  For example, the survivors of symphysiotomy made a submission claiming that the State violated the UN Convention against Torture by failing to initiate an independent inquiry and restitution scheme for victims of the scandal.  The new commission would not be able to examine such a claim.  To take another example, will it be able to examine the operation of direct provision in this State?</p><p>  Questions also arise in regard to the independence of the new commission.  It has been asserted that the increased accountability of the new IHREC to the Department of Justice and Equality is not conducive to independence or high-performance.  The Scottish Human Rights Commission, which was created in 2008 and has since emerged as a model of best practice, is solely accountable to the Scottish Legislative Assembly and has no links to the Executive.  The threshold proposed in the Bill for the carrying out of an inquiry by the commission is higher than existing equality legislation.  The proposed threshold is the term&quot;grave public concern&quot;, as opposed to the current term &quot;any purpose connected with the performance of its functions&quot;.  This may in practice limit the ability of the new commission to carry out inquiries.</p><p>  Much has been made about the imposition of a positive duty on public bodies to have regard for equality and human rights in their work.  However, while this provision is welcome, there is no provision for enforcing it.  If we are to have meaningful human rights and equality legislation, every Department and public agency should be forced by law to take account of the duty.   Successive budgets introduced by the current and previous Governments have given rise to questions about the equality or otherwise of actions taken.</p><p>The Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority should be able to look into that and should be able to make decisions in that regard.  If we want to build an equal and fair society, we should be providing for that in legislation.</p><p> Most other jurisdictions have separate national equality bodies and national human rights institutions.  Some countries have merged them, but a recent study found that there was insufficient evidence to say whether integrated bodies work better or worse than separate and free standing equality and human rights organisations.  We should maintain the independence of both the human rights commission and the Equality Authority and strengthen them, and provide them with the resources to ensure that they can act to ensure that all public bodies comply with human rights and have enforceable powers to ensure that human rights and equality is complied with right across the State, because that is the only way that we can build a fair and equality society.  We need that oversight and that rule.</p><p> Finally, on the membership of the commission, I note the members of the commission were appointed last year and they are proposed to be the members of the new commission.  While the legislation states that the Paris Principles will be used in setting up the commission, the membership of the commission should be specified within the legislation as well.  The Paris Principles state that non-governmental organisations and trade unions and Parliament should be represented on the commission and the legislation could be strengthened by including that in it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/978" speakername="David Stanton" time="18:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800035#HH00300"><p>I think it is a first for this new provision has and I am delighted to be here this evening as Chair of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality representing my colleagues on the committee.  This, as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, stated, is a new provision that was put in train last year so that the chairs of committee can come into the Chamber and make a presentation on the work of the committee and on the legislation before the House.</p><p>  The decision to merge the Equality Authority and the human rights commission was made by the Government in 2011, and there has been much consultation since then.  A working group was established by the Minister in October 2011 to advise him on the practical issues in the proposed merger.  I understand there were four representatives from each of the boards of the two existing organisations together with representation from the Department of Justice and Equality and an independent chair.  The group, I am told, reported on 19 April 2012 and made a number of recommendations under 42 separate headings and all of these were accepted by Government.  After that, there was a comprehensive consultation process involving 69 submissions.  The Minister then decided to refer the general scheme to the joint committee, which it was hoped would also help in raising public awareness.</p><p>  We considered the general scheme of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill in June 2012.  In particular, we were asked to examine head 13, which provides for the process in which a new commission would be selected and appointed.  We were asked to come back with any proposals within a short period, and we did so.  We made a number of recommendations including that the commission should be gender balanced; that those on the commission should have a proven track record and expertise in the field of human rights and equality; and, a person who served on the panel should be ineligible to become a member of the commission the members of which the panel is selecting.  The joint committee also stated it would like to meet the members of the selection panel.</p><p>  The selection panel was put in place.  A number of Members already stressed the importance of the independence of the Irish Human Rights Commission, and, of course, the issue arose of who appoints the selection panel.  If the Minister or the Executive was seen to appoint a selection panel and then the selection panel was to appoint the commission, it could quite rightly be argued that maybe it was not hands-off enough.  This led to a certain amount of confusion.  When the selection panel was appointed, the United Nations was consulted by the Minister, who wanted to be sure that everything was being done properly, and at that stage there was a certain amount of discussion and, I suppose, a little confusion.  The selection panel actually stood aside because of that because it felt the Government was not hands-off enough at the time.  Some discussions took place and then something novel and laudable happened in that it was proposed that the selection panel would come before and present to the joint Oireachtas committee.  That gave all members of the joint Oireachtas committee an opportunity to engage with the selection panel, to comment on the persons who were on the selection panel and to ascertain whether they would be suitable to carry on the job - in other words, whether they were independent enough.  One should bear in mind that the committee comprises, as all Oireachtas committees have, members from all parties and none.</p><p>  We engaged quite constructively with the selection panel and when it was over, every member of the committee was satisfied that the persons concerned were independent and fit, and had the expertise and the ability, and the interest and the energy, to nominate and appoint the members of the proposed human rights and equality commission.  They went with fair wind, and that was useful.  It was a unanimous decision by all members of the committee present.  No one dissented.  This is not like the situation in some states where there is a kind of star chamber of inquisition.  That was not the case.  The members of the selection panel had an opportunity to make presentations to the committee and the committee was quite satisfied with that.</p><p>  The Bill itself was also presented to the committee, which then looked for submissions under pre-legislative scrutiny.  We received 15 submissions on the heads of the Bill.  These came from the Irish Human Rights Commission and Irish Council for Civil Liberties, two submissions; Equality Rights Alliance, two submissions; European Group on National Human Rights Institutions; Children's Rights Alliance; Mr. Pat McCarthy, a member of the public, which is interesting because it is welcome that individual members of the public, not only NGOs, can make submissions to Oireachtas committees; the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network; Disability Federation of Ireland; Irish Congress of Trade Unions; Pobal; the Equality Authority; the Committee on the Administration of Justice; Senator Ivana Bacik; and, Senator Katherine Zappone.</p><p>  The committee held two public meetings, on 4 and 5 July 2013, having invited some of those who made submissions to address the committee in person.  I thank those who made submissions.  A lot of work and thought goes into it.  The Equality Rights Alliance addressed the committee in person, as did representatives from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Children's Rights Alliance; the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Equality Authority, etc.  Following two days of hearings, the committee produced a report with observations, representative of the submissions made as part of the consultation process which was then used to inform the drafting of today's Bill, published on 21 March 2014.</p><p>  The committee made a number of observations.  One was on the definition of human rights and equality, heads 3 and 30.  The committee was told that there was an inconsistency in the definition of equality at heads 3 and 30 which needed to be addressed.  It is essential that there be one unified definition of human rights and equality under the Bill.  I understand, from reading it, that there is no definition of equality in the Bill, as drafted.  Maybe there does not need to be.  At any rate, there is a definition of human rights.  The Bill, as drafted, still contains a separate definition of human rights in Part 3 to the other sections.  It was also submitted to the committee that the definition was too narrow and that additional discrimination grounds should be considered, for example, socioeconomic status, trade union membership, past criminal conviction and political opinion.</p><p>  Independence was also mentioned.  It was put to the committee that the new commission should be detached from the Department of Justice and Equality, and that it should not only be independent but also be seen to be independent.  The Irish Human Rights Commission specifically recommended that it be directly accountable instead to the Oireachtas.</p><p>This has been provided for in section 25, which deals with the strategy statement, section 27, which deals with accounts, and in section 28, which deals with the presentation of the annual report.  Section 14 provides for the removal of a commission member from office on the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  During this process, it was also suggested that financial accountability should be directed to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The director, as financial controller, will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.  Section 22 provides for financial accountability to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> The next issue raised concerns the appointment of the director.  Most groups that came before the committee agreed that the appointments process was much better and more transparent than previously.  However, concern was expressed that the selection of panel members would be decided by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Public Appointments Service.  It was put to the committee that provision 5 of head 17, that the first director of the commission shall be the chief executive of the Equality Authority, is in conflict with the Paris Principles and some contributors strongly recommended the deletion of the provision.  I welcome the fact that the Paris Principles are explicitly cited in the new Bill.  The appointment of the director is provided for in sections 20 and 21 of the new Bill and a temporary director will take up this position if it is in place before the commission is established.</p><p> The body should be empowered to recruit its own staff and there should be no Civil Service secondment to the body at senior level.  Recruitment, in general, takes place through the Public Appointments Service.  However, section 24 provides for the temporary employment of persons for specialist purposes by the commission.  Such persons can be experts in a particular area or topic on which the commission is working and may be released by their public, private or NGO employer to work with the commission for the duration of the project.  In accordance with the Paris Principles, the Bill states that all staff employed by the commission will be under the control and direction of the commission.  There is no provision for secondment.</p><p> Regarding membership of the commission, most groups recommended that more specific criteria for appointment to the commission should be set out in head 13 of the legislation as to the skills and attributes necessary for each commissioner.  It is suggested that at least one person on the commission should have experience in governance, administration and organisational management and also experience in employment law and industrial relations.  Membership of the commission, as provided for in section 12, will be the current members designate.  Members will be to appointed by the President on recommendation by the Oireachtas, with upcoming vacant positions advertised by the Public Appointments Service.  Section 13(5) outlines the qualification criteria for inclusion in the commission, such as human rights, matters of law, equality matters of law, public administration and reform and board management and corporate governance.  Selection criteria will be agreed by the MinIster for Justice and Equality and the Public Appointments Service.  Gender balance and minorities criteria are also listed in parts of section 13.  Staff of the Commission will transfer from the current bodies and they shall become civil servants and so not amenable to instruction from Government or Ministers.  This is in line with Paris Principles.</p><p> Much was taken on board from the recommendations of the committee.  Head 36 deals with public service duty and was welcomed by all but it was suggested that the provision should be strengthened.  The obligation on public bodies to give consideration to equality and human rights is not sufficiently defined.  For example, the term 'give consideration' could be defined as requiring public bodies to conduct equality and human rights impact assessments of all new policies and programmes.  Further, sanctions could be established in cases where an adequate standard is not achieved by public bodies.  The Bill introduces, through section 42, a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality and reflects a commitment in the Government's programme for national recovery 2011-16.  The commission will assist public bodies to comply with positive duty, including by producing guidelines and codes of practice, as outlined in section 31.</p><p> The committee agreed that the legislation generally should ensure that the establishment of the new commission is carried out in accordance with the Paris Principles as interpreted by the sub-committee on accreditation of the International Co-ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions.  Reference was made to that by colleagues concerned about the point.  The explanatory memorandum of the Bill states that the new commission is being established with the intention of being recognised, as the Irish Human Rights Commission currently is, by the UN as Ireland's national human rights institution accredited for UN purposes in accordance with provisions of the Paris Principles - best practice standards which ensure independent and effective national human rights Institutions that operate independently of  Government and have the mandate and resources to work effectively.  The Minister has agreed to increase the budget and has found &euro;2 million for the new body.  He has also increased staffing levels.</p><p> Section 35 provides that the commission may, of its own volition or at the request of the Minister, conduct an inquiry.  This shows the independence of the commission.</p><p> I want to be associated with the remarks of colleagues, who are no longer in the Chamber, who condemned the attack on the Minister's house.  Human rights, equality and fundamental freedoms are of great importance.  There is an ugliness out there at the moment.  A candidate for the European elections was spat on and insulted.  I am ashamed to say that it happened in Cork.  Social media gives a certain licence and freedom to people to violate human rights and attack and insult people.  We should have a look at that.  More and more people are subjected to bullying and other attacks on social media.  It is a growing phenomenon and people can get very upset.  People have taken their own lives because of it.  We must work to combat this and find ways to track down these people, punish them and ensure they cannot do it again.</p><p> I am taken with the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, some of which include the obligation to respect human rights, the right to life, the prohibition of torture, and the prohibition of slavery and forced labour.  Last week I attended a presentation by people concerned with prostitution, slavery and forced labour and trafficking in Ireland.  Other principles include the right to liberty and security, the right to a fair trial, the principle of no punishment without law, the right to respect for private and family life, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, the right to marry, the right to an effective remedy and the prohibition of discrimination </p><p> These are absolutely essential and should be discussed and taught in every school and in every classroom.  These rights should be teased out in transition year classes across the country.  What do they mean?  What does the obligation to respect human rights mean?  What is that about?  What does the right to liberty and security actually mean?  What do the freedoms of thought, conscience and religion and of expression and of assembly and association actually mean?  They should be spelled out in our classrooms.  It is one of the most important things we could do if these topics were part of transition year.  Some young people from Castletownbere appeared before the Oireachtas committee last week.  Deputy Sean Kenny was present for their fantastic presentation on trafficking.  They were articulate, inspiring and amazing.  Last year, people appeared before the Oireachtas committee and spoke about missing persons.  In fairness, the Minister took on the suggestion to have an international missing persons day.  It occurred last December.  There are major issues we must take on board.</p><p> Senator Zappone, a hardworking member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, has been listening to this debate.  She made a suggestion, which I want to put on record and which I have discussed with colleagues.  I have the honour of chairing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence for the moment and, on foot of this Bill and the importance of human rights, we suggest changing the name to justice, equality, human rights and defence.  This adds on human rights and presents the committee as the overseer of human rights provisions in legislation coming before the Houses.  This will quality proof and human rights proof Bills.  It happens in other jurisdictions, such as New Zealand and the UK, where there is early and ongoing consideration of human rights policy and legislative development.  These measures can improve the parliamentary scrutiny of the laws for consistency with rights and freedoms.  In New Zealand, a statement of compatibility is produced.  The suggestion of a human rights parliamentary scrutiny committee from Senator Zappone is a good one.  We should discuss and debate it and see how we can fit in to our procedures and methods of working.</p><p>The pre-legislative scrutiny of legislation takes a long time.  It is a totally new provision in my 17 years in the House.  In the past Bills were produced as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  They were introduced in the House on Second Stage and it was very difficult to make any fundamental changes because in some cases one would almost have to redraft the Bill from scratch.  Pre-legislative scrutiny means that NGOs, the ordinary citizen and State agencies - anybody and everybody - can examine the heads of a Bill before it is formally drafted and have an input into it.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence has gone through this procedure with a number of Bills including the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, which was previously the Mental Capacity Bill.  That was a huge piece of work.  The work the committee did and the fact that the Department took on the suggestions, as it did with this Bill, means the Oireachtas committees are having a huge input into legislation before Bills are even published.  The National Vetting Bureau Bill (Children and Vulnerable Persons) is another Bill we examined and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill.  The Personal Insolvency Bill was a huge piece of legislation in which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews, is very interested.  We also examined the Mediation Bill, which is due to come before the House shortly.  We expect the Gambling Control Bill to be produced in the near future.  We are currently involved in the same process in that tomorrow we have hearings on the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  The Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill is due and the criminal procedure Bill, among others.  With each of the Bills listed we went through the procedure of inviting submissions, holding oral hearings, engaging with people, teasing out the fundamental issues and sending a report back to the Department and the Minister.  In many instances we received letters from the Minister and the Department thanking us for the work we have done and in some cases taking on board all of the suggestions made by the committee, which one should remember in many instances come from society in general.  It is a way for people to have an input into legislation at a very early stage, before it is drafted.  It is easier to make changes at that time than it is after the Bill is formally published, so much so that a lot of legislation that comes to the House on Second Stage requires little debate given the work that has previously been done by committees, not just the justice committee but many of the other committees also.</p><p>In addition, when a Bill reaches Committee Stage we do not have many amendments to make because the fundamental work has been covered already.  It is a fantastic way to proceed.  It adds to the work of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas but it is extraordinarily useful and worthwhile.  I thank my fellow committee members for their work on all the Bills I outlined and other reports as well in the past three years.  The work they have done and the input they have had to very many technical, detailed and in some cases controversial issues.</p><p>I commend the Minister on the work he and his departmental officials have done to date on the Bill and other legislation.  I accept some Opposition Members have raised issues but my feeling is that there is a huge overlap between the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission and it makes sense to bring them together under one commission.  The savings made will be ploughed back into the new body which will be stronger, leaner, more efficient and far more effective.  That is what we want.</p><p>We must be ever-vigilant about human rights and equality.  We cannot let our guard down for a moment.  We must be most careful, in particular with the advent of social media and texting.  One of the first Bills I dealt with in 1999 to 2000 on being elected to the House was on copyright.  The previous Bill was from 1963.  At that time Members were concerned about the advent of television and the impact it would have on society.  In the debate in 1999 and 2000 we were concerned about the new-fangled device of the Internet, whether it would catch on and what impact it would have.  As science and technology change we must be ever-vigilant and careful about human rights.  We must protect them, champion them and recognise them.  We must also educate people about them.  Far more is required than just putting a Bill on the Statute Book and saying everything is grand.  We must change the mindset of people so that when people stand for election and knock on doors they are treated with respect.  It is to be expected that people might not agree with candidates who knock on our doors but they should be treated with a certain amount of respect and although one might say he or she does not agree with the point of view of the candidate he or she should politely thank the candidate and say goodnight.  Rather than have candidates being abused I urge people to treat with respect those who put their heads above the parapet and stand for election.</p><p>In Afghanistan earlier this week we saw people queuing although they were under threat of life and limb for exercising their franchise.  Thankfully, a surprising number of Afghan people voted.  A vote is something very precious and democracy is very precious.  Democracy is a thin veneer on civilisation.  I read a book recently about violence through the ages.  I cannot recall the title of the book but it made the point that, thankfully, in western Europe today we live in the safest most peaceful place that ever existed.  That is because we have democracy and the rule of law.  We cannot ever take it for granted.  A number of years ago in south Africa when people got their freedom they travelled for miles in the heat and queued for hours for the right to vote, which is a precious right.  We should really cherish it.  I urge the media when commenting on politicians and election candidates not to treat them as if they are something one would find under one&rsquo;s shoe.  That happens and such commentary fuels hatred for politicians, elected representatives and the democratic process.  It is a dangerous thing to do.  I will end on that note.</p></speech>

It is a key deliverable of the public sector reform plan published in 2011 in terms of the streamlining of our State bodies.  I acknowledge that the acting chairman designate, at the launch of the annual reports for 2013 of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission in November of last year, stated that it is a testimony to how far the process of combining the work of the two distinct organisations has progressed.</p><p>  The Bill is an excellent example of the new pre-legislative scrutiny, a process by which the main themes of the Bill are published and then examined in a meaningful and helpful way through engagement and consultation with the public and civil society organisations.  I pay tribute to the Minister on his work on the Bill and to my Oireachtas colleagues who sit on the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, chaired by Deputy David Stanton, who has just spoken and given a thoughtful, provoking speech and made a number of valid and welcome comments.  The committee held substantive public meetings and heard from a wide range of interested parties before publishing a helpful report.</p><p>  Originally the Irish Human Rights Commission was established following the Good Friday Agreement and it become the main body tasked with holding the State to account in terms of respecting human rights.  Acknowledgement of the rights enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights along with respect for these rights is the main characteristic of a civilised society.  It differentiates our nation and those in Europe from nations elsewhere which continue to deprive and denigrate their peoples.  It must be said that our State has not always respected and vindicated rights.</p><p>There is plenty of evidence which demonstrates that.  Even today we do not always get things right, and we could do certain things better.  However, the crucial difference between today and the past is the way we strive to uphold and vindicate the fundamental rights which are ascribed to people by virtue of being human.</p><p> The 2008 budget cuts of 43% to the Equality Authority and 32% to the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, were astounding.  All organisations had to contribute at such a time of financial instability and uncertainty but the levels of cuts were truly disproportionate.  They were also implemented at a time when the temptation to save money without due regard to human rights was at its greatest.</p><p> It goes without saying that every TD in this House, and every TD who ever sat in this House, has been contacted by people who have been deprived of their rights.  The TD's office is often seen as the last port of call for a person seeking to have their rights upheld.  In this regard, I particularly welcome the measures that will seek to instill a culture of respect for human rights across public sector organisations.  I hope that in time the necessity of appeals bodies, human rights watchdogs and others will be lessened because of this new culture.</p><p> I am aware of the concerns of some regarding the merger of the IRHC and the Equality Authority and the possible problems regarding the difference between equality and human rights.  I appreciate these concerns but I also see the overlapping functions between the two previously separate organisations and I see an overlap between the concept of human rights and equality.  If human rights are respected and vindicated fully among all citizens, then, in theory, inequality is not an issue and should not arise.  Of course, everyday life is more complex than this.  However, I believe that the work of both the IHRC and the Equality Authority through the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC can help foster a culture which delivers greater respect for human rights.  </p><p> On the subject of delivery, I welcome the Minister's statement that the new IHREC will unequivocally keep faith with the Paris Principles - the peer reviewed accreditation for human rights commissions.  I would hope and urge that in the review of the new organisation in terms of the Paris Principles that any shortcomings that are identified, which may affect the current &quot;A&quot; status which the IHRC has, will be addressed without delay.  One of the main principles of the Paris Principles concerns adequate human and financial resources.  While a sound legislative basis and a strong commitment at political level are essential, so too are resources.  The IHREC can only be as effective as possible as long as it is properly resourced.  In this context, I believe there will always be a tension, and a possible problem, when the organisation tasked with holding the Government to account on human rights and equality issues is financially dependent on that Government.  Section 26, which covers funding, contains a commitment that such funding will be reasonably sufficient to allow the commission to fulfil its mandate.  In straitened times there would be concerns that this budget would be greatly reduced, as occurred, as I outlined, in the 2008 cuts.   </p><p> We should examine ways of linking the financing the new IHREC with an independent measure, for example, that the funding would always a percentage of GDP or GNP or would never fall below a certain minimum threshold.  It is essential that the new IHREC receives the proper resources in order that it can carry out its very important work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1021" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kenny" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800038#LL00200"><p>I welcome the Bill and I wish to see the merger of the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission succeed.  I want to see it strengthen and enhance Ireland's institutions for the protection of equality and human rights.  Since April 2013, the two existing bodies have been operating as a cohesive unit under the direction of the members designate of the new commission.  The existing Human Rights Commission is accredited with the United Nations "A" status as Ireland's national human rights institution.  The Equality Authority was established in compliance with a number of EU equality directives.  All of this is significant as it demonstrates that Ireland is addressing its human rights obligations within approved internationally recognised structures, including compliance with the Paris Principles, and they have also exceeded best practice standards in regard to EU equality bodies.</p><p>  I support the Minister in his belief that the stronger legislation base, which the Bill provides, along with the enhanced powers and a wider mandate, will ensure that new commission is well placed to be successful in its forthcoming application to the United Nations to obtain re-accreditation as Ireland's recognised national human rights institution.  I also note and very much welcome the measures the Government has taken on a practical level - an additional &euro;2 million was provided for the IHREC in budget 2014 together with an interim staffing complement of 47.  That is a reverse of the disproportionate Fianna F&aacute;il cuts to this important area of Irish public policy during the term of the previous Government.  </p><p>  The new commission's enhanced powers and wider mandate will positively influence its capacity to address discrimination and promote equal treatment on all grounds, and to protect human rights in Ireland.  For example, a new duty will be introduced obliging public bodies to have regard, in the performance of their functions, of the need to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and treatment.  The new commission will be explicitly empowered to further support public bodies in meeting their obligations under this duty such as advising on the development of performance measures, operating standards and preventative strategies, as stated in the programme for Government.  </p><p>  The commission will have a power of public inquiry in situations where there is evidence of a serious violation of human rights or equality of treatment obligations or a systematic failure to comply with human rights or equality treatment obligations, as this is a matter of serious public concern.  This is of greater importance in the area of direct provision, a system that I believe is deeply flawed and in dire need of reform.  It is also useful in terms of penal reform, and while much progress has been made in this regard in the past year or so, I believe more is needed.  The commission will be able to influence this further required progress.</p><p>  It is important to mention that the opportunity this Bill presents is being taken to amend the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to provide for an enforceable right of compensation for a person whose detention is found to be in breach of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights and where the detention was a result of a judicial error.  This is a requirement of Article 5, paragraph 5 of the convention.  The proposed amendment follows an appeal of a Supreme Court judgment in the DG case to the European Court of Human Rights which found that Ireland is in breach of the convention by reason of not having an enforceable right to compensation in cases where unlawful deprivation of liberty is a result of a judicial error.</p><p>  I wish to raise, as a human rights issue, the need to outlaw discrimination against people in receipt of rent supplement who are seeking private rented accommodation.  This legislation would tackle the unacceptable culture which exists that discriminates against people on economic grounds.  I ask the Minister to say how this matter could be addressed by way of legislation.</p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality got a lot of flak last week and Labour Deputies who supported him got some flak also.  This legislation is an example of why the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is being supported so strongly.  A lot more has been done in the area of human rights than was done under 14 years of Fianna F&aacute;il Administration.  I am pleased to be a part of that as a Member of this House and also a member of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  On a final note, I utterly deplore the attack on the Minister's home last week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800038#LL00300"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation, which provides for something to which we all aspire.  Like other speakers, I would like to roundly condemn the attack on the Minister's home recently.  Such activity, brought on for whatever reason, is unacceptable.  It is a breach of human rights.  It is also a breach of basic democracy for anybody to decide that they have the right to take something out on somebody because they disliked something the person said, disliked the person for religious reasons, reasons of sexual orientation or whatever the case may be.  They have no right to engage in such activity and are attempting to deprive others of their basic democratic rights.  It goes without saying that those who tend to move in that direction should be warned that this is not the first time that has happened.  We have had such incidents before, great and small, all over this country and all over the globe and we should have learned a lesson from them.  If we have not learned a lesson from them by now, then unfortunately, we are beyond learning.  I hope we have not gone that far yet.</p><p>  I welcome the legislation and pay respect to the work of those who dealt with human rights and equality issues previously, Mr. Crowley, and a former colleague, Mr. Maurice Manning.</p><p>They did a very difficult job and established certain cornerstones on equality and human rights which hopefully will stand the test of time and be reinforced in the legislation.</p><p> There is an old saying that one person's human rights could be an abuse of somebody else's human rights but this is not necessarily so.  If we live in a world of reasonable equality where we respect each other we should not find ourselves in a position where we must trample on somebody else's rights to gain our own.  Neither should we have our rights trampled upon by others for whatever reason.  The rights of the individual are sacrosanct and must be borne in mind at all times.  Failure to do so is a serious flaw in our society.</p><p> Deputy Stanton passed remarks on the activities of somebody abusing a candidate in the European elections.  The people who do such things may feel brave.  They may feel they represent something they read on social media or heard on a street corner and that they are carrying out some deed on behalf of society.  Sadly they are not.  All they are doing is reproducing again the appalling basic human weaknesses of arrogance and an unwillingness to recognise anybody else's position but one's own.</p><p> An important matter all of us in the business of public life know is that we must recognise the right to free speech, not necessarily to offend others but to speak and represent ourselves and those around us.  If we fail to do so, and if we fail to observe these rights, we are not doing our job.  It comes back to basic democracy.  From the fledgling time of emerging democracies all over the globe the very first sign of democracy and society breaking down was when there were those who refused to listen to the other point of view.</p><p> The other point of view must be borne in mind and the manner in which the view is expressed is also important.  We do not have to express the view as if we were speaking to a condemned person in a cell.  We can extol the virtues of what we hold sincerely and dearly without causing offence to the other person.  Recently I saw two people exchange views in a public place.  Members of the public had a most insulting attitude towards a public representative for no reason except prejudice, begrudgery and a feeling society had done them a bad deed or had given them a short straw.  I believe it was Voltaire who advised us not to spend so much time complaining about the hand of cards life dealt us but to spend a little more time on playing them effectively to win the game.  This was good advice.</p><p> The Celtic tiger certainly did many good things for us.  It gave us new life and vision and the impression we could do things which previously seemed to be beyond our reach.  It also gave us a certain amount of arrogance that if we were not able to achieve our own aspirations we had to blame somebody for it and we could take it out on those who appeared to be in the way.  Something very similar happened in the 1930s all over the globe.  In the United States John Steinbeck wrote about the rolling hordes of people who found themselves jobless, homeless and roaming across the States looking for work and a reason to exist.  Steinbeck looked at it very carefully and showed how the human being reacts in certain circumstances.  Some withstood the test, some did not and some fell appallingly short of it.</p><p> At that time in the United States President Roosevelt was the right person in the right place as it happened.  He convinced the people to hold on, that good would prevail eventually and that they would survive.  He coerced them, challenged them, threatened them and cajoled them but he kept them in line to a fair extent.  In tragic contrast the people of Europe did something different.  At that time there were signs which are showing again.  These are signs of intolerance and the extreme left and right coming together in common cause and having a particular reason to object in strenuous fashion.  They were hurt because they had lost.  The roaring 20s were roaring in more ways than one but the hungry 30s came afterwards.  In the hungry 30s the hurt was so great that people buckled and looked around to find somebody whom they thought was responsible, perhaps people with money or people of a different religion.  What an appalling disaster to visit upon the people of the globe.  A total of 60 million people died and there are still people who state it did not really happen and that the Holocaust did not happen.  People in our lifetime state this, but sadly it did happen with the approval of the people at the time.</p><p> Let us not forget for one minute the chief artist in this scenario was elected by the people.  In recent weeks I heard people stating in this House that by virtue of their election whatever they did afterwards was always right.  This is not so.  If there was ever a single issue where this was challenged it was in Europe in the 1930s,  when somebody was elected to public office with the support of people who were well-qualified, such as academics and professionals, who should have known better but did not.  We know what happened.  Let this be a lesson for those in our society who like to take it upon themselves to condemn others and presume others have lesser rights or entitlements to democratic principles and human rights.  Let us remind ourselves these things have happened before because people did nothing about it.  People did not stand up to it, question it or challenge it and when they did it was too late.</p><p> We need to learn a lesson from this, and now is as good a time as any because we have been aware of the points raised by Deputy Stanton for some time.  There is a growing disrespect for the rights of others and this should not be the case.  We should have evolved past this and developed to the extent that we automatically recognise the rights and entitlements of others without impinging on our rights or theirs.  For my various sins I was one of the people in the original convention which drew up the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It was an interesting experience particularly as the meetings took place in Europe, the very cauldron to which I referred a moment ago.</p><p> I wish to remark on how we address ourselves in the House.  I remember when the language used and the manner in which a viewpoint was intoned was somewhat different from what is now.  This is something we must consider.  There was a time a number of years past when perhaps a much more academic debate took place, with distinct respect for the view of the other person when one did not agree.  I think we will lose this.  We have developed a somewhat different attitude, whereby it is believed and accepted that to get a viewpoint across we must be disparaging about the person to whom our views are directed.  This is the first, saddest and most basic flaw in what our society is showing up now.  It is a product of the Celtic tiger when we became arrogant.</p><p>Perhaps we must humble ourselves a little.  Whatever it is that we must do as a society, one can do great things without being offensive or obnoxious.  I hope people have learned a lesson in this regard on foot of some of the things that have happened in recent times.</p><p>I have heard, seen and read - as I am sure has everyone else - expressions by people on social media and in print, some of whom are professional people, of such a nature as to create hatred.  In any modern society, I believe there is a need for incitement to hatred legislation that identifies such behaviour.  While it may be simple or bland at the outset, some people in the social and print media come back to their subject by a different route.  One must realise that a person who receives such information electronically or by way of print may be impressionable.  Such people may have an impression created in their minds that this is the choice to make, this is what must be done and this is the way in which one should treat people.  I believe that to be really effective, legislation on the issue of incitement to hatred must consider the area to which I have just referred.  It could be beneficial and could provide for a situation in which people do not say or do what they wish when they wish, at the expense of everyone else.  Moreover, it should never be that way.</p><p>I refer, as did other speakers earlier, to ethnic groups and minority groups.  The manner in which a society treats minorities tells one everything about that society.  We tend to be a little vague about some aspects of the manner in which we treat others, that is, those who are members of minorities.  I can only make the point that as a nation and as a people, we have gone over the world.  Irish people have travelled everywhere out of necessity, out of adventure or for whatever reason.  We always have been received everywhere, although there have been times when Irish people were not received all that well and when they were the victims of discrimination.  However, this is all the more reason for Irish people to make absolutely certain that they do not ever practice discrimination anywhere, as they cannot afford to so do.  Irish people cannot afford to point at anyone or at any minority group anywhere because one should remember that we were those minorities and were ourselves in that position in different countries all over the world.  Moreover, we continue to be.  While I would like to hope we have earned the respect of the nations to which we have travelled, we must continue to observe the highest standards and enforce the highest standards in so far as the observation of human rights and entitlements are concerned.</p><p>I have one or two other points to make.  It comes home to each Member in different ways as to what he or she should or can do for society.  Currently, Members are told in this Chamber on a daily basis that because of financial cutbacks and austerity as it is called, they are wreaking havoc on society and are doing this deliberately.  No, they are not.  No one, either in government or, I am sure, in opposition, would do anything of that nature willingly.  Sadly, the Government arrived at the position in which it found itself largely on foot of the failure of certain instruments outside Members' immediate control.  Having looked back on this, some Members of this House pointed out things that were happening, as well as others that should have happened but did not.  However, people scoffed at that and asked what would those fools know, as they were not really into it.  People know now and this is the aftermath of all that.  Moreover, there was no other way.  I am not one of those who goes down the road of stating the Government should have found a different, easier or better way.  There was no such other way.  We have been there before, as this circumstance has been repeated many times previously.  However, it is so sad to see children with special needs, older people in difficult circumstances and others seeking and awaiting services.  This is very like the 1930s again, in that people are waiting for services that are taking so long to be delivered.  It is heart-rending to be obliged to look at the people concerned in such circumstances and to be able to do very little about it.</p><p>On the other hand, one often sees things and complains about one's ills and the fact that one does not have what one wants.  Often, one is better off than one thinks.  Many in society often are far better off than they think.  One can work oneself into a tizzy and a total and absolute depression by bringing more of it upon oneself.  I make this point simply because were people in Ireland to compare themselves with other European countries right across Europe, including some of the richest countries, they would find Ireland is not doing too badly.  I acknowledge it has not achieved the same efficiencies and has not achieved the delivery that some appear to have managed but in respect of GDP <i>per capita</i>, Ireland is not doing too badly.  This is a point people must recognise when they make comparisons with others.  Moreover, over the past couple of years people in this country have criticised some of our colleagues throughout Europe, allegedly on the basis that they have been punishing Ireland.  It is necessary to examine their own respective economies, as it should be noted they also punish themselves, which is a sad fact of life.</p><p>When economic implosion takes place, it undoubtedly affects everyone.  It affects the poorest worst of all but it affects everyone and some people to such an extent that they seek the only way out which they could think of, which also is a sad thing.  I wish to conclude on this point and refer again to discrimination, to which Deputy Stanton also made reference.  Moreover, many Members have tabled parliamentary questions relating to this subject matter which they follow from time to time.  Why should it be that teenagers, for example, seem inadequate to deal with discrimination of whatever nature such as bullying?  It appears to go on indefinitely in a vicious and incisive way to such an extent that the victims find they can only take one way out.  This is a sad flaw in our society and should not be happening at all.  Moreover, this has nothing to do with wealth or the lack thereof.  It pertains to a viciousness that is difficult to control when it takes off of its own accord - this has happened in the past both in this jurisdiction and others - to represent the ugly side of an evolving society.  Such unfortunate trends should be combated in a manner that is decisive and meaningful, without trampling on anyone's human rights.</p></speech>

The Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, an agency for the Irish Jesuit Province, publishes a very interesting magazine and while reading it over the last couple of days, I was greatly struck by a quote from Pope Francis's evangelical letter, <i>Evangelii Gaudiam</i>, the joy of the gospel.  In many ways, his comments are a fitting beginning for this Bill's starting point.  He speaks about the commodification of human beings and about all of us being put into that kind of commodification.  He states:<blockquote>[T]hose excluded are no longer society's underside or its fringes or its disenfranchised - they are no longer even a part of it.  The excluded are not the &quot;exploited&quot; but the outcast, the &quot;leftovers&quot;.</blockquote>Members are now beginning a second phase of this Bill's journey, following on from its pre-legislative scrutiny.  From the perspective of human rights and equality, the creation of the proposed new body is a goal and all Members must work collaboratively in this House to see the Bill enshrined, passed and in operation.  Moreover, Members will do this not as members of political parties or of none but as citizens operating under a Constitution that supposedly espouses equality and respect for all.  Members must promote and work towards protecting human rights at home and abroad.</p><p>I commend the Minister not just for this legislation but for his courage in standing up to tyranny abroad and to intolerance at home.  Other countries must look at their role and consider how they are espousing human rights and how they are failing to fulfil their international obligations to ensure equality.  </p><p> Let us look at what is happening in Uganda, Russia and in African countries where there are issues of inequality, lack of respect or lack of decency towards fellow human beings who are of LGBT persuasion or who are women or people of different ethnicities or religions.  One could make the point that the persecution of Christians in certain parts of the world needs to be addressed and challenged because if that were to happen in this country, those of us who are Christian would not stand for it and would be unequivocal in our desire to ensure it was stopped.  Intolerance of any kind cannot be condoned and allowed to go unchallenged.  We must all show respect by our actions rather than paying mere lip service to it.</p><p> The new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will be profoundly important.  As we develop and implement the rights of all citizens and as we strive to reach full equality for those of us who are LGBT and for all people, this commission will play a very important role.  I hope that public bodies will also pay due regard to their duties and obligations.  As Deputy Durkan said, it is hoped that they will strive to show that they respect human rights and equality and that this will be demonstrated in how they operate, in their use of language and by the delivery of their services.</p><p> I was struck by Deputy Niall Collins's comment that this was a dollar and dime Bill.  I was the Acting Chairman at the time so I was not permitted to interject or to heckle.  Those who criticise this Bill should consider the composition of the board of the commission.  I refer to the calibre of its membership.  I do not know all the members of the board but those I know, such as Sunniva McDonogh, Mark Kelly and Kieran Rose, are not puppets of a government or a Minister who will do the bidding of the Department of Justice and Equality or take orders from anyone else.  These are strong-willed people who have shown by their words and their actions that they stand for human rights and for equality.  Is it being said that these people are not independent or motivated by a desire to champion human rights and to ensure the full implementation of equality in our country?  Sometimes people oppose for the sake of opposing, just to grab a headline.</p><p> The Minister said in his concluding remarks that he was open to the Bill's being improved and amended.  We should not begin with the premise that the Bill is flawed because this is a Minister who has worked tirelessly to promote equality and human rights.  I was a proud member of the Constitutional Convention, which comprised 100 members, not least because we proposed many different reform measures, one of which relates to the constitutional provision on equality for civil marriage, as the Minister mentioned in his speech.  It is my hope that as we prepare for the referendum in 2015 we will have a debate that is positive, constructive, respectful and mindful of all the citizens of our country, no matter what their individual sexual orientation.  We deserve to have that debate in a manner that reflects the modern society in which we live.</p><p> The Minister is correct to address in his remarks his concern about the treatment in many parts of the world of people who are gay or lesbian.  I referred to Africa and Russia, but let us talk about North America, the bastion of freedom and democracy.  The way gay people are treated in certain parts of the United States leaves much to be desired.  Some of those politicians who profess to be Christian and who profess to support equality and to be against discrimination show by their language and their voting record that they are not fully behind the pursuit of equality and human rights for all the citizens of their country.</p><p> I ask the Government to raise at international forums, including at EU level and at the United Nations, the issue of the rights and freedoms of gay people which are being denied in many parts of the world today.  Are we to stand idly by as a series of regressive laws in many parts of the world permit discrimination, the suppression of human rights and the denial of equality?  Are we to stand idly by and say, &quot;It is fine; that is another continent, a different culture, a different ethos.&quot;?  What are we to say to a generation of young people who are looking at us if, as a Parliament or as a Government, we refuse to condemn or move to change what is happening in Uganda or Russia, where gay people can be killed or imprisoned and where one can be guilty by association?  Harvey Milk fought for freedom in the United States of America.  Many people across the continent of Africa are this day fighting for equality.  In our country we are now seeing the coming to fruition of the work to bring human rights and equality to the fore.  As the Minister said, this is at the core and the heart of what we do as a Government.</p><p> The Minister also referred to 38 countries where being gay is a criminal offence.  Thankfully, we changed the law in this country in 1993.  The Minister is correct when he affirms that there is no room for racism or discrimination in any part of the world.</p><p> I commend the Minister on the citizenship ceremonies for those who become Irish citizens.  One Sunday after the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, when walking past the Convention Centre, I saw hundreds of new citizens and their families, full of joy and full of life and vitality, being officially welcomed by their new homeland.  It was a wonderful sight.  </p><p> While canvassing this week I came across people from many different countries who want to vote and who want to participate in the local and European elections.  They know about their candidates and what they stand for.  They were aware of the differences between parties and policies.  They said to me at the doors, &quot;You did not push us away because we were from Poland.  You stopped and you asked us for our vote.&quot;  That is the type of Ireland we want, in which our new citizens can participate and where they feel they are welcome.  However, I have a concern about whether the integration strategy in many cities and towns has worked.  I wonder what is the view of the new Irish citizens or new immigrants.</p><p>What do they think about the Ireland they live in now?  What do the Irish people think about the new immigrants who come to our country?  It is important that this country has a debate on immigration and our new citizens, because we must have an integration strategy.</p><p> I want to pay tribute in the House to a group in Cork called Cois Tine, which operates under the direction of Fr. Angelo Lafferty, an SMA priest in Cork who does so much for integration.  He brings together people of all nationalities and ethnicities into a fantastic multi-faith cultural programme where we can all be embraced and feel welcome.  If we had the Cois Tine programme in many areas of our country, I do not believe we would have racism, and racist remarks made against people.  That happens in our country, and we cannot shy away from that.</p><p> I join Deputy Padraig Mac Lochlainn in his condemnation of the article by Brenda Power in today's paper, which was wrong in terms of the Traveller community and what it represents.  It fails to understand the ethos and the culture of the Traveller community.  There are some Travellers who transgress and break the law, and who must be held to account, but this week I had two young Traveller women in my office who were not violent, aggressive or badly dressed.  They did not speak badly.  They were like any woman I know.  They were concerned about their living conditions, their children's education and holding their family together.  They wanted a better life for themselves and their families.  What is wrong with that?  There is nothing wrong with that.  Those young women were no different from any mother I know.  The article by Brenda Power sent the wrong message.  Those of us who had the privilege of serving as chair of the Traveller accommodation committee in Cork City Council recognise that in many cases Traveller women who were empowered had empowered themselves for the betterment of their families, and their children in particular.  That is the reason the language we use is so important.</p><p> In welcoming the publication of the Bill to merge the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority I am very pleased that one of the first tasks of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, will be to review section 37 of the Employment Act.  As I stated recently in this House and also at other events, it is very important that section 37 of the Employment Act is changed because is causes a great deal of concern for LGBT teachers.  While it has never been tested in the courts, the exemption is at the very least a chill factor for many people, not just those of us who are gay and who worked in the classroom but for those working in religiously owned or controlled workplaces.  </p><p> In terms of this Government, we have seen the Ministers, Deputy Quinn and Deputy Fitzgerald, being very proactive in the areas of bullying and discrimination.  Our approach to bullying and discrimination must be consistent.  We cannot accept legislative provisions that potentially facilitate discrimination based on sexual orientation yet correctly ask those same teachers to prevent homophobic bullying.  There is an inconsistency in that policy that must be addressed, and I am hopeful this Minister will be the Minister to act on that.</p><p> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I commend the Minister for his progressive approach.  He will be judged as a reforming Minister.  A generation to come, a multiplicity of people will thank us for having Alan Shatter as Minister for Justice and Equality and for having a Government that puts human rights and equality at the forefront of its policies.  It will be wrong if we allow other countries to be regressive when we are so progressive.  We face a twin challenge, which I know this Government will address.</p></speech>

This is an important Bill to come before the House.  I listened to the various contributions made in this debate which were thoughtful, informative and important to air here.</p><p>  I want to raise a number of issue.  In dealing with human rights and equality we must examine all that is happening in our society.  Our country has made great strides forward with regard to rights and equality, and rightly so, but a number of issues and difficulties remain.  I welcome that the Minister is in the House to hear this contribution because over a continuous period and through his other role as a person of the legal profession, he will be aware on numerous occasions, including in recent weeks, judges have spoken out during cases about young people in particular coming before the courts who have mental health problems.  To be blunt, they are being brought to the wrong place.  We talk about equality and protection of people's rights, and I am delighted our country has made huge strides forward in dealing with people who have mental health issues.  Gone are the days when people had virtually no treatment.  Not too long ago the treatment people received was electric shock therapy.  That was a derogation of people's human rights but young people with mental health problems should not be coming before the courts because they should be taken care of in some other way, and I would like to see the Minister work on that in conjunction with the Minister for Health, and especially the Minister with special responsibility for mental health issues.  I rely on the Minister to examine that in a sincere way.  He will be aware of a case two weeks ago where a judge who had a young person before him demanded that the Health Service Executive come before his court the following week, and it was similar to the issue I raise, to explain the reason the person was being brought before the courts.  That is an important job to be undertaken and I would like the Minister to examine it.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan raised the issue of bullying.  There is no place in society for bulling, particularly bullying of our beautiful young people attending schools.  Cyberbullying, bullying by means of mobile phones and all of that was never an issue in the past but it is a horrible situation for young people to have to put up with.  We have seen the outcome of persistent and continued bullying, and it should not be tolerated in our society.  Our principals and teachers do their level best to try to tackle this problem but the horrible aspect of it is that it is a hidden practice.  In the past, if bullying was taking place in the classroom or in the schoolyard it was obvious because one could see it, but this is a hidden, sneaky way of getting at young people.  I was glad to hear Deputy Durkan speaking on that issue earlier but a great deal of thought, work and effort must go into trying to solve this problem because I would not like it to continue for the beautiful young children who will start school in September in all their innocence.  I do not want them to be subject to any type of bullying or abuse as they go through the school system.</p><p>  A major problem in this country, which we should not have because our country is so small, is the trafficking of people.</p><p>Since becoming Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter has tried to tackle the gangs that traffic people into this country.  Every effort must be made to put an absolute stop to this practice.  There is no worse type of abuse of a human being than trafficking, providing ill-gotten gains for a criminal gang.  I support the Minister in his fight against this awful practice.  With a country our size, we should not have any human trafficking.  It is different for larger countries with extensive borders which are difficult to fully police.</p><p> Wherever a person is from and whatever a person&rsquo;s religion, whether they have one or not, he or she is entitled to be treated with the utmost of respect.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="20:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800043#QQ00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  This Bill is an attempt to get the balance right with regard to planning and wind turbines.  Every public representative from the midlands is aware that the proposal for industrial-scale wind farms has generated massive debate and much opposition.  The proposed turbines are of a height and size never seen before in this country.  Many people are concerned by the prospect of large turbines being erected close to their homes, as well as the impact they would have on the landscape, tourism, agriculture and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives.  That is why there is a need for the robust regulations we outline in this Bill.  It is in that context I am introducing this Bill on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I hope it will be supported in moving to the next Stage, where it can form the basis of much-needed legislation in this area.</p><p>  All we have with regard to wind farms are guidelines, which are being updated.  I do not believe this is adequate given the many concerns about wind farms, especially in the context of the massive ones proposed for counties Laois, Westmeath and south Kildare.  The Government was supporting this development for the export of electricity in the absence of an overall energy policy that would properly plan the development of wind energy and other renewable energy sources.  The whole sector, however, is now driven by private companies rather than a coherent long-term strategy.  We clearly need planning regulations that are fit for purpose, and they should be mandatory rather than being voluntary or in the form of suggestions.</p><p>  With regard to set-back distances, the current guidelines recommend that turbines be placed no closer than 500 m from the nearest dwelling site.  That is not mandatory, however, and is very much dependent on the size of the turbine.  One key proposal in this Bill is that there should be a minimum set-back distance of ten times the height of the turbine.</p><p>  Section 4 sets out that all proposed wind farms must comply with and be consistent with county development plans and cannot be overridden by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  Wind farms must be located in areas zoned by local councillors.  This is crucial to the planning aspects of wind farm developments and was underlined by the recent departmental decision to overrule a decision by Westmeath County Council to enforce minimum set-back distances.</p><p>  The proposal to install massive industrial-scale wind farms in the midlands now appears to have been placed on hold, although the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, was somewhat vague when he appeared before the environment committee last week as to the likelihood of the project being revived.  The basis for the project was the memorandum of understanding between this State and Britain to export electricity to Britain.  Our Bill proposes that no such export contracts can be concluded until the State attains its own targets in electricity generated from renewable sources.  That also addresses a concern of the Irish Wind Energy Association in its submission to our Bill.  While the export of electricity from wind and other renewable sources has much potential for the country in the future, we ought surely to be reducing our own dependency on imported fossil fuels and addressing fuel poverty.  So far, we have seen no cost-benefit analysis as to whether export electricity generated from wind would be a viable option.  The Minister claims work has been done in this regard but I have not seen any of it.  There is also the feeling that the midlands will be used for industrial-scale wind farms that would not be tolerated in Britain.  This, in combination with the economic argument regarding the export of wind-generated electricity, has persuaded many people and whole communities to oppose the plans.  I suspect it has played no small part in the decision to put aside or postpone the proposal.</p><p>  Another issue dealt with in this Bill is consultation with local communities where it is proposed to site wind farms.  Too often, consultation really means that people are told what will happen while not having any power to amend or prevent what is proposed.  We saw this recently with the pylons issue, where a second round of consultations was set up - in effect, an admission that the first consultation process was inadequate.  The suspicion, however, is that the real reason for putting the pylons issue on the long finger until the local and European elections are over is to ensure the issue does not affect the chances of candidates from the government parties in those elections.  Many people are similarly suspicious that the midlands wind farm project will likewise be revived some time later in the year.  Will the Government clarify this?</p><p>  Section 5 provides that the specifications of all proposed wind farms will be well advertised in the local media and accompanied by detailed maps showing exactly where they are to be located.  The project managers would also be obliged to supply a report outlining all aspects of a wind farm project and its impact on the nearby community.  A public meeting would then be organised at which all people living within the set-back distance would be invited to voice their opinion, as well as being allowed to make written submissions.</p><p>  Other issues dealt with in the Bill include noise and shadow flicker.  There is some debate over the impact these have on people living in proximity to turbines.  We propose that shadow flicker should not pass over any dwelling.  We also propose that wind farm operators deposit a bond with the local authority, similar to that for developing housing estates, for dealing with any damage caused to roads and other infrastructure.</p><p>We need strict regulations also for the decommissioning of wind turbines at the end of their 20 year lifespan.  The operator at that time must be responsible for decommissioning.  We believe such regulations would go a long way towards addressing the concerns of local communities and ensuring wind farms were compatible with the interests and needs of local communities.  It is about getting the balance right.</p><p> I stress that neither Sinn F&eacute;in nor I is opposed to the development of wind farms as part of the replacing fossil fuels with renewable resources in the generation of energy.  We must move to renewable sources of energy.  However, there are questions about the current economic aspects of wind farms and the perception that the emphasis is being place on wind energy to the detriment of other renewable resources.</p><p> We have not explored the use of biomass sufficiently and seem to have moved away from the consideration of hydro energy.  We all know that none of these alone can provide the energy we need, but a wider view must be taken.  Solar energy must be considered.  There is a strong school of thought that the real dividend for this country, because of our location, will be from the use of tidal and wave power, but further development and research is required before its use can be progressed.  We can become a global leader with this technology and it has massive potential, can bring economic benefits and enable us to supply our own needs and those of neighbouring countries such as England, Scotland and Wales.</p><p> I urge all Deputies to support our Bill.  It may not be perfect and some may find fault with it, but we ask Deputies to support it as it is an honest attempt to provide regulations for what is coming.  We know from the past, particularly the housing boom, the problems that arise owing to the lack of regulation.  The absence of proper regulation, zoning and guidelines has meant the State made a bags of the boom.  We know the economic consequences of this and the planning consequences can be seen in the ghost estates in towns and villages throughout the State.  As a result of the economic consequences, people are coming into our constituency offices with problems owing to the fact they have been left with huge debts on houses that are now only worth a fraction of what they paid for them.  What we suggest is we must get the planning aspect and economic case for energy development right.  We must also take a broader view of how we can meet our alternative energy needs.  Our energy needs will not be met from one source.  The days of meeting our needs mainly through the use of coal, gas or oil are gone.  In the future we will have a tapestry of means of generating electricity, particularly in the renewables sector.  We must increase its development.  There will be little difference between political parties on this issue and all will agree that we must do this for economic and environmental reasons and to ensure we will have a sustainable economy and society for the future.</p><p> I urge Government Deputies and all others to support the Bill in order that it can proceed and be debated properly.  This is a debate we should have had two years ago, but what is happening is that we are following behind development, which is happening.  It is only because communities have stood up to speak out on this issue and suggested we take another look at it, only because people have protested, only because concerns have been raised throughout the State and only because the British Government has had second thoughts - I do not agree with its reasons for changing its mind - that we are getting this opportunity to reconsider.  I appeal to the Minister with responsibility for planning to ensure we take another look at this issue.  Let us go about this the right way and ensure we do not repeat the mistakes we have made in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-04-08a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="20:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800044#RR00200"><p>There is no need for any member of Sinn F&eacute;in to reiterate that this party and the broader republican movement stand for ownership and control of our natural resources by the people of Ireland.  We support the use of renewable energy.  Clearly, there is great potential for the use of wind energy on this small island, with the broad Atlantic stretching out from our western seaboard.  It is a massive resource and we should make best use of it for the benefit of the people.</p><p>  People all over the State are struggling with their utility bills and a responsible Government should be trying to relieve that burden.  It is a basic human right that people should be able to heat their homes, have hot water, adequate light and meet basic energy needs without financial strain.  The Government seems to think every aspect of human existence should be a source of profit for some private company.  It has set about dismantling any vestige of a welfare state and I would go so far as to say any trace of humanity in its dealings with vulnerable people.  It is charging for water, charging tolls on the roads, taxing our homes, imposing septic tank charges and privatising anything it can manage to privatise at full speed.</p><p>  This is combined with the sale, at knockdown prices, of our natural resources.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, signed an agreement with the British Government to export wind energy produced in Ireland to Britain.  This was happening, despite the fact that the State was so dependent on expensive fossil fuels.  The agreement with the British is said to have collapsed, but I wonder whether, after the forthcoming elections, we will see it being resurrected.  This venture, like many of the others proposed and, unfortunately, implemented, in some cases, by the Government, has unhappy consequences owing to the lack of regulation and forethought.  This area is badly in need of regulation, which is why Sinn F&eacute;in has introduced the Bill.</p><p>  So far, there is unbridled activity by private energy companies looking to erect wind turbines around the country.  The midlands, in particular, has been targeted for industrial turbines which are bigger and more intrusive than the turbines we are becoming used to seeing dotted all over the State.  Not far from where the Minister of State lives, in my county, in the Ballyhorgan-Lixnaw area, there is a proposal going through the planning process to erect ten turbines.  These turbines will be 510 ft high and in a valley between the Kilduff side of the mountain and back towards Kerry Head.  The irony is that at public meetings other elected representatives and I attended some backbench Deputies and councillors from the Labour Party and other parties agreed with what Sinn F&eacute;in was stating.  Therefore, if democracy is to prevail, the Labour Party, the Government and all backbenchers should agree with the Bill.</p><p>  The companies I have mentioned have sent their representatives, like carpetbaggers, around the midlands and other areas, with wads of cash in their pockets and contracts drawn up.  In times of economic hardship the lure of hard cash and the promise of more to come made many in rural communities prey to this hard sell.  Many of them now realise the full implications of the small print of the contracts they signed with companies, about which they still know very little, for the erection of turbines on their land.  The way this has been done has also damaged the harmony of many communities.  Families who have farmed side by side for generations are now at loggerheads over the erection of turbines.  This is often the way when new infrastructure is proposed and there are new innovations.  Sometimes people must be disturbed from their homes or land for the common good, but it is another story altogether when this is happening only to create profit for a private company and provide renewable energy for neighbouring countries.  That is the sad part of it.  If it was for our own people, we could say it was for the common good, but when it is for export by private companies, it flies in the face of the common good.</p><p>  It turns out that for some there are implications which they did not foresee regarding the use of land and their ability to sell it on or leave it to others unhindered by the contract.  There are some who signed with one entity and now find that their interest has been sold on to others.  The whole process has continued unhindered by proper, responsible regulation by the Government.  Others have signed contracts and now find they must get permission from the company to apply for planning permission to build houses for their sons or daughters on their own land.  This permission is often refused.</p><p>These companies are calling the shots and setting the agenda for the development of what should be a major State project, which should be designed for the benefit of the Irish people.  The harnessing of our wind energy should not be another asset to be sold off to the highest bidder so the banks can be paid off while ordinary citizen gets no use at all from it.  Any major development of industrial wind turbines should take place only after consultation with the local community and with community agreement.  It is not good enough that a company can throw in a sweetener in the form of some contribution to local facilities and expect the local people to accept the turbines when there is no proper, legally-binding obligation on the companies to look after them in the future.</p><p> When these companies, inevitably, pull out, who will be responsible for decommissioning the giant turbines?  Will they be left rusting on our hillsides, an eyesore for future generations to deal with due to lack of foresight in this generation?  In my area of interest, agriculture, there are concerns.  There is no need to spell out the importance of agribusiness to this country and our economy.  Many who are involved in livestock are concerned.  Horse breeders have specifically expressed their misgivings about this willy-nilly development of wind farms.  The thoroughbred industry in Ireland involves nearly 8,000 breeders and employs 14,000 people.  We cannot take the concerns they have expressed about turbines lightly.</p><p> The industry has called for the kind of regulation the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill sets out.  Set back distances not only from dwelling houses but also from stable yards must be established.  The industry has also called for a proper cost-benefit analysis for alternatives including offshore wind farms, and this makes sense.  My party colleague mentioned the opportunity to invest in wave, tidal and solar energy and to put wind turbines offshore.  That is how we should approach it, to minimise any disharmony it creates within communities and to ensure the benefits will be for the people of Ireland and not for private profiteers.</p><p> We cannot plan our energy strategy in the best interests of the Irish people if we allow private energy companies to rush ahead with schemes over which the Government has no control.  While local planning regulation might be effective on a case-by-case basis, this is no way to deal with such a major, national issue.  Renewable energy is a necessity, but must not be regarded as a product, a consumable to be produced for profit only.  We must harness it for the benefit of people and meet our renewable energy targets.  It should not be a priority to allow other countries to fulfil their renewable energy targets by imposing huge, industrial wind farms on the people of the midlands and other parts of the country when none of the energy to be generated will go into our national grid.  This area must be carefully regulated and an intelligent, sustainable energy strategy must be formulated which will be in our national interest now and for generations to come.</p><p> Over the years I have listened with great interest to policies proposed by the Minister's party and the former parties that are now part of the Labour Party, namely, Democratic Left, Sinn F&eacute;in the Workers' Party and the Workers' Party.  I have listened with great interest to what the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, said down through the years about the nationalisation of our energy and other aspects of our society for the common good.  However, when the Minister and the parties he belonged to through the years got power they reneged on everything they stood for regarding using our natural resources for the common good and the greater good of the Irish people.  I was part of a committee that tried to produce a report on our national resources, offshore energy etc. and I dug out what the Minister said at that time.  It was brilliant, revolutionary stuff.  He talked about the future, Ireland becoming self-sufficient and using the natural resources for the greater good and the common good of the people.  Unfortunately, he has left all that behind.  He and his party colleagues, some of whom came all the way from Official Sinn F&eacute;in to the Labour Party, have lost their way because they have been sucked in by the system and policies of future governments against which they had vehemently argued through the years.</p></speech>

I support the development of onshore and offshore wind energy when it is done in partnership with communities.  Climate change is a reality.  It is, and will continue to be, one of the most serious challenges faced by Ireland and the international community in the coming decades.  Climate change is causing thousands of deaths throughout the world, putting millions of people into poverty and forcing hundred of thousands of people to migrate.  It is the global threat.  It affects Ireland too and will continue to do so unless there is radical change in energy utilisation patterns.</p><p>  On a clement day such as today it is easy to forget that only a few months ago this country was gripped by a number of once-in-100-years storms in the space of a few months.  Climate change deniers are the flat-earthers of this generation.  The debate on the science has moved on; it is time to focus on solutions.  Fossil fuel must be rooted out of energy consumption.  The true cost of fossil fuel for the environment is not factored into the price of oil and coal.  The true cost of fossil fuel includes the damage climate change does.  It is happening all over the world.  This Government is reckless in its laggard efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's recent jobs plan detailed a number of ways we could kick-start the economy, create jobs and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  We could take a number of important steps, the first of which relates to energy conservation.  Our plan indicates how we could incentivise the private pension industry to invest &euro;3 billion and put up &euro;2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to create a green fund.  According to the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, the retrofitting of 500,000 houses with insulation would create energy savings of &euro;748 million per year when the houses were complete.  Over the period of ten years consumers could pay their bills as normal and the excess savings portion would be paid back to the green fund.  At the end of ten years energy bills could be reduced dramatically, homes would be warmer and reliance on fossil fuels would reduce, as would carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>  Our jobs plan also discussed the sequencing of investment in water infrastructure beginning with counties leading the unaccounted for water tables as provided by the local government services.  Ireland spends &euro;700 million, not including capital investment, each year to produce drinking water, yet 43% of this leaks from the system.  Although it takes large amounts of energy to process this water in the first place, the Government stands over a system that leaks nearly half of it out.  We also indicated methods whereby we could reduce the lead time for the necessary offshore wind projects.</p><p>We would mandate the ESB to develop an extra 300 MW of offshore wind energy in five years.  We also discuss the possibility of the construction of a full-scale open ocean test facility at Belmullet to move forward the development of wave energy.  These are costed and we have identified the source of funds to pay for them.  As a party we are committed to the development of renewable energy but we also see it as important not to put all our eggs in one basket.  Our energy must come from diverse sources, including offshore tidal, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal energy.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in is serious about climate change and we have put up the detailed policy proposals to prove that.  Crucially, we believe the strategies must not be imposed on local communities but rather implemented in partnership with those communities, especially when considering some of the radical plans that the Government has on offer.  This is a significant point.  Given the industrial size of the proposed wind turbines and the massive impact they will have on communities, along with the cack-handed manner in which this Government has handled the process until now, it seems that any goodwill towards sustainable energy in the country has been frittered away.  The possibility of even developing reasonable sustainable energy projects in this country is now far more remote, given the level of opposition created by the mess in which the Government has been involved.</p><p> We are talking about turbines which are 600 ft. high through the entirety of the midlands, including my own county.  They are without comparison in Ireland and Britain, located on farmland within 1 km of family homes.  There will be noise, flicker and a reduction in property values, including the value of homes.  Sales of homes in some areas, including my own county, have stopped because people are waiting to see if these plans go ahead.  People have been left in limbo in that regard.  Last year I was contacted by people from Ballinabrackey, Castlejordan, Ballivor, Raharney, Killucan, Delvin, Carlanstown and Loganstown about these proposed industrial-size turbines.  There are decent people with no ideological opposition to green energy who have become massively frustrated by the fact that they were not being listened to by the Government.</p><p> There is another significant issue concerning community acceptance of green energy models which the Government must consider.  This is the ownership model mentioned by my colleague Deputy Ferris.  Under the Government's proposals, large multinational investment companies would fund industrial-scale wind farms in rural landscapes and export that energy, leaving little behind except split communities and bad feeling.  That can be contrasted with the community-based model being developed in Germany and Denmark.  Much of the renewable energy production there is planned and owned by the local communities, and it is built around the needs of local communities, with size, shape and set-back to the design of local communities.  Both energy and profit is returned to local communities, so this is the model that the Government needs to promote.  However, that would mean empowering local communities, and the Government hardly has a track record in that area.</p><p> This Bill attempts to impose proper regulation on all aspects of wind turbine construction, including proper zoning of areas for wind turbine development, duties of planning authorities, set-back distance and responsibility for decommissioning of wind turbines.  The Bill seeks to impose a set-back distance ten times the height of a turbine from the dwelling where turbines are higher than 25 m.  There must also be clarity around land access and use for the farming community.</p><p> There is also an uncomfortable phenomenon which I should indicate to the Minister of State.  It is evident in my county and I am not sure if other Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la have seen it recently, as it harks back to the close relationship that once existed between Fianna F&aacute;il, property developers and banks in the last Administration.  A number of Fine Gael members and some elected representatives have formed a very close relationship in my own county with the multinational firms which seek to erect these industrial-sized wind turbines.  For example, some groups representing the communities have alleged that a Fine Gael councillor has used his office to frustrate the efforts of the local community in making representations.  Shockingly, community concerns have been completely ignored by Fine Gael on the ground and by this Government today.  It is unbelievable that the only saving grace for these communities is a possible disagreement between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats in Britain regarding the development of energy sources.</p><p> I ask the Government to think long, hard and very seriously about local communities and what it is like to live on farmland - where previous generations have lived - only to see the landscape altered radically with a turbine 600 ft. high placed within 1 km of one's home.  It is a shocking position for any family.  These people may also have to deal with possible sound effects, including lower frequency sounds that may not necessarily be heard during the day but that people may feel going through their bodies at night.  There is also the issue of flicker and difficulties in selling homes.  We know there are approximately 150,000 people in the country in mortgage distress, with many trapped in homes by negative equity and an inability to pay down mortgages.  We should consider how many other people will be trapped in homes if they have no chance of selling their houses.  Much research has been carried out in the midland counties, including my county of Meath, which indicates that people seeking to purchase a house will not do so if the property is next to a turbine.  Would the Minister of State seek to purchase a house within 1 km of a turbine that is 600 ft. high?</p></speech>

I appeal to the Minister of State to do all in her power to ensure the Government listens to communities on the ground.</p></speech>

I strongly agree with the Bill's general principles and particularly the proposed set-back distance for the construction of wind turbines contained in section 6 and the enhanced role of county development plans.  Section 2 is an opportune provision in light of the ongoing discussions about the energy industry in the UK.  I agree with the recognition that energy produced in the jurisdiction should only be exported in circumstances in which there is an excess.  Equally, the extensive provision in section 4 for proper public consultation is also a very important part of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.</p><p>  The explanatory memorandum refers to the Bill's having been introduced in response to proposed developments in Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, Kildare and Meath, and its focus is inherently on onshore developments.  I am aware of the strong concerns of residents in those areas and surrounding counties and am equally concerned about these proposals and their impact on residents and communities.  Some of my constituents oppose offshore wind farm developments across the eastern seaboard and particularly in Dublin Bay, as there is great concern that the bay will be turned into an industrial landscape.</p><p>  On 7 February the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, finally published the offshore renewable energy development plan, which had been in draft form since 2010.</p><p>We should have a further chance in this House to discuss wind energy.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for giving us this opportunity.</p><p> In a debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, last February I raised my particular concerns on behalf of constituents in Dublin about the proposed Dublin array.  The proposal consists of 145 turbines between 5 km and 10 km off the coast of Dublin and Wicklow.  This follows permission given by Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers, the former Deputies Noel Dempsey and Frank Fahey, in the period to 2006 under the archaic Foreshore Act 1933 for 200 turbines off Bray Head and 520 MW of wind turbines off Arklow.  According to environmental groups such as Coastal Concern Alliance, by the end of 2006, 1,620 MW had been approved off County Wicklow.  The striking aspect of those 99-year leases is that those on the Arklow Bank and Codling Bank were fairly quickly sold on in 2008 by the promoters, Airtricity and Treasury Holdings.  They took their profit and got out.</p><p> I made a submission to the public consultation on the Dublin array in June 2013 in which I queried the stark environmental and landscape impact of 145 giant wind turbines.  Location is key to wind generation.  If the wind turbines offshore were at the minimum distance suggested by Coastal Concern Alliance, 22 km or more, there would be no problem.  Likewise, if inland locations do not impinge on communities or on a glorious landscape, there is no problem.  Most of us support renewable energy, as the promoters of this Bill do.  Location is the key and that is what we need to deal with firmly.</p><p> I hope that after tonight's debate the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, who is responsible for the maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill, will come to the House to let us discuss it fully and carry on the discussion that Sinn F&eacute;in has started tonight about wind turbines.  Let us have a proper and good discussion.</p></speech>

They are targets the Labour Party has long advocated.  I thank Deputies Stanley, Ferris and Colreavy for introducing this Bill.  My colleagues Deputy Penrose and Senators Kelly and Whelan have previously published proposals similar to many of those in the Bill being debated tonight.</p><p>  It is timely in light of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and indeed recent political turmoil in key oil and gas-producing regions that we take the opportunity this evening to discuss Ireland's transition to more renewable forms of energy such as wind - but not exclusively wind - in order to achieve greater national self-sufficiency as well as meeting our international commitments on climate change.</p><p>  The development of renewables, including wind energy, is at the heart of the Government's energy policy.  The availability of indigenous, sustainable power is a valuable national asset and is vital for achieving energy security, emissions reductions and economic renewal through job creation.  The development of the wind sector in Ireland is subject to the planning code in the same manner as other developments.  Local authority development plans are required to achieve a balance in harnessing the wind energy resources of the planning authority's area in a manner that is consistent with proper planning and sustainable development.  Planning authorities must have regard to my Department's wind energy development guidelines, which were published in June 2006.  They provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan and development management processes.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.</p><p>  As many here are aware, I commenced a public consultation in December of last year on proposed draft revisions to the existing 2006 wind energy development guidelines, focusing specifically on the issues of noise, set backs and shadow flicker.  These draft revisions propose the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments, a mandatory minimum set back of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and the complete elimination of shadow flicker.  In order to ensure an evidence-based approach to this issue, the acoustics consultancy Marshall Day, which has previously assisted the Australian and New Zealand Governments in their reviews of wind energy, was commissioned to prepare a study on wind noise, which was a significant input into this review.</p><p>  The Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period and these will be an important input into the final version of the guidelines, which I hope to be in a position to publish by quarter 3 of this year.  This was the second public consultation the Department conducted on these guidelines, as an initial consultation was held in February 2013, when I originally announced my review.</p><p>  In respect of renewable energy export, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is preparing a renewable energy policy and development framework, which will be underpinned by a strategic environmental assessment.  This involves a three-stage consultation process.  The stage 1 consultation, which involved the publication of stage 1 information and summary documents, ran in November of last year, and gave all interested parties an opportunity, at the outset, to present their views on how we should develop national policy to realise the opportunity to trade renewable energy with other EU member states and, in the first instance, with the United Kingdom.  Almost 1,400 responses were received to the consultation across a range of sectors.</p><p>  In order to complete stage 1 of the development of the framework, taking into account the feedback received, the strategic environmental assessment scoping report is being prepared.  The process will then move to stage 2 with the publication of the scoping report for public consultation in the coming weeks.  National press advertisements and updates on the Department's website will inform all stakeholders of the commencement of the stage 2 consultation.  During stage 2, a report on the stage 1 consultation will also be published, providing an overview of the consultation process, feedback and analysis.  During stage 3, the draft policy, the environmental report on which the strategic environmental assessment will be based and the Natura impact statement on which the appropriate assessment will be based will all be published and a public consultation will provide all stakeholders with a further opportunity to contribute to, or make observations on, the development of the framework.</p><p>  I think I have demonstrated that this Government, in implementing its policies on renewable energy, has striven to ensure that communities are being consulted on the development of the regulatory mechanisms for such developments.</p><p>  I will now turn to the specific aspects of the Deputies' Bill, starting with section 2 on excess product and the memorandum of understanding between Ireland and the UK on co-operation in the energy sector.  This is an area that falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  I understand that the Minister briefed the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on this issue last week.  Officials from his Department and the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change are examining the outcome of the recent London summit between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister on the renewable energy export policy framework.  It is clear, however, that key policies and regulatory design decisions still remain to be taken by the UK Government, which means that both sides are still a considerable distance from settling on the specifics of what the Irish Government and the renewable generators believe must be the basic components of any intergovernmental agreement.  I also understand that a cost-benefit analysis is nearing completion on the proposed project, which, among other things, considers aspects of the matters set out in section 2 of the Deputies' Bill.</p><p>  On section 3 of the Bill, which requires the location of proposed wind turbines to be identified in county development plans, I advise colleagues that this matter is already addressed in the existing wind energy development guidelines, which recommends that development plan maps should identify the key areas within the planning authority's functional area where there is significant wind energy potential and where, subject to criteria such as design and landscape planning, natural heritage and environmental and amenity considerations, wind energy development will be acceptable in principle.  In addition, many local authorities have also produced local authority renewable energy strategies, which address this issue in considerable detail.  While larger wind farms that meet the criteria for designation as strategic infrastructure may be submitted directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the board will still have regard to local authority county development plans when determining whether a proposed development is in a suitable location.</p><p>  In regard to section 4 of the Bill on public consultation, proposed wind developments are subject to the same requirements set out in planning regulations for public notice, including site notices, as other proposed developments.  The Department is conducting a review of its 2007 development management guidelines, and planning regulations and public consultation and notice requirements will be one of the matters under consideration.</p><p>The 2006 wind energy development guidelines also emphasise the importance of public consultation at the earliest possible stage.  It is strongly recommended that the developer of a wind energy project should engage in active consultation and dialogue with the local community at an early stage in the planning process, ideally prior to submitting a planning application.  The developer should work with the local community on the format of any future consultation to allow for the free flow of information between the community and the wind energy developer at all stages in the project.  Consultation should be meaningful and should give the local community an opportunity to comment on and input into the planning and design of the scheme.  It should also be noted that an environmental impact assessment is mandatory for wind energy developments that have more than five turbines or will have a total output greater than 5 MW.  An EIA will also be required if the planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, considers that the development would be likely to have significant effects on the environment.</p><p>I will now address the sections of the Bill that deal with noise limits, shadow flicker and set back distances.  As I have already stated, I am proposing to address the issue of noise control through a more stringent absolute noise limit for both day and night of 40 dB for future wind energy developments.  This limit takes into account the World Health Organisation's findings on night time noise.  The proposed draft revisions to the wind energy guidelines also provide for the complete elimination of shadow flicker for dwellings in the vicinity of wind turbines.  The draft guidelines are proposing a mandatory set back of 500 m for amenity considerations.  It is important to emphasise that this set back is not proposed as a noise control measure.  In its noise study, Marshall Day acoustics consultants recommended that an absolute noise limit be strongly considered as a noise control method rather than set backs.  On the issue of set backs, Marshall Day stated: <blockquote>the relationship between distance from a wind turbine or wind farm and noise effects is significantly variable, and there is little means of future proofing when specifying minimum set back distances.  In this respect, set backs therefore have the potential to either over-protect or under-protect wind farm neighbours.  It is therefore recommended that set backs are not used as a control method.</blockquote>I acknowledge, however, that set backs have been raised in a number of submissions to my Department.  The relationship between the height of wind turbines and their distance from dwellings is an issue that will require further consideration.</p><p>I would also like to address sections 9 and 10 in regard to bonds and decommissioning.  Conditions requiring the lodgment of financial bonds have been used in the past to ensure that decommissioning takes place in a responsible manner.  However, the use of long-term bonds to secure satisfactory reinstatement of a site upon cessation of a project puts an unreasonable burden on developers given the long time span involved in wind energy developments.  The recycled value of the turbine components, particularly copper and steel, should more than adequately cover the financial costs of decommissioning.  Accordingly, the use of long-term bonds is not recommended in the wind energy development guidelines.  The guidelines do, however, address the decommissioning of a wind energy development once electricity ceases to be generated.  Plans for decommissioning should be outlined at the planning stage, including restorative measures, the removal of above ground structures and equipment, landscaping and reseeding roads.</p><p>Wind energy is a rich natural resource which is vital for our energy security, regional employment and economic development, as well as for meeting our climate change commitments.  It is important that we also recognise the considerable potential for employment in rural Ireland from the construction and operation of wind farms.  We need to ensure that local communities are not adversely affected by such developments, while also avoiding excessive planning requirements that could impact on the future development of the wind industry in Ireland.  These are issues which I and my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will be giving serious consideration to over the coming months.  It is important that we have an honest discussion on these issues to ensure we do not lose sight of the economic needs of communities in rural Ireland.  While certain aspects of this Bill could place overly onerous restrictions on the wind industry, the Government does not intend to oppose it on Second Stage on the basis that we are currently considering some of the issues arising.  However, the Government will also need to consider the outcomes of the consultation processes on the wind energy development guidelines and the renewable energy policy and development framework as the Bill progresses and it is important that we do not pre-empt the outcome of these important public consultations.</p><p>I thank the Deputies opposite for publishing the Bill and ensuring that the House is able to debate this important issue.  The proposal follows on from similar initiatives by Deputy Willie Penrose and Senator John Kelly.  I commend Deputy Penrose on the extensive research he has carried out on this issue.  The production of Private Members' Bills on wind energy makes abundantly clear the strong interest that exists in this House, and in the wider community, in achieving a dynamic renewable energy sector that respects local communities.  Achieving this balance is the fundamental role for the Government in this debate.  Through our ongoing work on the planning guidelines, we can strike that balance in a transparent and fair manner.  That said, I fully appreciate the views of Members who advocate for a legislative approach and therefore I will not be opposing the Bill.</p></speech>

However, certain companies appear to be taking a heavy handed approach in advance of the new regulations.  The Minister of State has outlined a number of positive measures in that regard.  In respect of the aforementioned project in County Carlow, the company concerned is attempting to start work prior to the introduction of the new planning guidelines because the current guidelines allow it to proceed in the absence of consulting extensively with affected communities.  In doing this, the company is splitting communities.  Old Leighlin is a small and tight knit community but people are taking to opposing sides of the fence on this project.  If the guidelines were already in place this issue would not have arisen.  The new regulations should treat projects consistently.  A methodology should be developed to replace the current process, which can be unfair.  It is essential that communities are brought along with projects if we are to reach our targets and harness the great natural resource of wind energy.  I am disappointed that certain parties are using this issue for political gain in advance of the local and European elections.  That is unnecessary because the issue affects every party and none.  Issues arising should be dealt with in a fair and honest manner.  Companies need to be brought on side so that everybody is treated fairly.</font></p><p><font color="#222222">  I ask the Minister of State to review the current system and put on hold all proposed planning applications until the new guidelines are in place.  The new guidelines are welcome but there is some way to go on them.  It is encouraging that a number of suggestions have been made on improving them but an issue that has been missed thus far is devaluation of adjoining properties.  Owners of land on which turbines are constructed will be compensated but their neighbours may get nothing even though their properties are devalued.  That issue needs to be addressed in a forthright manner.  It is important that everybody is treated fairly and equitably.</font></p><p><font color="#222222">  It is also important that the new guidelines are implemented at the earliest opportunity.  The consultation process has been reasonably good but we need to up the ante because the 7,500 submissions that have already been received give an indication of the extent of the public's concerns.  I welcome that the Minister of State has expressed her willingness to take on board all the views that are expressed so that we can have a fair and equitable process.</font></p></speech>

This is a common-sense approach.  I am glad to see that politics has changed under the Government as compared with the previous regime which opposed every good idea from the Opposition.</p><p>  It is welcome that proposals for giant wind farms have been shelved as there were grave concerns among community groups.  As someone who lives in a rural part of the country and comes from a rural constituency that was to be affected by these giant industrial wind turbines, I also had grave concerns.  We have all attended a large number of public meetings on this topical issue and, as most people in the midlands will be aware, they have been highly emotional in halls and other venues which have been packed to capacity.  I agree that public concerns must be taken on board.  We have not received the factual information sought at these meetings on health and safety issues, although the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has been helpful tonight.  She has allayed some concerns and fears and been frank in answering some of the queries raised.</p><p>  We have seen many detailed reports that wind turbines cause more annoyance than road, rail and aircraft noise at equivalent sound levels.  &quot;Annoyance&quot; in this context is something which causes stress and ill health.  There is strong evidence which identifies that children and young people with autistic spectrum disorder are particularly vulnerable to wind turbine noise and visual effects.  The effects of wind turbine noise on sleep and health are being or will be investigated by the governments of Japan, Canada and Australia.  All of these jurisdictions have provided for set-back distances greater than those permitted in Ireland under the current legislation and in the 2004 planning guidelines which were introduced by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  We have not been given concrete information on what is factual and incorrect.  It is a pity the companies advocating for the provision of wind turbines have not been more forthcoming with information for local communities.  They had golden opportunities at community meetings to express their views fairly, but none of them turned up.  They did not come to face the public and give their side of the argument.</p><p>  Another issue is that we are still working on the basis of the 2004 planning guidelines when the turbines proposed at the time were less than half the size of the industrial-scale turbines now being proposed.  Industrial-scale wind turbine development should not be allowed on open farmland.  It is claimed it could affect the rearing of livestock and the breeding, raising and training of thoroughbred horses.  Any turbine greater than 25 m should not be allowed within 2 km of a house, if it would impact on people's daily lives.  This needs to be avoided.  People buy their homes to live in and spend most of their time in them and it is unfair to cause significant disruption.</p><p>  A further issue that is constantly raised at meetings on wind farm developments throughout the country is that the chairman of EirGrid stated in December 2013 that he would not like to live beside a pylon.  That issue was never adequately addressed and it is still a problem.  Given that the chairman of that body was not happy with the type of proposal being made, where do we stand on it?  As politicians, we have to be accountable to communities as they are the ones who elect us to implement the will of the people.</p><p>  A major issue of concern is the failure of companies to adequately inform communities of their long-term plans. This has caused serious problems.  From the outset, the lack of balanced and factual information from the energy companies proposing the midlands wind energy export scheme has caused genuine anguish within communities.  Exaggerated claims such as the promise by one company of 55,000 jobs and that the development of wind farms is linked with a decrease in house prices have caused the public to question the accuracy and credibility of the information with which they are being provided.  Communities only became aware of proposed developments through word of mouth and newspaper articles rather than through departmental channels or representatives of the development companies.  That was despite the fact that landowners in the communities concerned had already signed binding option agreements.  I am disappointed that there was little or no community consultation by the green energy companies to debate the facts and address the genuine concerns of the public on this issue.  </p><p>  I welcome the debate which is of the utmost importance.  I am glad that the Government has shown common sense and shelved the idea until proper planning guidelines are put in place.</p></speech>

Joking aside, there are many communities the length and breadth of the country that are very concerned about the future development of wind energy projects.  Many communities have seen wind energy projects successfully developed in recent years and it must be said also that many within these communities are concerned about the development of these wind farm in relation to flicker, noise etc.  Last year Deputy Michael Colreavy and I spent one day on wind farms in Cavan.  We went through what was happening on them in terms of the height of the turbines and the issues to do with sub-stations to transfer the energy created.  It is all very fine to say the future is renewable energy and that this is a cheap and economic way of producing energy, but there are a number of issues to be addressed.  </p><p>  The one about which I am constantly concerned is the comments made by Mr. Colm McCarthy on the future economic viability of wind energy production.  In recent months we saw a television programme on what the Germans were doing; they were withdrawing from wind energy generation.  There is a concern that we are moving headlong into it.  There are many communities that I have met, particularly in the midlands, which are very concerned about the proposal to develop wind farms solely to produce energy for the export market.  There is a lot of angst about this proposal.  What they are most angry about is the height of the turbines to be built.  The available technology has advanced and the new turbine is hugely superior to what was being proposed even three, four or five years ago.</p><p>  Some counties have been looking at their county development plans and, because of the scientific analysis, have drawn up maps of where wind farms should be located, indicating the most advantageous areas for their development, but there is an issue about the generation of wind energy close to communities.  In the recent past there have been many articles about how rural communities that have served all facets of society extremely well for generations and about how we are moving towards greater urbanisation.</p><p>There is an issue of how we will sustain our rural communities.  If the projects being proposed are deemed to be suitable for wind energy, we must remember proposals in the late 80s and early 90s for dual carriageways before we built motorways.  Where there were proposals for a road here or a corridor there, the areas were effectively sterilised for a generation because of the proposals in county development plans.  There is a concern that going down the route of having designated areas for wind farms or wind energy means areas will be sterilised for one-off houses or development within communities to allow young people to settle down, raise families and maintain the viability of rural communities.  It is an urgent issue and I have constantly challenged planners on it.  </p><p> I am glad the Government is not opposing the legislation because we need an honest debate about it.  As Deputy Stanley said, if we were not so close to election time I wonder whether the Bill would be opposed.  We will take the Government at its word.  We need a major debate.  It would be good to get an absolute definition of the word &quot;consultation&quot;.  In the EirGrid pylons debacle, the organisation said it had consulted with the communities.  It put up a notice saying that two or three of its officials would be in the community centre or in a hotel room for three or four hours.  This might be between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on a Tuesday or Wednesday, a working day, so people cannot get to the meeting.  Proper consultation involves sitting down and listening to the concerns.  Who will live alongside wind turbines?  Are we saying it is wind turbines or people?  It is a fundamental issue.  Turbines can be put in uninhabited areas but they should not be put in areas where people live.  We have seen the policy developed across Europe, and many countries can tell us how to do this.  We are rushing into it and it is important to get it right rather than foist wind turbines upon communities for the sake of conforming to renewable energy targets.</p><p> We must have proper consultation and a listening process.  We have not had that in respect of wind turbines, when the process has been back to front.  Many people in the community are genuinely concerned, as are the public representatives, about the future of their communities if turbines are foisted upon them.  Many communities have accepted smaller turbines and successful wind farms over the past number of years.  Community groups have been involved through co-operatives but only at the planning stage.  It is important to consider all aspects of this to ensure buy-in in the community.  It is not a question of funding local communities through different projects, which can be construed in another way.  The debate needs to be open and needs an honest assessment of  people's fears and concerns.</p></speech>

When preparing my notes to speak on the Bill, I watched the news.  Today is an historic day.  It is the first official State visit by an Irish President to the UK.  It is the first official visit by an Irish President to meet the Queen of England.  It is the first official address by an Irish President to a joint sitting of the House of Commons and House of Lords.  It is an historic day and a sign of the maturing relationship between Ireland and our nearest neighbour.  Everybody on all sides of the island and on both islands appreciates the significance of it.  Then we see the topic under discussion during Private Members' business, which is legislation from Sinn F&eacute;in to ban the exportation of Irish wind energy to the United Kingdom.  I ask Members to think about that.  Everyone agrees that this is an historic day, but Sinn F&eacute;in, being what it is, does not fully agree with what is going on.  Its members are here to prevent normalisation of trade between Ireland and the UK.  I agree with Sinn F&eacute;in on aspects of wind energy, but introducing legislation designed specifically to prevent the export of electricity to the UK says a lot about the party.</p><p>  We should also ask what other action Sinn F&eacute;in took today.  The President of Ireland is addressing the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  Is Sinn F&eacute;in present?  Its Members are in this House and in the Northern Ireland Assembly and they draw their salaries and expenses here and in the North.  While their members draw expenses from the House of Commons, will they be present to meet the President of Ireland?  No, they will not, because there is still a deep-rooted hostility on the part of Sinn F&eacute;in to normal activity in regard to people in England.  That must be put in context.  I would not have a problem having a detailed debate on the merits of wind energy, exporting wind energy and the scale of wind energy projects.  Admittedly, Martin McGuinness is attending the banquet this evening, but Sinn F&eacute;in refused to participate in events when the Queen visited this country a few years ago.  I am pleased that Sinn F&eacute;in is beginning to mature, but it has quite a bit to go.  It will always take a particular populist stance and colour it by wrapping the flag around it to say it is anti-British.  That is fine, as that is the market for Sinn F&eacute;in, but most people in Ireland have moved on from that narrow view.  Introducing legislation to ban trade with one country is a narrow view of how we should be progressing.  That is the political backdrop to why we are here.</p><p>  I welcome the legislation in that it has some good points.  If the Bill moves to Committee Stage and Report Stage, Fianna F&aacute;il will table substantial amendments based on its recently published policy.  If that happens, we hope the Government and Opposition parties will accept our amendments.  The planning guidelines in the area should be put on a statutory footing, which should be included in this legislation.  There should be community ownership of wind farms, which should be included in this legislation.  Wherever the wind farms are being sited, a local authority or another body should create the opportunity for gains and profits to be shared with the community.  That body should be able to prevent the sale of the wind farms to a foreign investor, such as a pension fund in Tokyo or Ottawa, without community involvement at local level.</p><p>  The legislation should be improved by having a stronger emphasis on offshore wind farms.  We are an island nation and we get our wind from the oceans and the seas.  That is where the Irish natural resource of wind is at its strongest.  Fianna F&aacute;il has set the most practical and correct distance for wind turbine set back from residential buildings.  The Government proposes 500 m, but that is too short given that some wind turbines have tip heights of 186 m.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes ten times that, up to 2 km, but that means there will never be a wind farm on the island of Ireland.</p><p>There are adequate and suitable wind farms in proper locations around the country, away from residential properties and businesses.  There is one quite near me under construction.  One can see it from the main road but one has quite a distance to drive before one gets near it.  There are no houses in the area and it is in the middle of a bog at the back of a forest.  That is a good location.  Sinn F&eacute;in policy would oppose all wind turbines on the basis that there should not be anything within 2 km of anything else.  We have come forward with the proposal that the distance should be approximately six times the height, which would be approximately 1 km.  Coincidentally, that is halfway between what the Government is proposing, which is unacceptable, and what Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing, which is essentially saying it does not want any wind turbines at all.  We propose a proper sensible approach and we ask people to follow that.  We have detailed proposals on noise and shadow flicker, which we ask to be incorporated in the Bill.</p><p> Another aspect of the Bill on which I welcome discussion relates to strategic infrastructure.  The Bill proposes that not all applications should be referred immediately to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  One of the reasons for the debate is the excessive scale of the midlands project.  It would denude the countryside and prevent the building of many houses in rural areas in the future due to the proposed building of wind turbines.  Such a step would have a long-term effect and depopulate a rural area.  For that reason we consider the project to be excessive, over the top and unviable.  The two projects should not go ahead.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act should only be for Irish infrastructure; it should not be for private companies to use for their advantage for export-led projects.</p></speech>

What is required is a reasoned and truthful debate.  Let us remember the so-called debate EirGrid had with many hundreds of thousands of people in its effort to half-con people over pylons.  There was very little consultation.  As a matter of fact, it was awful.</p><p>  I welcome the Bill.  As it states, it is an attempt to impose proper regulation on all aspects of wind turbines, from their construction to where they are situated.  That is part of proper zoning, which is very important.  I will leave Sinn F&eacute;in to defend itself, but what Fianna F&aacute;il said about the export of electricity generated from wind energy was incorrect.</p></speech>

They said they would have no problem with exporting energy once we became self-sufficient in energy.  That is a reasonable aspect of the Bill and I do not have a problem with it.</p><p>  There are pros and cons to wind energy and we should wise up to that in the debate.  Wind energy is green energy and there is potential for enormous power from wind, 20 times more than what the entire human population needs.  Wind energy is renewable and green, but there are also disadvantages.  Experts say that wind is unpredictable and the availability of wind energy is not constant.  Cost is another disadvantage, although the costs are coming down.</p><p>  There are many wind farms in the United States and it is estimated that there are fatalities among the bird population of up to 500,000 per year.  We should be careful in that regard.  There is also a problem with noise and shadow effect.  I have seen it in certain areas.  There is nothing worse than having a shadow falling over one&rsquo;s house 24 hours a day.  I must conclude in order to allow Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan to speak.  I support the Bill and I hope there will be a reasoned debate on it in the coming months and years.</p></speech>

Prior to an election it does not tell people what it really thinks and then after the election it can ram things down their throats and tell them they are criminals if they try to do something about it, and they will forget about it until the next election.  It makes me wonder if we would be better off if we had an election every year in this country, as then the people would be listened to.</p><p>  We will hear what will happen with water charges after the election.  The Government is consulting on pylons and it will tell us the result after the election.  We will be told that natural heritage area, NHA, bogs are all right and we will all be fine until after the election.  The reason I say that is that I have experience in this area.  Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony, for example, said before the election in 2011 that people should go ahead and cut their turf, but within three weeks of the election - the cock had not even crowed - the terms that were being used about us were &quot;bad citizens&quot; and &quot;criminals&quot;.  Now the people have woken up to the fact that the Government plays this game.  When I was out canvassing for the elections to the European Parliament today someone suggested - I had suggested it myself previously - that it is quite popular to look for world peace.  I wonder will the Government promise it after the election because it thinks it might get some votes.</p><p>  The core issue is that people should be consulted and if they want it they will get it and if they do not want it they will not get it.  The Government&rsquo;s tactic - in fairness, the previous Government did the same itself - is called DAD: decide, act and defend.  It does not give a damn what people think.  The people in the Taoiseach's constituency in Mayo are wise to him and they are awake.  Fair dues to the people in the midlands; they have seen through it.  They were nailed on the turf in the past and they are awake.  The awakening is coming.</p></speech>
