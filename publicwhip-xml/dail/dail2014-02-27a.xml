I ask the Minister to expand on that statement and to outline the change in his relationship with that office now.  I also ask him to state whether he has minutes of his meetings with the confidential recipient since his appointment.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700003#A00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p><p>  I was surprised that Deputy Collins raised this matter because it is my recollection that approximately one week prior to me relieving Mr. Connolly of his position, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said that his position was untenable and I had presumed that Deputy Collins agreed with that.</p><p>   I detailed in the D&aacute;il yesterday my reasons for relieving the confidential recipient of his duties.  The background to this matter is as follows.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, made under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, provide for the appointment of an independent confidential recipient.  The independent confidential recipient was designed to enable members of the force and civilian support staff to report, in confidence, instances where they believe there may be corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mr. Oliver Connolly was appointed as confidential recipient with effect from 18 July 2011 for a three year period.  The appointment followed the required consultation with the Garda Commissioner, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda representative associations and the trade unions or staff associations representing civilian staff.</p><p>  Rumours were circulating for some time regarding the existence of an alleged tape and transcript of a confidential conversation between Mr. Connolly and Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  Given the importance of the office's confidentiality, no Minister for Justice and Equality could properly seek out such a transcript or tape.  However, following an alleged extract from the alleged tape being placed on the D&aacute;il record, I asked my Department to contact Mr. Connolly outlining my concerns that if the conversation as reported had taken place, then his actions had undermined the office of the confidential recipient.</p><p>  Contacts with Mr. Connolly over the following two weeks did not satisfy me as to his response to the controversy.  I wrote to him on 19 February 2014 and informed him that, in the context of his failure to unequivocally repudiate the content of the alleged conversation or take the necessary action to restore public confidence in the office of confidential recipient, I believed his position was untenable and I had no alternative but to relieve him of that position.</p><p>  I have publicly said that I do not believe the office of confidential recipient and the legislation applicable to it is fulfilling the objective for which it was established.  I have stated my intention to abolish the office and to enable members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who allege misconduct within the force to have their complaints considered and addressed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The Cabinet has agreed in principle that an appropriate amendment to the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 should be prepared to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to be prescribed under that Bill as a body to which disclosures may be made by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  Interim arrangements will be made to fill the post of confidential recipient by the appointment of a retired judge.  Every effort will be made to expedite the necessary consultation process so that the appointment can be made as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700003#A00800"><p>The Minister did not tell us whether minutes are kept in his Department of any meetings that he has had with the confidential recipient and I ask him to address that question.  The Minister has also not addressed the fundamental issue here.  What is contained in the transcript is not disputed by anybody, including by the Minister himself, but the Minister asked the confidential recipient to deny what he has said.  Mr. Connolly said what he said and obviously he is standing over what he said to Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the Minister has removed him on that basis.  That points to a very peculiar situation that the Minister is not addressing in terms of the comments that the confidential recipient made to Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  In any event, I will be asking the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to invite Mr. Oliver Connolly before it.  Does the Minister support that proposal?</p><p> My colleague, Deputy John McGuinness, yesterday raised the issue of another Garda whistleblower to whom he has spoken and raised directly with the Minister her dealings with the confidential recipient.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Has he spoken to the confidential recipient about it or has he knowledge or detail in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700004#B00200"><p>I will take the Deputy's questions in reverse order.  My only knowledge of the issue raised by Deputy McGuinness is what he said in this House yesterday and on "Morning Ireland" on RTE radio this morning.  I do not have any knowledge of the matter.</p><p>  I do not have knowledge of conversations that a confidential recipient has with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The essence of the office, as it was established when the Deputy's party was in Government, is that conversations take place between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the appointed confidential recipient in confidence.  My only knowledge of the alleged conversation that the confidential recipient had with Sergeant McCabe initially derived from the reports of the content of the transcript that was allegedly made.  It was an obvious cause of concern.  I presume the Deputy is aware of why his party leader said that the confidential recipient's position was untenable.  The confidential recipient, any previous one and whoever is appointed even temporarily, must ensure that a member of the force who comes to him or her has absolute confidence that an issue raised or a complaint made would be treated with seriousness, and that there is no question of them being under a threat of any nature from me or any Minister for Justice and Equality.  What was said was absolutely unacceptable.  It is something Deputies continue to repeat with great glee in this House.  There is no question of my treating anybody in that fashion.</p></speech>

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for clarifying that.</p><p>  When Oliver Connolly was appointed, the Minister testified to his character as an honourable man.  Since he has been relieved of his duties, and I do not know the man personally, it has been reported that he is a respected solicitor.  There is no question about this man's character.  Why did he find himself having that type of conversation with Maurice McCabe?  Why did he say the things he said?  What has not been focused upon is what he said about the very close relationship the Minister has with the Garda Commissioner, which I have criticised for a long time.  I am seeking the Minister's view on why a man who is honourable and decent, as the Minister testified and which has been confirmed by other peers, would say the words he spoke.  Does the Minister have a view on what led him to give that advice to Maurice McCabe and to be concerned for Maurice McCabe in that way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700004#B02100"><p>I can state quite categorically that I find the whole thing a complete mystery.  I have absolutely no idea what Mr. Connolly was thinking.  I have had very limited contact with Mr. Connolly in the context of his role as confidential recipient.  I recalled from memory last evening, and there are no notes of this, that following receipt of his letter of 23 January 2012 there was a brief conversation in which he emphasised to me that these were important issues to be followed up.  However, I did not have regular meetings with him.  His job was to engage confidentially with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  To be frank, I am utterly astonished at some of the commentary that has now come into the public arena.  I do not understand why he conducted himself in that way.  He has a very good reputation as a sound lawyer and mediator.  It remains as much of a surprise and mystery to me as I expect it should be to others.  I cannot explain this.  I can only say that it was an approach I regarded as untenable in the context of the important role of confidential recipient.</p></speech>

What will be the arrangement?  What will the arrangement be in the interim?  I presume the Minister intends to move to a position where garda&iacute;, regardless of the issue, will go directly to GSOC in future.  Will he clarify that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700004#B02300"><p>As I said a number of times before any of these controversies arose, my judgment was that the office of confidential recipient did not work.  I concluded, having been Minister for some time, that it was not appropriate that these matters are dealt with in this way.  It was unsatisfactory.  I brought a proposal to the Cabinet that the Bill brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, be amended, which it will be on Committee Stage.  It will require some modifications to what is already in the Bill to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can bring complaints directly to GSOC.  Of course, it will take some weeks for that Bill to be enacted.  It has been passed by the Seanad but it must go through Committee Stage in this House and any amendments made by this House must go back to the Seanad.  It will be some weeks but I was concerned to ensure there will not be an enormous gap.</p><p>  One cannot instantly appoint a replacement.  The view I expressed, and with which my Cabinet colleagues agreed, was that we should appoint a retired judge.  I will consider the individual in consultation with the Attorney General.  We must go through the consultative process that I described.  As soon as that is completed, either by next week or hopefully the following week at the latest, there will be a new confidential recipient appointed.  The confidential recipient will be in place on an interim basis pending the relevant part of the Minister, Deputy Howlin's, legislation becoming operative, which I hope will happen with some speed.

At the time, I sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the report and its recommendations.  The Garda Commissioner in his reply pointed out the many changes which have been made to Garda handling of these matters  in recent years, including the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of covert human intelligence sources.  As such, many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures, including improved training for garda&iacute;, the development of an electronic system for maintaining records, placing emphasis on the necessity for garda&iacute; to comply with professional standards, strict procedures for handling and disseminating intelligence as well as co-ordination between specialist units and robust internal auditing.</p><p> The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as <i>agents provocateur</i>s.  Although it is not referred to in the GSOC report, I emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the management and use of covert human intelligence sources.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, a former judge of the High Court.  In addition to monitoring compliance with the code of practice, Mr. Justice Smyth&rsquo;s remit requires him to communicate any matters he considers appropriate, including recommendations, to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report to the Minister for Justice and Equality annually on the discharge of his functions. </p><p> More generally, as I have previously advised this House, revised protocols were agreed and signed by the chairperson of GSOC and the Garda Commissioner on 23 September 2013 to ensure the highest possible level of co-operation between the two organisations.  The revised protocols put in place clear procedures for the timely sharing of information, including sensitive information, and more generally for enhanced co-operation.  The House will also be aware of the recent agreement of the Garda Commissioner to enhance these protocols to enable GSOC to have full access to PULSE.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p> I have no information on the sensitive operational question of the identify of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are, or have been, involved in informant handling or whether they are still serving. </p></speech>

Given the decision of the DPP not to prosecute, I assume the Minister has sought and received briefings from the Garda Commissioner on whether the relevant senior garda&iacute; have been disciplined, demoted or whether they remain serving in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would be obliged if the Minister will update the House in detail in this regard.  Can the Minister confirm that, in addition to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Commissioner and resigned or retired Garda will co-operate with and submit to Mr. Justice Cooke in respect of any possible involvement, despite the fact that the Commissioner and retired or resigned garda&iacute; do not come within the GSOC section 102 review, in respect of which Part 1 of the terms of reference is focused?  Does the Minister believe resigned or retired garda&iacute; connected with the Boylan investigation come within the remit of the paper review of Mr. Justice Cooke?</p></speech>

The terms of reference for the inquiry were agreed by the Government, on the advice of the Attorney General.  They are available on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach.

GSOC reached damning conclusions in this section 80(5) report despite assurances in 2012 from Commissioner Martin Callinan that it was his belief members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were co-operating with GSOC.  Even on the publication by GSOC of this section 85 Boylan report, Commissioner Callinan reiterated his belief that garda&iacute; had co-operated with the GSOC investigation.  This obstinance and internal logic is central to the blue wall of silence and the resolute refusal to submit to outside accountability within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along with a resolute resistance to admitting that any cultural change within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is even necessary, much less committing to implementing a programme of reform.</p><p>  The reaction of the Garda Commissioner to external criticism is not unusual.  He similarly publicly rejected the criticisms of Mr. Justice Smithwick and the Smithwick tribunal report that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na valued loyalty to the force over truth and honesty.  The response of the Commissioner was that he simply did not accept the judge's findings.  How in God's name can the Minister stand over keeping the Commissioner in place?</p></speech>

I took with great seriousness the report published by GSOC.  Some of the issues raised had been dealt with and addressed, while others have not.  GSOC is independent and in the context of issues that remain to be addressed we have put in place systems to ensure they are addressed.  It is of the utmost importance that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully co-operates with GSOC and it is of the utmost importance that GSOC carries out its independent functions fully and freely and reaches conclusions on allegations received by it.  The report on the Boylan matter published by GSOC illustrated issues of seriousness and the manner in which GSOC approached that work should have copper-fastened in everyone's mind the fact that it does its work independently.  On one hand, Deputy Wallace seems to be supportive of the work GSOC does yet, on the other hand, he criticises the work it does.  I cannot recall if it was Deputy Wallace or one of his colleague sitting beside him who made allegations yesterday that GSOC was not fit for the job it does.  Something of that nature was said.</p></speech>

The manner in which this controversy had continued and the new information I had received in the days beforehand led me to the view that it was in the public interest that measures be taken to ensure that the full truth is established beyond dispute.  In the light of that, I and my Cabinet colleagues agreed to the appointment of a retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Cooke, to inquire into all matters of relevance to the controversy. </p><p>  The Government subsequently appointed retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice John Cooke, to conduct an independent inquiry into the reports of unlawful surveillance of the GSOC.

Why did the Minister engage Rits to carry out a peer review?</p><p>What were its terms of reference?  Is it a comparable company, in terms of stature, ability and resourcing, to Verrimus?

Section 3 provides that, following a proposal by a Minister, with the approval of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Government may, by order establish a commission.  The draft order establishing a commission of investigation is the subject of a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  The Act has been used to inquire into a range of matters across Government, including, for example, the Leas Cross nursing home and the banking sector.  In regard to my Department, commissions of investigation were established to inquire into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Dean Lyons case, the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin and the Diocese of Cloyne and the death in custody of Garry Douch.  The reports of these commissions are available on my Department's website with the exception of the report into the Garry Douch investigation which has only recently been submitted to me.  The above reports attest to the important role of commissions of investigation to effectively inquire into matters of public concern.</p><p>  It is often appropriate, however, to first establish as many facts as possible before taking the step to establish a commission of investigation.  The starting point is to conduct a review of events and documentation to ascertain, to the greatest extent possible, the factual position.  The outcome of such a review can be helpful in clarifying the need for an inquiry or the matters which are to be the subject of the inquiry.</p><p>  The Deputy has undoubtedly framed this question with reference to the recent media report of unlawful surveillance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and allegations concerning certain Garda investigations.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has appointed retired High Court Judge John Cooke to conduct an independent inquiry into the GSOC matter and to report within eight weeks, the terms of reference of which are in the public domain.  The Government has also appointed Mr. Sean Guerin, SC, to examine allegations by Sergeant Maurice McCabe of Garda misconduct and to report back to the Government before Easter.  Mr. Guerin will have the power to recommend a commission of investigation, if he believes one is needed.  I consider it would be premature to establish a commission of investigation into these matters prior to consideration of the external report in each case.  The procedure which has been adopted replicates that adopted on previous occasions prior to the appointment of a commission of inquiry.</p></speech>

They have been gone through line by line and every decent journalist in the State has reported on and analysed them.  The Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has spent hours dealing with the issues.  The allegations and the issues of concern are very clear.</p><p>  Why did the Minister not deploy the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and give a person or persons the ability to compel witnesses, compel all the relevant documentation and make findings of fact?  Why was that not agreed to?  What is the reason for the delay in doing that?  The concern is that the delay reflects a concern in Government not to get to all of the facts of this matter which is reflected by the very poor response of Government when these allegations emerged and in the ten days which followed them in the Chamber and elsewhere.</p></speech>

Most people outside this House would regard it as entirely reasonable that all of these matters in regard to GSOC are considered and reviewed by an independent retired member of the High Court whose integrity is beyond reproach.  I expect all parties will co-operate with the work Mr. Justice Cooke will do and that all the papers and documents he requires will be made available to him and that if needs to meet or interview individuals, they will co-operate.  If it emerges that is not the case, then we may have to reconsider the matter but I expect that co-operation.</p><p>  I think it is a proportionate and reasonable response with a view to getting greater clarity on this matter within a shorter period of time than would otherwise be the case in the context of a statutory inquiry and at a good deal less cost than would otherwise be the case.  Should something arise out of Mr. Justice Cooke's report that means this matter may need to be revisited differently, so be it.  My only interest is that we know the truth of all of these issues surrounding the concerns that arose in regard to GSOC.</p></speech>

The Minister talks about a political football.  This issue has been in the political domain for three weeks and citizens would like it out of that domain.  The best way to take this issue out of the political domain is to have a genuinely independent inquiry under the Commissions of Investigation Act which, I repeat, has the power to compel witnesses and all the documentation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Department of Justice and Equality, Rits, Verrimus, the journalist John Mooney and whoever else, and finally make findings of fact.  Why has the Minister not deployed that legislation and taken this issue out of the political arena by giving it to persons with the necessary expertise to deal with it properly?</p></speech>

The fact that they run it does not necessarily mean that it is appropriate that matters be dealt with in the manner they describe.  The Cabinet made a decision that it is appropriate, and I agree, that all these matters be dealt with pursuant to the terms of reference furnished to Mr. Justice Cooke.  That is as opposed to its being dealt with in the political arena, which involves charge and counter charge and a greater interest in targeting me as Minister with some political charges than discovering the truth of this issue.

In the absence of direct evidence, the tribunal found that, on the balance of probabilities, there was collusion by an unknown garda or garda&iacute; in the murders of RUC officers Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan.  This is a finding of the utmost seriousness.  On the publication of the report of the tribunal I apologised on behalf of the Government to the Breen and Buchanan families for any failings identified in the report on the part of the State or any of its agencies.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste reiterated this apology.  I also wrote to the two families to convey the apology and to express my sympathy directly.  On the day following publication of the report, I met with the Garda Commissioner.  He has also publicly expressed his apology to the Breen and Buchanan families and his horror that any garda would have colluded with the Provisional IRA.  It is notable that there has been no apology or expression of remorse from Sinn F&eacute;in for these murders so callously carried out by their erstwhile comrades.</p><p>  The tribunal made a number of recommendations with regard to North-South police co-operation and matters relating to Garda discipline.  I met with Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, MLA, who is my counterpart on the Northern Ireland Executive, on 17 December and we were joined at that meeting by the Garda Commissioner and the PSNI Chief Constable.  We discussed the Smithwick tribunal&rsquo;s findings and its recommendations on cross-Border police co-operation.  At that meeting the two police chiefs emphasised that Garda-PSNI co-operation remains close and productive, and will continue to be a key element in countering the current security and other crime threats which this island faces.  The two police forces have the full support of me and Mr. Ford in this regard.  Mr. Ford and I tasked our officials and the two police forces to review the Patten programme of personnel exchanges and secondments, which has been in operation since 2005, to see whether additional value for the two forces can be gained from it.  The establishment of such a programme was recommended by the tribunal.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>  The tribunal also made recommendations on personnel management in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda discipline.  It is important in this regard to note the changes the already in place since the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act in 2005 with regard to the management of the force.  The Deputy will also wish to note that a number of the matters to which the tribunal referred in its recommendations are directly relevant to the Garda discipline regulations which were put in place in 2007.  These regulations are currently under review and the tribunal&rsquo;s views will be taken into account in that context.</p></reply>

There is continuing contact between the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland and the Garda Commissioner.  Mr. Ford and I emphasised our full support for both bodies and the work they are doing.  I expect in the not-too-distant future to receive a report of the outcome of the work that is being undertaken arising from the Smithwick report.</p><p>  As Deputy Niall Collins has rightly noted, court proceedings have been taken challenging some of the conclusions contained in that report.

Its function is to provide accommodation and related services to those who have sought international protection and who have no means of supporting themselves otherwise.  More than 53,000 such persons have availed of RIA's services to date.  Currently, there are over 4,300 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA.  The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly in the past five years.  In the period end December 2008 to end December 2013, the number of persons being accommodated by RIA declined by 37%.  Expenditure by RIA in 2013 was &euro;55.2 million.  A breakdown of this expenditure, as well as for preceding years, is available in the RIA annual reports which are published on its website.</p><p>  The operation of the direct provision system is kept under review and I have consistently acknowledged that the length of time that residents spend in direct provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire to have applicants remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  The direct provision system is not ideal, but it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking other grounds to be allowed, on a humanitarian basis, to stay in the State.  It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is under financial difficulty.</p><p>  A comprehensive review on the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out and the subsequent report, Value for Money and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme, which was published in May 2010, found that there are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.</p><p>  No Government can afford to ignore the likely consequences of any change to the system.  The system cannot exist solely in its own context.  It is inextricably linked to the surrounding international protection process.  By its nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes.  The time needed to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings also impacts on the length of the process.  A substantial proportion of cases - this may not be understood - in the High Court relate to judicial review proceedings taken or decisions reached in the international protection area and a substantial number of those in direct provision are engaged in such cases having failed in their applications to be granted asylum or to be allowed to remain in the State for other reasons.</p><p>  My resolve is to deal with the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases so that asylum seekers spend as little time as is necessary in the direct provision system.  To that end, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, which I will re-publish in a reformed draft later this year, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave-to-remain applications.  Recently, I also signed into law new regulations relating to the processing of subsidiary protection applications which aim to ensure that applications are processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and, of course, subject to the co-operation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.</p><p>  In relation to the naturalisation aspect of this query, it should be noted that asylum seekers do not satisfy the residency requirements for naturalisation as their residency is not deemed reckonable.  If a person is successful in the asylum process, he or she may apply for a certificate of naturalisation when he or she is in a position to meet the statutory residency requirements.  The number of refugees naturalised since March 2011 is approximately 3,200.</p></speech>

Would he reiterate his view that the direct provision system is unsuitable for long-term residency?</p><p>  In light of the ESRI report published last week which highlighted that six out of ten in the direct provision system are in it for over three years and one third are in it for over five years, and taking into account that four out of ten in the direct provision system are children, what specific practical steps can the Minister take to expedite the existing system by reducing the delays in processing the various stages involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700008#F00900"><p>First, I will deal with the issue in relation to children.  I have recounted in detail to the Oireachtas on numerous occasions the ways in which RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children.  These include the full implementation of the Children First guidelines as well as Garda vetting of all RIA staff.  RIA has a fully staffed child and family service unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE.  Moreover, details of the types of facilities and supports available to children are provided in RIA's annual report of 2012 which can be found on the website.  The annual report of 2013 will be published by the end of March 2014.</p><p>  More generally, the operation of the direct provision system is kept under constant review and I have consistently acknowledged that the length of time the residents spend in direct provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire to have applicants remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their cases.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the system is not ideal but the difficulty is that a substantial number of those in direct provision are engaged in court proceedings.  Before I am misinterpreted or there is any accusation made, I want make it clear that any individual is entitled to properly bring any application before the courts he or she deems appropriate.  Some of these challenges may be completely appropriate and, indeed, over the years some have been successful.  However, one of the reasons persons are so long in direct provision is because when they go through the initial decision-making process they challenge outcomes when they are not granted the application they seek.  There is a substantial backlog of cases in the courts in this area.  It is my hope that once we enact the new legislation, which I expect to have before the House this year, we will be in a different space and issues can be addressed in an appropriate manner.</p></speech>

On the legislation, as the Minister will be aware, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill passed Committee Stage on 11 November 2008.  It was subsequently withdrawn and we have been told since that it will be reintroduced.  Since 11 November 2008, the Exchequer has spent over &euro;1 billion on the asylum system in this country.  I accept that we need to reform the asylum system and the new immigration Bill will introduce a single processing system which will significantly expedite the issue and abolish the current four stages of appeal and involve one appeal.  Realistically, when does the Minister expect to have that legislation enacted and what specific practical measures can he take to expedite the existing system in the interim?</p></speech>

The last Bill was published in 2010, at which time I was Opposition spokesperson.  It was the third Bill in this area and despite that it was a much better Bill than its predecessor there were still very substantial defects in it.  Deputy Rabbitte, who was then Labour Party spokesperson on justice, and I tabled substantial amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  On taking up office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Minister for Defence I had the Bill as previously published reviewed.  More than 300 amendments were required.  It was decided that rather than retabling the old Bill a new Bill incorporating all the necessary changes would be published.  I had hoped the Bill would have been published sooner but because of the priority which the troika required that we give to other legislation, personnel were not available within the Attorney General's office to do the necessary work.  I am assured that work on the Bill is now taking place and that it will be published during the course of the year.  It is my objective to have it enacted before the end of the year.  It will do exactly what the Deputy says in that there will be a one-stop decision system where all applications can be dealt with.  It is designed to facilitate applications being dealt with quicker.</p><p>  On the direct provision issue, substantial sums of money have been spent by the State on direct provision.  The alternative to direct provision would be the provision by the State of individual housing for every asylum applicant.</p></speech>

The State cannot afford to do that.  We are not in a position, having regard to the current finances of the State, to provide appropriate local authority or social housing for many of those born in this country who are currently in need of housing.  We are constrained in terms of the amount of money available to us for housing purposes.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware of the decision last week of Mrs. Justice Maureen Harding Clark in regard to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in which she said that the only reason the person had not been granted asylum was because the tribunal's member did not like the applicant.  There are fundamental problems with the current system that can be addressed, including the nine and 33 week delays, respectively, in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal, and the 27 months it is taking for a judicial review, only to get decisions of the type I mentioned earlier.</p><p>  What practical measures will the Minister put in place to deal with the two-year delays in processing subsidiary protection applications until such time as that legislation has been enacted?</p></speech>

I note the judgment to which the Deputy referred.  As I said, people are entitled to have access to the courts.  It is not the function or role of the Minister to deal with the hearings of these cases.  There is a structure in place to do that, which is independent.  If there is a procedural or substantive failure, the individuals concerned are entitled to draw the matter to the attention of the High Court.  There have been cases taken in the High Court in which applicants have been successful.  There have also been cases taken which have been unsuccessful.</p><p>  As I understand it, there are currently more than 1,000 cases awaiting hearing in the High Court.  The courts are independent of the Minister.  It is for them to determine how they cope and deal with the number of cases awaiting hearing.  I cannot interfere in that process.  I agree that the number of cases awaiting hearing is a matter of concern.  I do not want to say anything that would prejudice in any way the outcome of a single case.  I am sure that in some of those cases the applicants will be successful and in others they will be unsuccessful.  That will derive from issues that have arisen out of the current statutory structure that exists to deal with these matters.  I want to get on with the reform we need.  I would much prefer it the legislation had been enacted by now.  Unfortunately, that has not proved possible.  However, it will come before the House this year.</p></speech>

With regard to the Departments of Justice and Equality and Defence the following are the main areas of co-operation and policy overlap.  As the Deputy may be aware, where necessary, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are assisted in carrying out certain specific duties by members of the Defence Forces in fulfilment of the role assigned to the Defence Forces to provide aid to the civil power.  Outside of these areas of aid to the civil power, the distinction between the policing function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the military function of the Defence Forces is an important one and I have no proposals for deployments along the lines referred to by the Deputy.  Also, under arrangements agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Air Corps, aircraft attached to the Garda Air Support Unit are flown by Air Corps pilots.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  One of the main areas of co-operation between the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Defence is the maximum security prison in Portlaoise.  The Army memorandum of understanding for its role is to aid the civil power, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service to prevent unauthorised movement into or out of the prison compound. </p><p>  Under the auspices of the Office of Government Procurement, a defence and security category council was established in 2013.  The category council is charged with determining the sourcing strategy for the defence and security category and must determine the best way forward to meet the needs of customer Departments.  The nominated lead for the defence and security category council is the Department of Defence and the Irish Prison Service is a participant on the council.</p><p>  As part of the normal engagement between Departments, officials in the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Defence are co-operating in regard to the proposal to establish a new Court of Appeal in the context where the establishment of the new court will see the abolition of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.</p><p>  In the context of drugs surveillance and interdictions at sea, there are common areas of interest.  The Irish Naval Service plays a key maritime operational support role in assisting our law enforcement agencies in this regard.  This is done through the joint task force on drug interdiction which enhances co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue's Customs Service and the Naval Service in enforcing the law in regard to drug trafficking at sea.</p><p>  I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to another area of co-operation between the Departments, namely the Government task force on emergency planning.  The task force is chaired by the Minister for Defence and the Department of Justice and Equality is also represented on it, as are all other Departments and certain agencies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department of Justice and Equality co-operates with the Government task force in agreeing on the lead agency to take charge of the response in the case of an emergency arising.  It also co-operates in developing risk assessments related to emergencies and in attending meetings of the Government task force. </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is currently preparing proposals with a view to updating and strengthening policies in the immigrant integration field as part of an overall integration strategy geared to present conditions.  It is intended that the Department of Defence will be among the Departments asked to participate in this work.</p><p>  At a more day-to-day level, a room is provided in the Department of Justice and Equality head office for use by senior staff from the Department of Defence.  In addition, since the end of last year the Department of Justice and Equality has further facilitated the Department of Defence by arranging for the opening and closing of a premises in Dublin which is used by its staff.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago I submitted a question to the Minister for Justice and Equality asking if he would provide in tabular form the legislation in place for which his Department is responsible and which also confers powers, responsibilities or a consultative or advisory role on the Minister for Defence, Department of Defence or any authorised person within the Defence organisation and the nature of any such powers, responsibilities, consultative or advisory roles conferred on same.</p><p>The Minister replied advising me that as members of the Government are not officially responsible to the D&aacute;il for interpreting or stating the law, he had no responsibility for the matter I raised.  I tabled a similar question to the Minister for Defence and received a tabular breakdown.  I have heard of Cabinet splits but I have never heard of a split on the part of an individual Minister.  Can the Minister explain how that situation could evolve and why the Minister for Justice and Equality, apparently, does not agree with the Minister for Defence?</p></speech>

The list of legislation the Deputy received from the Department of Defence was a reasonable list and not excessive.  Given the manner in which the Deputy phrased the question and the amount of legislation for which the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible, the amount of time it would take to trawl every relevant tranche of legislation relating to the Department of Justice and Equality would be extraordinary.  I am keen that my Departments facilitate Deputies as best they can.  In the area of defence, it was a more straightforward matter but, strictly speaking, neither Department is obliged to respond to a question of that nature.</p><p>  I imagine the Deputy will appreciate that it was not out of any discourtesy to him and I imagine also the Deputy will appreciate that if Members were to pose questions asking the Minister to list all the legislation relevant to a particular matter, then the time of officials could be taken up to an extraordinary degree in simply listing legislation.  God help them if one tranche of legislation was missed and the Deputies on the other side of the House were to criticise them.  It was not out of any discourtesy.  On the defence side, it was an easier matter to deal with but, strictly speaking, I understand it was not an appropriate question to table.</p></speech>

I examined the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  There is a potential issue which may arise due to the fact that the same person is Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence.  Under section 6(1) an application authorising an interception in the interests of the security of the State is made by the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  The Minister for Justice and Equality decides whether the these authorisations should be granted.  However, where the application is made by the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, it must be accompanied by a recommendation in writing from the Minister for Defence supporting the application.  In such instances the Minister for Justice and Equality would be considering an application that must include a supporting recommendation from the Minister for Defence.  I suggest that creates a difficulty since the Minister for Justice and Equality is required to consider these applications carefully.  However, if the application is to be accompanied by a recommendation from him in his role as the Minister for Defence, then it is difficult to see how he could be impartial and assess the issue impartially in his position as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

The legal advice I got was that under statute it was quite appropriate that I do both jobs.  However, I took the view that it was not appropriate based on the spirit of the legislation.  Therefore, to cater for when matters come from the Chief of Staff to be signed by the Minister for Defence, an order was made to the effect that instead of the current Minister for Justice and Equality dealing with the matter it would be appropriate to make an order that another Minister be so nominated.  We were advised by the Attorney General in this regard.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, was so nominated.  Rather than me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, considering a decision I made as Minister for Defence, the order ensured that what I regard as the spirit of the legislation would be complied with, even though I got firm advice that in legal terms it was not necessary.</p></speech>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p><p>  An interdepartmental committee on the convention is monitoring the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  As part of its work programme, the committee has identified issues to be considered by various Departments.  It is a matter for these Departments to determine whether any actions are required to address the issues in advance of ratification and report back to the committee.  This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the request of the committee, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting in assessing remaining requirements for ratification to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>  For my Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN convention.  It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity.  The Bill will go to Committee Stage shortly.  The enactment of this legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN convention.</p></speech>

Thankfully, we are addressing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill.  However, I believe the Bill contains some problematic features, not least in that the convention is clear that persons with disabilities must enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in aspects of life.  Elements of the Bill are problematic and in this regard I call on the Minister of State to consider amendments on Committee Stage with respect to the views from the other side of the House on improvements we are keen to see.

Our approach to this legislation has been unique.  In my experience and in the experience of the officials in the Department there has never been such widespread consultation.  It is still open-ended.  We are still examining the matter.  As recently as last week we met representative from the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland to discuss deprivation of freedom under the legislation.  We hosted an international conference in which people who have had a good experiences in respect of enhanced capacity decision-making gave their views.  Equally, we listened to the views of those from other countries where the experience has not been so good.  We are open-minded about the legislation but until we see the amendments it is difficult to know whether to accept them.  Our minds are not closed.</p></speech>

As a geographic term it reaches back to the time of Homer in the 5th century B.C.  It stretches from the Azores to Severny Island and covers 10 million square miles, 750 million people and 37,000 years of civilization.  As impressive as these facts are and as much as they provide a sense of perspective for debate for any discussion, such as what we will have this morning, they present us with some obvious questions.</p><p>What are we talking about when we talk about Europe?  Why are we engaging with it?  How are we doing it and to what end?  These are important questions which go to the centre of the Government's actions in Europe as well as our overall engagement with European issues as parliamentarians and, most importantly, as Irish citizens.</p><p> This is why I welcome this debate, which is allowing the House to address the fundamental questions of why, how and what.  Those are the three questions that I wish to address in my opening statement.  I want to examine why Europe matters, how we are engaging with it, and what this engagement will deliver.  </p><p> I will begin with the question of why.  The great Scottish philosopher, David Hume, once said: &quot;It's when we start working together that the real healing takes place... it's when we start spilling our sweat, and not our blood.&quot;  I do not need to remind Deputies of the foundations of the modern European project, forged as it was out of the horrors of war.  I do want to remind colleagues, however, of how precarious this peace is and what it is that keeps those horrors from resurfacing.  We have all been gripped by the tragic events in Ukraine.  Reflecting on why Europe matters could never be timelier when we consider the loss of life and anguish of the people in their longing and desire to be a part of what we all too often take for granted.</p><p> We should not forget that Europe does not consist purely of the EU, as important as that is.  In addition, the EU is not purely about economics or financial markets, and is not solely about directives and regulations.  It is, always has been and will to continue to be a project of peace.  It is a catalyst composed of ideals, values and beliefs which transform our encounters with other countries into relations which produce the benefits many of us assume have always been there: the ability to move freely, to live, work, travel and trade across borders without restrictions.</p><p> This ability is tied in closely with the concept of globalisation - that interconnection, integration and interdependence which now characterises the world in which we live.  That is the contemporary rationale for the European Union, which underlies what I have just discussed.  It is the biggest current &quot;why&quot; of the European project.</p><p> I have spoken in the past about this contemporary rationale for the European project as the goals and objectives of the Union have grown and developed, and as its constituent member states have drawn together.  We must continue to work together because on its own no country, no matter how big or small, can manage, prosper or hope to influence a world in which everything is now linked.</p><p> To quote another philosopher, Isaiah Berlin: &quot;Injustice, poverty, slavery, ignorance - these may be cured by reform or revolution.  But men do not live only by fighting evils.  They live by positive goals, individual and collective, a vast variety of them, seldom predictable, at times incompatible.&quot;  This is the &quot;why&quot; of our engagement - a Europe based on values, enabling countries to best manage challenges and opportunities which are too big to grasp on their own.  These are the positive goals we live by when we engage with Europe.</p><p> This leads directly to how we engage with Europe, which has two fundamental and interwoven strands: our engagement through the institutions of the Union and directly with other European countries.  There is a tendency to view Ireland's relationship with Europe solely within the framework of the European Union.  Given the events of recent years, this is entirely understandable.  However, in so doing we must not overlook the importance of the bilateral dimension of our relationships with all European countries and risk failing, in turn, to fully appreciate the extent to which strong bilateral links helped to generate goodwill and positive sentiment towards Ireland.</p><p> This Government is strongly committed to enhancing Ireland's bilateral political, trade, economic and cultural relations with other European countries.  This is, and will remain, a key feature of our engagement with Europe.  How will we do this?  The most important component of Ireland's agency in Europe is our network of bilateral diplomatic missions.  With the opening of a new embassy in Zagreb, we will have a presence spanning all EU member states and covering the entirety of Europe.</p><p> It is because of this that I have invested significant time in undertaking bilateral visits across Europe.  To date, I have made well over 20 visits to European countries and EU institutions to further develop Ireland's profile and advance our national interests.  For example, I will travel to Poland later today where I will have meetings with my counterpart, the Minister for European Affairs, Piotr Serafin, as well as with the State Secretary at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development.  The week before last, I visited Germany to meet my new counterpart, Minister Michael Roth, for the same objective of advancing and developing our national interests within Germany, which is a key European ally.   </p><p> Beyond the EU, I have also paid particular attention to developing Ireland's relations with the countries of the western Balkans.  In the past two months, I have visited Tirana in Albania, and Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as meeting the Foreign Minister of Kosovo during his visit to Dublin.  I also intend to visit Serbia and Kosovo in the near future.</p><p> The second strand of our engagement is through the European institutions: the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.  This engagement is interwoven with the direct contact with other member states, as I have outlined.  The Government has prioritised - Deputies will recognise this from our record of attendance - active ministerial participation at the Council of Ministers and regular, substantive engagement with the Commission.  The Government has also committed to regular engagement with the European Parliament, including a ministerial presence at each plenary session.</p><p> I have just returned from Strasbourg where I met a number of influential MEPs from various countries who are active in committees that have a material impact on our national interests.  I also had the opportunity to meet Commissioner Stefan Fuele to discuss the outcome of my own visit to the western Balkans and have an update on events in Ukraine.  I recognise the value of the work by MEPs of all political parties and none which is undertaken in advancing our interests within the European Parliament.  A key feature of all my visits to the European Parliament is to engage directly with MEPs from Northern Ireland, all of whom respond positively and constructively to this form of engagement which is based on our mutual interests.</p><p> Having outlined the why of engagement, and focused on how we are doing it, I want to conclude by explaining what this will achieve.  The future of Europe is never far from the minds of anyone involved with or interested in European Affairs.  Everyone wants to know where Europe is going and what is the ultimate goal of all these efforts.</p><p> I acknowledge the work of Deputy Dooley and Deputy Crowe in travelling abroad to represent Ireland, as well as representing their political parties and constituents.  Their work through bodies like COSAC and the Committee on Foreign Affairs involves actively engaging in detail with the work we do abroad.  Their work as Members of the Oireachtas continues through their engagement with parliamentarians from other countries.  They will be aware, as I am, that there is no end point to this kind of engagement.</p><p> The European project is a perpetual vehicle of collective action designed to enable countries to continuously work together to the benefit of all and to overcome difficulties through compromise and negotiation.  By means of the wheels of democracy and those of bureaucracy, both of which turn slowly, this is what Europe does each day.  To make this engagement effective, we have clear priorities.  I wish to focus on two of these, namely, creating jobs and stability in Ireland and throughout Europe and maximising our national influence during a period of considerable change.  In the context of our agenda for creating jobs and stability, three clear priorities stand out.  These are fostering an environment for investment; developing the Single Market; and harnessing the semester process.  The concept of the banking union is crucial to this because it encapsulates our engagement with Europe.  It is not that long ago that the collapse of the euro was openly and widely predicted by some and discussed by nearly all.  That collapse did not happen because of the actions taken by a number of Europeans institutions, including the European Central Bank, and the Irish Government, among others, in respect to the crisis.  We now have a much more robust and stable architecture in place and a larger eurozone.  Clearly, however, our work is not finished and we continue to face into a huge crisis, particularly in the context of unemployment.</p><p> Restoring and reinforcing economic growth and securing the stability of the euro remain the key tasks for Ireland and the Union.  Delivery of what has been agreed in regard to the banking union, not least the June 2012 agreement to break the link between sovereigns and banks, is key.  To complement this we must continue to press for growth-enhancing measures, including the deepening of the Single Market, enhancing business access to credit and stimulate external trade.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, is a prime example of how a constructive method of delivery can be adopted in respect of this agenda.  In 2013 alone, the EIB agreed to provide &euro;600 million to Irish projects.  This included &euro;200 million for SMEs, as well as support for DIT's Grangegorman campus development.  In total, this represents an increase of over four fifths in the level of investment Ireland received from the EIB in the past.</p><p> The European semester process is another area in which our engagement with Europe will yield significant benefits.  As the House is aware, this fourth European semester cycle is the first in which Ireland will be a full participant on foot of our exit from the EU-IMF programme.  The Government's second priority is maximising our influence during a period of major change and this will be to the fore in everyone's mind during the European elections in May.  As co-legislator with the Council, the European Parliament's role in shaping and determining European policy has never been stronger.  It matters like never before and the Government has recognised this via its direct engagement with the Parliament.  As already stated, we have ensured that Ireland has had a ministerial presence at each plenary session of the Parliament during the past six months.  We will continue to pursue this agenda.  The scale of the institutional transition will be huge.  It is vital, therefore, that we maintain and develop strong relationships with the presidents of the Commission, the European Council and the Eurogroup.  We must draw on the goodwill and strong connections we have generated through our bilateral relations, and which have been reinforced by our programme exit, in order to deepen our influence and enhance our effectiveness within the EU.  If the past year the resilience and adaptability of Europe have been evident.  More importantly, however, the resilience and adaptability of the Irish people has also been on show.</p><p> I have endeavoured to explain the nature of our engagement with the European Union.  Our approach has a single objective, namely, to support the Irish people and to ensure that our economic recovery accelerates and that the benefits from the progress we make will be shared fairly and equally among all citizens.</p></speech>

I also welcome the fact that the Minister of State is present.  He has shown considerable zeal for developing Ireland's position in Europe, particularly in the context of his constant travelling through the European Union each week to meet our partners, to network and to maintain and build upon relationships which were first established when we joined the European Union.  The approach he has taken is the correct one and I wish him well with it.</p><p>    Our discussion on the European Union during the past four years has continually and understandably focused on our engagement with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund and their implementation of the bailout programme.  Thankfully, that programme is now in the past.  Not forgetting that experience, I hope that our discussions on this topic will broaden again.  We need to begin to focus on the future of Europe and on Ireland's place in that future.  In the context of current debates, we often forget how far the European Union has come in the short ten years from 2004 to 2014.  Ten years ago, Ireland led one of the most successful presidencies in the history of the European Union.  On 1 May that year, then new states, many from the former Soviet Union, joined the European Union.  If anyone wants to understand the importance of that development, he or she need only consider what is happening in Ukraine at present in the context of the battle taking place between Europe and Russia for the hearts and minds of a people who want to progress, to embrace that for which the European Union stands and the principles of democracy and who want change for themselves and future generations.  I welcome the support taken by High Representative Catherine Ashton and others, with the assistance of the Irish Government, in assisting in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Ukraine.  It is worth noting that, yet again, Europe is somewhat powerless in this instance.  Thankfully, however, there has been an easing of the tension in Ukraine.  It has not eased to the degree most people would like but the country has retreated from being on the verge of outright war.  Europe is still ill-equipped to deal with a crisis of the magnitude which could have developed in Ukraine.  Yet again, the US began making statements directed at Russia and suggested that it might involve itself in the crisis.  Europe has a long way to go in the context of reaching a point where when issues of this nature arise in states on our borders, it will be ready to deal with them.</p><p>  Ten years ago, when the countries to which I referred earlier joined the EU, our neighbours and friends who had previously been kept apart from the rest of the Continent by the Iron Curtain were finally welcomed home.  The official ceremony to welcome them to the EU took place in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in in the Phoenix Park and it represented a high point in Ireland's engagement with the European Union.  At that time, the President of the European Council, the President of the European Parliament and the Secretary General of the European Commission were all citizens of Ireland.  We often lose sight of the level of engagement we have had at the centre of the European Union's decision-making process.  That level of engagement speaks volumes for the way in which successive Governments have engaged with the European Union project.  They did so in a way which encouraged senior civil servants and senior Government advisers to identify a path towards becoming part of the administration of the EU.  They did so because they saw the benefits which could accrue to Ireland.  As part of that process they have made moves designed to allow them to work within the structures of the various institutions of the European Union.  This has been of immense assistance to Ireland, not because those to whom I refer have done us favours but because - from an Irish perspective - they have played a role in developing the thinking relating to the direction which the Union should take.  The engagement to which I refer is real and tangible and it ultimately benefits this State.  Such engagement means that we can have a real and permanent influence on the direction in which the EU is going to go.</p><p>My concern, which is probably shared by the Minister of State, is that over time we will lose that unless we continue to remain engaged at a political level and until we continue to regard it as important as it was when we joined Europe.  This is more difficult now because the engagement is different.  When we joined we looked to Europe as being the cash cow that resolved issues we were unable to resolve from our own Exchequer returns.  The funding streams from Europe provided the capacity to build up our infrastructure that had been left in a relatively diminished state.  I refer to the social gains that resulted from our co-operation with other European states.  Now the tangible benefits do not seem as obvious to the people.  The financial crisis has created a level of dissatisfaction and the blame game has developed.  In many cases politicians are responsible for this dissatisfaction.  When measures in our interest need to be dealt with, it is very easy to go back to the constituency and blame the bad Europeans for foisting this upon us.  That is a negative attitude which will not be helpful in the long run to the attitude of the people to the European Union.</p><p> Under the 2004 Irish Presidency the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe was agreed which eventually led to the comprehensive reforms of the EU contained in the Treaty of Lisbon, a treaty regarded by some academics as the final treaty change in Europe for decades to come.  We know now that has not been and will not be the case.  The financial and economic crisis which engulfed both sides of the Atlantic was to threaten the very foundation of the European Union.  The constitutional and economic framework of the Union was to prove grossly inadequate at a time of extreme turmoil and led not only to a financial and economic crisis but to a political crisis from Lisbon to Athens.  This crisis has left a deep scar on the societal fabric of the union.  This will take time to heal.  One of the biggest scars is that of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, which hit 23.5% in 2013 within the EU.  Parts of Europe are now threatened with the possibility of a lost generation.  Many young people view the EU in a very negative light.  Where the Union was often associated with opportunity, it is now viewed with great suspicion and often fear.  If the Union is to have a future, it must address these problems with greater urgency than has been the case.  It must ensure the benefits of EU membership are spread equally among the member states and citizens of the European Union.  The EU must reform itself if these goals are to be achieved.</p><p> This links to my earlier point that when we joined the European Union we saw the benefits because they were real and tangible.  We have reached a level of infrastructural development on a par with many states of our size.  We are in a different phase now and the demands are different.  If we try to explain our engagement with Europe by pointing to what it has done for us and arguing that we should stick with the programme, that argument will not be sufficient to hold this current generation.  We must show that the European project, which is all member states working together, has the capacity to address the challenges facing today's generation.  This must mean finding an appropriate resolution to the youth unemployment crisis.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il firmly believes that the reforms which have been enacted do not go far enough to guarantee the future prosperity of the EU.  Key elements are missing from the constitutional and economic framework of the EU which leave us all vulnerable.  Despite some significant reforms enacted to battle the financial crisis, the EU has still found itself asking the same question of where it goes from here.  That question has yet to be answered by those who driving the European project.  The only constant since the economic and financial crisis in Europe began five years ago, is the absolute lack of leadership being shown by the European political elite.  This is a great shame as the potential of unlocking the energy and talent of 28 countries with more than 500 million people has been lost in those years.</p><p> Thankfully, we have moved away from the continuous crisis model of management, thanks more in part to actions in Frankfurt than in Brussels.  However, many deep problems remain for Europe.  As a small but highly respected member state which has been the poster boy in both the good and the bad times, Ireland must engage with Europe and seek to offer credible solutions to those problems.</p><p> I reiterate my party's position regarding Ireland's future in Europe about which there should be no doubt.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to Ireland remaining at the core of the European Union.  We must ensure we remain at the centre of the European Union and the eurozone while being at the vanguard of further institutional and political developments.  With this in mind, Fianna F&aacute;il is determined to restore the Community method of decision-making in the EU institutions.  We believe the EU must rebalance the institutional powers of the EU back in favour of the European Commission and away from the intergovernmental approach which has become increasingly prominent in recent years.</p><p> The Minister of State and I have discussed this issue in the House.  During the crisis the European Commission was not equipped to deal with the crisis that befell the European Union.  I remind the Minister of State of the weekly spectacle of the premiers of France and Germany holding crisis summits in each other's country which, in my view, did very real damage to the citizens' perception of how the EU was managed.  Confidence in the Community model was eroded and the Commission was sidelined with decisions being taken by the two big countries.  This did more to damage the entire perception of the European Union than the economic crisis.  Crises come and go.  The measure of a man or a woman or an institution is in how crises are dealt with.  Sadly, we were found lacking.  While the Community is progressing in dealing with the banking crisis by establishing a banking union that it is hoped will deal with any future similar crisis, I still do not believe the Commission has an appropriate level of confidence in the Community model and the level of support is not sufficient.</p><p> As the guardian of EU treaties and the common European interest, including protection of the interests of smaller member states, the European Commission must be restored as the guiding force in European affairs.  Otherwise, the unfairness inherent in intergovernmental leadership will create a great division between large and small member states.  This would threaten the stability of the EU in the long run.</p><p> My party is of the view that Ireland should lead the call for rebuilding the economic and monetary union.  Now is the time to re-examine the structures of the EMU as well as the mandate of the European Central Bank.  The architecture to ensure the long-term sustainability of the eurozone is still absent.  This must be corrected and provide a basis for the future prosperity of the EU.  The ECB's mandate must require policies for targeted growth as well as targeting inflation.  Its adherence to German economic theory may well work for Germany, but this is a monetary union of 18 member states, not one.  This should be reflected in ECB policy-making.</p><p> I hope the Members opposite will agree when I state that a fully functioning banking union is also an extremely necessary part of the rebuilding of the EMU.  Any future banking union must include common regulation, common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism.  Without these elements, a fully functioning banking union will not be achieved and we risk repeating the very serious mistakes of the past.</p><p> While I accept that achieving agreement between 18 member states on banking union, including the agreement of member states who have not suffered the same kind of economic crisis as Ireland, is difficult, it highlights the lethargic approach to achieving banking union.  A key element for Ireland in these developments is the separation of sovereign debt from banking debt.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes the EU must fulfil its commitment to separate sovereign debt and banking debt within the EU.  The euro area Heads of State or Government agreed in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  It is time to fulfil this commitment by retroactively recapitalising Irish banks.  Although banking union needs to be agreed before these commitments can be implemented, it sends out the wrong message to the citizens of this State and other states.  It shows that Europe is not equipped to deal quickly and succinctly with a problem.</p><p>If we are serious about this, we have to be far more progressive and efficient in getting decisions made.  Ireland must continue to play its full part in all of the institutions of the European Union.  Decisions made in Brussels, Strasbourg and Frankfurt have dramatic implications for our country and our citizens.  We must remain engaged in the discussions on the future development of the EU and play our part in shaping that future.</p></speech>

Deputy Dooley and I were involved in a conference call to colleagues in the Scottish Parliament to discuss EU matters.  The first question we were asked was about Ireland's experience of joining the EU, to which each of us gave our own impressions and memories.  It was amazing to hear such a range of views and perspectives on the type of country we lived in at that time.  Ireland was one of the poorest countries in western Europe in the early 1970s.  On the global stage, the United States and the Soviet Union were facing up to each other and nuclear weapons were pointed on capital cities throughout the world.  The apartheid regime in South Africa was still in place, as well as the old colonial regimes across Africa.  There was huge upheaval in Latin America.  In our own country there was conflict across the Border, which went from marching for civil rights to war on the streets.</p><p>  We have seen major changes in Ireland in the past 40 years, many of them very positive.  At that time we joined the EU there was a major unemployment problem.  I was arrested later in the 1970s for putting up posters showing a graph of the unemployment rate since our joining the EU.  People tend to have a rosy view that Ireland was somehow transformed overnight after joining the Union.  That was not the case.  In fact, large numbers of jobs were shed in those years.  The open market opened up new opportunities for Ireland, but there were also many factory closures and so on.  This was a world without laptops or mobile telephones.  The young people in the Gallery would be amazed to hear that people had to go to the local telephone booth to make a call.  Contraception was not readily available and then only to married couples.  Women in the Civil Service lost their jobs when they got married.  Many of the positive changes we have seen have come about at least in part from our involvement in the EU because there was a lack of political will by politicians to address the issues.  Indeed, it proved useful in many cases to cite our EU obligations as justification for pressing forward certain controversial changes.  EU membership helped to drag us into the 20th century and on into the 21st century.</p><p> No observer in the early 1970s could have predicted the massive changes that would see the European Economic Community growing into the 28-member European Union we have today.  Ireland has seen positive and negative effects from its EU membership.  Irish people, while generally not concerned with the day-to-day business of the EU, which seems very removed from their lives, remain sceptical of the increasing powers the EU is giving itself.  That disconnect is a common theme when talking to people.  The EU and its workings are often seen as something that does not really affect people in their day-to-day lives, with surveys showing that many citizens cannot even identify their MEPs.  It is an issue we need to address.  That apathy can be seen in the rejections of several EU treaties in a series of referenda.  The Lisbon treaty was passed only at the second attempt, after the Irish people were subjected to scaremongering by the EU, the Government and most of the mainstream parties</p><p>  The free movement of people, goods and services has undoubtedly helped the Irish economy to escape its former isolation and attract new business and investment.  Numerous human rights cases taken to the European courts have forced Irish Governments to improve protections in the human rights area and update archaic law.  However, the gross mishandling of the economy by successive Governments by way of light-touch or non-existent regulation of business and banking operations ensured our economy went into free fall.  Instead of burning the unsecured bondholders who were gambling with the Irish market, as Sinn F&eacute;in argued for, the Government, strong-armed by an EU which was afraid of contagion, chose to burden our taxpayers with the gambling debts of these bondholders.</p><p>  The bailout programme has been a disaster from start to finish.  We have seen a huge increase in youth and long-term unemployment and a massive increase in emigration.  I was in Madrid at the weekend where there is 40% youth unemployment.  People there are angry at what they see as corrupt governance not just by the current conservative Government, but also the previous socialist Government.  There is much talk among citizens of quitting the country.  That lack of hope that things will change is familiar to Irish people.  Here at home we see increasing homelessness and a housing crisis that the Government will not face.  We have seen the introduction of a family home tax and the imminent levying of water charges.  Our health service is in serious crisis, but the Government is cutting more than &euro;600 million from its budget.</p><p>  While we have seen a small improvement in the economic climate in recent weeks, there can be no certainty that this potential recovery is based on solid foundations.  Despite economic growth and improved trade figures, our domestic economy is still extremely stagnant.  Families cannot continue to endure wages cuts and job losses while indirect taxation increases and new forms of taxation are introduced.  Most families are barely keeping their heads above water and have very little at the end of the month to spend in the domestic economy.  We may have exited the bailout programme, but for ordinary people, very little has changed or will change.  As long as private banking debt remains bundled up with our sovereign debt, exiting the bailout programme will not change the reality of austerity for people.  On the basis of our current loan profiles, Ireland will remain under surveillance until 2032.  Even thereafter the Commission can choose to prolong that surveillance.  Moreover, during that period the Council may impose on us whatever measures it deems fit.</p><p>  The parties in this Government have always enthusiastically supported the diminution of Irish economic sovereignty in treaty after treaty.  There has been no critical analysis from the mainstream parties, with everything that comes from Europe deemed positive and welcome.  We know to our cost that this is not the correct approach.  Those who adopt an unthinkingly positive approach to Europe are effectively opponents of Irish economic sovereignty.  Their record is clear on that point, even though the primary aim of current EU economic policies is to ensure member states do not deviate from the neoliberal economic ideology the Union is pushing.  The fiscal compact treaty and other EU economic decisions such as the two-pack and six-pack arrangements see a continuation of this erosion of economic sovereignty for EU member states.</p><p>  Other small states such as the Scandinavian countries have done well in working for their own interests in Europe.  Irish Governments, on the other hand, have continually failed to stand up for the Irish people.  This Government seemed for a time to exist only for the amusement of the troika.  It never stood up for Ireland and failed to get our banks recapitalised, despite the Eurogroup commitment of June 2012.  The troika's legacy throughout Europe is mass unemployment, emigration, increased poverty and the devastation of communities and public services.  Exiting the bailout will change little for hard-pressed working families.</p><p>  Let us not pretend that the Government or the EU have any intention of ending austerity.  The message is all about continued belt tightening.</p><p>The EU will continue to push its economic programme, which prioritises the needs of big business over those of hard-pressed citizens.  Ireland's engagement with the EU needs to focus on standing up for a better and fairer economic model that benefits citizens and is not focused on appeasing business lobbies.</p><p> Many key EU personalities are continually calling for greater European political union and, more worryingly, a united states of Europe.  People across Europe are concerned about this move towards EU federalisation.  While I agree that more mutually beneficial co-operation between European states is always welcome and has led to huge progress for the Continent, we have to ensure that Ireland, as a small state, does not become overwhelmed by an increasingly centralised and undemocratic political union that is dominated by a small number of large countries.  I want the EU to be a true partnership of equal sovereign states that co­operate in social and economic development.  During the conference call I mentioned earlier, reference was made to Connolly's view of Europe as a &quot;federation of free peoples&quot;.  I think people across Europe want the EU to develop in such a way.</p><p> The Government could and should do much more to ensure Ireland's voice is heard in Europe and Irish interests are respected and listened to.  The EU continues to suffer from a democratic deficit and a lack of accountability.  Decisions continue to be made without oversight from ordinary people.  This lack of scrutiny prevents ordinary people from actively participating in the decision-making process.  It is important for us, as part of this debate, to examine the extent to which European legislation is scrutinised.  The European Parliament's travelling circus, which moves between Strasbourg and Brussels at a cost of &euro;200 million, needs to be scrapped.  Brussels should become its permanent home, as the European Parliament has voted on and supported.  Aside from the economic cost, it just does not make sense to ask people to physically move from one place to the other.</p><p> The gap between ordinary people and the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament is growing.  As a result, the decisions taken at EU level do not reflect people's real concerns or needs.  There is a view that the EU has shown a lack of urgency regarding the crisis of recent years.  People are not responding to it.  The European Commission is living in a bubble.  The EU institutions are not coming together to assist those countries that are experiencing difficulties as a result of the crisis.  There is a clear disconnect between the lives of European bureaucrats and the reality that faces millions of struggling working families across the EU.  Member states do not have the flexibility to implement alternative policies which would support investment, growth and jobs.  In effect, the EU is working to deny citizens real political choices when electing their Governments.  I will give an example of that.  At a time of crisis throughout Europe, the EU decided to pull back on the European budget rather than expanding the stimulus programme across Europe.  Progress is not happening.  Cuts are being made in relation to connectivity, etc.  The budget is largely the same, if not smaller.</p><p> It is important for the EU to become a project of its people, rather than remaining a project of the elites.  Irish foreign policy should reflect this when this country is engaging with the EU.  The EU has a significant role in this regard.  I am concerned that since the Single European Act in 1987, successive EU treaties have corroded independent foreign policy to the point where our neutrality is virtually all we have left.  The Nice and Lisbon treaties, which were initially rejected by the Irish people, have transferred political, economic and military power away from member states and granted it to centralised EU decision bodies.  The Lisbon treaty, in particular, took a great deal of power from EU member states in the areas of foreign affairs and defence.  It is shocking that in 2010, at a time when the citizens of EU member states were being crippled by brutal austerity policies, the EU's military expenditure totalled &euro;194 billion.</p><p> Lobbyists from the whole military industrial complex in Europe continue to pontificate about the huge risk of disaster if EU member states were to cut their military expenditure.  In fact, high military spending by countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain helped bring about economic disaster.  I am proud that Ireland has one of the lowest military spends in the EU.  There have been some military spending cuts since the financial crisis hit the EU, but there has been a focus on personnel cuts, troop reductions and recruitment freezes, etc.  This State stands out in the EU for its significantly low level of military expenditure.  It is a record we should be proud of.  Ireland's engagement with European countries should focus on opposing the further militarisation of the EU.  The Government should ensure Ireland does not participate in EU battle groups or support the increased push to create a standing EU army.  Irish neutrality is extremely popular among the vast majority of Irish people.  The State should reflect that by opposing any forms of further EU militarisation or erosion of our sovereignty.</p></speech>

I never wanted to live in it.  I always wanted to live in Ireland, not in the European Union.  I found it interesting to hear Deputy Dooley speaking about "when we joined the European Union".  I remind him that we did not join a Union - we joined a Community.  I was only born around then, but in the years after that I was always a fan of the European Union.  The whole idea was that states would co-operate with each other, not that they would all become a single state.  I think many Irish people feel the same way.  One of the most rampant eurosceptics I know - Tom Ward, who is a member of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association - canvassed for Ireland to join the European Community.  As far as he is concerned, it is now an abomination.  This view is shared by many people I know.  I do not like the term "eurosceptic" because I love Europe.  I accept that "hate" is a very strong word, but it is because I love Europe that I hate and despise the EU and what it is doing.</p><p>  I hear over and over again that the European project started out because France and Germany could not stop killing each other.  If they want to fight wars against each other, that problem will not be solved by tying us all together in one country, especially if everyone is not on board.  If one wants proof that the effect of the EU is far from bringing peace, all one has to do is look at what is happening in Greece.  The same mistakes that were made after the First World War, when the kicking that was given to Germany produced extremism, are now being made in the case of Greece.  The EU has also produced extremism.  As a result, a party like Golden Dawn seems to be getting away with being openly racist.  If the European project is about peace, I would love to know how we have ended up with such a situation.</p><p>  Two years ago, I joined many other people at Clonmoylan and Barroughter bogs to defend our right to keep our homes warm and cook our food as we have done for hundreds of years.  We were met by 30 police vehicles, approximately 40 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 18 members of the armed response unit.  They were deployed, in the European Union that is supposedly looking for peace, to stop us from keeping our houses warm.  The same State that basically declared war on people who cut turf benefits all over the world from postcards of piles of turf.  It is clear from the fact that guns were brought to a bog to stop people from cutting turf that we are now so far up Europe's posterior that we are tickling its tonsils.  How is that bringing about peace?</p><p>  One of the biggest mistakes we ever made was to join the euro.  I have to say I did not understand it at the time.  My simplistic view was that it was great.  I have never been to Spain - I could never afford to go there - but I thought that if a time ever came when I could afford to do so, it would be great if I was able to use the same money.  I thought the euro looked lovely.</p><p>That was my level of analysis at the time, but people such as Anthony Coughlan were quite clear about where it would lead.  I believe he said at the time, "You're all smiling, but this will end in tears" or words to that effect.  How right he was.  It has ended in tears and ended up with us having &euro;70 billion worth of debt on our shoulders which we should not have.  How have we benefited from that?  That &euro;70 billion worth of debt is a drag on every activity in this country, including electricians going out to fit a lock on a door.  The Government has set up the PSA to bail money out of them and throw that back at the debt.  The same is true of any activity, even going out to buy an egg.  People are taxed on the petrol they put in the car to get to the shop; they will pay extra tax on the egg when they get there; and there will be extra tax on the fuel in the shop where it is being sold.  Where are the benefits from this Union?</p><p> It is time to reverse gear and put an end to this European Union.  As I love Europe I believe it is time to do it soon because otherwise we will end with having more wars and problems, not fewer.</p></speech>

It is not fair to say that the decisions made in Europe are to the benefit of all.  The Minister of State would have to admit that they are to the benefit of some more than others.  The &quot;some&quot; are the smaller group and the &quot;others&quot; are the bigger one.</p><p>  As my previous friend outlined-----</p></speech>

The bailout was shoved down our necks and as Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan said, it impacts on just about every citizen on the island, which is unfair.</p><p>  When we signed the Nice and Lisbon treaties, we paved the way for big business to flourish at the expense of the ordinary citizen.  It now wants far greater control of our social services and those two treaties facilitate it.  We will see far more privatisation in the next ten years, which will be permitted under the terms of the Nice and Lisbon treaties.</p><p>  On Tuesday night the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, explained why, because of EU law, it would be very difficult to stop Tesco taking over a large chunk of our post offices.  He is right; that is what will happen.  Despite all the nice talk in here last night about saving post offices, EU law will ensure there is no impediment to Tesco getting its way and God help the poor post offices.</p><p>  Most big decisions are money related.  A road to bypass New Ross in Wexford is planned.  The Government has boasted that it can borrow money at an interest rate of 3.5%, which is good and fair play to it.  However, we are not allowed to borrow money at an interest rate of 3.5% to build a bypass in New Ross because of EU rules.  We are allowed to do a PPP, where the cost to the State will be closer to 20%.  While it might be over a longer period of time, it means that if we want to spend money on infrastructure we are driven into the hands of the markets and investors.</p><p>  Speaking of big decisions being money orientated and related to the maximisation of the accumulation of profit, the latest trouble in Ukraine is frightening and I hope the EU plays a responsible role.  At stake in Ukraine is a battle for economic control by Russia on the one hand and the US and EU on the other.  It is the usual colonial carve-up.  The losers will be the people of Ukraine.  Ukraine's problems will be solved better by non-interference.  The less that Russia, the EU and the US interfere in Ukraine, the better are the chances of the Ukrainians reaching a good solution.  There will be a sad story there if the EU, the US and Russia continue on their present paths.</p><p>  The same problem applies in Syria.  The conflict there escalated when Russia, Iran, the US and Saudi Arabia got more interested in what was going on.  They decided to play out their games, which is great for the arms industry because so many of them are used there.  However, the devastation there is unbelievable.  The devastation in Ukraine will also be unbelievable if Europe does not play a responsible role - and the same applies to Russia and the US.</p><p>  From reading the mainstream media here, one would believe that there were good boys and bad boys in Ukraine.  I would have no sympathy for the man who was thrown out, but the crowd that will replace him are seriously anti-Semitic and very right wing.  Many of them have come from organisations that supported the Nazis during the Holocaust.  Bad things are coming down the tracks and the EU should be careful about taking sides.  Ms Yulia Tymoshenko has been released from prison but one of them is as corrupt as the other.  It was interesting to see that Ms Tymoshenko bought a beautiful house for her daughter in one of the most expensive parts of London not long ago.</p></speech>

It is not an exaggeration to say it is Orwellian.  That term is often thrown around, but I recommend the Minister of State to go back and read <i>1984</i>, because what we are seeing is starting to look alarmingly like that.  We hear talk about peace and that Europe is promoting peace, but what we get are battle groups, and the very intense push to develop and expand the European arms industry selling weapons of mass destruction.  It is trying to involve Ireland in the arms industry in producing components and so on.</p><p>  Some of us pointed out the enormous irony at the time of the peace agreement in the North.  The big talk was of taking the gun out of Irish politics.  Within weeks of those statements, an arms plant was established in Derry to produce components for patriot missiles.  We take the gun out of the North and are putting missiles into countries throughout the world.  That is the contradiction.</p><p>  Deputy Wallace is right about Ukraine - there are no good guys.  There are many ordinary people who were rightly angry about corruption and joined those demonstrations.  However, some of the leading forces in those were vicious, pro-Nazi and scary people.  The opposition and government there are rotten and they are being stirred up by cynical manipulation by both Russia and, sadly, by the European Union as well.  The EU's assistance to states is always conditional on those states essentially moving into its camp.</p><p>  We saw this previously with the Balkans.  It is well worth remembering what happened in the Balkans - of course it also happened at the beginning of the 20th century and led to the First World War.  The manipulation by the big powers and big empires led to the crisis in the Balkans that produced the First World War.</p><p>We saw it again at the end of the 1990s when there was an economic collapse in the former Yugoslavia and legitimate anger against the rotten old communist regime and so, on but that anger was channelled in a nationalist direction by people who sidled up to forces in Europe.  Those forces in Europe actively encouraged them.  The unilateral decision by Germany to recognise the independence of Slovenia and Croatia was the direct spark that led to the Balkans crisis.  Then the literal partitioning on a map, in line with the various accords, of what used to be a multi-ethnic society along ethnic lines led directly, whether intentional or not, to the brutal civil war and all the horrors that followed.  Then there were the NATO bombings afterwards and all the rest of it.  That is the reality.</p><p> Similarly, we hear talk of social and economic justice but what we actually get is a European Central Bank and European institutions that insist that, at all costs, we bail out banks, corporate entities and so on which are driven by nothing but greed and which have driven the European economy, including this country, to the edge of the abyss and demanded that ordinary citizens pay the bill with vicious and brutal austerity and mass unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, across Europe.</p><p> I want to mention the transatlantic trade and investment partnership talks that are taking place, on which I hope journalists and the wider public will focus.  No doubt the Minister of State would probably trumpet those talks as a wonderful development in terms of big trade deals between the EU and US.  In reality, at the centre of these is that new courts of arbitration will be set up between states and corporations to give investors even more protection than they already have and to circumvent the environmental, social and labour laws of individual states such that governments would be precluded from enacting laws that protect the environment, workers' rights, social equality or in any way infringe on the right of big corporations to make profits.  It is more of the same.  It is Orwellian and we should reject moving in that direction.</p></speech>

Intensive engagement with the European Union is essential given the sheer breadth of the legislation and policies which originate in Brussels and have such an impact on the lives of the people in this country.  Some three quarters of our social and economic legislation has come directly from Europe via regulations, directives or other EU instruments and much of our domestic legislation has been influenced by our membership of the Union.</p><p>  The European Union has grown immensely since we joined in 1973.  Where once we were a partner among 12 member states, we are now one of 28 in a Union which embraces most of the continent of Europe and involves more than 500 million people.  When put in this context, the challenges facing a country of our size for establishing effective engagement become very clear.  The reality is that as a small nation we have to work that little bit harder to ensure our voice is heard and our views are known.  It is due to the diligence and dedication of our representatives in Brussels and in the European institutions as well as various national public representatives here that we have been able to have the impact that we have had.</p><p>  One of the long-held criticisms of the European Union has been its apparent disconnect with the ordinary citizen.  Long before the Treaty of Lisbon, which consolidated the various treaties legally underpinning the Union, this was an issue.  It was with the Lisbon treaty that the relationship between citizen and the Union was examined in great detail for the first time.  Accordingly, with the passing of that treaty, each citizen of each member state became a citizen of the European Union with new rights and responsibilities as identified in the cases undertaken by the European Court of Justice.  I believe the enthusiasm in the Lisbon treaty to reflect on the role of the citizen within the European Union has been born out of the recognition that for any organisation or institution to succeed, there must be involvement of the members.  In an increasingly evolving Union it has been correctly realised that the success of the Union is tightly connected with the inclusion of its citizens in shaping and deciding its direction and future.  The Lisbon treaty saw increasing the role of national parliaments as a way of achieving this buy-in and inclusiveness.</p><p>  However, the Lisbon treaty was drafted at a time before the economic and financial crisis which struck in 2008 and 2009.  The result was a sudden and understandable preoccupation with financial and economic matters which in turn left little room for considering the many other aspects of the EU.  National parliaments were concerned first and foremost with stabilising national finances and in drawing up and implementing measures to deal with ravages of the recession.  There was little scope for national parliaments to spend time fulfilling the role envisaged for them under the Lisbon treaty.</p><p>  Following the 2011 general election it was decided that each Oireachtas committee would undertake scrutiny of various European legislative measures and proposals in their subject area.  With the limits and constraints on time, it is understandable that this course of action was taken rather than creating a European Union committee to do all EU scrutiny.  As a result, those of us on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs have been able to examine the other issues such as the role of EU in various areas, the future direction of the Union and the different perspectives and views of other member states.  As a committee we have been able to hear from different organisations, academics, journalists, business leaders, policy­makers and ambassadors on a variety of issues concerning the European Union.  All of this have been very positive and has deepened our understanding of the Union and the issues facing it.  In turn we have been able to impart many of the views held by Irish people on the Union.  However, given the amount of legislation that originates from Europe, the impact it has on our legislation, I wonder if we could do more in the Oireachtas to ensure the Irish voice is heard from the outset and at every stage of the decision-making process.</p><p>  As I have said previously, a reformed Seanad could lead a much enhanced level of engagement between the Oireachtas and the European Union.  We elect Senators for each of the various directorates in Europe - agriculture, competitiveness, foreign affairs, education and so forth.  The Senators would be able to devote more time and energy to scrutinising and shaping European proposals, an outcome that would benefit not just Irish citizens but all of the citizens of the European Union.  The opportunity is there for us to build on the engagement we have with the European Union.</p><p>  At a time of uncertainty concerning the Union, with the deepening financial union, the impending UK referendum, the question of Scottish independence, the instability towards the east of the Continent, meaningful inclusion and engagement with citizens is crucial to a successful European Union, a Union which has championed peace and co-operation among Europeans for longer than in any other time throughout history.</p><p>  I have spoken previously on the single market for energy and that area needs to be tackled.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, appeared was before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and attended the Competitiveness Council meeting this week.  There are huge threats to European businesses regarding the lack of competitiveness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the United States which has much lower energy costs.  It will be a huge challenge for the future in terms of attracting and maintaining foreign investment in this country.  The single market in energy offers huge opportunities.  I would point to the debate on wind energy.  We need to ensure there is proper infrastructure in place across Europe and that we can tap into those markets and the interconnection among members states of the Union.  That is a great challenge and it is needs to monitored and embraced.</p></speech>

By any stretch of the imagination and to say the very least and be polite, progress to date has been minimal.  There is now a situation where the funding model that is being proposed by the Minister for Health is a form of universal health insurance and, at the same time, two key Ministers in government, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, are cynically undermining that proposal.  Before the previous general election, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, said no one would pay any more than they are paying already for health insurance.  Clearly, that has not happened, with massive increases in private health insurance costs, year in, year out, in the interim, forcing families to abandon it at a rate of up to 6,500 people a month.</p><p>  We await the publication of the White Paper on universal health insurance.  Last Monday the Minister for Finance was quite robust in undermining the principle of universal health insurance, saying it would expose the State and families to huge costs.  This is coupled with the leaks last week from the office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, that families will have to pay up to &euro;1,600 for the basic health cover that is being proposed by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.</p><p>  First, does the T&aacute;naiste agree that the panacea announced by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, three years ago, where nobody would pay any more than they are already paying, is now a fallacy in the sense that people are already paying substantial sums over and above that?  Second, when will the White Paper be published in order that we can have an informed debate on this issue?  We are depending on scraps and leaks from Government and from individual Ministers trying to undermine what is a central core principle of this Government in regard to the delivery of universal health insurance.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree the White Paper should be published immediately and that we should have an informed debate on it?  Clearly, the document we published last year would indicate it will not be utopia if we introduce universal health insurance, as proposed by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, because, simply put, it will cost an awful lot more than people are paying in private health insurance at present.  Is the Labour Party happy with giving over health insurance to private companies-----</p></speech>

It is something that is coming after a period of Fianna F&aacute;il Government when it showed no interest in reforming the unfair two-tier health system we have had for a long time in this country.  It still does not, of course, which is why it has opposed the Government's proposals to give a break to families with a medical card for their children.</p><p>  This Government believes people should be treated based on medical need, not on the amount of money they have in their pockets, so people who get sick know they can get treated in good time.  We also want to change the incentives to the health system in order that the majority of people get treated in their communities and do not end up unnecessarily in accident and emergency or in a hospital bed.  That makes sense when it comes to keeping people healthy and spending taxpayers' money in a way that is most effective.  That is why, for example, the Government has put an emphasis on putting in place the building blocks for a universal health insurance system.  It is why we decided to lower the cost of accessing primary care for people, starting with the introduction of free GP visits for children aged five and under.  It is also why we are building up the primary care system.</p><p>  The introduction of universal health insurance is a major reform project.  It is not going to happen overnight and it is important we get it right.  We are not rushing it.  There is a lot of preparatory work that has to be done and the White Paper is part of that.  It will be the basis for the consultation, including what should be included in the guaranteed basket of services.  Other preparatory work is also ongoing, such as the introduction of the money follows the patient concept across the public hospital system and free GP visits for those aged five and under.  Regarding cost, as I said, we must proceed cautiously.  We want a more efficient health system that delivers better value for taxpayers and we also need to keep health insurance affordable.</p><p>  We are at an early stage in this.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance, as one would expect them to do, are doing their job, which is to probe the costings and to maintain an oversight of policy in terms of its cost implications at an early stage.  We want, over time, to reform the health service in order that it treats people as early and efficiently as possible.  To do that, we want to keep health costs affordable for families and for the taxpayer.  The alternative, of course, is the Fianna F&aacute;il alternative, which is to do nothing and to allow a drift.  That is not acceptable to us.  The White Paper is being prepared.  It will be published in the not too distant future and it will provide an opportunity then for all of us to have an input into the discussion on how universal health insurance is progressed.</p></speech>

There is quite a large difference between the two.</p><p>  At the outset, the T&aacute;naiste said the Government wants to introduce a policy that would give access to people based on their medical need as opposed to their ability to pay.  In the last couple of months, it has decided to announce free GP care for those aged under six but, at the same time, it is funding that particular initiative by taking medical cards off the sickest in our society.  The idea that the T&aacute;naiste would come into the House and say the Government wants to ensure people will access treatment based on their need simply is not credible when one looks at what the Government has done in regard to discretionary medical cards, week in, week out, withdrawing them from the sickest and most vulnerable in society.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance, by his policies, consistently undermines the basic principle of universal health insurance, which is a dynamic private health insurance market where people can afford insurance.  Every policy the Minister for Finance has introduced in this House has undermined that basic principle, including the capping of tax relief on insurance premiums and now a further threat to remove tax relief altogether from hard-pressed families.</p><p>  The Government is talking about a universal health insurance model whereby health insurance companies will be the ones who will fund the system through people taking out health insurance.  By any stretch of the imagination and looking at it coldly and clinically, the Government is undermining that basic principle, day in, day out, by the policies it has pursued for the past three years.  When will the White Paper be published and will it have detail and costings?  The public want to know whether the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is scaremongering or telling the truth with regard to a cost of &euro;1,600 per person for universal health insurance.</p></speech>

First, the Labour Party position on universal health insurance, which was initially published in 2001, provided for and proposed that there should be a number of health insurers which would be part of universal health insurance, one of which would be a public service provider.  That was and is the position of the Labour Party in regard to universal health insurance.</p></speech>

That is a fact.  I cannot understand why Fianna F&aacute;il continues to oppose the Government's plan to provide free GP care to children under six.  It is something that will take pressure off families and it is also an essential building block for the introduction of a universal health insurance system.  As I said, the introduction of universal health insurance cannot be done overnight.</p></speech>

The hardship, destruction and devastation have been outlined in a series of debates we have had in the House.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and various Ministers have visited those communities that have been affected.  Thanks to the work of local authorities and local communities with the assistance of Government funding, many of those areas are now starting to get back on their feet.  However, it will be a long journey for a lot of people.  Some people may never get the opportunity to re-open their businesses because of the devastation that has been caused and the fact that they were unable to get insurance for previous incidents of flooding.  Some areas are living in a constant state of readiness waiting for the next flooding event.  My own city of Cork and County Cork, which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, visited very quickly after the last bout of flooding, was devastated with the city centre suffering devastation to unprecedented levels.</p><p>  At the time, we needed to deal with three issues.  The first was the immediate assistance that needed to be provided to home owners and business owners, and that phase has now concluded or is at least very well advanced.  The second related to business owners and home owners who were unable to get insurance.  I know the Minister of State is working hard on that issue with the insurance companies trying to get a memorandum of understanding.  The T&aacute;naiste might give us an update on that.  The third phase, which was outlined by the Government, was investing in flood defences in the longer term.  At the time, the T&aacute;naiste stated that about &euro;250 million would be invested over the next five years.  We all know that this will not be enough to meet the challenges facing the State.  In Cork, it is estimated that about &euro;100 million is needed to put flood defences in place.</p><p>  My question relates to EU assistance.  I know the EU solidarity fund is only available for assistance in the immediate aftermath of flooding and will not help with capital projects and that the bar has been set very high.  It is estimated that the amount of flooding damage and devastation would have to be in the region of &euro;700 million for us to be able to apply for that.  On 20 February 2014, the T&aacute;naiste said his Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in discussions with the European Commission about the possibility of getting EU assistance in terms of funding to help alleviate flooding.  Could he give us an update on those discussions?  Are they still ongoing or have they concluded?  If so, what was the outcome?  My second question concerns an update.  The Minister of State might be able to inform the T&aacute;naiste of the discussions with the insurance industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700019#R01300"><p>I agree with Deputy O'Brien that it is a devastating experience for families and households affected by the flooding.  It is devastating for residential buildings and businesses and is something that will take a very long time to recover from.  I also want to put on record my appreciation and that of the Government for all those who worked so hard to help people out in the immediate aftermath of the flooding.  They include people in the utility companies, employees of local authorities, public servants and those involved in the voluntary effort that was contributed to by people at a local level.  I saw this very recently when I visited Limerick and saw the impact of the flooding there and the work that people in the community did to help others out.  I also want to put on record my tribute to the late Michael O'Riordan who lost his life helping people to get their electricity restored.</p><p>  The Government's response to the flood crisis was, first, to make funding available for the immediate issues.  That was done through the Minister for Social Protection.  Second, we have provided &euro;70 million to deal with the aftermath of the flooding, mainly in infrastructural works and so on.  The local authorities are producing submissions and many of them have submitted them to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who is considering them.  The third dimension, which was mentioned by Deputy O'Brien, is the issue of flood defences.</p><p>  Deputy O'Brien asked me two particular questions.  The first is where we are going on the European front.  We are still in discussions with the Commission in respect of what assistance can be provided from European funding for flood relief.  I must say, however, that the threshold is very high and I do not believe it will make a significant contribution to the cost we must bear in dealing with the flood issue.  However, the Minister of State has been in discussion with the European Investment Bank, particularly in respect of the flood defences issue, and is making considerable progress in that area.  Deputy O'Brien also asked about the issue of insurance.  Again, the Minister of State has been in discussion with the insurance companies and expects to be able to complete a memorandum of understanding with them within the next two months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700019#R01400"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his reply.  I welcome the fact that within two months, we hope to conclude those discussions with the insurance industry.  It will come as a relief if we can get a positive outcome for those businesses and home owners who, through no fault of their own, find themselves unable to get insurance.  That would certainly be a very welcome development and I wish the Minister of State the best of luck with that.</p><p>  Do the discussions with the European Investment Bank relate to flood relief assistance or are we looking at discussions in respect of getting capital funding to help with flood defences?  The T&aacute;naiste also mentioned that the threshold for getting assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund is set very high.  In a reply to a recent parliamentary question, the T&aacute;naiste said we would be looking at damage of up to around &euro;700 million to qualify.  I hope we would never see that level of devastation as a result of weather conditions.  It is very unlikely we would ever qualify for assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund because of the very high bar that has been set.  Is it a commitment from this Government to try to have discussions on the possibility of changing the criteria to lower the bar in order that in the event of future flooding, this State would be able to get some assistance for immediate flood relief?  Is that part of the ongoing discussions with the European Commission in which the T&aacute;naiste is currently involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700019#R01500"><p>The discussions with the European Investment Bank relate to capital works so the funding would be mainly for flood defences.  As the Deputy knows, the European Investment Bank is already assisting us with some of the capital programme, for example, some of the education and transport projects that are under way.</p><p>We are in discussions with the European Investment Bank to determine if we can make the capital works that are associated with flood defences amenable to EIB funding.  The Deputy mentioned his assessment of how far the &euro;250 million that we have committed to will go in terms of dealing with flood defences.  We are conscious of that and, therefore, are considering ways in which the EIB can assist us.  That is on the capital side.</p><p> The EU Solidarity Fund operates on the basis of a percentage of GDP.  For this reason, we estimate that we would need to have suffered damage amounting to &euro;700 million to qualify.  The fund was established on a Europe-wide basis, but we are trying to determine whether it can be broken down on a regional basis.  Weather impacts vary from region to region, in which case the threshold might be lower for those of us in this part of Europe.  This is one of our discussions on the matter.  As with any issue such as this, we are trying to determine how we can maximise draw-down from the EU programme.  It seems that we would probably qualify for little, if anything, from the Solidarity Fund as it is currently constituted.  Therefore, we are likely to bear the cost ourselves.  However, we are in discussions on how the fund might be adjusted on a regional basis to enable us to qualify for funding.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the special liquidator appeared before the finance committee.  We heard of this voluntary agreement and that there would be no Central Bank oversight, sanctions or recourse to the financial ombudsman.  We found out that the voluntary agreement was not even written down.  From the perspective of the families affected it is fair to say that the voluntary agreement is not worth the paper it is not even written on.</p><p>  The Irish Nationwide mortgage holders want to bid on their own mortgages but they have been refused.  The rationale supplied by the liquidator and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, for this was that allowing the mortgage holders to bid for their own mortgages could drive down the total sales price, exposing the State to legal challenge from creditors.  The sales process is based on a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers which the Minister has refused to release and which the special liquidator has not yet released.  However, we found out some useful information about the report from the special liquidator yesterday.</p><p>  The report recommended a single course of action, which is the one being followed.  It did not evaluate different options in terms of the sales price.  The liquidator agreed with the finance committee or, rather, told us that sales prices in various scenarios were not provided.  In other words, the liquidator has not been provided with advice on what the sales prices would be if mortgage holders were allowed to bid and if they were not.  It is still entirely possible that allowing the families to bid for their own mortgages would garner the same sales prices, or even more, than the current process does.</p><p>  The media has highlighted one example today, that of Mr. Duncan Bannantyne.  He offered the special liquidator 97 cent on the euro for his loans, but they were sold yesterday as part of a tranche to Lone Star for 60 cent on the euro, thereby getting &euro;55 million less.</p><p>  There is still an opportunity but time is ticking.  Based on the information that the liquidator provided to us yesterday, he is acting on incomplete advice.  In response to a parliamentary question yesterday, the Minister confirmed to me that neither he nor any of his officials had seen the report on which this sales process is based.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that there is an opportunity to pause the process and for the Minister, his officials or the finance committee to conduct a thorough investigation into whether another process can be designed that would allow the families to bid while making the same returns to the liquidator?  We have a small window of opportunity to do considerable good for the many thousands of families that own these mortgages.</p></speech>

The agreement provides that, if successful in acquiring the portfolio, the phase 2 bidders will ensure that the relevant acquired mortgage loans are serviced in accordance with the Central Bank's CCMA.  The special liquidator appeared before the finance committee yesterday and explained its decision.  I understand that it was aware of the anxieties of mortgage holders and had noted the concerns expressed in recent weeks by the Minister for Finance and other Members of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  I welcome this positive announcement and remind the House that the Government has always been clear, in that we will ensure mortgage holders retain the protection of the CCMA.  As previously stated, however, if it becomes evident that the voluntary application of the code is not delivering the requisite protection for mortgage holders in arrears, the Government will introduce the required legislation.</p><p>  Looking beyond the IBRC loan book sale and as discussed by the finance committee, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Attorney General's office are examining the applicability of the CCMA to unregulated firms and the need for legislation in that regard.  We have continuously stated that we expect any purchaser of the IBRC mortgage portfolio to service it in accordance with the CCMA.  This remains the position.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the sales process is being undertaken by the special liquidator as part of the liquidation process.  It operates independently on its own legal basis, but the Government is clear in its desire to protect the interests of the mortgage holders.  There have been two previous sales of loan books.  In both cases, the purchasers agreed to the continued operation of the CCMA.  In the current case, the two bidders have given an undertaken to follow suit.  If they do not deliver on that undertaking, the Government will introduce whatever legislation is required.</p></speech>

I did not ask him about legislation on the CCMA.  I asked him whether we could pause the sales process to figure out whether another could be devised in which families would be allowed to bid on their own mortgages while returning the same or greater value to the liquidator.</p><p>  I will provide a quick example from the protest outside Leinster House.  A gentleman with whom I spoke who lives in a home with his wife and their children owes &euro;220,000 and will not be in a position to repay it.  The liquidator will sell the gentleman's mortgage for a conservative estimate of &euro;100,000, although it could be as little as &euro;50,000.  The man and his wife could refinance at &euro;150,000, but they are not being given that opportunity.</p><p>  When I put my next comment to the liquidator yesterday, he did not disagree.  What is likely to happen is that one of the two final bidders, both of which are funds from the US that specialise in distressed assets, will buy the family's &euro;220,000 mortgage for approximately &euro;100,000, quickly ascertain that the man and his wife cannot pay the former amount and, after ascertaining that there is equity in the house, initiate repossession proceedings and evict him, his wife and his children.  On the basis that the liquidator is acting on imperfect information and the Minister has not even seen the advice, it is clear that a process could be devised that would allow this man, his wife and children and thousands of other families to stay in their homes through buying back their mortgages at the same prices or even more.  However, those mortgages are about to be sold to international funds that invest in distressed assets.</p><p>On the basis that what is about to happen is going to cause enormous and unnecessary distress to tens of thousands of men, women and children------</p></speech>

He also knows the risks to the taxpayer of an interference by the State in the liquidation process.  It is easy to say "let us pause the sale".  There are consequences to that which might arise from actions taken by other creditors, and other people involved in the IBRC liquidation process.  One would have to be very careful and be very sure that there would not be an exposure to the taxpayer of any such intervention of that kind.</p><p>  This process is not concluded.  The special liquidator told the committee that there are two bidders.  Arising from the concerns about the position of the mortgage holders, those bidders have given an undertaking that they will comply with the CCMA, as was the case in the sale of two previous loan books that occurred.  The sales process is not complete, and I do not think it is wise to begin speculating about where the sales process will end up.  We do not know.  That is a matter for the special liquidator.  As far as the Government is concerned, we want to see the mortgage holders protected here.  If the purchaser does not meet the commitments and standards that we expect, then the Government is prepared to legislate and such legislation would apply not just in the case of the IBRC mortgage holders, but in the case of all mortgage holders.  In any event, repossession cases would have to go before the courts and we know the approach the courts are taking, which is to expect that the terms of the CCMA are applied.</p></speech>

No legislation is being proposed next week, so we will be talking about the Government's priorities instead.  The priorities were outlined in the programme for Government in 2011 and we could have a lot of debates on it, but there will be no legislation and no accountability of the Government next Tuesday, which is a farce.  I have no difficulty in holding this Government to account, but when we cannot have questions and we cannot raise issues, and we have this back slapping next week to allow the Labour Party Members to come in and praise Fine Gael because they could not do it over the weekend, then that is simply farcical.</p></speech>

As part of the reform of the D&aacute;il that we proposed earlier this year, we said that we would provide an opportunity where the Taoiseach and I and other Ministers would come in and set out our priorities for the year, which could be debated in full in this House.  I think that is a reasonable and sensible thing to do, which is what we are doing.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Bruton, said he was opposed to this.  I am not convinced by his response that this cannot be done.  In all sectors of enterprise, as in the world at large, there are unscrupulous individuals who will work for their own benefit against the common good, often breaking the law to do so.  All the regulation in the world is not worth a blade of grass if the legislation in place is not enforced.  Much of the time in this country enforcement is considered in the context of cost, which is usually a factor in it not being provided for by the State.  However, we are sometimes lucky enough to come across an area in which there is no cost in terms of enforcement.  This is one such area.</p><p>   Legislation to strengthen subcontractors' rights was recently enacted.  However, I have been speaking to subcontractors who have told me that enforcement of those rights is still not good enough and as a result some of them are being forced out of business and wages are not being paid.  We need only look to the US, which has a system whereby the State pays subcontractors directly if needs be, which shows how enforcement can be efficient and cost-free.  In this country, the Government takes tax law very seriously.  Non-compliance with tax law will force a person out of business.</p><p>We have seen what happens to individuals.  There was a man on hunger strike outside the gates of the Oireachtas previously who was not in compliance with the household charge.  He was not given a tax certificate and therefore could not operate his business.  Now, we have an opportunity to strengthen significantly workers' rights.  The amendment simply seeks to put in place a provision whereby if a company breaks employment law then it is not afforded the funds or finances of the taxpayer.  There are clear parallels between this and tax regulation in the State.  Is a breach of employment law any less significant to Fine Gael or the Labour Party than a breach of tax law?  Why can we not put something in the legislation to solve that problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700024#W00200"><p>I thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for his input to the Bill.  This is a technical tranche of legislation, the purpose of which is to implement the 2012 Government decision to dissolve the county enterprise boards, transfer their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland and to allow for the transfer of the existing staff.</p><p>  I note Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's concern in respect of State-funded companies and compliance with labour laws.  I agree that companies should adhere to all national law, including employment rights.  It is clearly our intention that assurances of compliance with labour law by an employer will be a requirement prior to the issuing of grants.  However, we also do not wish to create excessively onerous compliance statements or impose a heavy administrative burden on new and existing small or micro-enterprises.</p><p>  I am in total agreement that measures can put in place to safeguard against flouting labour law.  Therefore, as the operational procedures for the new local enterprise offices are currently being reviewed, the inclusion of compliance with labour law as a requirement for payment of a grant will be included in the procedure.  Currently, all grant recipients are obliged to comply with other national laws, for example, taxation.</p><p>  One role of the local enterprise offices is as a first-stop-shop to ensure that micro-enterprises and small businesses in particular are aware of their obligations under various statutes.  The LEOs will promote an expectation of compliance with all legal obligations.</p><p>  Reference was made to the enforcement of labour laws.  We already have legislation in force in respect of conditions of employment with associated enforcement mechanisms in respect of the breaches of the law.  I do not believe that we should charge another body, whose job is to support the growth of enterprise, with a policing role on employers who renege on their responsibilities.  The provisions for enforcement are included in the relevant employment rights legislation and are enforced by the relevant bodies, for example, the National Employment Rights Authority.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment as put down.</p></speech>

Enforcement of employment law is far from adequate in the State.  Anyone who believes that enforcement of labour law is adequate is not living in the real world and has not spoken to the people at the coal-face.</p><p>  When did employment law become too onerous for the Government to seek to enforce in this way?  When did a person's right to work for proper pay and conditions become too onerous an issue to decide on whether to give a company in breach of employment law grants?  Surely any body in breach of any law in the State should simply not be afforded taxpayers' money until they make themselves compliant.  Employment law is one of the most important elements of an individual's experience.  It relates to his ability to feed himself and his family etc.  I call on the Minister of State to answer these two questions.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with regard to enforcement?  Does he believe it is adequate?  Why is employment law considered onerous but tax law is not?</p></speech>

We have a compliance agency for labour law, namely, NERA.  It has a staff of 60 inspectors to ensure compliance with the law and they are fully trained for that purpose.  The staff of LEOs are not best placed to deal with the employment law problems in respect of which Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n may have concerns.  That is the job of that agency.  However, these bodies will be a first-stop-shop for business.  We will have the facilitation of job creation for small and start-up companies.  We are also dealing with the micro-finance fund.  There will be a first point of contact where people can make loan applications and this will encourage enterprise.</p><p>  We have a compliance agency for labour law and that is its job.  There is no point in having duplication.  I have stated clearly that we are looking at adherence to the law.  All micro or start-up companies start with the intention of creating jobs in the economy.  If there are breaches then I am certain NERA can deal with them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700024#W00600"><p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote>In page 5, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:<br /><br /><b>&ldquo;7. </b>Each local enterprise office shall establish a consultative committee which shall provide advice on local economic development to relevant interested parties, such committee shall operate on a voluntary basis, the membership of which shall include&mdash;(a) members of the relevant local authority, and<br /><br />(b) representatives of local business.&rdquo;.</blockquote>The Minister of State will not be surprised that I have tabled this amendment.  It was ruled out of order on Committee Stage but we rephrased it in order that there would be no charge on the State.  The basis and success of the county enterprise boards has been the formal local involvement of elected members and business people, who have brought their practical experience to the running of the operation.  While the notion of a LEO is welcome and the way they are being established, especially in my county, is rather innovative and exciting, the fact is that we are proceeding to ignore formally the input of local elected representatives and the local business community in terms of the day-to-day management and operation of the LEOs.</p><p>  Let us consider the service level agreement.  Section 2.5 states:<blockquote>The County / City Council is a Local Authority (LA) in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. Each Council has a remit to provide a wide range of services in its functional area...LEOs will be established in LA offices to deliver the services as referenced...The decision to establish LEOs acknowledges the support that LAs are providing to businesses, and seeks to facilitate the sharing of best practice and active benchmarking of these types of support across the Local Authority system.</blockquote>That is fine although there may be considerable doubt in the business community about the support provided from local authorities to business, but we will allow that to change.</p><p>  Now, let us consider the operational arrangements under the service level agreement.  Section 4.1.3 states:<blockquote>The incoming CEO shall be the Head of the LEO and there will be a direct reporting relationship between the Head of the LEO and the County or City Manager. The management relationship for Heads of LEOs appointed subsequent to the establishment of the LEOs will be subject to any future local arrangements the County or City Manager may wish to provide.</blockquote>That is fine where there is a good and innovative county manager committed to the LEO ethos and the agenda of local enterprise.  However, if we do not have that, then where is the control?  Where are the controls to ensure the enterprise ethos is within the LEOs?</p><p>  Section 7.1 of the agreement relates to information sharing and states: &quot;To facilitate active engagement between LEO staff, with the EI Centre of Excellence, and the City and County Managers Association (CCMA), a system of regular formal liaison meetings between the LEOs, EI and the CCMA, including at least one annual meeting, will be established.&quot;  There is no mention of elected representatives or local business organisations.</p><p>  Then, section 7.2 refers to serving the political system.  It makes reference to parliamentary questions, ministerial representation, Adjournment Debates, Topical Issue Matters, Oireachtas committee appearances and ministerial speeches.  This is followed by the only mention of local authority members: &quot;In accordance with normal requirements, the activities of the LEOs will be reported on to the elected representatives of the Councils.&quot;  They are so far down the food chain in the running of local enterprise offices that they only get a one-line mention in a detailed document of 34 pages.</p><p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, goes around beating his chest about Putting People First, which is about as relevant a title to a document as I do not know what, because there is nothing about people in it.  This service level agreement document carries that ethos through.  The role of the elected representative is reduced to a one-line mention in the service level agreement.  There are formal reporting relationships within the service level agreement for the County and City Managers Association and Enterprise Ireland.  Furthermore, the local business input from the local chambers of commerce and local Small Firms Association branches is gone from the LEOs as well.  They have gone into some sort of fluffy local community development thing.</p><p>This amendment seeks to ensure that there is some sort of formal recognition for elected members of county councils.  In his time as a local representative, the Minister of State was a member of Sligo County Enterprise Board.  He brought day-to-day experience to the running of that board, including the awarding of grants, a function which will now be withdrawn from elected members of county councils.  If he had not been able to do that and was an ordinary council member subject to the reporting requirements - so the county manager would have given him a nod towards the CEB whenever it suited him - his input would have been drastically reduced. </p><p> This amendment therefore proposes a method of having day-to-day input from elected representatives and local business people.</p></speech>

I much appreciate all of the ideas he has proposed.  I must emphasise that this is a technical Bill to dissolve the existing support structure for micro-enterprises and transfer the functions to Enterprise Ireland to be delivered on Enterprise Ireland's behalf by local authorities.  There will, however, be local county development committees in every county, so the Deputy should study that structure closely.  This is a massive transformation of local government.  In Sligo, it will give a lot of autonomy and a fantastic role for local councillors through the local community development committees.</p><p>  The local service level agreement is a clear document.  It is the first time that, in the context of Enterprise Ireland, a circle of companies will have a high potential to export and grow.  That difference in its charter is important.  When enacted, the Bill will dissolve the existing support structure for micro-enterprises and transfer the functions to Enterprise Ireland to be delivered on Enterprise Ireland's behalf by local authorities.  That sums up what is happening in this legislative context.</p><p>  Looking at the Deputy's proposed amendment, it is necessary to distinguish between the economic policy development role of local authorities and the enterprise support role of local enterprise offices or LEOs.</p><p>  It is not necessary to include Deputy Calleary's amendment for the following reasons: <blockquote>1. the amendment, as written, would effectively be recreating the board structure that this Bill is dissolving;<br /><br />2. an evaluation and approvals committee will be established in each LEO.  This committee will consist of:(i) a chair, either the city or county manager or another senior local authority official not from the LEO, delegated by the city or county manager;<br /><br />(ii) a representative of Enterprise Ireland;<br /><br />(iii) five individuals with specific areas of business expertise, i.e. record of entrepreneurship, accountancy experience, knowledge of markets/sectors/technology, and banking/financial expertise;<br /><br />(iv) a public call for expressions of interest from individuals, to serve <i>pro bono</i> on the evaluation and approvals committee, is currently being made by each local authority city or county manager.  A panel will be formed from which first-filling and subsequent vacancies will be filled.  The appointment of the business sector representatives will be made by the city or county manager, in consultation with the head of the LEO.  Particular account will be taken of the individual's relevant experience and expertise; and3. The Local Government Reform Act 2014, which only recently passed through the Houses, provides for the establishment of a strategic policy committee, SPC, for economic development and enterprise support in each county and city council.  The relevant section is section 48(1A) of the Local Government Act 2001, as inserted by section 41(a) of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.</blockquote>  The requirement of each county and city council to establish the SPC for economic development and enterprise, reflects the increased importance placed by Government on the economic development and enterprise support function of the local authority.</p><p>  Each SPC will be made up of elected members of the local authority and relevant stakeholders, including representatives of the local business community.  The SPC for economic development and enterprise will have a key role in the development of the economic elements of local economic and community plans that local authorities will be required to make.  Therefore, every councillor will have autonomy and a huge role in this.  The SPC must be agreed by the elected members.  In addition, business people will be on the business committee, which will complement the structure in certain cases.  In many ways, the system can be too political whereas what we want are good business decisions being made by people with expertise.</p><p>  Each SPC will be empowered to request the attendance of public authorities at its meetings to assist it in developing policy.  Therefore, there is adequate legislative provision to enable local authorities not only to provide advice on local economic development to relevant interested parties, but also to formulate, develop, adopt, monitor and review its policies in relation to economic development.</p><p>  This is a more comprehensive approach to ensuring the economic and enterprise support elements of the local authority role are fully reflected across the range of functions that local authorities are responsible for, and will ensure a more integrated approach than the amendment proposed in this Bill.  Deputies should remember that each county manager is now a CEO so it is a different structure and the service level agreement will be closely monitored  </p><p>  The economic development and enterprise SPCs will not have a role in deciding grants and supports by the LEO, which will be allocated in accordance with national enterprise policy set by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Local enterprise offices will be executive offices within local authorities and will perform functions on behalf of Enterprise Ireland under the cover of service level agreements.  Such agreements will be up for review in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, so I am certain that we will have some major feedback on this matter.  Unlike county enterprise boards with a board structure, LEOs will not have a committee with members, but will be serviced by the LEO staff.</p></speech>

The SLA states that the evaluation and approvals committee will have a chair, officials and a representative of Enterprise Ireland.  Those five individuals will be appointed by the city or county manager in consultation of the head of the LEO.  There will therefore be no direct input from the elected members who are responsible to the people.</p><p>  The LEOs will be asked to nominate a chair of an evaluation and approvals committee to sit on the Enterprise Ireland jobs expansion fund committee.  It sounds good.  This position will be rotated every six to 12 months in consultation with the City and County Managers' Association.  So they will have the power.  There is no role in the SLA for the proposed SPC, so the LEO could go off and do its own thing because there is no formal reporting role for it.</p><p>  I welcome the SPC which I think is a good idea.  However, the power we are giving through this legislation to unelected officials is, once again, undermining the role of local elected members.  We will spend from now to 23 May trying to convince people to participate in local government, yet in this Bill the role is being undermined and diminished.  It will establish another quango which is only informally answerable to the directly elected members.</p></speech>

The obvious thing to do is have people with the relevant experience at the coalface of enterprise in specific positions within the development of these new LEOs.  At the start of this legislative process, there was no input from enterprise.  It was only when we on the opposition benches kicked up such a fuss that an infrastructure was put in place to allow businesses to have an input into the development of LEOs.  That was after the Government decided what route the infrastructure would take.  Under pressure the Government put in window dressing to make it appear that enterprise would have an input.</p><p>  Many councils just tolerate councillors.  Hundreds of motions are passed at councils around the country which are ignored by council officials.  This legislation represents a step back and a disempowerment of local enterprise and business.  At the same time, however, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, claims to be introducing the most radical reform of local government that will be more responsive and accountable than ever.  Why is it that Fine Gael and Labour want to separate enterprise from enterprise delivery services?</p></speech>

Service level agreements, SLAs, are operational agreements between local authorities and Enterprise Ireland.  Such agreements never previously obtained at this level.  There is no intention to take away from the current oversight relationship that exists between elected councillors and county managers.</p><p> I reiterate that what is envisaged here is already catered for under the strategic policy committees, SPCs.  It is important to emphasise that point.  Councillors will be represented on SPCs.</p></speech>

When one considers the level of enterprise across the counties, one will see that this will in no way diminish the role of councillors.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, has introduced transformational change and given autonomy to local councillors for the first time ever.  Councillors will be represented on the SPCs and the LEOs will undoubtedly make a contribution to the process in this regard.  There is no need to duplicate arrangements or to create LEO consultative committees that would include councillors among their membership.  If there were different councillors on both entities, there could be conflicting opinions with regard to what LEOs should or should not be doing.</p><p>  What we are doing here relates to creating jobs.  Local government plays a critical role in the job creation economy of every county.  Councillors can agree to provide derogations in respect of vacant units or to encourage enterprise in towns and villages.  What is envisaged is about giving power back to the people in the area of job creation.  At present, enterprise boards are completely autonomous but that will not be the case with LEOs.  The service level agreements relating to them will be operated by the regional director of Enterprise Ireland.  When one considers the jobs plan that was announced earlier, one can see that huge emphasis that is being placed on start-up companies.  One of the major engines of growth in this country at present is composed of the 200,000 new start-up companies operating here.  Companies which commenced business in the past five years were responsible for 50% of the employment created during that period.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n stated that what is being done in this instance does not take account of the role of enterprise.  Great consideration was given to this matter across local government and the enterprise sector.  From now on, county managers will be chief executives and there will be a great deal of consultation with elected members.  We want business people to be included on the evaluation committees.  It would be easy for LEOs, which will have relatively small staffing complements, to be distracted and become involved with wider economic policy making and reporting.  The latter will be dealt with by the SPCs.  There would be no point in having the two entities doing the same job.</p><p>  We are talking here about committees which will place an emphasis on business.  Chambers Ireland and others can become involved, as can the community-owned economic development companies that are operating in, for example, Mayo and Sligo.  Several of the latter companies will have a role to play in the context of the SPCs.</p></speech>

The performance of LEOs will be monitored through Enterprise Ireland.  We are giving a very clear commitment in this regard.

It is very important legislation and I am delighted to see it passed by the D&aacute;il.  This reforming initiative reflects a commitment in the programme for Government and is a core element of the Action Plan for Jobs.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and all the staff of the House for facilitating the orderly passage of the Bill.  I thank my officials for their outstanding work in getting all of the necessary agreements in place.  I also thank Members, particularly Deputies Dara Calleary and Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, for their valuable contributions on each Stage of the debate.</p></speech>

The county enterprise boards have done very good work since 1993.  The notion that the new regime will offer some type of all-singing, all-dancing show serves only to undermine that legacy.  In fact, the local enterprise offices will essentially be building on the very good track record the county enterprise boards have left behind.</p><p>  It is important that we get started without delay.  The establishment of the LEOs has been announced more often than I have had hot dinners.  We had yet another announcement this morning in the context of the so-called Action Plan for Jobs.  It is time now to get things moving.  In terms of the service level agreement, I realise that the Minister of State has a major interest in this area.  The SLA must have some role in future for elected members if we are to be true to the ethos of putting people first in terms of local government.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister of State on his achievement in progressing the Bill.  He has put an enormous effort into it.  Let us proceed now with rolling out the initiative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700028#AA00500"><p>For the past three years, the Government's economic policy has favoured all sectors of job creation other than local indigenous business, even though the latter is the most productive and sustainable sector in the long run.  We certainly welcome foreign direct investment, but an over-reliance on FDI is dangerous in the longer term.</p><p>  In its press statement today regarding the Action Plan for Jobs, I noted with an ominous sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> that the Government is focusing on jobs in the construction sector.  We have called for more investment in housing construction to meet the need that is there.  We acknowledge that ensuring adequate supply is very important.  However, current Government tax policy is resulting in speculators piling into the housing market in a number of narrow pockets throughout the State, elbowing potential home owners out of their way.  This has a second negative impact, other than the implications for potential home owners, in so far as enterprise is essentially competing with property for funds.  Indeed, the current capital gains tax regime is in danger of soaking up all available funds to the detriment of local indigenous business.  Moreover, the vast majority of FDI is going into Dublin and to a far lesser extent Cork, to the detriment of the rest of the country.  This is resulting in a two-tier economy.</p><p>  Focusing on indigenous business is the way to create a regional balance in the development of enterprise, and the county enterprise board has heretofore been the tool to do that.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the many people who have worked on the boards over the years.  They have not always been right in what they have done, but it is also the case that they have not always been provided with the necessary funding to do what they wanted to do.  Since 2008 or so, when Batt O'Keeffe was Minister, they have not had any direction.  Instead, they have had a sword hanging over the heads.  Yet they continued to transfer funds and knowledge to start-up businesses and micro-enterprises at a time when such were badly needed.  In some ways, the skills and knowledge residing in the country enterprise boards will be diluted as a consequence of this legislation.  My concern is that the culture of the local authority will become the culture of what was formerly the country enterprise board, and not <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>  I urge the Government to ensure that the new structures are properly funded and supported into the future.  We must create a balance within our enterprise mix which places local manufacturing and internationally tradeable services at the centre of a sustainable growth path.</p></speech>

This Bill will improve the experience by patients of the health care system by introducing a unique identifier for every person in Ireland.  The measures contained in the Bill will help to ensure quality and safety of care and correct patient identification.  These provisions will reduce administration costs and, in the long term, prevent instances of unnecessary care, thereby avoiding the types of medical cock-ups that have resulted in legal cases being taken against the State in respect of patient misidentification and errors in regard to records.</p><p>  The Bill proposes the introduction of two types of identifiers, namely, individual health identifiers for every patient and health service provider identifiers for the health professions and organisations.  The Health Information and Quality Authority has highlighted the necessity of introducing a unique health identifier for patients and drawn attention to the very low proportion of health care funding that is spent on IT services relative to other European countries.  Identifiers will not contain any personal or clinical data at the initial stage.  Their introduction will ultimately lead to a more pleasant experience for patients, who will not have to give their details more than once, on their first admission to hospital.</p><p>  The current system of storing patient records is antiquated and disjointed.  Some documentation is stored in electronic format but the vast majority is held in files in various locations.</p><p>Obviously, this can result in files being mislaid.  It can present difficulties for health care professionals who need the complete picture with all the relevant information if they are to make informed decisions and judgments.  We often hear about health professionals who are not able to see the complete global history of a patient, but are instead confined to what are called "islands of information".  The introduction of health identifiers is a step forward in that regard as it will make it easier for the movement of patients within the health system to be traced.  The health providers register will be open to everyone to access.  That will not be the case with individual records, obviously, but the issue of data protection arises nevertheless.  People have relevant concerns about who will have access to the individual patient identifiers, as distinct from the health providers register.</p><p> Responsibility for this work has been allocated to the primary care reimbursement service.  Does it have the resources and the capability to carry out the duties it is being given?  Like other Deputies, I have had difficulties dealing with the medical cards office in Finglas.  It has lost information, for example.  One of my constituents had to send in the same information in support of a medical card application on three occasions.  It was only when the office was challenged - a receipt was submitted to prove that the information had been sent by registered post - that the primary care reimbursement service accepted that it had received the application.  That undermines the work of the service and underlines why there is genuine concern about the quality of its computer systems.  Why does the service not scan these documents when they are received to safeguard the sensitive information contained in medical letters and payslips, etc.?  I am concerned that the primary care reimbursement service does not act in a clever manner that ensures information is retained and stored safely.  Can the Minister of State outline in his response what role the service will have in the implementation and roll-out of this system?  Will training be provided to the staff of the service to ensure people's files and records are retained correctly?</p><p> No detailed costing or funding information regarding the implementation of the various systems is being given.  Perhaps the Minister of State can give Deputies some information about how much it is estimated that this will cost to implement.  Is it planned to upgrade the various information technology systems in the health service in due course to ensure the new system can be accessed in a timely fashion?  Genuine issues have been raised regarding the decision to introduce a completely new identifier system when the PPS number system is already in operation.  I understand the PPS system has been discounted on the basis that the necessary capability does not exist within it.  Why is that the case?  Are we incurring unnecessary additional costs in this instance?  As I mentioned earlier, there are genuine data protection concerns about who will be able to access the individual health identifiers.  Ultimately, this is a good system.  An electronic health care system is the Government's end goal in this regard.  I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State's initiative in this regard.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State and the Department for putting together this overall plan for a new era.  I thank the Bills digest office for providing a helpful 46 page document.  I do not intend to whinge about the fact that I am being allowed to speak for just three minutes.  We need to remember a few things in this context.  The modern scenario for individuals and families involves a great deal of traffic across continents and countries.  If one has a sudden health setback while one is away, one might need to access one's records from Spain or France.  The electronic element of this initiative is good.  We need to watch out for a few areas of it, however.  We should not allow some of its commercial dimensions to over-impose on the delivery of medical care at various stages including diagnosis, care and follow-up care.  Medicine and nursing are primarily about the person.  We need to be careful not to be dazzled by systems, and their perfections or imperfections, in the way that is depicted in <i>Brave New World</i> or <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>.</p><p>  The integrity, security and updating of information is crucial if we are to join up the islands of information.  We must be careful to ensure medical practitioners and delivers - doctors and nurses - do not start to have a casual reliance on what is easily available on the data bank.  The likely diagnostics cannot be determined solely on the basis of an examination of where the patient has come from, and where he or she was at during the most recent assessment, as set out in the patient history.  The face-to-face presentation sometimes shows that all the history is irrelevant because a new germ, disease or situation has arrived.  I know that because two of my brothers are general practitioners and three of my sisters are qualified nurses.  There is a great temptation to rely on the file or the history.  The Minister of State, and his colleague in the Department of Social Protection, will be aware that all assessments in cases of appeal are now being done on computers.  The assessors do not even look at the patient.  That is very wrong.  There is a need to look at the patient.  I believe in having electronic files as a backup, but I do not think it is a good idea to do one's diagnostics on a computer.</p></speech>

I will not confine my remarks to the issue of health identifiers.  The Department of Health's electronic health initiative offers massive potential to bring services closer to the patient's home and to ramp up community services far more significantly than has been the case in the past.  The introduction of this legislation is necessary if that is to happen.</p><p>  When this Bill was initially published, I was concerned about the approach being taken with regard to PPS numbers.  Having gone through the explanation in the briefing, I understand the justification for it.  An argument has been made in favour of proceeding on the basis of a unique identifier.  Nevertheless, I suggest that the facility could exist for this unique identifier to become the PPS number of the future at some stage.  Up to now, we were looking at piggy-backing on the social welfare system.  Perhaps the social welfare system should look to piggy-back on this particular identifier.</p><p>  It is all well and good for people like me or the Minister of State - or even someone as senior as Deputy Mathews - to have to remember a PPS number, PINs for credit and debit cards, online banking numbers, the new IBAN numbers that will kick in at the end of this month, the new postcodes that will be introduced in the next 12 months and medical card numbers.  Will one's medical card number be amalgamated into this new system, or will one still have a separate medical card number at the end of this process?  Having to remember a series of numbers can cause significant problems for older people who might not be technologically literate.</p><p>  I would like to refer to one of the issues I have with this unique identifier.  It seems that no personal data associated with this number will be held.  My understanding is that personal information, such as one's forename and surname, one's date and place of birth, one's sex and one's parents' names, will be associated with this number.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether this is the case?</p><p>That information can be used to access bank accounts and so forth.  However, older people arriving at a casualty department may not know their hospital number but will know their date of birth.  If the two are not connected together, it will also cause problems.  How do we deal with that double-edged problem?</p><p> Now that we are connecting medicine with technology in practical terms for the first time, I hope the Minister of State will be able to work with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and allow for medical data to be held on a driving licence.  The only data that can be held on a driving licence is to indicate whether the driver is an organ donor.  The technology exists and a chip will be introduced on the credit card-type driving licences pretty soon.</p><p> That should contain basic information such as my blood group, my next of kin and if I have any allergies, so that if I am involved in a traffic accident the paramedic with a specific reader can read those data from the credit card-type driving licence and treat me at the scene rather than having to rush me into a casualty department, give me O negative blood because they do not know what my blood group is and gamble regarding the medicines they give me in case I have a particular allergy.  That kind of basic connectivity should take place because it will save lives and assist paramedics at the scene of an accident.</p><p> There is potential to save significant amounts of money in the health budget by introducing this.  HIQA has estimated that 30% of the health budget is being spent on handling data.  Even the cost of storing those data must be significant, never mind the associated administrative costs.  Streamlining this will make a big difference.  However, while we have the legislation, we do not know how much it will cost.  A significant amount of the investment will take place this year, but how much investment will be required to ensure this happens?</p><p> Significant amounts of money are wasted on diagnostic tests.  If I go to my GP with a pain, he will carry out a battery of tests.  If I ring him back at the end of the week, he might tell me I have an elevated indicator in my blood and might refer me to the county hospital.  When I go to the county hospital, I have another battery of tests, many similar to the ones the GP has already done.  If it cannot get to the bottom of the issue, I might be referred on to a specialist in St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin.  When I go to St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin, the same tests are carried out because there is no connectivity between the GP and the local hospitals, and between the local hospitals and the regional centres.</p><p> I would have become a pincushion as a result of those three separate sets of tests, which is a relatively minor issue.  However, there are significant costs in carrying out those tests.  A recent edition of the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i>highlighted that most medical professionals are unaware of the high costs of these laboratory tests.  I accept that the tests need to be carried out, but it is important that we do not carry out the same tests all over again.</p><p> I know the Minister of State has a particular problem at the moment - we met representatives of the IMO yesterday - regarding medical cards for children under six.  I know there will be challenges in introducing it.  I agree with the principle of it and I know the objective is to extend it to encompass the entire population.  That will be a big challenge.  As an interim measure, I ask the Minister of State to explore the possibility of giving every adult in the country a health check test similar to the NCT for cars.  Every four years everybody should have a standard set of cost-effective tests.  I am talking about urine analysis, blood analysis, and blood pressure and cholesterol checks.  Those can act as an identifier, particularly for chronic diseases.  As we all know if a chronic disease, particularly obesity, diabetes and so forth, is identified early, it can be more easily treated at that early stage and at a significant saving to the Exchequer.</p><p> At the moment diseases related to over-use of alcohol, smoking, bad diet and so forth are costing our health budget &euro;7 billion per annum.  By connecting all this up, we will be able to identify people in risk categories.  We will also be able to ensure that when these chronic diseases are diagnosed, people can receive far more of the monitoring and supervision at home rather than continually having to travel to meet GPs or consultants.  This can be a big issue for those living in rural areas, particularly in my constituency.  For example, one third of pensioners in County Leitrim live on their own; it is just over 30% in County Roscommon; and just under 30% in County Galway.  Some very useful technology has been introduced into Wales and England which uses the telephone line and the television screen to communicate directly with people and monitor their blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and deal with conditions such as COPD, at a greatly reduced cost than is the case at present.</p><p> I urge the Minister of State to take this technology and piggyback on the existing systems rather than introducing a completely new system.  Our recent conference at the RDS was addressed by Mr. Andrew Murphy from Sl&aacute;inte Healthcare.  He is introducing this technology across the world and in some hospitals here.  They are building on the existing IT infrastructure, rather than starting from scratch.  We need to start with what we have, build on it and use it to create the best type of technology infrastructure we can.</p></speech>

The Bill represents a key step in the Government's reform programme and will allow us to introduce a system of unique identifiers for the individual and those who provide health care services.  It will lead to an improvement in the quality of care, better access to information and more joined-up thinking.</p><p>  We all recognise the need to prioritise the safety of patient information.  It is important to put things in context.  The Acting Chairman and I share a common interest in the GAA.  Within that organisation we have an ability to share information about club membership.  I view the Bill's provisions as being similar to the club membership card.  It allows for the streamlining of medical records, reducing duplication in things such as the diagnostic tests Deputy Naughten mentioned.  Of course the Deputy should have concluded by saying that the Minister in introducing universal health insurance and free GP care for children under six is taking the first steps to allow us all have health check tests and access treatment fairly fast.</p><p>  Tomorrow is rare diseases day and a unique conference on rare diseases will be held in Belfast.</p><p>Having listened to delegates this morning at the Joint Committee on Health and Children who made wonderful presentations, there was a palpable feeling that the system does not talk to itself, so to speak, and the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  I preface my next remark by saying that I am sure we are all aware of the tremendous work being done in our hospitals, but charts go missing, systems need to be upgraded and medical information needs to be shared.  I understand the concerns of some people when they have seen what happened to Edward Snowden and others, but I give this example.  If I were to walk into the emergency department of Cork University Hospital at 7 p.m. on Friday, I would have to fill out a form, get my chart, take my place in the queue and that is fine but if I have to go to the Mercy Hospital or the Bon Secours Hospital, which is a private hospital, the following day, there is no co-ordination in the sharing of information.  In the context of this Bill, the sharing of information is important.  The primary motivation for introducing this Bill is to bring about a better e-system of governance in our health system and make sure that medical and other information is shared, which is important.</p><p> The Bill lays out a clear framework for the setting up of a structure in regard to individual health identifiers for patients and service users while also setting up registered health service provider identifiers for health professionals and organisations.  The idea behind this measure is about improving the quality and safety of care along with the modernisation, updating and reform of the system of record management and of the management of the system within our hospital network.  Having listened to other speakers and the Minister, I note this measure will ensure there is a reduction in the repetitive and needless care, a reduction in organisational expenditure and that it will facilitate e-health projects which have been launched by the Government.  On the same day this Bill was introduced in the Seanad, the Government launch its e-health initiative.  That is an important step because it sets a target that must be attained and achieved on behalf of the patient or the service user.  It indemnifies the staff in our hospitals who - as I know from talking to some of them - are looking for a change in terms of the system of operations.</p><p> Interestingly, the recent report from HIQA estimated that up to 30% of the health budget may be spent on handling, collecting, searching for and storing information.  It is a large amount of money in the context of today's health budget of &euro;13.2 billion.  If one were to put the annual health budget under the microscope, this legislation would be welcome, necessary and considered to be innovative.</p><p> The health identifiers will form an integral part of the Government's planned e-heatlh agenda, which was launched by the Ministers.  The strategy sets out a roadmap for improving the health and well-being for each citizen of the country through simple and cost effective means, for example, through the introduction of e-prescribing.  I have met different pharmacists and GPs who have set up this system in their practices and at the click of a button on the computer they can send a prescription to the pharmacist without the need for paper or unnecessary toing and froing.</p><p> The introduction of health identifiers will allow this planned system to work more efficiently.  It will mean the same information does not need to be collected on numerous occasions, which can be frustrating for both the patients and the people who are working in the system.  If we are serious about our e-health project and about bringing in reform, and we have created new hospital trusts, new hospital networks and moved forward with the reconfiguration process, we must ensure the experience of the patient and the health care provider is enhanced and positive.</p><p> Deputy Naughten's remarks regarding diagnostic testing needs to be followed through.  If we are serious about reducing the cost of health care, this is one area we need to examine forensically in the context of all the different types of tests being carried out by different health providers.  If we have a unique identifier linked to the patients' records the multiplicity of tests could be reduced.  This audit that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, speaks about in terms of health insurance will be a positive step in the right direction.</p><p> We are 13 years on from when this measure was first spoken about and we are now putting in place the structures on which to develop and implement it.  The work being done by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, the Minister of State, Deputy White, and the Department of Health is to be commended because it will ensure we will have a functioning and operative period within which to put the provisions of this Bill into practice, and the savings that will be made will be part of this process.  We hear a good deal about reform of the health service inside and outside this House and this measure is another example of reform of the health system which will provide better value for money and ensure that the quality of care is improved and that the experience of the person using the health system is also improved.</p><p> The health identifier is an exclusive, non-transferable, lifetime number assigned to all citizens, which is to be welcomed.  Its purpose is to identify accurately the individual and enable health and social care to be delivered to the patient at the right place at the right time.  Protection of patient privacy within the development of this Bill is vital.  Public confidence in the protection of personal data online and on file, as we know, is diminishing and shrinking almost daily.  We have seen people's information being hacked into and used for many different purposes.  Genuine concerns in this respect have been expressed by people about this Bill and to that end we must strike a balance and ensure when we provide a health care system and service that in tandem we also protect our people from the misuse of their personal information.  People will not object in my opinion to being part of this new e-health strategy.  It is about the provision of information.  Once we explain and demonstrate to people the rationale for having a personal identifier number unique to them in a simplified and easy way this will be a positive development for the future of our health system.</p><p> We have demonstrated that we have a very professional health care system with the men and women who work in it providing an exemplary standard of health care on a daily basis.  In implementing this Bill we must ensure we can provide the same level of health care in a far more effective and efficient manner and in a reduced time period.  This Bill is about ensuring progression and modernisation of our health system but in tandem with that it also must be about the patient, service user and those who work in our hospital system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.269" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700031#DD00200"><p>I am thankful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  It is another important and practical piece of legislation to come through the House in recent time, which will enhance the delivery of greater reform of the health sector.  It is a simple and straightforward Bill.  It is a common sense measure.  It is hard to believe that it was not brought in years ago.  One would assume that this system was already in place but having worked in the health service I know that it is not in place.  It is a basic system that should have been implemented a long time ago to ensure our modern health service is run as efficiently as possible.  It is another measure on the list of reforms that the Government has said must be brought in and we will bring in those reforms.  We have ticked this box and it will lead to greater reforms as we move forward.</p><p>  The Bill, as passed by the Seanad earlier this month, will provide the legal framework for individual health identifiers for those using the health service and unique identifiers for those who work in the health service, irrespective of whether they are in the public or private sectors.  It is important to note also that the Bill is another step in providing a more modern, efficient and safer health care system, and safer is the key word.  Matching the right information with the right patient is basic and key but it does not always happen because there can be human error and mistakes can be made but systems must be put in place to ensure that does not happen.  That is what this measure is.  It is putting a simple system in place which will attach the right information to the right patient and that it can be found when it is needed.  In that way we will know who everybody is in the system and when they go from one doctor to another they will not have to repeat themselves and fill in the same forms over and over again.</p><p>  I am encouraged by the general support for the Bill on all sides - if I am correct on that - in both Houses.  It is encouraging with all the party politics that have been going on in recent weeks that we are dealing with a Bill such as this on which everyone can agree and that makes common sense.  In reforming the health service generally, most parties will agree with what has to be done.  There might be slight ideological differences about certain aspects of it.</p><p>Overall, the majority of us want this system reformed as much as possible.  We recognise there are outstanding people working in all parts of it.  However, we need to have a system that allows them to do their work to the best of their ability, efficiently and at the lowest cost to the taxpayer and the insurance payer.</p><p> The Bill does deal with privacy concerns, so I hope that issue will be put to bed and that everybody will accept this and use the number.  It is important that we find some way to encourage those who might have doubts and might not want to use the number.  I also spoke about what information will be attached to this.  However, I hope it will be realised that the system is there to help people and make sure they get the best health care.  They will buy into it once it is explained properly and there is help for them in using it.  I have no doubt there will be a great take-up of this.</p><p> The Bill is about safety and quality of care.  It will enable better promotion of patient safety to include clinical audit and investigation, reporting of patient safety incidents, management of the health services, including planning, monitoring, delivering, improving and evaluating health services, and also investigating and resolving complaints.  During his speech in the Seanad, the Minister said this would take away some of the duplication of diagnostics.  This should not be necessary because the information should be attached and there should be no need to repeat the same test again a few months later or in a different part of the health service, be it private or public.  That is what we are told and I believe it is outlined in the Bill that previous test results can be attached and used again.  I hope that is the case and is what will happen in practice.</p><p> With regard to the management of the service, when I worked in the payroll end of the service, it was a nightmare, with all the different grades and people who worked half-time, full-time, quarter-time and so on.  For someone who was just in college trying to learn accountancy, it was a pure nightmare trying to put a system in place that would work out people's wages and pay them properly.  A couple of years later, when I was in the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach of the time was Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Finance was Brian Cowen and the Minister for Health and Children was Mary Harney.  On the same day, in three different speeches, although I could be wrong on who gave which figures, one member of the Cabinet referred to the HSE and the health service employing 140,000 people.  That evening, another Minister, possibly Mary Harney, referred to the service employing 110,000.  Lo and behold, before the night was out, Brian Cowen referred to the figure as 120,000.  Therefore, the Government of the day did not even know how many people it employed and paid in the health service.</p><p> That alone shows that a basic system like this, which would show who is who and who is working on what patient, is fundamental to bringing reform and managing the health service.  There is so much money and so many people involved in this area that it is important we get it right.  Therefore, while this is not a large Bill, it is essential.  We have been talking about it for years and I am glad to see it happen.</p><p> It goes back to the reform agenda, which states that we will not just talk about reform but that we will go and do it.  I accept that reform can take time.  In any reforming agenda, especially in regard to health, any given Minister, such as the Minister, Deputy Reilly, or the Minister of State, Deputy White, will be picked on at certain times because a certain part of the health service is not performing.  It cannot all be fixed overnight and it will take time.  However, it is possible to pick off the bits we can do and say, for example, that this year we will do X, Y and Z, and, over a period of time, we can get it fixed.</p><p> To be fair, when it comes to health, both Labour and Fine Gael very clearly said before and after the election that it would take time to fix it.  There was no false promise that we would fix this in seven months, a year or two years.  In fact, seven years was the general figure talked about and it was said that it would take two terms of Government to completely reform the health service.  I believe we are on track to achieve that and I have no doubt we will do so.  It is not the end of the world if we are six or eight months behind in our schedule provided we have most of it on track, know where we are going and have a plan of action.</p><p> Measures such as this small Bill feed into the idea that money follows the patient and into universal health care, which will reform the health service.  I totally believe universal health care will solve our problems.  Yes, we will have to tease it out and work out the details but if we get it right the first time, it will work.  It will level the playing field and will give a genuinely single-tier health service, once it is implemented correctly.  I have no doubt about that.</p><p> I presume that, at end of the day, the Government will provide the basic cover that will get people equal access to health treatment and to an operation, which is what is fundamentally important.  If people want to have a room of their own, have more flowers in the room or have a nicer dinner, they will pay more for that, which is their choice.  However, the access to treatment is what we must have equality on, and I have no doubt that will be achieved if we see this through correctly.</p><p> It has been said that this is the key to the money follows the patient approach and the whole e-health agenda.  Money follows the patient is another simple concept that has worked very well in the last year or two while on trial, and it has been rolled out much further this year.  No hospital has been penalised due to this and the money still stays in the system but, eventually, hospitals will be rewarded for activity.  This works very well and has driven huge change and efficiencies in the orthopaedic unit of my own hospital.  The results speak for themselves.  There has to be a system of reward as well as penalty.  If someone does well and benefits from the money follows the patient approach, which is a form of activity-based costing, there is a reward for that in terms of extra resources, which hospitals will get to keep.  If a hospital is three months ahead of its target towards the end of the year, it will get extra money to do more work.  Ideally, if the money follows the patient concept provides efficiencies and frees up time, we should be able to use that extra space to carry out more operations.  I presume that is the overall agenda.</p><p> As I said, the sooner we have universal health insurance, the better.  Across the board, the e-health agenda will make it much easier for health practitioners and all those involved in the service to deal with people and make judgments.  If they can use IT systems at the highest level, they can give a judgment no matter where they are based, and a consultant based in Cork can give an opinion on a case in Dublin.  That is what we need.  It is partly in place already but we need more of that, and it can only happen if systems such as this are rolled out.  I am all for that.  The sooner we get it, the better.</p><p> This area is part of a wider overall reform.  The Minister in his speech in the Seanad referred to the medical card situation.  Even a Bill as simple as this should help the situation because information is getting lost at present.  This happens in other Departments also, although it should not happen.  It means that, while people eventually get their medical card in any case, there is the trauma of trudging through the system, repeating the information and asking Deputies to send the information again.  It is embarrassing and should not happen.  I trust a Bill like this will help with the reform of the system, ensuring that information flows more easily and will not get lost or attached to the wrong file.  Departments should not lose information, in the same way that the private sector should not lose it.  It should not happen and I hope this Bill is the beginning of the end of that.</p><p> While I could address other areas of reform, I am happy when I see a Minister outline that, this year, we will fix X, Y and Z.  The plan for this year was to tackle the outpatient waiting list.  It was embarrassing to admit at the start of last year that there were 350,000 people on outpatient waiting lists.  However, we had to admit that, count the figure and then say that we would bring it down.  That figure has now been reduced, and instead of the 100,000 people who were waiting more than one year, the figure is now 4,000 or 5,000, which is a massive achievement.  The Government has to be strong at the start and admit how bad the situation is, and then say &quot;Give us a year or two and we will fix it&quot;.  We did not have that in the past.  People were afraid to admit to things.  I am glad we are on the right track.  While it will take more time to fix everything in the health service, we will get there.  There is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

The Bill introduces a very practical system of a unique health identifier, which is essentially an ID number for each and every person in the country who accesses health care.  This is a welcome step in the Government's reform programme, moving towards a modern, integrated health service which focuses on patient care and safety.  This new system will play a critical role in managing the health service more efficiently and effectively.  HIQA has stated that the absence of a universal health identifier is the single most important deficiency in our health information infrastructure.</p><p>  The Bill provides for a national register of individual health identifiers, IHIs, containing an individual's IHI and other identifying particulars, but will contain no personal or clinical data at present.  Health service providers, health professionals and organisations will use this number to identify patients.  Health service providers, health professionals, organisations and some employees will also have a unique identifier.</p><p>Providers will have to use their identifier on their patient records and relevant communications.  This will clearly identify the person and organisation involved at each stage of care.  I am pleased to see the Data Protection Commission has been consulted on this project to ensure there are no issues with regard to a person's private data.  The identifiers for health care providers will be open to everyone but, understandably, access to identifiers for patients will be strictly limited.  Access to the national individual health identifier, IHI register will be restricted to health service providers and other entities under the Bill.  The Bill provides for offences and penalties for inappropriate access to the national IHI register or use of the IHI.</p><p> At the moment, there are gaps in information right across the board when it comes to health care and follow-up care.  The majority of speakers have spoken about this issue this morning.  This is why this new system is so badly needed.  It will tie into the Government's e-health strategy which aims to enable the health service to modernise in line with information and communications technology advances as well as modernise the way we treat patients, particularly in providing care in the most appropriate setting and at the most appropriate level within the health services.</p><p> Priority areas for initial development include e-prescribing, online referrals and scheduling, tele-health, particularly relating to the management of chronic disease, and the development of summary patient records.  A new body called eHealth Ireland will be established and the IHI provided for in this Bill will be essential to all of these developments.</p><p> Further benefits of this new system include the streamlining of records management and reducing repetitive and unnecessary care and administrative costs.  We all live in the age of technology and appreciate the need to record data electronically.  The health identifiers will allow all care to be traced to the health care provider.  At the end of the day, IHIs are primarily about patient safety and ensuring the right information is associated with the right individual at the point of care.  The IHI will also help in managing our health service more efficiently and will be a building block for health reform initiatives, including the money follows the patient concept.  I commend the Minister on moving forward with this project as I think it has great merit.  It is the first step in making patients' needs more accessible through proper management and medical care.</p><p> Perhaps in the future it will be possible to include within this system reference to medication for people attending hospitals and accessing outpatient services, especially when people, particularly older people, are being rushed to hospital in an ambulance and bags of medication have to be brought to them.  There can be a lot of confusion when they reach hospital as to what medication they are on.  Perhaps this could be looked at in the future.  Perhaps this Bill and the IHI will make the medical profession more accountable and responsible when prescribing medicines for older people and others.  I often find not only through my own family but through relatives and neighbours that some people are prescribed medication three or four times but might never actually use it.  Perhaps it might be possible to ensure through the IHI system that medication is responsibly issued and looked after.  I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill, which I welcome, to the D&aacute;il and hope it is introduced quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700033#FF00200"><p>I also welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on what on the face of it seems like a fairly simple and straightforward Bill.  This Bill sets up a unique patient identifier for every citizen in the country, provides the legal framework for how it will operate and who will access it and deals with governance issues associated with data protection rules.  The Bill was deemed necessary and recommended by the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, also had an input in suggesting there be an identifier for health professionals.</p><p>  This Bill goes far beyond that in that it enables much more far-reaching effects than merely identifying the patient.  As Deputy English mentioned, it is difficult to believe we have not had this in place for many years.  It seems such an obvious precondition for patient safety.  The Minister has referred to the main purpose as being patient safety, and indeed it is.  It is not just about identifying but identifying is extremely important, particularly in an island country where we have a concentration of family names.  Given that people can have the same surname, it is easy to see how there is potential for disastrous mistakes to be made in testing, communicating the results of tests, diagnosing, prescribing and treatment.  The chances of having many Mary Murphys on a GP's list are quite high.  It is even possible to have two or three Mary Murphys in a hospital ward.  It is not entirely improbable.  I recall somebody telling me about her worry when she had a new baby because somebody in the same ward had the same name as her.  She was never terribly sure if she was getting the right baby or not although I know that maternity hospitals go to great trouble to ensure one does get the right baby.  It is amazing we have so few mistakes relating to identity with people consequently being given inappropriate treatments, particularly in hospitals.</p><p>  Apart from treatments, the Minister gave an example of how identifiers can really improve the administration of our health service, which improves service to patients.  He spoke of the problems relating to delays that were associated for a time with the granting of medical cards when we were switching from locally dispensed medical cards to centrally provided cards.  In one example, the delay was due to 133 people with the same name applying simultaneously for a card.  Again, it is easy to see how it might not be that easy to match all the medical and financial details to the correct person.  Of course, it caused people enormous stress and disappointment when they were turned down after being assessed on details that applied to somebody else.  It has great implications for this kind of administration.  There could literally be dozens of John O'Briens but it does not take dozens, it just takes two people with the same name or even similar names for mistakes to happen.  The unique identifier will deal with this particular problem.</p><p>  I understand there was considerable debate as to whether a new identifier number was actually necessary when we already had a comprehensive personal public service number system.  A single identifier does have its attraction as a cleaner, simpler and comprehensive way of serving all health and social needs, particularly those of large numbers of people and particularly because those kinds of services overlap.  However, I understand that HIQA was against the use of the same number for a number of reasons.  Of the two reasons I found most persuasive, one related to data protection and the fact that the PPS number contains personal information that one would not necessarily want to be accessible.  The other reason was that the PPS number is not available on a 24 hour basis, which would be essential for a health service.  People often need their health information instantly.  These were compelling reasons for giving separate numbers despite the attraction of a single number.</p><p>  Due to the fact that health and social welfare services overlap, it is very important that the two systems can be linked.  I hope and expect that over time, both the health service and social services will become increasingly computerised.  It is important the two systems are able to speak to one another accurately about the same patient.  I welcome that as well as containing the name and address of the person, the health identifier will also contain their PPS number.</p><p> The main objective of this legislation is patient safety.  Introducing a unique identifier for every citizen will increase efficiency in the administration of health.  An important aspect of this development is that it will facilitate many other ICT improvements in prescribing and dispensing, in referrals, in consultations and in record keeping.  The one matter on which everyone agrees is that we need a greater investment in ICT.  It is scary to see the filing systems in place in some hospitals.  To the casual observer, they look Dickensian - people queuing for files, files falling apart, files that cannot be found, people needing to return on another day because files have gone to other departments etc.  Information is not always accessible instantly, as is the requirement in an emergency.  A major investment in ICT would not just improve safety and quality in the health service, but also make it more efficient and cheaper, which is something we definitely need.</p><p> The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has estimated that a breathtaking 30% of the health budget is spent on handling, collecting, searching, filing and storing information.  Even basic information on individuals is held across a range of social and health services, for example, by hospitals, general practitioners, GPs, laboratories, physios, etc.  It is almost impossible to collate a complete health history based on a name alone, particularly where a person has a complex or long-term complaint.  We must access and manage information more effectively.</p><p> Not to put a tooth in it, but a slightly worrying question is, if 30% of our budget is spent on filing, how much of a health professional's time is wasted as a result.  As we know, health professionals are not cheap.  An even more serious question relates to the cost of, for example, lost files in terms of patient outcomes.  Face-to-face contact with health professionals is also lost, even though this is what the health service should be all about.</p><p> Some 0.85% of our budget is spent on ICT, whereas the European norm is 2% to 3%.  As part of a move to a more efficient and modern health system, we must have proper ICT systems.  The value of this Bill is that identifiers facilitate such systems.  Indeed, identifiers are a precondition for them.  However, the main boon of an identifier is the extraction of population-wide information for epidemiology studies, which are vital to good health planning.  The Minister mentioned vaccination and screening programmes, but identifiers will also allow for the tracking of increased or decreased instances of diseases and demographic or geographic differences in health status.  I am referring to the types of information that are required for a focused health care response and future planning.  Identifiers would also be a critical enabler of the e-health strategy.</p><p> I wish to make a couple of helpful points.  First, there will be a system for putting in place a marker when people die.  As mentioned in the legislation, dead people will have a number.  No such system is in place currently, which has led to the scandal of GPs being paid in respect of people who had left their areas or died.  This Bill represents an opportunity to put in place a foolproof marker system so we can know how many patients a GP has on his or her list, etc.</p><p> Second, when people contact Deputies, we often need their PPS number, but they do not have a clue what it is or how to go about getting it.  We should run an information campaign to let people know, as a PPS number is important and unique and people must be able to access theirs.</p></speech>

Once again, the Minister and the Ministers of State, Deputies White and Kathleen Lynch, have introduced innovative legislation.  This Bill is appreciated and supported by the majority of Deputies regardless of their side of the House.  This is to be welcomed.</p><p>  Last week, I took great pleasure in speaking on the opt-out clause - or opt-in clause, however one views it - for organ donations.  That provision was innovative.  I am a member of the Irish Kidney Association.  Every week, we try to raise awareness of kidney donations.  Having told people for years that they should carry their cards, however, I did not even have mine in my wallet.</p><p>  The question of health identifiers is one of patient safety.  We must ensure the right information is associated with the right individual who is receiving care.  Identifiers will allow our health services to be managed more efficiently.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell is correct about how horrific it is to see that 30% of the health budget is spent on administration.  We seem to have a love affair with files.  I probably visit Roscommon hospital once per week.  Each time, I see someone carrying a file or the files office is busy.</p><p>  Contrary to what people might believe, Roscommon hospital is certainly not closed.  It is actually twice as busy as it was in 2011 before the famous downgrading of its accident and emergency department.  What is important is that its patients are much safer.  At the time, everyone claimed that the hospital would close.  This Government claimed otherwise, and now the hospital is still open.  People claimed there would be job losses, but not one person has lost his or her job.  In fact, more people are working there now.  It was also claimed that patients would die, but not one patient has died and at least 50 lives have been saved through the use of advanced paramedics and air ambulances.  Previously, if one was in an accident or suffered a cardiac arrest, an ambulance came to collect one and brought one to Roscommon's accident and emergency department to be stabilised before being sent on to Galway.  People called Roscommon's accident and emergency department a real one, but it was not.  It did not have a cardiac surgeon or a paediatric surgeon, someone to intubate or someone to provide night-time cover.  Let us dispel the myths.  The Government took HIQA's advice.  Ms Tracey Cooper of HIQA stated that the department was unsafe because fewer than 20 people used it per day.</p><p>  The population of County Roscommon is a little over 50,000.  Where Deputy Naughten comes from in south Roscommon, people have always used the accident and emergency department in Ballinasloe.  Where I come from in north Roscommon, we have always used the department in Sligo.  Roscommon town has a population of 5,000 people.  The days of having an accident and emergency department in every provincial or large town are a thing of the past.</p><p>However, I am happy to say that in less than two months, the turning of the sod for the new endoscopy unit will take place.  That is a &euro;5 million development and another &euro;5 million will be provided for a palliative care wing.  I hope we will have a rehabilitation consultant for the west as well.  What is happening is fantastic, but patient safety is there.</p><p> It was said we would not get an air ambulance, but it has saved lives.  Instead of going to any accident and emergency department, a paramedic comes out, deals with people who have heart attacks or who are in car crashes and gets them as quickly as possible to a real accident and emergency department.  This issue of being more than an hour and a half from Galway is simply untrue.  At least 50 lives have been saved in County Roscommon, and I ask people to call into the hospital and ask the consultants - Gerry O'Meara and Liam McMullen - if this hospital is safer, if it is busier, and whether they are satisfied with the hospital, and they will tell them.  For two and a half years I have asked the local newspapers, the national media and the local radio station to make a telephone call to or to call into the hospital, but they do not want to do so.  I have asked politicians to go and talk to the consultants who wrote the letter to say the accident and emergency department was unsafe, yet they still do not want to go in.  It is not a race to the bottom.  If politicians make a mistake, we put up our hands and say so.  However, this was a good news story so people should talk to those consultants and they will tell them.  For two and a half years, no one wanted to go in because when they get it wrong, they are afraid to put up their hands and say they got it wrong.  I am sick and tired of everybody going on to the radio and saying that the hospital will close, people will lose their jobs, and people will die, because none of these things has happened.</p><p> I was there seven days before that famous vote.  Tracey Cooper stated she would not allow the accident and emergency department to remain open because it was unsafe.  It was unsafe because when only 20 people were using it per day, a cardiac surgeon there would become deskilled.  People did not listen and they said that HIQA did not come to inspect it.  I was there and I know what went on, and if I had to make the same decision again, there is only one decision I could make, which was the right decision.</p><p> We were talking about putting a new endoscopy unit in Roscommon, and we were talking about putting it over the current urgent care centre, which was the accident and emergency centre.  It could not be done because we would have had to move the files office, and there were so many files that it would be ridiculous.  It was proposed to leave the files office where it was AND to move the endoscopy into a portakabin outside, which was going to cost almost as much as the building.  This was more HSE madness.  What were they doing in the Past 15 years to look at health identifiers for patient safety?  They did nothing and now it is all about files.</p><p> I pay tribute to the Minister of State and his team.  We are working in a health system where there is 20% less in the budget and 10% fewer staff.  In the face of some outrageous, sometimes misinformed and sometimes informed debate, we have kept the system going.  Not everything is perfect, but this is another step in the right direction and I congratulate the Minister of State.</p><p> Employees, health professionals and service providers will have a unique identifier, and that is very welcome because, over the years, we had a reverence for doctors and consultants who we feel should know everything.  They do not know everything.  When I was growing up, if a person liked the drink, then he was an alcoholic but a great doctor.  How could someone be a great doctor and an alcoholic at the same time?  However, if someone was a tradesman and an alcoholic, he was a low-life.  We had that kind of admiration of the professional classes.  What is the difference between God and a consultant?  God does not think he is a consultant.   That is the thing with these consultants and rightly so perhaps, because they save people's lives and they work extremely hard.  Between the doctors and the nurses in the hospitals, they have saved lives, but that is what health professionals are supposed to do and that is what they get paid for.  They work in very difficult times, but we must cut down this love affair with professionals.  With the increase in social media outlets and even being able to ask questions in the D&aacute;il, we have broken down those mysteries that people were able to work behind.</p><p> I agree with the 2008 report of the commission on patient safety.  It is building a culture of patient safety, and the development and implementation of a unique identifier for the health service was recommended.  We need to look at what has happened in Scandinavian countries.  They are certainly the role model and I hope the Minister of State and his team examined that model.  It is much less complicated, and we always seem to like to complicate things.  We need to look at the data protection issue as well.  We did not have a data protection culture in this country, because a person could be tipped off by someone they knew that this or that was happening.  I remember people not wanting to go to an automatic system with telephone exchanges years ago, because we wanted to keep our local operators in the telephone exchange, but then they often listened into conversations.  We did not know about data protection, and now we have a much better awareness of it.</p><p> This could be a case for introducing a national identity card, because it should not stop with medical records.  I can understand why medical records are separate from this, but I do not think a national identity card is an intrusion on rights or a form of Big Brother, but rather a welcome requirement.  We should have nothing to fear from identity cards.  They are not an infringement on our rights.   They ensure the process of administration is simplified.  Deputy Mitchell pointed out that 30% of the health budget is spent on administration and I think this is a great case.  Health care reform has faced many obstacles but what has gone on has been very good for the country.  The health identifier system will improve access and quality of health care, and that must be welcomed.</p><p>When people make statements about hospitals and health care, they should be conscious that when they undermine a hospital or health service, they drive the fear of God into people.  For two years, signs were erected in County Roscommon with slogans such as "People will die" and "Nearest A&amp;E - 150 km".  Roscommon County Council applied the law in two different ways.  It allowed these signs to remain in place for two years without imposing one fine on the sponsors who were local businesses.  I did not press for fines to be imposed.  However, when Fine Gael Party signs supporting Gay Mitchell were not removed within one week of the presidential election, the council issued the party with two fines of &euro;150.  What was the public servant in the relevant office doing?  Was this a fair approach?  While I did not do anything about it, some public servants need to remember that they must be impartial and must not take action on the basis of a dislike of a political party.</p><p> I accept that the Fine Gael Party should have been fined but in the past we would have received a telephone call about election posters.  How can one prevent someone from taking down a sign, putting it up one week later and calling the county council to ask that the relevant party, whether Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party or Sinn F&eacute;in, be fined for not removing election material?  The law was not applied fairly in this case because people in positions of authority decided not to take action in a case where the issue was emotive and related to health.  While I accept that fines can be imposed for not removing election posters, there is nothing to prevent someone from removing a poster for a Fine Gael local election candidate and subsequently erecting it again a week later before mischievously telephoning the council to express outrage and ask that the party be fined.  There were more than 900 signs in place for at least four months before the two fines were imposed on my party.  The decisions taken by the council on this matter do not reflect well on its fairness or otherwise.  I have not raised this issue previously but do so now because it needs to be noted.</p><p> Figures were published several weeks ago on the safety of cardiac patients in hospitals.  The figures were not used as a reason for closing the accident and emergency unit in Roscommon hospital.  They served as a signpost and I invite people to read the relevant report and make up their own minds on them.  The figures were twisted to suggest the Minister had used incorrect information in the D&aacute;il and resulted in calls for him to resign.  I pointed out in a radio interview that certain Deputies had cited the most outlandish figures in the House, twisted stories and made erroneous statements in newspapers and on radio without being once asked whether they had been wrong.  Two years ago, the Deputies in question stated this or that facility would close.  Perhaps it is time to ask them whether they were wrong.</p><p> When I was in opposition, I used to compliment and support the Government when it had good ideas.  If we are honourable, we should put up our hands and admit when we are wrong.  I do not want to tell people they were wrong but they were.  If they have any backbone, they should admit that Roscommon hospital is safer than it was two years ago and will be twice as big and five times busier when the current plans have been implemented.  Most important, people in County Roscommon, especially Roscommon town, are safer than they were as a result of the action taken by the Government.</p><p> I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, on introducing this Bill, which enjoys cross-party support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700036#JJ00200"><p>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on the Health Identifiers Bill and welcome their support for what is proposed.</p><p>  This Government is committed to a very ambitious programme of reform, at the heart of which is the care and safety of the patient.  The focus of this debate is the Health Identifiers Bill which, as the Minister set out in his statement, is an initiative that has the potential to support health reform goals and bring a range of benefits across the health system in a number of areas.  The principal benefit of the identifier system will be in individual patient care and safety and ensuring the right information is associated with the right individual at the point of care.</p><p>  I propose to address briefly some general and specific points made by Deputies in their contributions.  Speakers raised the matter of the Bill and patient information.  Deputy Kelleher read into the record an e-mail he received from persons with concerns regarding the disclosure of personal health data for research and other purposes and recording their apprehension or fear about access to centralised medical records.  It is important to clarify that while the Bill introduces a framework for using the individual health identifier or IHI, it does not change the existing law on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of personal health data or the creation of medical records databases.</p><p>  I am aware there is some controversy in England about the establishment of a national medical records database by the National Health Service, the uses to which the data involved can be put and the persons to whom the data can be disclosed.  This Bill is not about such databases.  The only national registers created under the Bill are the registers to hold the individual health identifiers and provider identifiers and the appropriate related identifying particulars, such as name, address and date of birth.  The Bill specifically provides that the identifying particulars relating to an individual's health identifier cannot contain clinical data relating to the individual.</p><p>  The law on the sharing of personal health data continues to be governed by the Data Protection Acts.  The Health Identifiers Bill, which has been discussed with the Office of the Data Protection Commission, is designed to ensure the individual health identifier is associated with an individual's medical records and related medical correspondence.  This will help ensure the individual can be uniquely and quickly identified during each engagement with the health system.  Furthermore, the persons who can access the IHI register and the purposes for which they can access it and use the IHI and the identifying particulars in the register are set out fully in the Bill, as are the persons to whom they can disclose such information.</p><p>  Deputies mentioned access by individuals to their medical records. The Data Protection Acts and freedom of information legislation provide a statutory framework for an individual to seek access to his or her personal health data.  The requirement under the Bill to associate the individual health identifier with a patient's medical record and related correspondence should facilitate such access, as it will ensure that records associated with the individual can be identified more readily and made available to the individual concerned where he or she seeks them.</p><p>  As I stated, the Bill was discussed with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  This reflects our concern to address privacy considerations fully in the governance structure.  In that regard, it is important to make clear that the Bill gives an express role to the commissioner in a number of areas, for example, where the Minister proposes to add to the number of specified persons or the identifying particulars for the individual health identifier.  This is in addition to the Data Protection Commissioner's general role, under the Data Protection Acts, in regulating the processing of personal data.</p><p>  I note Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's views on section 5(3).  This subsection is included in the Bill to make clear that the assigning of an individual health identifier to an individual shall not be regarded in any way as indicating in itself an entitlement to, or eligibility for, the provision of a health service to the individual.  As stated by the Minister in his opening speech, the main purpose of the Health Identifiers Bill 2013 is to put in place a legislative framework for individual health identifiers.  Eligibility for health services is a separate issue.  While it has been canvassed by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in as issue for this legislation, it is provided for in other legislation.  In so far as there is necessity for a debate in that regard, that ought to happen in the context of that other legislation or new legislation that a Deputy might wish to propose for introduction to the House.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Kelleher's remarks in the earlier part of this debate in regard to the potential of e-medicine and e-health for Ireland.  The scope of the potential of e-health includes improving the health and quality of life of our population and better quality health services at lower cost.  It also extends beyond the health sector to improving the economic health of the nation through its potential for job creation.</p><p>  The Minister published the e-health strategy for Ireland last December.  It identifies a series of high level actions to achieve these objectives.  It will bring all stakeholders together, including Government, industry, health care providers and academia, under the umbrella of e-Health Ireland, which will be established initially in the HSE to move Ireland towards the vanguard of e-enabled health care.  Health identifiers will be another enabler of e-health.  I am sure Deputies will agree that the assurances the new identifier system will bring to the<i></i>identification of patients will be of considerable importance in enhancing patient safety in the excellent potential real world examples of e-health applications, as described by Deputy Kelleher in his contribution to the debate on the Bill.</p><p>  Health care in Ireland is changing radically and future health care systems will need to be radically different to respond efficiently and effectively to forecasted demand.  A unique identifier system is an essential element underpinning the changes that are being, and will continue to be, introduced to address those challenges and to ensure the patient stays where he or she belongs, which is at the centre of the health system.  The Bill before the House is about making that happen.</p></speech>

This follows on from the enactment of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 under which the HSE board was abolished and replaced by the directorate.  Under the existing system, which developed following establishment of the HSE, the Minister can abdicate almost all responsibility for the operation of the health service provision.  This is being changed.  I welcome that.</p><p>  Before speaking further on the Bill I want to raise an issue of concern in relation to funding of mental health services.  I will try to be as brief as possible.  In 2012, the Government allocated an additional &euro;35 million for development of the mental health services, including recruitment of 414 whole-time equivalent professionals to develop the community mental health service.  Recruitment did not commence until October of that year.  By the end of the year, no staff had been recruited.  However, &euro;2 million was allocated to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, which brought its budget to approximately &euro;4 million.  This means &euro;33 million of the &euro;35 million, or 94%, was not spent on that for which it had been allocated.  I am informed it was spent in the mental health area.  On what was it spent?  When I asked that question during a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children one of the officials accompanying Mr. O'Brien, told me that it went towards the budget deficit.  </p><p>  In 2013, 447 staff were to be recruited but only 137 were recruited.  Had the 414 staff from the previous year been recruited they would have had to be paid in 2013.  This means the &euro;35 million had to be allocated on a continuous basis otherwise staff would have had to be let go.  In all, 513 staff were recruited.  Assuming that 50% were recruited in the first half of that year and the other 50% were recruited in the second half of the year, this means only 30% of the &euro;70 million was allocated that year, plus an additional &euro;4 million to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, again almost doubling its allocation.  This means &euro;45 million of the &euro;70 was spent elsewhere.  Where did it go?  In two years, &euro;78 million was not spent on that for which it was allocated.  Where was it spent?  I am informed it was spent in the mental health services area but was it used to meet a deficit of moneys moved out of the mental health services?  Perhaps the Minister of State would throw some light on that issue when replying to the Second Stage debate. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill 2013 provides for the disestablishment of the Vote of the HSE and the funding of the HSE from 1 January 2015 from the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health.  It establishes a new financial governance structure for the HSE, which is necessary as the existing statutory system of control, which exists by virtue of the HSE having its own Vote, will no longer apply.  The Bill gives the Minister the power to set a net budget for the HSE and to approve, as part of the service plan, that if the HSE exceeds its budget in one year, it must discharge its liabilities arising as a first charge the following year.  The Bill also imposes certain legal obligations on the Director-General of the HSE to ensure that the executive operates within the financial limits imposed by the Minister and provides for a new procedure for the approval of capital plans.  </p><p>  The purpose of the 2004 Bill was to give the HSE greater operational autonomy from what was seen as a politicised decision-making system but it crucially weakened the accountability of the HSE to the Minister for Health and his Department.</p><p>Experience has shown how flawed it was to remove the accountability of this House and the Minister for what was happening with the finances allocated to the Department of Health.  The Bill seeks to rectify this situation by restoring the Vote of the HSE to the Office of the Minister for Health and thus re-establish appropriate and proper accountability for the HSE to the Government.</p><p> This is another step on the reform journey along with the dissolution of the HSE, the establishment of a health commissioning agency, new community care structures and the establishment of hospital trusts.  It is appropriate that the Minister has been progressing reform since the publication of the Future Health document a little over one year ago.  The Minister published reports on establishing hospital groups and on the future of smaller hospitals.  Since that publication the Minister and the Government have appointed chairpersons for each of the seven groups and they are currently in the process of appointing senior executive officers.</p><p> In March 2013 the Minister published Healthy Ireland, the Government strategy document for empowering people to get healthier.  The Government also published Tobacco Free Ireland, the strategy for making Ireland tobacco-free by 2025.  Furthermore, the Government has published a package of measures to tackle alcohol misuse in the form of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children is finalising the report on obesity in children, which will be a relevant contribution and I hope the Joint Committee on Health and Children will publish that document in the near future.  I pay tribute to Deputy Fitzpatrick, who did a good deal of work and research for the committee.  He put in considerable effort to produce a worthwhile report on child obesity, which is a growing problem in Ireland, as has been highlighted in recent years.  I am pleased to support the Bill.</p></speech>

The reforms are intended to abolish the HSE budget and subsume it into the Department of Health budget.  There will be a new financial governance model and a rule whereby if there is over-spending it will have to be rowed back in the next year.  There are also new responsibilities for the director of the HSE.  We know what the Bill is about but the question I am asking is whether this will solve the problem.  Will this reconfigure it?  How do we get the best value from the large amount of money that we spend on health services?</p><p>  I do not dispute the value in there being one budget.  In fact, it is useful to have some debate around the budget and it will be directly under the responsibility of the Parliament.  However, I question whether it will achieve much in reality and I say as much for several reasons.  Since the time the Health Service Executive was established I have been critical of the institutional arrangements and I believe these institutional arrangements are at the heart of the problem.  Where there have been reforms I believe they have been rather superficial.  The old health boards, more or less, still exist, the HSE is on top of them, there is a governance arrangement on top of it, in turn, and then there is the Minister.  One need only look at the HSE website to see that there is chaos in the institutional arrangements.  A look at any website tells us something about what is behind it.  It is impossible to find telephone numbers on the site and generally it is very fragmented.  It is guaranteed that when we see that pattern we will see duplication and confusion.  It screams out to me that the institutional arrangements require significant amendment.</p><p>  Within the HSE there are many good and dedicated people who are working hard and who feel rather put upon because of the constant criticism of the HSE, something these people all take to heart.  They did not design the institutional arrangements.  I do not believe it is only a matter of the financial arrangements.  Addressing the financial arrangements will not solve the problem.  It is a rather reactive approach.  Having said that, I prefer to have oversight and those of us in the D&aacute;il can have more direct oversight in respect of the shifting of those financial arrangements.</p><p>  Clearly we need to get good value from the amount of money we expend on health care.  Some of the points included in the service plan really jumped out at me.  One particular example in the conclusions on page 7 states:<blockquote>It will be very challenging in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands being placed on the health services.  In particular, some service priorities and demographic pressures may not be met.</blockquote>I always look for the reference to demographic pressures.  Like the area the Minister represents, in my area the demographics have shifted remarkably.  There has been a disproportionately young and growing population in recent decades.  These are the areas that lose out because there is an opportunity cost.  I wish to draw attention to one particular area to highlights this, that is, therapy posts for which the embargo was lifted.  Approximately 220 new therapy staff were to be recruited.  We looked at where they were to be spread throughout the country and above all two areas jumped out.  One was Cork and the other was the area taking in Kildare, west Dublin and west Wicklow.  In the latter area some 58 of the 220 posts were to be located.  That really shone a light on the huge gap in services there.  There was a guarantee that one year afterwards, all the people would be recruited but, according to the most recent information I have, they are still not all recruited.  I asked about it early last year.</p><p>  Let us suppose &euro;20 million has been included in a budget for that recruitment but we do not recruit people until the tail end of the year.  Then, the allocation is not being used for that purpose and the money will be reallocated elsewhere.  Shifting the financial responsibility from the HSE to the Minister will not alter that.  It may well give the Minister more scope to slow down the recruitment.  Deputy Neville made a point about money allocated to mental health services that was not spent in the year for which it was allocated.</p><p>  The Charter of Fundamental Rights is something we discussed as part of the Lisbon treaty referendum.</p><p>It states that everyone has the right of access to preventative health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national law and practices.  It also states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all union policies and activities.</p><p> When it comes to the enforcement of such rights, however, they almost have to be guaranteed by the courts.  For example, Ireland would be fined by the EU if rivers were polluted and treatment plants were sub-standard.  However, we do not seem to have guaranteed rights for minimum levels of health care.  The HSE's governance arrangements will never produce an optimum result until they are fundamentally changed.  Changing financial and budgetary arrangements will not alter a system that is fundamentally flawed and reactive.  </p><p> It is a bit like a youngsters' football match.  When their team is losing, the youngsters will run in, pull out the goalkeeper and blame that player for any goals that might result.  Effectively, however, more than that is wrong in the health service.  It is not just the financial measures that are wrong, the whole structure of the HSE is wrong.  I do not see any vision to change that or any guarantee of a health system that will deliver what we signed up to as a country when people voted to include that element as part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p><p> Health service delivery depends very much on what area of the country a person is living in.  Three year olds may require speech and language therapy but if they are delayed for two years they will start school at a disadvantage and will continue to have that disadvantage right through primary school.  Delaying expenditure on such services because of the way the budget must be structured in a given year does not save money in the longer term.  There is a huge cost to individuals who are denied such services.  </p><p> I would like to see a vision for the health services.  We are told that a White Paper is on the way, which is really a Green Paper on how health services will be paid for.  I do not see the broad vision or what might be described as an &quot;NHS moment&quot; for the Irish health care system.  It is very much a piecemeal approach.  I do not have an objection to having oversight on the budget but it will not make a fundamental difference unless the Minister deals with the institutional arrangements in a much more fundamental way.</p></speech>

Successive governments have failed dismally to do this, however.</p><p>  During the economic crisis in Irish capitalism in the course of the 1980s, savage cuts were inflicted on our health services.  Thousands of beds were cut from public hospitals despite the fact that even at that stage health spending here lagged far behind comparable countries in Europe.  We now have a second major assault on our health services in the wake of the collapse of the property bubble and following the disastrous decision to bail out bankers and bondholders on the backs of working class people.  This austerity is taking billions from the pockets of ordinary people, creating huge unemployment problems and dramatically affecting the central taxation income.  In response to its disastrous policy the Government piles disaster upon disaster, with a major attack on our health services.  </p><p>  The Government currently boasts of having taken tens of thousands of jobs out of public services, including many thousands from the health service itself.  The effects of that are being shown up quite brutally around the country with the huge stress and strain on front-line workers in our health services.  Fine Gael's policy on future health funding and organisation, based on what is called universal health insurance, has dictated Government policy in this regard.  Five years ago, I analysed that Fine Gael policy called Fair Care, and my analysis stands the test of time.  According to Fine Gael, Fair Care would represent the most fundamental reform of the health system since the foundation of the State.  The new policy, however, involves a huge surge in the privatisation and marketing of health care.  It essentially hands the running of health services over to private insurance companies.  </p><p>  The Fine Gael document, Fair Care, states that Ireland has two administrative systems for health: one public, the HSE; and one private, the insurance companies.  Over time, it states, these two systems will become one run by the insurance companies.  That gives the game away.  The document is replete with the ideology and terminology of market capitalism.  For example, it states that health providers will be paid for how many patients they treat.  In addition, it states that patients will be a source of income rather than a cost, just as they are in private hospitals today.  </p><p>  The document further states that a Fine Gael government would encourage insurance companies from other European countries that have experience of implementing social insurance models to enter the Irish market.  Therefore, our health service is to become a market for competing private insurance companies.  While claiming that this Fine Gael policy will be based on a not-for-profit ethos, in reality it will involve cut-throat competition for profit in the health system.  Profit-based private insurance companies will control the entire hospital budget.  Therefore, public hospitals will be turned into autonomous units to compete with other hospitals, including private ones, for so-called business from these companies.  </p><p>  Just like the banks and developers that crashed this economy after a greed-fest that lasted years, private insurance companies are driven to maximise profits for their shareholders.  Fine Gael's policy, which is now accepted by the Government, would give such companies inordinate power over patient care.  It is clear, therefore, that in order to squeeze more profit out of the system they would, to cut costs, put relentless pressure on hospitals and others who provide health care.</p><p>As a result, hospitals, doctors, nurses, administrative staff etc., would be forced into a vicious competition driven by the commercial imperatives of the insurance companies.  This would inevitably distort what should be the basic criteria relating to proper health care, namely, protecting the health and well-being of the patient and having compassion for those who are ill.  That is the reality.</p><p> Fine Gael has stated that it relied heavily on the Dutch model when developing its own model.  Since Fine Gael's FairCare policy document was introduced, the Dutch model has been shown to be extremely prone to both crisis and ongoing difficulties.  The IMPACT trade union, which organises thousands of workers in the public health service, compiled a study, the author of which stated that in the Netherlands &quot;a system of competing private insurers has created an inequitable and inefficient system of funding, different tiers of entitlement, rising hospital deficits, and even bankrupt hospitals&quot; and that &quot;financial incentives to discharge patients early has also led to one of the highest hospital readmission rates in Europe because more people experience post-discharge complications&quot;.  Patients experienced such complications because they were turfed out of hospital early in order that the insurance companies might save money and make further profits.</p><p> It is an incredible betrayal on the part of the Labour Party that it has swallowed - lock, stock and barrel - the Fine Gael privatisation programme relating to the health service.  That programme will not only exacerbate the problems I have outlined, it will also provide for a massive new austerity tax on those people who pay their central taxes - PAYE, VAT etc. - and look to the public health service when they require care.  Those individuals will be obliged to pay an additional tax which some commentators estimate will run to &euro;1,600 per annum if the Fine Gael policy is put into effect.  Again, this involves taking the route of taxing working people further rather than making the choice - which could already have been made during this period of austerity - to, for example, tax major corporations.  Such corporations pay tax at a rate that is among the lowest in Europe.  If we take a rate of corporation tax of 8% as opposed to the headline rate of 12.5%, then based on the figures for 2010 every extra percentage point would have amounted to an additional &euro;525 million for the Exchequer.  In addition, a tax could have been imposed in respect of the huge increase in wealth that has been recorded among the extremely well off in our society in the past five years.  The resulting income from such taxes could have been invested in job creation and would have increased the State's tax take even further.  It could also have been invested in the health service and used to provide universal health care.  Such health care would have been paid for from general taxation and would have been of a very high standard.  If what I have suggested had been done, control of the health service would have been taken away from private insurance companies and the other parties that currently control it and placed in the hands of the front-line health workers who keep our hospitals and the service itself going.</p><p> On the basis of a democratic transformation of our health service such as that to which I refer and the provision of proper funding, we could deliver a service that would be supreme in terms of the level of care provided, desired outcomes for patients and the elimination of stress and worry for people as a result of the disappearance of waiting lists.  In addition, many of the difficulties being experienced at present would be removed as a result of health workers and care workers in general being placed at the very centre of the administration of the system.</p></speech>

Under the Health Act 2004 the Health Service Executive has its own Vote and is funded directly by the Exchequer separately from the Department of Health.  Effectively, this Bill will lead to the disestablishment of the HSE Vote and put in place a new statutory framework to govern the executive's expenditure.</p><p>  On occasion I have congratulated the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Martin, for certain actions he took but I also hold him responsible for establishment of the HSE.  One innovative item of legislation he introduced, as Minister, was that which introduced the smoking ban.  That legislation was introduced in the face of lobbying by publicans and others.  Deputy Martin showed courage in introducing that innovative legislation which has certainly led to lives being saved.  His timing was perfect because the smoking ban was introduced at the beginning of summer and smokers did not mind going outside to smoke in the good weather.  I have always been of the view that if it had been introduced in November or December, there would have been much more opposition because smokers would have objected to being obliged to go outside in the freezing cold.  Needless to say, the relevant legislation was necessary, innovative and welcome and it helped to save lives.</p><p>  When he was Minister, Deputy Martin made a huge mistake by facilitating the establishment of the HSE because this effectively led to power being taken out of the hands of elected representatives and placed in those of people who were answerable to no one.  The question that was asked in this regard was &quot;How much is enough?&quot; and the answer always was &quot;A little more&quot;.  In recent years the current Minister has introduced very innovative legislation designed to try to clean up the mess that was created.  When he was Minister, Deputy Martin oversaw a process whereby 147 different reports were compiled in respect of the health service.  If issues arose in respect of the health service during its time in office, the previous Administration invariably commissioned very expensive reports, which took time to compile and many of which were cumbersome, in respect of them.  Those reports were then placed on the shelf and those then in government stated that they would have eventually done something about them.  The reports in question were left to gather dust and nothing was ever going to be done about them.  That was the way the previous Government operated.  It did some good things but, unfortunately, it also did many bad things.  When good news emerged, it wanted to claim the credit.  When there was bad news, however, it hid behind the HSE.</p><p>  In the past if one wanted to get someone a bed in a hospital, one was advised not to approach a politician or go through the system.  One's local doctor or a consultant in the area would probably have known somebody who could get one a bed.  Effectively, those people were answerable to no one.  Consultants in hospitals were able to give people beds.  I know of people who handed over a few punts or euro, depending on when the incident occurred, and their mothers or whomever were kept in hospital for an extra five or seven days.  That would not happen in any other country's health system.  It was both wrong and corrupt.  Neither the HSE nor the then Government did anything about it.  I accept that not everything in the garden is rosy but at least action is now being taken.</p><p>  Deputy Higgins was correct in what he said with regard to health insurance.  My mother went into Sligo Hospital for a routine operation and was kept there for five days.  The only reason for this was that she has private health insurance.  If she had been a public patient, she would have been discharged much more quickly.  She should have been taken in, treated and discharged within a day in any event.  I raised this matter with the Minister.  I am convinced that the hospital was following the money.  My mother has private health insurance and the hospital was convinced that her insurer would just pay for her stay without question.</p><p>That is not the way to run a business.</p><p> I am pleased that at last the insurance industry is asking for proof - such as a photograph - that a bed was occupied. This may be regarded as intrusive by some but it is a way of following the money.  The health insurance premium for my mother and myself has increased but thankfully I think we can afford it.  I have an insurance policy but I would not want to be moved ahead of someone on a public waiting list because it is not fair.  The Minister has a significant challenge to address the very complicated issues of risk equalisation.  </p><p> I refer to the situation in the west.  Roscommon hospital is a small hospital which needed to recruit consultants, doctors and nurses to work in that single entity.  However, when the throughput of patients is not high, no doctor who wants accreditation or to move up the professional line will be attracted to work in small hospitals such as those at Roscommon or Ballinasloe.  I commend Bill Maher for administering the Galway hospital group which includes Roscommon, Ballinasloe, two Galway hospitals, Sligo, Letterkenny and Castlebar.  For example, a heart attack patient or a person seriously injured in a traffic accident will be brought to an accident and emergency department with a throughput of patients.  Roscommon, Portiuncula and other hospitals will provide services such as endoscopy and people will come from Dublin and Galway to Roscommon where there is plenty of parking.  They will be seen and out in a few hours and they will be well treated.  I know of constituents on a waiting list in Sligo for the treatment of varicose veins who had to wait for treatment for nine months.  I have suggested to them to try Roscommon hospital which has a waiting list of less then three weeks for the same treatment.</p><p> I support the establishment of hospital groups.  In the past a consultant would be based in Galway and would visit Roscommon once a week.  After six months the consultant would decide that he could not be bothered going to Roscommon and that the poor unfortunates in Roscommon could come to him in Galway.  Under the new arrangements, consultants and other medical staff will be required to be in Galway for two days and a day each in Sligo and Roscommon.  I commend the arrangement whereby doctors and professional staff can work on a rota between the hospitals in the group.</p><p> Health is a very emotive issue.  I wish to pay tribute to the nurses and doctors for their work which is often difficult.  However, in many cases such as this, the fight is never what the fight is about; it can be a disagreement about overtime or promotions, for example.  These issues can impede a solution of the main issue.  Much has been achieved with a budget which has been decreased by 20%, with 10% fewer staff and an 8% increase in population.  We have to make that money go further.</p><p> Fianna F&aacute;il when in government built an accident and emergency department in Roscommon hospital at a cost of &euro;7 million.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il when in government also set up HIQA which closed it down.  We must ensure the money is well spent and that patient safety is at the forefront.  I will hold the Minister to account if patient safety is undermined but I compliment him on his work so far.</p></speech>

It sets a new budget limit and it establishes the first-charge principle so that if the HSE over-runs its budget, that overrun is taken from the following year's budget.  It imposes legal obligations on the director general of the HSE to live within his or her financial limits.  All these provisions are welcome.</p><p>  The principal provision is the disestablishment from 1 January 2015 of the Vote of the HSE and the funding of the HSE through the Vote of the Minister for Health.  This is a very significant provision and is of some concern.  The reaction to this proposed legislation has been very muted in so far as there has been very little reaction from stakeholders and the media has not focused on it to any great extent.  This is to be expected because health administration tends to be a very dry subject.  People waiting on trolleys and on waiting lists always tend to get the attention of the media rather than the administration of the health service.  All of us in this House know that getting health administration right is critical to getting the front-line services right.  If there is not a robust administration many things can go wrong.  This has been evident over the years with the various configurations of the health service.</p><p>  This legislation is being introduced under the guise of greater accountability for that &euro;13 billion spend and the decision about who will be responsible for that spend.  I have serious concerns about the proposal to concentrate responsibility for expenditure of that scale in the hands of one person, the Minister for Health of the day, whoever he or she may be.  This raises significant questions about accountability and the lack of an arm's length approach by the Minister.  It is somewhat different in other Departments where much of the expenditure is already spoken for.  In the Department of Social Protection the expenditure is decided because the social welfare rates are known and there is no discretionary element.  However, the Department of Health has a significant element of discretion as to where the &euro;13 billion should be spent.  </p><p>  When one considers this legislation in combination with the HSE governance Bill, it throws the notion of proper corporate governance out the window.  There is no break on the decisions of a Minister if all that power and responsibility is vested in one person's hands.  The financial controls in the HSE are far from ideal and I would be the first to accept that there is a need to greatly strengthen those controls.  I also acknowledge the fact that some progress has been made in that area in recent times.  If full responsibility for that &euro;13 billion expenditure is being taken over by the Minister for Health and the Department of Health, where is the expertise within the Department to manage a budget of that scale?  As I am aware there is no health economist in the Department.</p><p>It is a very basic consideration where a body is taking over responsibility for a huge budget that we be assured the expertise exists within that body to manage a budget and ensure proper controls.  I have concerns in that regard.</p><p> Efforts to centralise power and control are happening in the context of what we are told is a move to universal health insurance, UHI.  We have had the removal of the board of the Health Service Executive, removal of any independent oversight, and removal of any checks and balances in regard to the budget.  All these major decisions are being taken in the context of a promised move to UHI, but we still have not seen the White Paper that was promised in the programme for Government for delivery in the early stages of the Government's term.  We are going into the fourth year of this D&aacute;il and we still have not seen it.  By all accounts, including the comments made by the T&aacute;naiste this morning, it will be some time before that White Paper is produced.  Moreover, there will be a long process to go through after that, assuming the promised White Paper is genuinely a discussion document.</p><p> While there are many excellent aspects of our health service, there are also several aspects that are seriously dysfunctional.  These dysfunctional aspects must be addressed before we move to a system of universal health insurance.  Overall, the health service does not serve patients optimally.  There is far too much emphasis on hospital care and very little on preventative medicine, early diagnosis and so on.  The greatest concerns in respect of the health service are its two-tier nature and that the cost base is far too high.  The programme for Government provides for a significant reduction in the cost base.  If that is not achieved before moving to a new system, we are merely imposing the rule of insurance companies on an already problematic and dysfunctional system.</p><p> These underlying problems must be dealt with urgently, but the promises we were given in this regard have not been delivered to date.  The greatest cost driver across the health service, in primary care and in hospitals, is drugs costs.  In spite of many promises to that effect, we have not seen the types of reductions in drugs costs that were envisaged.  We still have a situation where Irish consumers - and taxpayers, through the primary care reimbursement service - are paying multiples of what drugs cost in other jurisdictions.  Unless that issue is tackled, we will continue to see costs going through the roof.</p><p> The same applies in regard to consultants' pay.  Again, the programme for Government provided for control of the cost of consultants' remuneration.  What the Minister chose to do, however, was cut the pay of new consultants drastically.  This is having a knock-on effect in terms of discouraging people from applying for jobs here.  Why would young consultants, who have put so much time and effort into their training, be willing to work for 30% less than the people working alongside them?  Rather than tackling the problem of high pay among consultants - some 500 of whom are earning in excess of the public sector pay cap of &euro;200,000 - the Minister chose, unfortunately, to penalise new entrants.  That is having a very negative impact all around.</p><p> Another factor driving costs for consumers is the rising price of private health insurance.  Rather than tackling the problem of rising insurance costs, however, measures introduced in the last two budgets have actually made insurance less affordable.  In fact, some 6,000 people every month are leaving the private health insurance market.</p><p> No serious attempt has been made to control the costs I have referred to within the health service.  Equally, there has been no serious attempt to change the model of care.  We can only make our health service sustainable if we drastically change the model of care by switching the focus away from the most expensive care, which is acute hospital care, to community and primary care.  That is what we were promised, but it has not happened.  The narrative seems to be that introducing a limited measure of free GP care amounts to a change in the model of care when, in fact, it is only one tiny element of the change that is required.  We know that 70% of the workload in the health service relates to chronic illness.  Unless we start providing new models of care which deliver early diagnosis, early treatment and good management of chronic illness, we will not see that switch and make those savings.  Not only would we make significant savings by changing the model of care to focus on the primary care sector, we would also achieve much better health outcomes.  It is a win-win scenario.</p><p> Despite its being set out very clearly in the programme for Government that we must move activity into primary and community care, that nettle is not being grasped.  In fact, any move to a new model of care has been greatly impeded by ministerial decisions that were taken in this area.  There are clinical care programmes that set out best practice in regard to the management of the major chronic illnesses such as diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and so on - the issues that create the greatest burden of care within the health service.  It seems, however, that we are not prepared to put in place the types of programmes that would maximise the prevention of chronic illnesses and also ensure best practice in terms of their management, thereby keeping people out of hospitals.</p><p> The introduction of free GP care for children aged six and under is indicative of a one-off type of approach.  It does not seem to be part of any type of coherent plan.  It is most regrettable that the decision was taken to move away from the programme for Government commitment that the first phase of free GP care would encompass people with long-term illnesses.  A great deal of work was done in that area and it would have made absolute sense from everybody's point of view to start with the people who are most ill, namely, those with chronic illnesses.  Guaranteeing access for people in that category would have represented a real change in the model of care.  Part and parcel of the proposal to bring people with chronic illness into the free GP care initiative was to expand the capacity within primary care, including by way of the provision of increased practice supports for GPs.  A great deal of the work of chronic disease management is done by practice nurses and other therapists, as referred to by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  These professionals are essential to managing chronic illness at community and primary care level.</p><p> All those developments were possible.  Money was provided to bring people with chronic illness into a free GP care initiative and expand the capacity of primary care by recruiting additional staff.  Ideally, of course, we should be talking about fully staffed primary care teams operating from modern primary care centres.  That is not happening because there is some blockage within the Department of Health, some objection to that approach to health care.  We know the failure to introduce free GP care in 2012 was nothing to do with finances, because money was provided for it.</p><p>We know that &euro;30 million was provided for it last year, but it did not happen.  We also know that &euro;20 million was provided in 2012 for the additional therapists who were so badly needed, but the Department of Health decided to redirect that essential funding.  Instead of being spent on primary care, it was put towards the deficit that had been allowed to balloon within the Department.</p><p> When we consider what is being proposed with regard to universal health insurance, it is important to be conscious of where the funding comes from and where it goes within the health service.  We know that Exchequer funding of more than &euro;13 billion is provided each year.  It is clear from an examination of the health funding structure over the last decade or so that approximately 80% of that funding comes from the Exchequer.  Just 10% of it comes from the insurance companies and a further 10% of it comes from out-of-pocket expenses.  The moneys that people pay to GPs, which are included in the out-of-pocket expenses category, account for just 3% of total funding.  Moneys paid to consultants are also included in that category.  It is clear, therefore, that approximately 80% of all health spending is funded by the Exchequer.  The Government, in introducing universal health insurance, is proposing to redirect all of that Exchequer funding through the insurance system.  That makes no sense whatsoever, to my mind, because it will have two immediate consequences.  If we put a vast amount of Exchequer funding into insurance companies, which will have to cream off their profits, it will become dead money straight away.  As a result of its failure to control costs in the health service, the Government is likely to oversee a further escalation of health inflation.</p><p> The Government is not learning lessons from what has happened in other countries.  As we know, the Minister for Health is fond of referring to what happens in Holland.  That may have looked promising when visits were made to that country a number of years ago, but we know now that it has not worked out in Holland.  The health service was one of the biggest political hot potatoes during the most recent Dutch general election campaign.  The Government in Holland failed to provide for the enhancement of primary care.  Primary care is still very underdeveloped in Holland.  We also know that costs have gone through the roof in Holland.  When the new system was being put in place there, the issue of health inflation was not tackled and the model of care was not changed.</p><p> Not only are we proposing to put vast amounts of Exchequer funding - taxpayers' money - into the health service in a way that will allow the insurance companies to cream off their part, but we are also essentially handing responsibility for the health service to private interests.  That would constitute the privatisation of our health service, in effect.  It would be the wrong way to go.  A great deal could have been done if the Government had followed the steps set out in the programme for Government and put in place the building blocks to transform our health service, reduce costs and ensure much better health outcomes are achieved.  That plan has been bypassed in many ways.  I think it is a big mistake to seek to jump to the end point, which is to have an insurance-based system, without first putting in place the essential building blocks.</p><p> As I said during the debate on the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill, I am firmly of the view that nobody in the Government knows what the future holds for the health service.  They are going along with proposals or vague notions of the direction of travel.  I challenge anybody on the Government benches to tell me what the health service will look like in five or ten years' time.  This is a huge leap into the unknown.  It is based on vague notions of what we should be doing.  There is no clear evidence base for what is being proposed.  I am pleased that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform now seems to be sitting up and paying attention to what is being proposed.  It seems to be aware of the significant dangers that are inherent in going headlong into a whole new regime without thinking it through fully, having a clear plan in place or imposing any controls on expenditure.  I hope the Department's voice is heard in terms of where we go.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister and the Government for continuing on the road to reforming the health service by disestablishing the HSE Vote and bringing it back within the Department of Health.  The removal of political responsibility for the health service was one of the biggest mistakes to be made in the health sector in recent years.  I know from watching Oireachtas committee proceedings before I was elected to this House that Ministers used to shrug their shoulders and say &quot;nothing to do with me, not my fault, not my responsibility&quot;.  We do not want that sort of health service.</p><p>  I do not want to get into the universal health insurance debate other than to say that the sort of health service I want in five or ten years' time is one that treats people on the basis of medical need.  The debate on how we can get to that point is an important one.  I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to publish a White Paper rather than rushing straight in.  It is important to get the timing right and to consult.  We are all familiar with terrible cases of people turning up for procedures like colonoscopy only to be told they have to wait for a period of time because they do not have private health insurance.  We are aware that a person in the same circumstances who has private health insurance might be rushed straight through the following week.  We remember what happened in tragic cases like that of Susie Long when people could not access health care on the basis of medical need but were instead denied it on the basis of their ability to pay for it.</p><p>  This Bill is the latest building block in reforming the health service.  I would like to remind the House of some of the recommendations and findings that were contained in a report on the health service that the Committee of Public Accounts published in March 2013 after it had examined the HSE Vote.  Finding No. 3 was that &quot;the financial management infrastructure currently available to the HSE comprises of legacy systems from the old health boards and this infrastructure is no longer fit for purpose&quot;.  Finding No. 4, strikingly, was that &quot;the HSE is not in a position to identify the number of its former staff who are now employed as agency staff and working in the public health system&quot;.  Finding No. 9 stated:<blockquote>Sixteen voluntary hospitals receive approximately &euro;1.9 billion in grants from the HSE annually: Only two of the sixteen hospitals are audited by the C&amp;amp;AG: the remaining 14 hospitals are audited privately thus making their boards and executive unaccountable to the Committee of Public Accounts [and therefore to the taxpayer].</blockquote>Finding No. 11 stated:<blockquote>The HSE paid out over &euro;2.6 million in allowances to 31 Hospital Consultants who retired in 2011 in lieu of historic rest days that had been accumulated by the consultants during their careers.  A payment of over &euro;175,000 each was made to eight of these Consultants.</blockquote>We know where we have come from.  Now it is about how we can get to a better place.</p><p>  I want to flag two issues that need to be considered and where progress needs to be made.  I appreciate that the Minister is cognisant of these issues.  The first of the two issues is the provision of funding for people with disabilities.  This country constantly hands block grants to service providers.  I accept that many of them provide excellent services.  We consistently tell people with disabilities to go off and find an available place and to be happy with whatever place they are lucky enough to find.  As long as we continue to allow the health service to run like that, we will be unable to have proper oversight of every single cent of taxpayers' money and, much more importantly, people with disabilities will remain disempowered.  We would not tell any other group of citizens in this country &quot;take what you are given, there you go, be glad you have a place&quot;.</p><p>  We need to empower people with disabilities.  The money follows the client model must be introduced in the disability sector.  If that were to happen - if people with disabilities were given control of their destinies - many of the issues that have been examined at the Committee of Public Accounts and many of the concerns of people with disabilities would be removed.  I know there is a commitment in this respect in the programme for Government.  I know the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, are committed to it.  If we are genuine in what we say about getting a proper grip, in terms of financial control, on the Health Vote, we must take this opportunity to do so.  At the same time, we would be doing the right thing by empowering and giving an appropriate level of dignity and quality of life to people with disabilities.  We should allow them to choose the services they want, rather than handing them a place and taking control out of their hands.</p><p>  I want to raise the issue of section 38 organisations.</p><p>Between section 38 and section 39 organisations we are paying out more than &euro;3 billion in taxpayers' funds each year.  We all know the work the HSE is undertaking in trying to bring section 38 organisations into compliance with public sector pay policy, which I welcome.  I also welcome the light that has been shone on a sector that has been in darkness for far too long. All is not well, however, in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and I am not sure people realise the extent of the problems.  The HSE is quite correctly trying to bring that organisation into compliance with public sector pay policy.  I commend the job it is doing, and the dogged and determined way in which it is pursuing that.  However, if the HSE believes public sector pay policy is the only issue that needs to be addressed in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, it would be sadly mistaken.</p><p> One of the largest hospitals in the country, treating so many patients and receiving so much taxpayers' money each year, cannot even file its accounts on time year after year.  The Companies Registration Office has had to take the decision to fine it.  If any small business in any of our constituencies was not able to file its accounts on time we know it would be fined and would be disapproved of.  We also know companies take that responsibility seriously.  In this case the best-paid health administrator in the country cannot even file its accounts on time.  It is not just one year; we are now into the second year of it.  That usually indicates something is not right. It has been allowed to create a bizarre structure that is not in the interests of the public health service.  I challenge anybody to explain to me how it could possibly be in the interests of the public health system.</p><p> On 15 January I asked the Minister a parliamentary question seeking to ascertain if the Department of Health ever gave permission for public health facilities at St. Vincent's University Hospital to be mortgaged and used as collateral to build a private commercial entity.  The Minister checked his records and clarified that there was neither departmental nor ministerial consent to this.  This organisation continued to get hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money every year to run a public health service and yet it mortgaged the whole lot of it to banks to go and build a private hospital.  It did not believe it needed to check this with the Minister's predecessor or officials at the Department of Health.  It just handed over the public hospital and its lands to a bank to build a private commercial venture.  I know the HSE and the Department have made efforts to put safeguards in place for the taxpayer, which I welcome.  However, that is neither here nor there.  There is a level of arrogance in having a health entity that believes it can take our money and do what it wants.</p><p> There is no board for the public hospital at St. Vincent's.  There is an amalgamated St. Vincent's Healthcare Group board.  People seem to remain on the board forever and a day.  I am not clear how people are elected to the board.  There is one chief executive for the public and the private hospitals, an issue of which the Department is aware.  When people go to a board meeting of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which is getting hundreds of millions of euro to run two public hospitals, who is protecting the public health interest?  Does the CEO have to step into the room and say he is there to look after the commercial venture and then step back out only to come back in again?  It is ridiculous; it is like Lanigan's Ball.</p><p> It has been allowed to happen even though previous governments knew of it.  The former Minister, Ms Harney, presided over it and it has not been fixed.  While I accept we should bring the CEO's inordinately high salary into line with public sector pay policy, let us not stop there.  The model is rotten and is not working.  The model is not protecting the taxpayer and is not accountable.  As far as I can make out the model was not authorised by the Department of Health and yet it has been allowed to continue.</p><p> It gets worse.  There is a crossover of directors.  The four directors of the St. Vincent's Foundation, the fundraising arm of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group are also directors of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Those raising the money are also making the operating and commercial decisions.  I am not making a comparison to the CRC in terms of the activities, but we saw what can happen in extreme examples when those safeguards are not in place and crossover of directorships is permitted.  It is bad corporate governance, as confirmed to the Committee of Public Accounts by the HSE director general and Mr. Barry O'Brien of the HSE.  Yet it is still happening.</p><p> We invited representatives of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to appear before the committee.  They pl&aacute;m&aacute;sed us and told us we were asking very valid questions; they went off and did nothing about it.  They should be instructed to fix that today with none of the nonsense that they gave us, claiming it is very hard to find people to serve on boards.  It is not good enough and as long as they are receiving our money to run our public health service, they ought to take our concerns with more urgency than they have shown to date.</p><p> The next issue with St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is its unique interpretation of the hard-fought for consultant's contract.  It confirmed to Susan Mitchell of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>on 30 January 2011 that 220 patients had been treated by public hospital consultants in St. Vincent's Private Hospital.  Under the terms of their new contract, as the Minister knows well, newly-appointed public hospital consultants - referred to as category B contract consultants - are allowed to use 20% of their practice time to treat private patients in public hospitals.  They are not allowed to run off to the nearest private hospital and treat their patients there.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group confirmed to the same journalist on January 2011 that it allowed this to happen and that the chief executive had asked consultants to do this in &quot;special circumstances&quot;.</p><p> I have been contacted anonymously and by people who are willing to put their name to a letter, informing me that this is making it nearly impossible for other hospitals to compete for consultants because it is much more attractive to work in St Vincent's.  Obviously, that is not in the interests of our overall health service.  However, worse than that, it is depriving our public health service.  This is the problem when public and private structures are allowed to merge with one person wearing two hats.  The public hospital is being deprived of the income that would derive from treating the private patient in the public hospital.</p><p> I have heard of specific cases and I would be happy to provide the Minister with documentation.  A patient was taken into the private hospital, told they needed to go over to go to the public hospital for the procedure.  They were checked into the private hospital, saw their consultant and were then sent over to the public hospital.  They were told that when they got to the public hospital they should say they had no health insurance.  The public hospital carried out the operation to install a medical device, which may have cost more than &euro;10,000, and then the patient was wheeled back to the private hospital for the tea and toast.  This sort of scenario, where the public hospital is being used as a convenience to carry out the arduous medical work and then the private hospital is then generating income, is not acceptable, but we know it is happening.  The HSE knows it is happening and the Minister's predecessor knew it was happening.</p><p> We need to get serious about this.  The HSE does not often find itself on the right side of issues in the public mind.  I commend the proactive stance it has taken on the section 38 organisations and the comprehensive audit it has carried out.  In particular I commend Dr. Geraldine Smith, the HSE auditor, who has appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on many occasions and talked us through the audit report.</p><p> I acknowledge the excellent work being done by so many front-line staff in hospitals within the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the excellent level of care patients receive.  However, I want this House and the Government I proudly support to send a message to the group that sorting out the CEO's pay situation by the end of March is not the only issue.  We need to hear from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on the consultant's contract - it does not have a special arrangement.  We need assurances regarding the mortgaging of public hospitals to pay for private facilities.  We need it to introduce new corporate governance structures - not just tokenistic ones, but ones that will really protect the taxpayer and the public health service.  It also needs to clearly decouple the public from the private.</p><p> Enough is enough at this stage.  The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has dragged its feet.  It was the last organisation willing to reveal if it was paying top-ups and did so reluctantly just before Christmas Eve.  Its representatives then appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and, as they appeared on the same day as representative of the Central Remedial Clinic, it may have meant they did not get the same degree of media and public scrutiny that was merited.</p><p>I have heard from countless people who have serious concerns.  I share their concerns and I believe this needs to be rectified.</p><p> On a broader level, the HSE and our health services have outsourced a great of deal of funding in recent years to section 38 and section 39 agencies.  We need to have a debate on that also.  The reason we have been outsourcing funding to disability groups and public and voluntary hospitals is that as a State we have historically failed to provide those services.  While problems have arisen on occasion, one would have to worry how much worse services would have been for people with disabilities and for people reliant on health services had such organisations not stepped in and filled that breach.  I commend the great work that is done by many section 38 and section 39 agencies but it is not fair that one of the largest and best-funded agency, treating the largest number of patients, would drag its heels on catching up with where the rest of sector is and is willing to go.  In the context of financial reform, reforming the health and putting in place the new building blocks, I ask the Minister to take that message very seriously back to his officials and to the HSE.</p></speech>

That order owned the hospital grounds.  I grew up in a house at the top of Nutley Lane, off the main Stillorgan Road, and my mother still lives there and I remember that work on the site of the hospital when it was at the early foundations stage was stopped for a few years because there were no funds or resources available from anywhere to continue the building.  It then got off the ground and the structure was built.</p><p> Ireland is at a point now where we sometimes try to put a template of appraisal over whole sectors of society such as the delivery of the health service, with modern, demanding standards over established facilities that have evolved little by little over time - physically and financially and all the complications that come with that.  The Bill we are debating is the outcome of a health reform agenda set out in the programme for Government, including the commitment to dissolve the HSE and transfer its functions to other bodies as part of a wider move towards the establishment of universal health insurance.    Let us think about that.</p><p>  The objective in that statement is to get to universal health insurance.  Deputy Shortall asked whether l universal health insurance will be operated by an overall insurance body or by an amalgam of different insures in a competitive marketplace because then we will be subcontracting to free markets the funding of the delivery of health services.  Perhaps it would be better to take the clean state approach and try to estimate for a population of 4.5 million, given the demographic profile of that population, the sorts of illnesses and continuing medical services that might be required now, in the medium and longer term and put measurements on that.  That would indicate that a physical amount of delivery of services might be costed in parameter or outline terms.  Then we would have an idea of the scale of the budgetary requirements over that time profile.  </p><p>  This is an interim measure towards the goal of universal health insurance.  I have a question over what type of overall universal health insurance we will have.  Will it be a disparate free market model or a State insurance model like the State pension?  In the interim, for best efficiency and effectiveness of the cost consciousness of what we have in place, we need to revisit the accounting systems.  The best way to do that, as an interim measure, might be through activities-based accounting rather than the approach of noting what was provided last year, estimating roughly what might be needed next year and putting forward a tranche of money and getting it approved by central funding.  That is part of the proposal in this Bill, namely, to move it out of the separation between the HSE, which was some sort of amalgam umbrella of the geographically divided health boards, and the Department of Health.  That has become an awkward balancing and contrasting appraisal.  The idea now is to get it into one sweep under the Department of Health and to try to standardise, in template-type form, to get uniform measurement over the activities within the various elements of the hospitals and other location set-ups for the delivery of health.</p><p>  It is a big budget - it is a behemoth.  It is &euro;13 billion and 80% of it comes from cental funds and other bits come from insurance funding.  As Deputy Shortall pointed out, there will be an attempt to juxtaposition that funding and account must be taken of recognising the requirement by the insurers of a profit margin.  To that extent, there will be additional costs to the public.  It might be better to revisit this and go back to the first page, the blank page, and say that we will have some form of funding that will be a universal-based one but it will be along the lines of the State pensions provisioning and in the meantime we will get a handle on the activities in the delivery of health services.  </p><p>  The health services comprise not only the delivery to patients of care and the carrying out of operations but the education of the people who will be continuing to service that sector - the education of the nurses, paramedics, medics and specialists.  A holistic approach is needed and should be undertaken in a disciplined way, even as interim measures take place, and they should be interim measures and recognised as such.  </p><p>  The overall measurement and presentation of budgetary requirements can be expressed differently than they have been to date.  I find that throughout all Departments there is a sequential way of describing things that is presented in a legalistic manner.  One has to fight one's way through the sentences instead of reading them in an overall mapping sense.  Armies have the huge requirement of logistics.</p><p>Historically, the armies at Stalingrad, where there were 800,000 men on both sides on the front line, which is a total of 1.6 million people, had to be logistically provisioned.  The way that was done was not by the sort of paragraphing and legally inclined language we see in legislation.  Rather, it was very much in terms of maps, bar charts, pie charts, columns, figures and headings.  I believe that could also be helpful in appraising the overall medical sector.  When one sees things visually in headlines, columns, graphs and proportions, it is easier to understand the scale.  One can then support that with drilled down detail.  At the moment, it is a sprawling, moving octopus.  It does not make sense and is very hard to measure.</p><p> The figure of &euro;13 billion is easier to get a handle on because it can be seen as a proportion of the overall budget.  As Deputy Shortall pointed out, 80% of that is just over &euro;10 billion, so one is beginning to see things in proportion.  That &euro;10 billion is from the Central Fund and the other &euro;3 billion is divided over the health insurers and direct contributions.  The Minister knows what I am getting at, so we will not fight over the detail.</p><p> Again, when the Minister speaks of 500 consultants, what does this look like in the context of the overall head count?  The HSE and the Department of Health may have 135,000 people, so one can see the divisions and where the scale of expense lies.</p></speech>

The issue concerns the plight of the Rohingya people from Burma.  I must confess that, until very recently, it was a plight with which I was not too familiar.  In Ireland, since 2009, there have been two communities of Rohingya people in Mayo and in Carlow town.  I understand there are 75 to 80 people who were previously the occupants of refugee camps in Bangladesh and who were taken in by Ireland in 2009, having been displaced from their homeland in 1992.</p><p>  I raise the issue today with the Minister of State and the Department primarily in view of the upcoming census that is due to take place in Burma at the end of March.  As I understand it, this census is being partly funded by the European Union and it is the first such measure of population to have taken place in that country for more than 30 years.  The estimated population of Burma is 60 million people from 135 different ethnic groups, so there is a huge amount of diversity within the borders of Burma currently.  In particular, I want to speak of the plight of the Rohingya people, who are subject to terrible abuses, largely on the basis of their religion but also on the basis of pure ethnicity.  The upcoming census is not going to provide them with the opportunity to state their ethnic background.  The census forms have been printed and more than 100,000 invigilators have been appointed to cover the population of Burma.  However, as I understand it, there are only eight principal ethnic groups to which people can say they belong, when in fact on the ground in Burma there are in excess of 135 different ethnic backgrounds.  As a result, there is a great fear that many of the smaller ethnic groups within the country will just not be counted under their ethnic background, and this could have significant implications for them into the future.</p><p>  I also want to raise with the Minister the ongoing civil rights abuses that are taking place within Burma against the Rohingya people.  There was a massacre on 16 February where 16 people were shot in a wooded area on the borders of their homeland, which is near the Burma-Bangladesh border.  Has the Minister of State or his senior colleague been in a position to raise the matter of the terrible abuses to which the Rohingya are subjected routinely?  They are a peaceful people who simply wish to remain part of their own country.  They need some hope for the future.  I hope the census, which has been partly supported by the EU, may give an opportunity for the EU to have some input into the crisis that currently exists in that country.</p></speech>

The Government closely follows the situation of the Rohingya people in Myanmar-Burma.  Recently reported incidents of serious violence against the Rohingya people in Rakhine state, in particular in Du Chee Tan village in January 2014, are deeply worrying.  I welcome the announcement made by Myanmar's President, U Thein Sein, on 28 January that there would be an independent investigation into this incident.  This investigation was launched on 7 February and is due to conclude at the end of this month.</p><p>  Ireland's ambassador to Myanmar, based in our embassy in Hanoi, visited Yangon from 20 to 22 January 2014 and attended the monthly EU heads of mission meeting while there, when the situation in Rakhine was discussed.  During this latest visit, the ambassador also received updates on the situation in Rakhine from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, and from non-governmental organisations actively working in Rakhine.  From 29 January to 1 February 2014, the EU delegation in Myanmar, along with several EU heads of mission, travelled to internally displaced peoples, IDP, camps in Rakhine state to assess the overall situation in the region and get first-hand information by listening to those involved in ongoing communal conflict.</p><p>The EU has specifically called on the Government of Myanmar to address the status and welfare needs of the Rohingya people and to take a zero tolerance approach to violent extremism.  The EU has also urged Myanmar to permit the establishment of a country office of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p> Since 2007, over &euro;7 million has been provided by Irish Aid to NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long-term development and emergency and recovery responses in Myanmar.  In December 2013, the T&aacute;naiste announced an additional programme of funding worth &euro;500,000.  The EU is providing around &euro;70 million to the people of Rakhine state.  A large share of this assistance is to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of the region.</p><p> Ireland through multilateral organisations such as the EU and UN takes every opportunity to raise the plight of the Rohingya people and urge the Government of Myanmar to address humanitarian and human rights issues.  At the 23rd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in May-June 2013, Ireland and our fellow council members adopted a presidential statement regarding the situation for Muslims in Myanmar.  Council members including Ireland expressed deep concern at the gross violations of human rights against Muslims, including the Rohingya community, urged the government there to grant full citizenship rights to the Rohingya in Rakhine and review the discriminatory 1982 citizenship law.  At the upcoming 25th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council to be held from 3-28 March, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Mr. Tomas Ojea Quintana, is due to present a report on the human rights situation in the country.  The special rapporteur recently commented that the present situation in Rakhine &quot;represents a particular obstacle and a threat to the reform process&quot;.</p><p> The Irish Government is also concerned about the issue of Rohingya people forced to leave Myanmar for neighbouring countries.  There have been reports of mistreatment of Rohingya in Thailand and elsewhere.  The EU has expressed concerns to the ministry of foreign affairs and the national security council in Thailand.</p><p> Myanmar continues to undergo a process of long-awaited transition towards full democracy.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, recognises that while significant progress has been made, difficult and complex challenges remain.  The situation of the Rohingya is one such challenge which requires the care and attention of the international community and the Government of Myanmar.  Ireland will continue to utilise our bilateral and multilateral channels to urge the Government of Myanmar to address the human rights situation of the Rohingya, together with other challenges.</p></speech>

The issue I really want to highlight and which was brought to my attention is the upcoming census which, if carried out along the lines of what is expected, will not even include a categorisation for the Rohingya people.  There are about 2 million people in this population, most of whom do not live within the borders of Burma.  Many of them are scattered all over the world, particularly in Bangladesh and Thailand.  This census will take place over a 12-day period up until the end of March.  I understand it is being at least partly funded by the European Union.  The Rohingya will be classified under the heading of "other", which is not a very satisfactory classification given that I have been told there are only eight different classifications of ethnicity in the census when there are 135 different ethnic backgrounds in the country.  That is the sense of urgency.  I appreciate the Minister of State's view regarding the 1982 citizenship law, which is discriminatory.  The Rohingya people are unable to ensure their children are educated and cannot move freely about the country.  While many of them are living in refugee camps outside its borders, those who are still in Burma have very restricted lives in terms of movement and the ordinary things we all take for granted.  I appreciate the gist of the Minister of State's response about keeping it as a priority, which is to be welcomed, but perhaps there is an opportunity to broaden the classification of different ethnic groups before the first census in 31 years takes place.</p></speech>

The actual thrust of the Topical Issue made no reference to the upcoming census so I could have better information on that.  The census is being carried out in the context of forthcoming elections.  As the Deputy mentioned, there has been no census for 30 years and the EU is indeed part funding the taking of the census and the organisation of it.</p><p>  I will be meeting the ambassador of Bangladesh in the next few days.  Certainly it is an issue I can take up with him because many of the Rohingya people are originally from Bangladesh.  I will be attending the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday where I will be addressing the council on human rights.  In addition, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Mr. Tomas Ojea Quintana, will give a special report on human rights at the council so it will be an opportunity to raise it again.  I can come back to the Deputy with further information in respect of the specific issue of the census.  Indeed, if he wishes to raise a Topical Issue on the census in Myanmar, I would be very happy to come back to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1045" speakername="Derek Nolan" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700047#UU00500"><p>The carbon tax was introduced in 2010 as a very important element of our climate change strategy.  The rate of tax with effect from 1 May 2013 is based on a &euro;10 charge for CO2 and will increase to &euro;20 per tonne with effect from 1 May 2014.  This will have a particular impact on people who use solid fuel.  Leaving aside large industry, businesses and SMEs who may be able to absorb costs even though that is not even said, it will translate into a very tangible price increase of &euro;1.20 on a bag of coal and 26 cent on a bale of briquettes.  This will be a doubling of that charge on those products compared to the year before so we are talking about &euro;2.40 on a bag of coal.  One is talking about possibly two to three bags of coal per week for people who use coal as the main fuel to heat their homes, for example, pensioners who have to keep the range on to keep warm.  That is &euro;7 and if one puts that out over a year, one is talking about a significant amount of money from people who are very challenged financially at the moment.  It is not a luxury.  It is not like we are talking about incentivising and different emissions or that there are other products they can use.  If one has a range in one's house or a fire one uses to heat the home, coal is what one uses.  Unless we are going to give people grants to change their method of heating their homes completely, which I do not think is on the cards, this is simply a punitive tax on people who really cannot afford it.</p><p>  I know we have obligations in this regard but what I am asking for is that we delay it.  We are finally starting to see this little bit of hope in the economy.  People are getting back to work.  It is not there fully and we are not realising it in people's pockets.  There is a case to be made to delay the implementation of this tax to keep the bag of coal at its current price.  It is not fair to have a &euro;1.20 increase last year and another one this year so suddenly when we have not seen the impact of that bit of hope in the economy on people's pockets.  I am asking that the Department consider the cost and delay it for another year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700047#UU00600"><p>We all understand that we have obligations under the climate change agenda but there is a question here about domestic versus industrial.  The increase of &euro;1.20 last year and now another increase of &euro;1.20 represent a significant amount of money to people on limited incomes.  It has been widely reported and spoken about in this House that one in five people experiences fuel poverty.  As Deputy Nolan has said, this is not a luxury item.  It is a very basic item for people.  In urban areas like Waterford city, Dungarvan and Tramore, many people are reliant on it as are those in rural parts of my constituency in places like Lismore and Tallow.  They are reliant on solid fuel.</p><p>I do not need to tell the Minister of State that the unemployment rate in Waterford is the highest in the country, at 19%.</p><p> I concur with Deputy Nolan that we need to delay this tax and allow the economy to kick in outside the greater Dublin area.  There has been some good news in respect of jobs, but that effect has not been felt in the south east.  This punitive tax will impose difficult circumstances on people with limited incomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700048#VV00200"><p>I thank my colleagues for raising this important issue.  I have been asked by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to respond.</p><p>  The Minister provided for the application of a carbon tax to solid fuels in budget 2013.  In order to lessen the potential impact on lower income households, he chose not to introduce it until after the 2012-13 winter period and opted to introduce the tax in two phases, that is, &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne from 1 May 2014, thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels, namely, &euro;20 per tonne of CO2.  The net effect of the &euro;10 carbon tax from 1 May 2014 will be approximately &euro;1.20 on a 40 kg bag of coal and 26 cent on a bale of briquettes.</p><p>  Deputies will be aware that the application of the carbon tax to solid fuels remained subject to a ministerial commencement order dating back to 2010.  This approach was primarily adopted to delay the application of the carbon tax to solid fuel in the residential sector so as to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large-scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland, where lower sulphur standards apply.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government undertook to provide such a robust mechanism in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  As part of that exercise, the Department, in conjunction with the NSAI, consulted with a stakeholder working group that included officials from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the industry representative - the Solid Fuel Trade Group, SFTG - the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and representatives of selected local authorities.  Such a mechanism has been in place since June 2011.  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012, given the overall tax increases in budget 2012, including in the standard rate of VAT.</p><p>  The introduction of carbon tax was about sending a price signal that there was a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of our environment.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result, they are considered the dirtiest fuels and, given the environmental impact, it is important that they be taxed accordingly.</p><p>  In the context of domestic heating provision, the carbon tax is intended to apply to all types of coal and commercial peat.  According to the ESRI, low-income households usually make extensive use of cheaper, but more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal and turf.  The effect of the &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emissions from 1 May this year will result in an increase of &euro;1.20 on a bag of coal and 26 cent on a bale of briquettes.  The issue of fuel and energy poverty is being addressed through the energy affordability strategy, which aims to tackle energy affordability through a combination of institutional supports, investments in improving the energy efficiency of our housing stock and wide availability of advice on energy efficiency.  In a decision of 14 September, the Government agreed to publish the strategy with a view to its full implementation.</p><p>  While tax increases are always unpopular, where member states are under fiscal pressure it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise.  In this instance, a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our total dependence on imported fossil fuels.  Accordingly, and unfortunately for the purposes of this debate, the Minister does not intend to defer the further increase of &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emissions from 1 May.</p></speech>

They will get the contradiction quickly.  The Government decided in September to publish a strategy to deal with energy affordability with a view towards its implementation.  That strategy is still being implemented, yet we are moving ahead with a punitive increase in the cost of people's fuel.  There is a contradiction in that strategy versus &euro;1.20 extra on a bag of coal.</p><p>  I realise that the Minister of State is not the Minister for Finance, but will he ask the Minister to produce information on how much revenue will be generated this year by that tax and to reconsider the possibility of delaying its introduction by just another year to give the economy a little bit of a chance to pick up and to give people a bit of slack and breathing space?  Otherwise, a &euro;2.40 tax on a bag of coal will be applied within the space of one year.  For the people under discussion and who we are trying to represent, that is a great deal of money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700048#VV00400"><p>I concur with Deputy Nolan's sentiments.  Will the Minister of State relay our message to the Minister, Deputy Noonan?  The Government is trying to implement an energy affordability strategy.  Supports will be available to houses to make them more efficient, but what will the budget be, where will the money come from and how will people benefit from it?  Currently, much of the strategy is being delivered through Leader programmes and, for example, the Waterford city development area networks.  I hope that the reforms under way in that regard will ensure that this type of work continues, as it is of vital assistance to those on limited incomes in particular.  What resources will be put behind this strategy?</p><p>  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to allow people some time to get back on their feet before this proposed tax is imposed on 1 May.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700048#VV00500"><p>I do not want to give anyone a false impression of the Minister's position, as he is clear on this - the budget is set for this year.  Deferring this tax would effectively change a budget that had already passed through the Houses.  I appreciate the points raised by the Deputies.  The same have been raised in my constituency.  This tax is difficult for people.  One of the Minister's reasons for choosing to increase the tax on 1 May was that the winter months would be behind us and we would have some time to get ready for the next winter period.  We held a good debate on this matter in the context of the Finance Bill.</p><p>  I managed to get some information from other Departments in preparation for this debate, as the strategy on warmer homes is cross-departmental.  The State has already invested significant funds in this regard.  For instance, the national fuel scheme is a direct subsidy to the poorest homes and effectively amounts to &euro;20 per week household supplement.  More than &euro;280 million is spent on it.  This is rightly welcome, given the difficulties posed by fuel poverty, which is an issue for people with little income.</p><p>  On 18 February, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced a significant retrofitting programme for local authority housing amounting to more than &euro;30 million this year.  This will make a considerable difference.  This year's spend on the energy efficiency upgrade is &euro;57 million.  I also understand that a total of 105,000 homes have benefited in recent years from retrofits under better energy awareness housing schemes.</p><p>  We will solve this problem by improving thermal efficiency, particularly in poorer households.  The Government is committed to doing this and is rolling out a substantial investment programme.  We need to continue this initiative.</p></speech>

The experience of hard-pressed residents in Priory Hall and in other developments underlines that.  However, the regulatory measures coming into effect on 1 March will penalise own-build home owners who want to build their own family home.  One-off homes will be hit with a regulatory framework designed for large-scale developments in major towns and cities.  This will dramatically increase costs and has the potential to damage the construction industry at a time when the Government claims it is trying to boost it.  There has also been a failure of the Government to communicate the changes, leading to speculation about their impact, further damaging the construction industry.  It may well be seen as another anti-rural bias of the Government.</p><p>  The regulations can essentially be broken down into three broad principles.  Anyone wishing to building anything - with the usual exemptions - must, by law, employ what is referred to as an assigned professional, such as an engineer, architect or surveyor, to inspect the property on-site.  This assigned professional must inspect the building, and at the end of the procedures, issue a certificate warranting that they have inspected the works and that they comply with the regulations.  The professional also warrants that he or she accepts responsibility for the legal liability for the inspection of all works as necessary, to ensure they are neither defective nor contravene any requirements of the second schedule of the building regulations &quot;notwithstanding the responsibilities of other persons or firms in relation to the works&quot;.  What implications does that have for indemnity insurance?  Some would say that some have left the market or are planning to do so because of what does not appear to be a clear delineation between the owner and the inspector.  The assigned professional must submit a full set of completed drawings to the building control authority on completion.</p><p>  There are various problems with these regulations.  The cost of the regulations will place a hefty and disproportionate burden on one-off housing.  There has been no public information campaign, leading to speculation about the consequences of the changes that may potentially harm the construction sector.  What level of resources have been given to local authorities to handle the deluge of information and paperwork that will result from the new system?  When we consider the crisis in respect of roads and housing and the fact that development charges have diminished to such an extent that the income does not exist any more and there are recruitment embargoes in local authority planning departments, we should acknowledge the pressure all this will put on the system.  Up to 500 architects' practices may well be out of the loop with these inspections, with all the implications this has on that sector.</p><p>  Perhaps the Minister can respond to those issues, and maybe then I will make suggestions if I do not feel he plans to examine them.  Ultimately, I ask him to consider a deferral in the first instance, with a review panel and a targeted approach.  It is incumbent on him to consider a deferral for six months, re-engagement with the stakeholders, and to take on board some of the suggestions that have been made to me and to many of the Minister's colleagues.</p></speech>

These new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations.</p><p>  Every effort has been made to ensure arrangements are in place for a successful transition to the new building control arrangements from 1 March 2014.  Discussions have taken place with all stakeholders for the past two years in respect of implementation.  The new online building control management system has been developed to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  The local government sector has been involved from the beginning in dealing with these measures.  Briefing and guidance on the new system has been provided for local authority staff and representatives of the key construction sector professional bodies, as well as for the Construction Industry Federation in recent weeks.  The definitive code of practice for inspecting and certifying buildings and works was circulated to industry stakeholders on 7 February 2014.</p><p>  Standard forms of contracts used for both private and public sector projects fall to be revised to reflect the new regulatory environment.  The Government construction contracts committee and the key construction professional bodies both report strong progress in advancing this work within their respective sectors.  The Government has established an oversight group to ensure no unavoidable delays will occur in critical public infrastructure projects at a time when construction activity and employment depends so heavily on public sector investment.  Briefing and guidance is available within the Government and within the private sector to deal with contractual challenges and procurement issues that will inevitably arise as change takes place.  The above measures are the key supports necessary to ensure the new regulatory arrangements can work well in practice.</p><p>  The training for professionals has been taking place for the past few months.  The Construction Industry Federation, the chartered building surveyors, the chartered quantity surveyors and the local authorities have all welcomed these particular measures.  The Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland has been a bit reluctant to come to the table in respect of these matters, and there has been a difference of opinion within its own membership, and I am sure the Deputy alluded to that.  In the past ten days, however, I understand that 1,200 architects have been subject to training and are now very familiar with the new contractual obligations and regulations.</p><p>  Concerns that the new regulations prevent a self-build situation are unfounded.  I notice that on four occasions this week, misinformation was provided on Mr. Duffy's programme, in spite of the fact that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been providing the appropriate information, which he refuses to read out.  These allegations on cost are unfounded, although all house builders and owners must comply with the regulations.  An owner who intends to self-build - known as direct labour - will, as before, assume legal responsibility for ensuring the building or works concerned are compliant and he will be required, as builder, to sign the undertaking by the builder and the certificate of compliance on completion.</p><p>  As local authorities and industry move to full implementation next week, the Department will continue to work with all parties to ensure they understand their obligations and the steps necessary to meet them.  These changes are essential to deal with the disgraceful legacy issues we have seen with Priory Hall, unfinished estates and the supply of pyritic material.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700049#WW00300"><p>I agree with the Minister's final statement.  A strengthening of regulations is required to maintain and confirm that a high quality standard of building is put in place.  Notwithstanding the fact the Minister said he will not agree to a deferral, I ask him again to consider a specified term of three to six months before this comes into effect.  Would he also consider putting a review panel in place to monitor the new regulations thereafter?  This will assure us it will not have a detrimental effect on rural Ireland and on the elements of the industry that find themselves outside the loop in respect of their ability to carry out inspections.  Will he make a committed effort to launch a public information campaign to allow us to be sure the public is well aware of the implications of the changes?</p><p>  Would the Minister consider a national building inspectorate?  There could be targeted inspections, a system of licensing or registration of builders, and information on builders shared among the relevant authorities, with full prosecutions of any designers or contractors who are negligent in their duties.  An open register of inspections and prosecutions and reports of inspections could be made public.</p><p>The Minister acknowledged that developers should lodge a bond with the local authority.  This should be a mandatory rather than discretionary requirement, as is currently the case.  The bond should not be returned until such time as the council is satisfied that the development is complete and meets the required standards.  Under the current process, it may be too late when the council initiates proceedings.</p><p> I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the four or five proposals I have made before proceeding as intended on 1 March.  We must not misconstrue or misrepresent some of the comments we have heard on the public airwaves and elsewhere in the past week or two.  Many members of the public honestly believe there are means and methods to strengthen the process the Minister proposes to enable us to stand over them.  We need certainty that the system will not fail to achieve the objectives set for it, as it did in the past with detrimental results. </p></speech>

The new regulations have been the subject of consultation with all of the people involved in the construction industry for the past two years.  I am prepared to establish an oversight group, as suggested by Deputy Cowen, to monitor the implementation of the regulations.  I concur with him that the implementation of a new regime inevitably gives rise to teething problems.  Nevertheless, comprehensive consultation documents have been published, including a document strengthening the building control system, a document to inform public consultation on the draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012, which sets out the context in which the reforms will operate and their regulatory impact for building owners and industry stakeholders.  This document remains available on the Department's website.</p><p>  The arrangements being introduced for the control of building activity may result in some additional costs.  Certification will be required if one proposes to build to a higher quality design or have a risk-based inspection system.  It is not expected that single houses in rural areas will require many inspections.  However, inspections will be required for blocks of apartments and commercial developments, as we know from the past.  The costs will be modest compared to the outcome.  </p><p>  A register of builders will be established on a voluntary basis in 2014 and will be made statutory in 2015.  I am proceeding with this measure, with which the Construction Industry Federation agrees. </p><p>  Owners and developers who are worried about these matters, for example, draughtsmen, who tend to work in rural communities, will be able to proceed as present on a direct build basis.  They will, however, be required to have an architect, building surveyor or chartered surveyor sign off the job to certify it has been done properly.  This requirement has always been in place but was not always complied with.  If individuals who do a good job want to register with the professional bodies, I appeal to them to do so.  I have commissioned a report from the chairman of the architects admissions board, Mr. Garrett Fennell, to examine how to make it easier to register with the professional bodies.  I will immediately implement Mr. Fennell's recommendations to enable people to become the assigned certifiers in respect of the regulations. </p><p>  I assure Deputy Cowen that all of the nonsense on RTE this week is absolute misinformation to the extent that it is being claimed that the cost of building a house by direct labour in a rural area will increase by as much as &euro;50,000.  Additional compliance should cost between &euro;1,000 and &euro;3,000, depending on market forces and where the best deal can be secured.  I encourage small business professionals, such as draughtsmen, to register with the professional bodies in order that they can act as assigned certifiers.  I will careful monitor the position to ensure the regulations are implemented fairly. </p></speech>

Reviews are frequently carried out soon after the medical card has been granted.  I am aware of a number of cases where reviews are being done of medical cards that were allocated until April 2015.  A problem arises because the evidence provided by medical card holders is not retained and is, therefore, not available to the officials carrying out the review.  This means the medical card holder must gather this evidence again as part of the review, which can be costly, especially if they need to visit a general practitioner or consultant.  While data protection issues may well arise in these circumstances, these could be overcome if medical card holders were asked to sign a data protection waiver.</p><p>  I will illustrate the problem I describe by citing a number of cases with which I am dealing.  One case involves a young father aged in his 30s who has experienced kidney failure and is being maintained on medication.  He is not yet on dialysis.  The young man has a mortgage to pay and was awarded a medical card on medical hardship grounds.  As part of the review, he must again gather all the evidence he provided for the initial application.  His medical card has been withdrawn and he has lodged an appeal.  It will not be in anyone's interests if this man cannot afford his medication as the cost to the health service will be higher. </p><p>  Another case involves an eight year old child with profound disabilities who is in a wheelchair and is fed through a tube.  She has the mental age of an eight month old baby and while her parents would love her medical diagnosis to change, that will not happen.  The child was awarded a medical card until April 2015 but an early review was initiated, with the result that the parents must go through the whole process of gathering the evidence again because it is not retained by the relevant officials.  The same problem arises in respect of another child with a heart problem, which is not likely to change.</p><p>  In another case, a man in his early 60s who is receiving chemotherapy treatment is unable to work because his condition has worsened.  The family do not want to get a letter stating his condition is terminal because they want to hold out some hope.  He, too, is being put through a rigorous review.</p><p>  While I understand that people's financial circumstances change, the medical conditions of many of the individuals in question are unlikely to change.  I ask that the rules governing medical card reviews be relaxed to assist people who genuinely need a medical card for reasons of medical hardship.  They should not have to endure the torture of having to repeatedly gather certain information given that their health condition will not change.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700050#XX00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</p><p>  Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is founded primarily on the undue financial hardship test.  Under the legislation, determination of an individual's eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The 1970 Health Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.  If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds for eligibility for a medical card or a GP visit card, as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of medical or social circumstances, which could result in undue financial hardship.  However, even where a person exceeds these financial thresholds, eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot access general practitioner or other medical services without undue financial hardship.  In these cases, social and medical issues are taken into consideration by the HSE when making a decision on eligibility.</p><p>  It is important to note that discretion is not a stand-alone exercise.  Exercising discretion remains an integral part of the assessment process for a medical card. </p><p>Eligibility for a medical card continues for as long as a person meets the criteria set out in the Health Act.  The legislation requires a person to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances, including income, expenditure, medical or social issues, which renders them no longer entitled to a medical card.  In practice, few people do so.  As a result, the HSE has an obligation to ensure that the medical card register is as accurate as possible and that its voted budget is being spent appropriately in the medical card scheme.  One recognised auditing practice now carried out by the HSE is random reviews.</p><p> All card holders, irrespective of the basis on which the card was awarded, may be subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility.  As Deputies will be aware, each person eligible to a medical or GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &quot;valid to&quot; date is printed.  This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person. Notwithstanding the &quot;valid to&quot; date printed on the card, the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility at any time and to take appropriate action in circumstances where the cardholder no longer fulfils the criteria for eligibility under the medical card-GP visit card national assessment guidelines.  </p><p> Persons who have been granted a medical card under the financial hardship provisions of the medical card scheme are required, when the subject of a review assessment, to submit all relevant and up-to-date details.  This is necessary so that the HSE can make a correct determination of continuing eligibility.  Where an applicant indicates on a review application that medical evidence has been previously submitted relating to a life-long medical condition, and this has been confirmed by the HSE, the HSE will not request further medical evidence in this regard.  The applicant will, however, be required to submit all other information material to a review assessment.</p><p> A critical element of probity in the medical card scheme is the ongoing review of client eligibility by the HSE.  Overall, the HSE assessed the eligibility of more than 700,000 individuals in 2013. More than 95% of complete applications were processed within the 15 working days target.  I am satisfied that all reviews undertaken are appropriate and carried out in an appropriate and a facilitative manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-02-27a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022700051#YY00200"><p>The Minister stated in his reply that additional information will not be sought in respect of a life-long condition.  However, that is not the true in two of the cases which I have brought to the Minister's attention.  I will bring that information to the attention of the HSE, using the reply given to me today by the Minister.</p><p>  I understand that economic situations can change and I am not disputing that reviews should be carried out.  However, requiring a person who, for example, is suffering kidney failure and is in receipt of chemotherapy and cannot work to provide information which it is costly to obtain in order to prove that he or she has a medical condition is unfair.  The Minister said that the expiry date on the card is the latest date for a review.  In the cases of the two children I mentioned the cards were valid to end April 2015 and they had been issued on a three-year basis.  There appears to be a systematic review that occurs way short of the expiry date of the card.  </p><p>  The Minister will be aware that for a child with a major disability, such as one of the children to whom I referred, a medical card is of critical importance in the context of access to other services within the HSE, including a public health nurse and so on.  As such the medical card becomes critically important in keeping a child like that in reasonable health.  I hope the Minister will consider requesting that further changes be made.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that people whose condition is not going to change not be asked to provide the same information in a fairly short timeframe, when doing so puts them under huge pressure.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is anybody in this House who wishes to see families who already are bearing the burden of ill-health or life-long disability subjected to unnecessary distress.  That is certainly not what I, as a doctor or a Minister, want to see.  I would like to see a situation whereby if medical cards are selected for random review and a desk-top study reveals that the person's situation is unlikely to have changed because he or she has a life-long condition, terminal illness, renal failure or other such problems which are unlikely to have improved, they will be set aside until the regular review is due.  I will raise that matter with the PCRS and the Minister of State, Deputy White.</p><p>  We do have to audit our system.  If we did not, the Deputies across might not be the first but they would certainly be among those who at the Committee of Public Accounts would hold me to account for not guarding scarce public resources and ensuring they go to those who need them most.  We know that we have a lot of need in our society, that we need to bring fairness and equity to the system and that in the past people in some parts of the country could get medical cards based on very loose criteria while those desperately in need in other parts of the country could not.  As stated by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Buttimer, in the old days in certain parts all it took was a telephone call and a representation and a person got a medical card.  That is not fair.</p><p>  We want equity in the system in so far as we can.  We want consistency of approach.  I believe in discretion.  Not long after I became Minister I asked the PCRS to set up a team of doctors to ensure that there was a medical input in terms of discretion.  They do their best to ensure that people who have life-long conditions, disabilities and other serious conditions that are unlikely to improve are given medical cards.  Even those who may now have a poor outlook but may improve in six months or a year's time with new treatment, etc., get the benefit of the doubt in all cases.  That is what we try to achieve.  In any system of the size of the PCRS, with almost 2 million people on medical or GP visit cards, people will fall through the cracks.  A good system should try to catch them.  This Chamber is another avenue in which to highlight those cases.  I welcome when cases are highlighted so that I can look into them and ensure that all matters have been carried out in a way that allows those who are most vulnerable in our society to get the most help and support that we can give them.  That is the purpose and function of the health service.</p></speech>
