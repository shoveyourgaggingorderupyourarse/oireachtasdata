that child poverty is an indictment of our State, robbing children of their childhoods, their health and well-being and squanders a child&rsquo;s potential later in life;<br /><br />&mdash; that consistent child poverty is the harshest form of poverty where children live in households below 60 per cent of the national median income, and experience deprivation based on 11 deprivation indicators;<br /><br />&mdash; that despite the removal of 14,000 children from consistent child poverty during the lifetime of previous Governments (between 2011 and 2018) the number of children at risk of poverty or in consistent poverty remains unacceptably high, over 200,000 children are currently at risk of poverty and among these children more than 90,000 are in consistent poverty;<br /><br />&mdash; that the previous Government&rsquo;s target to reduce the number in child poverty by 70,000 by the end of this year, as indicated in the publication, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020 (Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures), will not be reached;<br /><br />&mdash; that this wholly unambitious target is unlikely to offset the Economic and Social Research Institute&rsquo;s (ESRI) prediction of a one-quarter increase in the rate of child income poverty by the end of 2020 if the economy does not recover due to the Covid-19 pandemic;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Government has recommitted to the original target stated in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 and in the Programme for Government, however, very significant action will be needed in order to achieve these targets;<br /><br />&mdash; the regrettable reality that child poverty rates in Ireland doubled during the last recession resulting in one in every five children currently at risk of poverty <br /><br />&mdash; a stark reminder of the risk for children in the current recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic;<br /><br />&mdash; that for many children, the current recession will be the second one in their lifetimes, meaning for some, they will never have benefited from improved economic conditions;<br /><br />&mdash; that children who experience poverty have poorer physical and mental health, experience social and educational deprivation, contributing to a lower sense of well-being and less opportunities later in life; and<br /><br />&mdash; that investing in poverty reduction measures leads to better outcomes not only for children and their families, but for society as a whole; </blockquote>acknowledges that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; this Government has an opportunity to end consistent child poverty in Ireland once and for all;<br /><br />&mdash; the upcoming Budget 2021 is an opportunity to allocate the necessary resources to address consistent child poverty in this State; and<br /><br />&mdash; a systemic approach to ending child poverty is required in Ireland, reflecting the ambition of the European Union (EU) Child Guarantee that every child in Europe should have access to free healthcare, free childcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition with a primary focus on disadvantaged children, including those experiencing poverty, ethnic minority children and refugee children; </blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> 	&mdash; agree to a new and ambitious target of eliminating consistent child poverty within the lifetime of this D&aacute;il;<br /><br />&mdash; legislate for the target to eliminate consistent child poverty within the lifetime of the current D&aacute;il;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure the establishment of an Oireachtas Special Oversight Committee on Child Poverty to monitor the implementation of this target;<br /><br />&mdash; establish a cross-Departmental Child Poverty Unit headed by the Department of the Taoiseach, tasked with the following: <blockquote> 	&mdash; develop a comprehensive all-of-Government strategy and implementation plan to meet the target of eliminating consistent child poverty within the lifetime of this D&aacute;il;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that the elimination of consistent child poverty target is a central focus in the new National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Strategy;<br /><br />&mdash; present an annual report to the Oireachtas Special Oversight Committee on Child Poverty on the progress of the implementation of this strategy and the implementation plan for the new target;<br /><br />&mdash; establishing interim targets between annual budgetary cycles;<br /><br />&mdash; undertake a child poverty audit of all policies across key Departments affecting children and their rights, ensuring that all annual budgets and Departmental budgetary decisions are poverty-proofed, transparent and fair;<br /><br />&mdash; assist in the design of national initiatives to end child poverty;<br /><br />&mdash; reform the current way in which child poverty and overall poverty is measured using the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data and minimal essential budgets;<br /><br />&mdash; carry out research and make recommendations to the Government on the required levels of investment for services that focus on inclusive universal health development services, early years education, school supports, disability supports, social housing, childcare and one parent family supports in line with EU Child Guarantee ambitions; and<br /><br />&mdash; monitor the State&rsquo;s implementation of the EU Child Guarantee and Article 27 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; and </blockquote>&mdash; ensure that adequate funds and resources are provided to facilitate the establishment of the cross-Departmental unit.&quot; </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>Some 90,000 children in Ireland live in consistent poverty.  That is 90,000 children who live in households where there is very little income and which cannot afford very simple things like a warm winter coat, to heat the home or a warm, roast dinner once a week.  That is 90,000 children who we as a State have failed to protect in their most vulnerable position.  None of those 90,000 children has chosen to be in the position they are in; we in this Chamber and successive Governments have made that choice for them.  Today we have a choice to think differently.  Targets to reduce consistent poverty have come and gone over the years and have not made the difference they needed to make.  As such, the time has now come to ensure we eliminate consistent poverty for our children once and for all.</p><p>The Social Democrats are putting forward a motion to eliminate consistent child poverty and I will outline how we propose to do that.  Our proposal was developed by listening to those on the front line, the NGOs and the child poverty agencies and by looking overseas to see where other countries have done it.  Ireland is not an outlier in this regard; child poverty is a problem in many countries.  Some of the countries which have taken the strongest steps to eliminate consistent child poverty are those which have legislated for it and that is something we are also putting forward in our motion today.  The one consistent point coming out of discussions in the international sphere is that this was done on a whole-of-government basis and across all parties.  That is something we must do here if we really want to address the issue.  I ask Members listening to my speech to do so without their party political hat on and instead to listen as a parent, brother or sister, neighbour or community member.  We need leadership on this issue and we can take that leadership step today.</p><p>It is a very complex issue and there is no one answer.  It crosses all Departments and all sections of our society.  Indeed it is not just the child who is impacted by child poverty but also their family, their community and society as a whole.  It is also not the case that it just affects a child at a point in time - it follows that child through their lifetime.  This is a burden that children should never be forced to carry.  It is well documented that growing up in a poor household is linked with long-term consequences in educational outcomes, physical health and brain development that can follow someone throughout their life.</p><p>Growing up in poverty in Ireland means that a person will find it harder to escape poverty in adulthood and if that person has children that cycle continues into the next generation.  Childhood poverty also brings with it health implications and increases the chance of developing chronic illnesses as a result.  Poverty can also harm a child's brain development and brings lifelong mental health issues.  Children in poverty also find it harder to graduate, affecting their chances of employment throughout life and there are even studies which show that childhood poverty leaves its mark on adult genetics.  A child can be at risk or in consistent poverty.  It can be associated with being born into a marginalised group or with a disability that their parents have perhaps acquired.  It can be based on the marital status of a parent, their social status or even linked to a particular geographical location.</p><p>In this country we have a particularly shameful record when it comes to one-parent families.  The State has consistently failed them and their children.  These families have the highest risk of consistent poverty and are almost four times as likely to be living in consistent poverty as two-parent households.  The chronic lack of adequate housing, childcare, income supports for one-parent families and the severe cuts to social welfare payments during the last recession mean poverty rates remain high for these families.</p> <p>Child poverty is also persistently high in minority groups such as the Traveller community.  Just a few days ago, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights published a report that found Travellers have the highest rates of acute poverty, the lowest unemployment rates and face of some of the worst discrimination of six Traveller and Roma communities throughout Europe.</p> <p> The face of poverty in Ireland is also changing and an alarming trend I would imagine we all see in our constituency offices is that more and more children are in poverty despite their parents working.  Thousands of working households with children are struggling to stay out of poverty, particularly those living in the private sector and having to pay childcare, rent or mortgages or those living with teenagers and headed by one parent.  According to CSO data, approximately 110,000 people who are employed live in poverty.  Over time, the poverty figures for this group, the working poor, have shown little movement, reflecting a persistent problem with lower earnings in Ireland.  Many working families on low earnings struggle to achieve a very basic standard of living.</p> <p> Poverty can be geographically linked.  The baseline report of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs found that children living in regions other than Dublin display the highest poverty risk, households in rural areas have the highest levels of child poverty in terms of income poverty and consistent poverty, while households in urban areas have the highest levels of material deprivation and low work intensity.  Furthermore, Border counties and the south east consistently have high poverty rates more generally among all age groups.</p> <p> We can see that children often bear the brunt of our decisions and bear the brunt of crises that happen to our society.  They are extremely vulnerable to these crises and today they are experiencing three.  They are experiencing the housing crisis, the Covid pandemic and the climate crisis.  As of July 2020, 2,651 children are living in emergency homeless accommodation in this country.  Until we stop families having to choose between paying rent and feeding their children, child poverty rates will never be eradicated.  Aside from the housing crisis, children and families have the current global pandemic to contend with, and navigating the changes in the Government's response and facing economic uncertainty has meant more and more families remain on the brink of poverty.  The reality for parents under lockdown was bigger food bills, little to no access to school meals programmes and less child maintenance for one-parent families.  The provision of childcare at this time is uncertain and was missing for a large part of lockdown, affecting one-parent families in particular as they lost income because they had to care for children.</p> <p> All of this uncertainty for families was highlighted in the ESRI's report on child poverty and the pandemic, which predicts a very alarming scenario for children in the State entering the current recession.  It predicts that without an economic recovery in the latter half of this year, and I do not think anyone can foresee this happening, child income poverty rates are estimated to rise from 16.6% at the beginning of the year to 21.1% by the end of 2020.  This is a one quarter increase in the rate of child income poverty.</p> <p> If we consider how Ireland performed during the last recession we have to rethink our approach to the current one.  According to a 2014 UNICEF report, children in Ireland suffered most in the recession and they continue to bear the consequences of this despite child poverty falling in almost half of European countries since the start of the economic crash.  Child poverty rates doubled in the recession years, making Ireland one of the worst performing countries in Europe at the time.  The sad reality is that many of those 90,000 children living in consistent poverty today went through the first recession and they are now going through a second recession in their very short young lives.  Some of them will never experience the benefits of an economic recovery.  As we navigate the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic it will be important that we poverty proof Covid supports for children and their families, ensuring they meet the needs of those most at risk of poverty at this time.</p> <p> We must not forget that children can be very vulnerable to climate change as we transition to a low carbon society.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, in its report Growing up in the Cold, reported that 12.3% of children in Ireland live in homes with leaking roofs, damp walls, floors or foundations, or rotting window frames or floors.  It is important that they and their families are not left behind as we transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p> Past Governments have tried and failed to reduce consistent poverty.  Going back to 1992, after Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Government pledged to commit to the right of children to a childhood free from poverty and deprivation.  Almost two decades on from that promise we continue to fail children in this regard.  In 2002, the national anti-poverty strategy pledged to reduce the number of children experiencing consistent poverty to 2% and, if possible, to eliminate it by 2007.  In 2007, having failed to meet this target, the pledge was repackaged and repeated with an end date pushed out to 2016.  Between 2006 and 2016, the national social partnership agreement stated that every child should grow up in a family with access to sufficient resources and supports to nurture and care for the child and to foster the child's development and full and equal participation in society.  This target also failed.  In 2014, the national policy framework for children and young people included a target to reduce by two thirds the number of children in consistent poverty by 2020.  However, because it lacked an implementation plan, child poverty rates only marginally declined within that timeframe.  In the same year, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures was published, which set out the Government's previous target of reducing by 70,000 the number of children in consistent poverty by 2020.  Unfortunately, this target will also be missed.  The roadmap for social inclusion, which was signed off by the previous Government in January, recommitted to this target and it was also acknowledged in the programme for Government.  We can all see a pattern here.  Where Governments have put in place a target to partially reduce child poverty they have failed.  This time we need a new target and a new way of dealing with this.  We need a new approach.  We need to eliminate child poverty once and for all.</p> <p> Our motion sets out a four-pronged approach to making child poverty history.  It calls on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to target, legislate, implement and resource.  The motion calls on the Government to commit to the ambition target to eliminate child poverty within the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  This target rejects the idea that any amount of poverty is acceptable.  All child poverty should be targeted and not just a percentage.  The motion calls for legislation to put into law this new target.  It has been done in other jurisdictions.  It not only puts the onus on Governments to meet targets but also ensures that the issue of poverty remains high on the agenda.  Previous targets failed when there was no implementation plan and legislation can only go so far without one.  The motion calls for the establishment of a child poverty unit to be housed within the Department of the Taoiseach which, among other things, would help in the design of an implementation plan and monitor its progress.  The motion also calls for the establishment of a special Oireachtas oversight committee on child poverty to monitor progress in this area.  We need to put funding in place to make sure this happens.  This has been lacking in the past.  The motion calls for the provision of necessary and available resources to support the target of eliminating child poverty in the lifetime of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> We all bear the cost of child poverty.  Inaction not only affects those children in poverty but us all as a society.  This year, the Hidden Cost of Poverty report by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul found that poverty costs the country &euro;45 billion annually.  This figure is not specific to children and child poverty but it looks at and puts costings on the services that deal with child poverty, such as housing, the justice system and education.  The money we spend on the consequences of poverty is money that cannot go into other services.  It is money we should be investing in children now rather than waiting five or ten years to have to invest it then.</p> <p> As stated in the motion, income alone will not address child poverty.  A systemic approach is required in Ireland reflecting the ambition of the EU child guarantee that every child in Europe should have access to free healthcare, free childcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition, with a primary focus on vulnerable children and those experiencing poverty.  With regard to ethnic minority children, including refugee children, we need to address child poverty in an intersectional manner addressing all dimensions and manifestations of child poverty.  We are only bringing four children from the camps on Lesbos and I ask the Minister to look at bringing more than this.</p> <p> I thank the Children's Rights Alliance and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for their input, research and support.</p> <p>I can only hope the Government chooses to distance itself from this regrettable history we have and chooses a different course of action to eliminate child poverty within the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, to legislate for this new ambitious target, to put in place the necessary mechanisms to implement this target and to provide the necessary resources to end child poverty once and for all.  I call on this House to show leadership when it comes to child poverty and work together to ensure we eliminate it from our society because I do not believe any one of us here thinks it is right that we have this in Ireland at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000005#C00200"><p>I am proud to support this motion put forward by the Social Democrats, the case for which has been made strongly by my colleague, Deputy Whitmore.  I want to echo her comments regarding Lesbos, the migrant camp there and the four children.  I will say to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, that we can do much better as a country than bring four children into Ireland.  There is a much greater need than that and I believe there is a strong will from the Irish people.  We have a proud history in supporting people in need in different countries and we can do much better than bringing four children here.  I strongly urge the Minister to do what he can on that.</p>  <p>  As spokesperson on housing for the Social Democrats, I wish to address one particular aspect of child poverty, that is, children and their families who become homeless or are at risk of homelessness.  The current situation is that 2,620 children are living in emergency temporary accommodation for homeless people.  That is without the security and stability of a home, often in overcrowded situations and with no ability for their family to plan ahead.  Those are not the circumstances anyone in this House would support for children growing up and going to school and for families doing their best.  </p>  <p>  To put this in context, in 1990 in the Dublin area five families were put into emergency temporary accommodation for homeless people.  That is five families in the entire year.  By mid-2019, we were looking at four families a day being put into emergency accommodation for homeless people and those children were being put into that accommodation.  That was just in the Dublin area with additional children and families outside of that area.  This is how much this has grown under successive Governments.</p>  <p>  The disruption and devastation caused by homelessness can have serious outcomes for children and their families and can impact on their mental health, education and well-being and the family's ability to hold down jobs and plan ahead.  This is not a question of resources.  Over the last five years, the State has spent more than &euro;565 million on temporary and emergency accommodation for children and their families and for adults who are in homeless emergency accommodation.  That is more than &euro;2 million a week being spent.  This is not a question of resources; it is a question of how those resources are being spent.  It is about political will.  We know from international evidence and from other countries how to tackle this.  The Housing First model is proven to work.  Unfortunately, our plan under the Housing First strategy is to provide secure accommodation for just half of the families and children most at risk.  We have identified those who are most at risk - the families and children who have been in and out of emergency accommodation repeatedly over the years, those who need more support and those who have been rough sleeping.  It is not acceptable that our ambition as a State is to provide a long-term solution for half of them.  The goal of countries such as Finland is to eradicate homelessness, child homelessness and family homelessness and as a result of that ambition they are doing much better at tackling this than we are.</p>  <p>  We know from other countries what works.  In terms of eradicating child poverty, we can see the policies that work with regard to children and families.  We know the Housing First model works but it is across the board in terms of child poverty.  We know what policies and strategies work.  This is a political choice and a question about what kind of country and what kind of Ireland we want to live in.  Do we want to continue to tolerate child poverty or do we decide we will eradicate it?  I ask the Minister and the Government take a leadership role in this regard.  It is within the Minister's power and ability to do that.</p></speech>

</blockquote>  <p>I start by thanking Deputy Whitmore for bringing this motion forward.  It is absolutely crucial that we take this time to discuss the issue of child poverty and how we respond to it as a country.  Over the last few months, we have seen unprecedented turmoil as a result of Covid-19 and we are now facing into a recession.  As Minister, I am acutely aware of the risk the economic downturn poses to children and, particularly, those living in or at risk of poverty.</p><p>While we have made progress in recent years, we know that poverty continues to steal childhoods and children's futures.  Poverty affects not only children's material living conditions but also their sense of belonging, their well-being and their physical health.  Every child should have the best start to life.  It is not acceptable to me or to any Member of this House that children continue to live in poverty in Ireland today.</p><p>The effects of child poverty are both immediate and long-term.  Growing up in a marginalised and disadvantaged community experiencing intergenerational cycles of poverty, educational disadvantage and unemployment seriously hinders the opportunities of a child or young person.</p><p>Those worst affected by child poverty are those with the least access to power to make their voices heard.  Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, we have heard many representative groups and trade organisations speak on behalf of their members about the genuine and devastating impacts the pandemic has had upon them.  However, so much of the suffering caused by child poverty happens silently behind closed doors to children and families who are marginalised and vulnerable.  When we look at how we live with Covid-19 and what kind of country we want to create when we emerge from the pandemic, we will fall short if we focus on the economic health of the country only.  Therefore, it is my absolute priority and that of this Government to ensure these most vulnerable members of our society are protected during the pandemic but also during the lifetime of this Government.</p><p>Any measure we take in regard to child poverty has to be based on the strongest possible evidence.  This is why since I was appointed as Minister, the Department has published two pieces of research looking at child poverty.  The first is a statistical baseline analysis of the prevalence of child poverty in the country and the second looks at the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on children and young people.  This second report found that school closures and the lack of face-to-face engagement with peers is having a direct effect on the lives of children and young people.  The impact of the pandemic will be felt most by young people from more disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special educational needs.  Parental job loss and the possibility of long-term unemployment will affect children's well-being through greater stress within the family but also as result of loss of income.  As the pandemic continues and the restrictions remain in place, these risks become more pronounced and demand a stronger policy response.</p><p>With the challenges presented by Covid-19 in mind, the programme for Government makes commitments aimed at addressing child poverty.  The Government will work to end food poverty and a key component of this will be the school meals programme.  With the co-operation of our schools around the country this programme continued during the summer months this year in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Additionally, the programme for Government commits to initiating a new anti-poverty social inclusion and community development action plan underpinning sound community development practices and reflecting a response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This will build on the existing sustainable inclusive and empowered communities strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland.</p><p>There are also a range of measures that will speak to the wider mission of improving the well-being of children, extending free GP care to more children, abolishing in-hospital charges for children and extending free dental care to more children.</p><p>The programme for Government also commits to the development of a specific youth homelessness strategy so we can end the practice that previous Deputies alluded to earlier of housing hundreds of children in emergency accommodation such as hotels.</p> <p>The programme for Government also commits to the creation of a successor strategy to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  In 2014, the then Government launched Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, which provided a national policy framework for children and young people.  This framework recognised that poverty, substandard housing and social exclusion have a significant impact on a child's life outcomes and we needed to redouble our efforts to reduce these inequalities.  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures set a target of reducing consistent poverty for children by two-thirds of the 2011 level.  It was a challenging target.  The target aimed that by 2020 the number of children in consistent poverty would be reduced to 37,000 children at most.  The figures available for 2018 show that the consistent poverty rate for children had decreased from 9.3% in 2011 to 7.7%, a reduction of 1.6%.  This corresponds to a reduction of 14,000 children living in consistent poverty between 2011 and 2018.  Despite the progress that was made, it is clear at this point that the target set in 2014 will not be achieved.  I am deeply conscious that these are not just numbers we are speaking about.  These are children facing hunger, deprivation and all the physical and mental affects and impacts we have spoken about today.  This is happening to children all over our country.</p> <p> As the new Minister with responsibility for children, I am committed to establishing a new and ambitious target to reduce child poverty.  This target will form the central element of the successor strategy to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  However, an ambitious target on its own is of little value without the means, the structures and the will and drive to meet it.  As part of the successor strategy that I will be bringing forward, I will establish new infrastructure within my Department and across Government for the delivery of our child poverty reduction goals.  This new strategy will contain mid-term targets and monitoring mechanisms such that we are better able to measure progress and address any potential slippage.  I look forward to engaging with Deputy Whitmore and members of the joint Oireachtas committee on children, equality, disability, integration and youth to examine the best mechanisms to ensure the delivery of these goals.  I agree with Deputy that we need to work across party lines on this issue.</p> <p> Central to the success of any target on child poverty is a whole-of-Government approach.  Such an approach to tackling child poverty has been adopted, building on the lifecycle approach adopted in the previous national action plan for social inclusion.  There is clear evidence about what works in terms of reducing child poverty.  Ireland's historical approach to tackling child poverty has focused on cash transfers and this approach has resulted in Ireland consistently ranking as one of the top performing EU countries in the poverty reduction effect of social transfers.  However, despite the relevant of success of social transfers, in order to have a comprehensive and sustainable impact on child poverty, newer strategies must focus on improving service provision.  Doing so can have a meaningful impact on reducing the cost of living for families with children.  The diverse nature of these challenges demonstrate why a whole-of-Government approach is essential to tackling child poverty effectively.  I agree with the Deputy's assertion that we need to strengthen oversight.  </p> <p> Earlier this year, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection published the roadmap for social inclusion and identified child poverty as a cross-sectoral issue that needs to be addressed.  Officials in my Department continue to work closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I recently met the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the issue of child poverty and on initiating discussions on the development of the new poverty targets in the successor to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  I welcome the support today of the Department through the contribution of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.  </p> <p> Government leadership can and has been supported by the experience and expertise of members of civil society groups, academia and other Government-funded organisations.  My Department always engages positively with our partners.  This has involved close co-operation with the National Advisory Council, which is currently chaired by Tanya Ward, the chief executive officer of the Children's Rights Alliance.  The council brings together a diverse range of specialists in children and young people's policy and provision.  It provides advice and recommendations on child poverty to me as Minister.  Shortly after I was appointed Minister, I had the opportunity to meet the council.  It was the first external organisation that I met and in our discussions that day we focused on the issue of child poverty.  </p> <p> Earlier this month, I visited Hill Street Family Resource Centre in the north inner city, where the project manager showed me around and introduced me to some of the parents who use the centre.  The breadth of what they do there is extraordinary, from adult education to parenting support to child care.  The complexity of the work and the compassion with which it is done is deeply impressive.  Each of the parents I met spoke about the support and sense of community they find there.  What I heard and saw in Hill Street underlines the complexity of child poverty but also that solutions exist.  As a Government, we will lead on and progress a strategy to reduce child poverty in conjunction with our partners in the non-governmental organisation, NGO, sector, civil society and, I hope, with other parties.  We are committed to setting and achieving an ambitious target to reduce poverty, underpinned by the necessary resources and structures.  We will not be found wanting in our determination to achieve this.</p></speech>

It is an excellent motion, but it is a shame that we have to be discussing such a subject.  However, that is the reality.  As I stand here today, approximately 700,000 of our fellow citizens live on a poverty income, of which approximately 225,000, or 30%, are children.  If this was not startling enough, in June this year, a Society of St. Vincent de Paul study, entitled, The Hidden Cost of Poverty, reported that poverty costs the State in the region of &euro;4.5 billion.  When we speak about child poverty what we are talking about is children going to bed hungry, children going to school without lunches, without warm coats as we approach autumn-winter and without the correct footwear.  It is important to remember that is the reality for children.  That in 2020 there are children in this country going to bed hungry or going to school hungry is heartbreaking to say the least.  What these children need is not sympathy, they need action.</p>  <p>  When I was preparing for my contribution today I realised that this is not a new phenomenon.  We have been talking about child poverty since as far back as the first D&aacute;il in 1919 when the State pledged then, as its first duty, "...to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter..."  Yet, here we are more than 100 years later and children are still suffering from the same plight.  It is important to say that this has a knock-on effect on every part of a child's life.  A child cannot go into school and function properly if he or she is hungry, tired or freezing.  That is the reality for so many children.  There are additional issues in regard to direct provision with children in direct provision not having the same opportunities and likewise children in homeless services, by which I mean not just children living in hotels and bed and breakfasts but children living in overcrowded situations with families and friends.  These are people who are trying to keep themselves out of the emergency accommodation system and are the hidden homeless.  There are children growing up squashed into one room with their entire family.  There are no opportunities for these children such as the normal things many children take for granted such as having school friends to their home, birthday parties and so on.  </p>  <p>  Child poverty has always been with us and unless we do something radical it will always be with us.  Covid has highlighted the crisis.  While all children missed the benefits of school, their child care or the early years placement, for many children these were the places they went to that were safe, warm and provided them with a meal.  I know so many organisations and services did so much good work during Covid trying to get meals, etc., out to children.  An enormous number of children are potentially going to fall through the cracks as a result of Covid.  It is important that we remain focused on that and ensure measures are put in place in that regard.  The Minister mentioned the schools meal programme in his speech.  It is an excellent programme, as are breakfast clubs.  Another initiative I regularly talk about that sometimes does not get enough attention is the school completion programme.  While it operates primarily in DEIS schools, it is also in other schools and it could be rolled-out to all schools, but its funding would need to be increased because none of the funding cuts applied to it in the recession has been restored.  The programme enables excellent work in a range of areas and it flies under the radar, which is exactly what a child in that situation needs.</p> <p>They do not need it to be highlighted that they are somehow different or have a red circle put around them.  That is what is excellent about the school completion programme.  It is ironic that responsibility for that is moving from the Minister's Department but I ask about any influence he might have in the time remaining to increase its funding or its mandate to allow it roll out more schools because the work it does is invaluable.  I will pass over to my colleagues but I want to commend Deputy Whitmore again and say that we fully support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000007#E00200"><p>I too welcome this motion and commend the Social Democrats on bringing it forward.  Before we ever heard of Covid-19 the Government was telling us about low unemployment, plenty of jobs and Ireland being the fastest growing economy in the EU but what good is any of that when we have children going hungry, are cold in their own homes and some who are without any home living in bed and breakfast accommodation and homeless accommodation across the State?  It is a rich economy but a very poor society.  That is the reality for more than 90,000 children who live in consistent poverty every single day.  Those children have been robbed of their childhood.  That carefree nature, the fun and the make-believe has been replaced with worry, uncertainty, and in some cases fear.</p>  <p>  The Minister's amendment welcomes increases in the earnings disregard for the one parent family payment.  We remember that was done after it had been previously cut and the age reduced to seven.  Indecon reported on the impact of those very changes on lone parent families, which were made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  We secured in the Social Welfare Act in 2016 an independent Indecon report to examine those changes.  That reported concluded very clearly that all evidence indicated that it was those very changes that made life more difficult for lone parent families.  That policy was introduced without any regard for the consequences and for lone parent families the consequences of those changes were detrimental.</p>  <p>  The Minister welcomes a maintenance disregard for the working family payment.  That is a payment that is badly needed but why is it needed?  It is needed to top up poor wages and again shows the prevalence of low pay in this State.  Last year, almost &euro;400 million was spent by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the working family payment.  It shows that because a job no longer guarantees a route out of poverty.  We know that more than 100,000 people at work are living in poverty so that guarantee of employment no longer exists.</p>  <p>  We know that deprivation levels have increased.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, report on enforced deprivation published earlier this month showed an increase of 45.4% to lone parent families and one in five children experiences deprivation every day.</p>  <p>  When it comes to child maintenance, and the Minister referred to the maintenance disregard, that is a payment that is taken into account as household means for all social welfare payments.  That should never be the case.  Child maintenance, if it is actually paid, should be seen as income for the child to help raise that child, not as a household income.  That must change.  I welcome the disregard but it should be available for all social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  We are blue in the face saying that we need a child maintenance service in this State, similar to what is in place in the North.  In the past three years, we twice published proposals on how we can get that service in these Twenty-six Counties and have consistently raised that issue.  Last year, we had a motion passed in this House that for the establishment of that child maintenance service, and I welcome that it is committed to in the programme.  I am aware that work is under way but that needs to happen very quickly because if someone is seen to be in receipt of child maintenance it reduces their other social welfare payments, regardless of whether they are receiving it.  They might not be getting the child maintenance payment but it cuts their other payments.  That cannot continue and it should never be the case.</p>  <p>  The other issue in that regard is the liable relative unit in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is dysfunctional.  Its objective is to go after the liable relative, who is the non-custodial parent, to recoup money to pay for the one parent family payment.  It is to recoup costs for the State as opposed to costs for that child or children, or that family.  That is very disturbing.  When we looked at this previously between January 2018 and August 2019, that unit examined more than 18,000 cases and in just over 2,000 of them a non-custodial parent began making payments.  Of the almost 16,000 cases, nothing happened; they were simply left.  That child maintenance is needed urgently.</p>  <p>  The motion also makes reference to the roadmap on social inclusion, which is welcome, but it was two years late.  We had been calling for it in those two years.  That fails to mention benchmarking social welfare payments to adequacy, which was highlighted by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Social Justice Ireland and the Anti-Poverty Network, which has stated that benchmarking to adequacy is not in this social inclusion model.  Social Justice Ireland went as far as to say that when this social inclusion roadmap is finished, there will be no change in poverty rates.  That in itself is very stark.  We have raised this issue.  We published legislation for a social welfare commission to do two things.  It should make sure that households were lifted out of poverty and that their social welfare support met a basic need for that household, whether it was rural or urban.  That takes out the shameful political football that we have every year as the budget approaches in terms of &euro;5 for this group but no &euro;5 for that group, which is based on nothing.  We need to see an end to that because poverty in this State is an ongoing crisis but we can take three simple steps very quickly.  We need to establish a child maintenance service for those lone parents who are struggling; we need adequate social welfare supports; and we need a living wage to ensure that work actually pays.</p></speech>

Child poverty has a huge impact in my constituency.  I represent Limerick city, which includes part of north Tipperary, and we have serious problems in the area.  In Limerick, 18 electoral divisions were classified as unemployment blackspots, which is twice as many in any other part of the country.  The average unemployment rate in those areas is 43%.  The last census identified Limerick city as having eight of the top ten worst unemployment black spots in the State.</p>  <p>  I do not profess to be an expert on child poverty but I profess to be an expert on the outcomes of not dealing with child poverty.  We have massive issues, of which the Minister will be well aware.  There was a Government intervention in the mid-2000s when a drugs war was costing lives and deprivation was rampant.  While we had a robust Garda response at that time which put a lid on drug dealing and drug violence, the regeneration plans and promised reinvestment did not deliver in many areas of my home city out of deprivation.  Unfortunately, it continues to this day.</p>  <p>  The most deprived area in the entire State is in my city of Limerick.  Limerick really is a tale of two cities.  We have massive wealth on one side and mass deprivation on the other side.  Unfortunately, Pobal, CSO and census statistics tell us there is no change in those areas.  They will always remain at or near the bottom.  The only change is that an area of the city might not be the very last in one census but is last in the next census and it goes over and back with no real change, no access and nothing done to improve matters.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Funchion, referenced the impact of Covid-19, which exposed many issues, including the importance of schools, particularly the DEIS schools.  I have been in a number of them since Covid-19 came to our shores and saw the great work.  School meals continued through the summer.  Some of the schools in my city opened.  It was the only safe place for children to go.  They go home to families which are dysfunctional.  Poverty is rife and that issue is not being addressed in the way it needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The motion is very important.  I want to mention St. Munchin's Community Centre on the north side of Limerick, which has done a fantastic job making sure that people are fed.  It may sound strange to many people but when schools are not open, unfortunately, some children do not get fed.  They made sure that service continued throughout the pandemic lockdown and the school closures.  I want to commend Linda Ledger and her team, led by Bobby O'Halloran, in St. Munchin's Community Centre, who have done a fantastic job.</p>  <p>  In November 2019, Social Justice Ireland released figures showing that 200,000 children were living in poverty in this State.  As a State we have seen some economic growth over recent years.  The working poor and their families have been left behind.  It is not a surprise that we have such levels of poverty among children when this Parliament cannot legislate for a living wage of &euro;12 per hour.  My time is short and I will give the remainder to my colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000007#E00400"><p>I wish to commend Deputy Whitmore and the Social Democrats on introducing this motion, which I fully support.  The fact that more than 200,000 children are living in poverty in Ireland today is a disgrace and is an issue that must be addressed immediately.  Children living in poverty miss out on so much; it is very tough on them.  They miss out on the things we take for granted such as warm clothes, participating in activities and going on school trips.</p> <p>Before being elected, I taught in a secondary school in Cavan.  Last year, I had a first-year class, and on Thursday, first years were allowed out early before lunch to go to the canteen because it was a particularly busy day.  There were five or six students who remained behind because they did not have a hot meal ordered.  I asked had they all brought lunch and they said they had, except one little girl.  She told me not only did she not have lunch, but she had not eaten since 5 o'clock the evening before.  My heart went out to her and I was able, because we were in a DEIS school, to talk to the relevant staff and organise that she would receive a hot meal in future at school.  I found out by chance that she had no food.  She might not have admitted that to me and she is probably one of many.</p> <p> Living in poverty affects health and well-being and it increases anxiety and other mental health issues.  It means a person is less likely to go to college.  If a person is cold and hungry, he or she will not be able to concentrate in school or proceed.  Therefore, it becomes a generational issue.  There have been some efforts made by Government in recent times to address some of the issues, but it has not been near enough and targets are consistently not being met.  One of the issues is the cost of education, which is proving prohibitive.  When Donogh O'Malley introduced free education in 1966 he described it as "the one great leveller-upper".  I am not sure about his grammar but his sentiment was absolutely correct.  However, education is no longer free.  Uniforms, books, materials, and transport all cost money.  I know there is a back-to-school allowance but it needs to be broadened and increased.</p> <p> School closures as a result of Covid have been mentioned by others here.  Such closures have impacted on poorer children more because of simple things such as access to technology not being available.  The supports they receive in school were also absent.</p> <p> Children of lone parents are four times more likely to be living in poverty than those in two-parent families.  Deputy Kerrane has dealt with the maintenance issue but there needs to be a statutory entitlement to seek and receive maintenance in this country, as there is in many other countries.  People should not have to constantly go to court to receive maintenance for their children.</p> <p> There needs to be significant investment in children and families at the beginning of their lives.  It would pay dividends and make savings in the long term in areas such as health, the prison system and in relation to other interventions that it is to be hoped will not be needed if children are invested in at the start of their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1470" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000008#F00200"><p>I welcome this motion put forward by the Social Democrats.  The issue of child poverty is something I have great interest in.  As a parent, there is nothing that means more to me than the welfare of children.  What parents does not want to do their best for their children?  Who would not want to provide their children with a stable life in a caring environment?  The reality is that many parents struggle even to put food on the table for their children.  For many children, the only hot meal they receive each day or the only breakfast they will get is the one provided by their school under the school meals programme.</p>  <p>  According to Social Justice Ireland, there are close to 700,000 people living in poverty in Ireland today, of which almost 230,000 are children.  That is one in five children under 18 living in poverty in Ireland today.   According to Focus Ireland, child homelessness has risen by over 250% over the past six years.  The crisis of child poverty is creating a lost generation of young people.  A poor standard of living and a poor quality of life has a huge impact on a child's formative years, their educational potential and, later, their employment prospects.  These are the hidden costs of child poverty.</p>  <p>  The pandemic has been a nightmare for those who are homeless and has been especially hard for children living in emergency accommodation.  The stress of being homeless and under lockdown has for many had a serious detrimental effect on their mental health.  Much of the child poverty we see today is the result of families struggling to survive on low incomes.  We need to develop a roadmap out of poverty for families that will involve serious policy challenges for Government.  Some measures we could look at for decreasing child property would be decent pay and conditions for working parents, building more social and affordable houses, keeping welfare payments in line with minimum essential standard of living rates, having affordable childcare, increasing child benefit, especially for families on low incomes, extending access to free medical care for all children, and much more.  Children cannot be taken out of poverty unless and until their families are taken out of poverty.</p></speech>

It is an issue we all care deeply about and hope to address in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il because we have waited far too long.</p>  <p>  More than 200,000 children are at risk of poverty, 90,000 children are living in consistent poverty, and behind every one of those children there is a parent, often a mother, who is afflicted by that exact same poverty and in many cases suffering and going without so the child does not have to.  In my contribution, I will give voice to that.  The consistently most vulnerable group of people in our State have been lone parents.  A shocking 50.1% of people in one-parent families with a child or children under the age of 18 are living in poverty.  That is a sad indictment on our State.  I raise the issue of poverty constantly because I grew up in a constituency where it surrounded and impacted me and made me passionate about making these changes.  When we hear the word "poverty" sometimes, we sometimes forget what it means.  It just comes across as the word and a statement and what that means to the person who has impacted by it is lost.  I will give voice to that if I can.</p>  <p>  There are indicators that were developed in 2007 to give an indication of what poverty means, and I will go through some of them.  Poverty is the lack of two pairs of strong shoes; the lack of a warm waterproof overcoat; an inability to eat a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day; it is the lack of capacity for a parent to go out and socialise with a friend.  Poverty is all-encompassing.  It isolates and renders a person hungry and cold.  It is detrimental to the human condition, but I believe it is more than that.  From conversations I have had since I have been involved in politics and working in the north inner-city community in the community development sector, I believe poverty impacts on every one of our senses as human beings.  It is possible to smell poverty and taste, touch and feel poverty.</p>  <p>  Walking around canvassing, as all of us have done over the past year or five years, we have knocked at a door and spoken to a person who has told us about his or her poverty.  Walking up the North Circular Road and knocking on the doors of some of our migrant community, I walk in and see they have nowhere to store their bins.  They tell me they would just like somewhere where they could store the bins so they did not have to smell it.  Regarding how poverty tastes, mothers on low incomes have no alternative but to provide cheap ready-made meals because, first, they cannot afford a more nutritious variety and, second, food has to be cooked quickly because they are running out to do the cleaning jobs or are going to work.</p>  <p>  Regarding how poverty sounds, poverty is never silent.  People are in conditions that are overcrowded and vulnerable and mothers with children in those conditions have nowhere they can find a bit of silence.  I had a heart-rending conversation with a mother who was homeless and placed in hotel accommodation.  She told me about the indignity of being able to tuck her child into bed but not being able to leave the room and watch the television or find her own space to just be.  Poverty never affords silence.</p>  <p>  Regarding how poverty feels, I remember my first canvass for a local election in 2014, knocking at a door and a woman talked to me about the deprivation she was experiencing.  She brought me into her house to show me her fridge.  She opened her fridge door and there were Tupperware boxes with all the food for the week.  It was clear there was one day a week where she did not eat.</p>  <p>  Regarding how one can touch poverty, it is the old furniture that cannot be replaced, the old clothes and jackets and the impact all of that has on that person and on the human condition.  Poverty is detrimental and we must endeavour to address that problem, because not to do so is enforcing a grotesque inhumanity on citizens in this State and it is not by any means a small number.</p> <p>More than 700,000 people are at risk of poverty, 100,000 people are working and still experiencing poverty and 90,000 children are affected.  If addressing that is not the great ambition of what we can achieve in the D&aacute;il, I do not know what we are doing here.</p> <p> I am conscious that when one talks about poverty and who is impacted by it, one starts to see history replicating itself.  People who were locked away in mother and baby homes or Magdalen laundries, now that those institutions are gone, are simply being ignored by the State.  Having been forced into Magdalen laundries or mother and baby homes, those people are being placed into hotel rooms and asked to live in cramped and overcrowded conditions, often to the benefit of hoteliers who we choose to benefit from other people's suffering in this country.  History starts to replicate itself.  Despite all the talk of ambitious targets that are not going to be met, we ignore people in poverty and choose not to do anything.  We commend and change motions, or bring forward countermotions referencing welcome Government action, when the reality for people on the ground is one of suffering, hunger, pain and hardship.  It is cruel and we need to address it.</p> <p> There are structural changes that we can choose to make if we actually want to address the fact that children and other people in this country live in poverty.  Social Justice Ireland, Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, SPARK, One Family and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have a wealth of policy recommendations that would vastly improve the circumstances of people suffering from poverty in this country.  Those policy recommendations include linking welfare rates to a minimum essential standard of living, providing housing first, investing in local authorities and publicly-owned homes.  Those organisations advocate investing in a publicly-funded model of childcare.  There are old things to which we should always go back, such as strong public services that seek to eradicate the suffering of the population.  If that is not what governance and being involved in the State is about, we are failing miserably.</p> <p> It is also important to talk about poverty as it is experienced in schools, an area about which I am passionate.  When I think about what the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed, I am almost amused at the way in which we, in Ireland, use words to cover what we actually mean.  When children were sent home from school in March, we talked about a "digital divide" in this country.  That means that many people were unable to educate their children and young people because they did not have access to a laptop.  It is interesting that we can talk about a laptop in those terms.  Perhaps we can aspire to one day giving kids laptops.  If a child does not have a laptop, it is not that his or her parents did not work hard enough.  The truth is that a divide exists in homes all over this country and is the reason kids were not able to be educated at home when they were sent home from school.  It is not only a digital divide, it is a divide in terms of basic provisions such as a table on which children can do their homework.  Most young people and teenagers who were sent home from school had to step in and do care work because their parents were off working in supermarkets and elsewhere, providing essential front-line services that were keeping our hospitals and supermarkets open.  We never acknowledged that.  All we said was that there was a digital divide.  The divide that exists for students and young people in this country is far more substantial than that.</p> <p> Poverty is never inevitable.  Nobody chooses poverty, neither child nor adult.  No parent would choose poverty when considering how to raise a child.  These problems can be addressed and solved.  We are a small nation and if we cannot address the poverty of our own citizens while we are still relatively wealthy, we need to up our ambition.  There is much suffering out there that can be alleviated with the right level of effort and consideration for who we are as a republic.</p></speech>

Mr. Tony Murphy, the Irish member of the court, was clear in his messaging about the European Union's response to eliminating child poverty.  He stated: </p> <blockquote> 	Child poverty is a serious issue in the EU.  Without a sustained and targeted action, the current unacceptable level is unlikely to decrease.  It is becoming more critical because of the expected impact of the pandemic. </blockquote>  <p>Those are stark words and bear closer scrutiny.</p><p>The report stated:</p> <blockquote> 	EU legislation does not target funding directly at combating child poverty.  Both the Commission and the Member States visited could not quantify the amount of funds allocated to projects directly tackling child poverty and therefore could not assess their effectiveness. </blockquote>  <p>By any standard, that is a damning indictment of us, as a country, and successive Governments, including the one of which I was a part.  We now need radical action to ensure that this issue is addressed.</p><p>There were presentations during the week by the European Court of Auditors and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The central message from Mr. Murphy, the Irish member of the court, was that because EU instruments targeted at eliminating child poverty are not legally binding, it has become difficult to measure the true impact of measures intended to eliminate child poverty.  The EU target of removing 20 million citizens from poverty has no sub-target for children and no adjusted target has been set even though it has been clear for some time that this objective will not be met.  Mr. Murphy's critique, if I can use that word, was not just of the Commission for failing to pressure member states, but of member states themselves for being deliberately obtuse in drafting policy, interpreting directives and reporting results.  Ms Karen Kiernan, chief executive officer of One Family, bore that out when she said that was her experience and that it applies to Ireland.  </p><p>The policy discussion during the Society of St. Vincent de Paul presentation included policymakers from New Zealand, Ireland and Scotland.  They discussed how best to respond to child poverty in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape.  Ms Kristie Carter, director of the child poverty unit in New Zealand, spoke about the child poverty unit in Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's department.  The Prime Minister has a child poverty unit within her department.  That is the level of importance that is ascribed to this issue in New Zealand.  We can learn from that.  I note that the Minister with responsibility for children is here today and I accept his <i>bona fides</i>but the example of New Zealand shows what can be done when political parentage, if you will, is given to this issue such that it is elevated to the equivalent level of the Department of the Taoiseach.  That is when one starts seeing real action because that is when resources are made available.  Policymakers, people who are charged with implementing policy, and stakeholders can then see real results from the efforts to eliminate child poverty.</p><p>Ms Carter highlighted that the creation of the child poverty unit was crucially accompanied by cutting red tape for non-governmental organisations, NGOs, as well as increasing funding.  The logic was simply that if this was not made a priority, targets would be missed.  That sums up the Irish scenario on the issue.  It seems reasonable to request then that in addition to reporting, measuring and setting targets, the Government provides the necessary funding as happens in New Zealand.</p> <p>We endorse the setting of legislative targets because we feel strongly it would guarantee accountability.  Where there are nebulous targets, there is nebulous policy-making.  Where people must account for themselves and their actions, one starts to see real results.  The two events that took place this week were, arguably, very prescient because they dealt directly with the substance of the motion before us today.  We are here again in the D&aacute;il talking about these issues, and there is a working out of these issues when we talk about child poverty.  All Members of the Oireachtas have countless examples of constituents who are suffering because of a lack of proper income but also because, increasingly, children do not have access to the basic services they require.  From an answer to a parliamentary question I tabled this week on access for children and the number of children waiting for occupational therapy through the HSE, I learned there are now 21,000 children who have been waiting for up to one year.  I have stated before in this House that there is something illogical about the fact that occupational therapists, front-line workers, are being deployed to do testing, swabbing and tracing when any reasonable non-medical person could be trained to do so.  The net effect of the loss of an occupational therapy service is that children, by and large, suffer.  We need to start producing logical public policy, particularly health policy, in respect of children.  The lack of such policy leads to greater impoverishment.  I use the term "impoverishment" broadly.  We support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000010#H00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity, afforded to us by the Social Democrats' motion, to discuss this important issue.  We recently celebrated, with some fanfare, the 100th anniversary of the D&aacute;il.   The statement adopted by the First D&aacute;il 100 years ago reads: "It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as Citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland."  It is staggering that, in the intervening 100 years, we have failed so badly.  Today, as this motion points out, there are over 200,000 children in poverty and a total of over 600,000 people in poverty.  The rate of poverty is not an accident or unfortunate oversight.  Unfortunately, it is not something that will be changed by D&aacute;il motions, reviews, commissioning reports, setting targets or even convening august bodies of experts.  It is systemic and ingrained, and it is a wholly foreseen consequence of our economic system and the priorities and policies of the current and past Governments.</p>  <p>  It is true that the rates of poverty soared during the last recession but, despite some falls in recent years, there are still more children in poverty now than ten years ago.  It is also true, unfortunately, that what the ESRI warned about in July will almost certainly come to pass, that is, that the Covid pandemic and recession will likely see an increase in the poverty rates by around one quarter.  The persistent, endemic and extraordinary issue of child poverty is not ultimately caused by one recession or another but by the very structure of Ireland's economic and social fabric.  Our industrial, housing, welfare and even climate policies will ensure this remains the case.</p>  <p>  Over 100,000 of those in poverty are working.  They are the working poor.  The children of those workers are living in poverty not because of an oversight but because we have an economy that encourages low pay and precarious employment with minimal oversight and enforcement in respect of workers' rights and statutory entitlements.  We pride ourselves on a voluntarist model of employer&ndash;worker relations.  This is code for a lack of workers' rights and entitlements enforced by the State.  Ireland is a haven for bad employers.  A direct consequence of that system, carefully built up over decades, is the working poor and their children.  So long as the Government's primary concern is to sell this country to national and international investors as a low-wage, deregulated  economy with little oversight or enforcement of worker' rights  we will continue to see high child poverty rates.</p>  <p>  Thousands will be in emergency accommodation tonight.  Thousands of children will be in poverty.  Tomorrow, they will face gruelling journeys to and from school and the impact of not having a stable, secure home.  This, again, is entirely foreseeable.  It is a consequence of a housing policy that eulogies the private market and private provision of housing, that regards housing as a commodity to make some people wealthy and whose purpose is to generate wealth for a few rather than shelter for the many.  As long as we have a system of REITS, vulture funds and untrammeled rights for landlords, it will continue.  As long as the Government is more concerned about ending an eviction ban, in case it disturbs landlords, than about providing shelter and secure homes for people, we will continue to see high poverty rates in the wider society.</p>  <p>  We are aware that 12% of children live in fuel poverty and that some 140,000 homes are cold and damp, yet we have a climate policy that prioritises individual responsibility in addressing carbon dioxide emissions, that allows organisations to get off the hook in terms of corporate responsibility and that regards raising carbon taxes on the fuel, heating and transport of ordinary people as a way to change personal behaviour.  In short, it is a policy that is designed to fail in limiting the rise in carbon dioxide emissions and that is guaranteed to keep people in fuel poverty, with no alternatives.  As long as the Government regards carbon tax increases on the fuel and heating needed by ordinary people as comprising the chief measure needed, we will continue to see high child poverty rates.</p>  <p>  The slight falls in child poverty rates noticed in recent years are being wiped away as we speak, I suspect, because of the effects of the Covid crisis on carbon dioxide emissions and the minimal increase in social welfare rates.  In one sense, there is no mystery about how to end child poverty, if that is the goal; it is entirely possible to target State supports in housing, employment, health, education, climate mitigation and, especially, social protection and welfare to make a real impact.  Again, however, we see from recent steps and actions of the Government that, when the chips are down, these are not among its priorities.  It is entirely foreseeable that the recent cuts in the pandemic unemployment payments for over 200,000 recipients and the wage subsidy scheme payments for another 300,000 will add to the misery, the difficulty in making ends meet, and the worry, stress and uncertainty for thousands upon thousands.  Ultimately, this will result in an increase in the rates of child poverty, fuel poverty and food poverty seen in the statistics.  </p>  <p>  We support this motion, but in the unfortunate certainty that it will have no impact on the lives of those children in poverty tonight and those whom this Government and its policies will keep in poverty in the coming months and years.  To achieve change, we ultimately need more than a D&aacute;il motion.  We need a mass movement of workers, families and others affected by the headline rates that will force the current and future Governments to address the deep structural injustices and inequalities that have been ingrained in our economic and social system since the State was founded.  We discussed motions such as this 100 years ago and we are still doing so today.  The problem is systemic and endemic and needs to be addressed from the bottom up.</p></speech>

The truth of the matter is that these are not the priorities of this State.  That can be seen in the radical numbers of children and people who live in poverty, not just people who are out of work but also the working poor who are living in poverty in the State.  <br/><br/>I have to agree to a certain extent with previous speakers that we often hear a lot of worthy words coming from Government parties around the issues of child poverty, but child poverty is not a mistake, an accident or a situation that has happened despite all the best efforts of previous Governments and the policies they were involved in.  Child poverty exists because of the policies and efforts of and decisions made by previous Governments.<br/><br/>I heard the Minister speak.  He spoke about the fact that he felt it was an extremely complex situation.  Many family situations can be extremely complex.  I have no doubt that there are a lot of individual reasons families find themselves in poverty, but in the general scheme of things the issue of child poverty is not a deeply complex one.  It is a very simple issue.  At the heart of it is the massive inequalities of wealth that exist in this country and the world.<br/><br/>We are living at a time where there is a phenomenal concentration of wealth in the hands of just a few individuals.  Figures from a number of weeks ago show that about 2,100 billionaires have the same amount of wealth as 4.6 billion people, which is about 60% of the population of the planet.  Jeff Bezos, who is likely to become the first trillionaire in 2026, will at that stage, it is estimated, have as much wealth as 137 individual countries.  That is breathtaking.  We are living at a time of income inequality that has not been as big since probably medieval times.<br/><br/>The reasons that is happening are many, but one of the key issues is tax injustice.  It is feeding the massive wealth creation of a small number of individuals and as a result is robbing the vast majority of people of the ability to raise their families and put a roof over their heads, gain access to education and healthcare and feed their families.  This country's taxation policies are one of the driving forces of tax injustice. <br/><br/>Aont&uacute; firmly believes that foreign direct investment is massively important for the development of the future of this country and we welcome foreign direct investment into this country, but we believe that it should be based on competitive advantages in education, transport, ICT communications and the quality of life that exists.  It should not be based on bargain basement taxes, as is currently the case. <br/><br/>Wealth inequality is leading to massive poverty throughout Ireland.  In my constituency, Meath West, my constituency office is the home of the Meath Food Bank.  That organisation does massive work to make sure that the people of Meath have access to food in these difficult times.  It has helped well over 600 families this year alone with the distribution of food packages.  Most of the families who use the food bank told its head, Aisling Lowe, that the fears they had with regard to the return to school were not necessarily about to Covid but rather their ability to feed their children when school restarted.<br/><br/>It would be impossible to discuss the issue of child poverty today without discussing the policies of the Government with regard to Covid-19.  We have to be careful and cautious about Covid-19.  It is important that we socially distance, that people work from home where possible, that people do their best to keep the numbers down, etc.  I also believe that the Government is involved in delivering policies that are having a radical effect on society, and which are causing child poverty now and will cause it in the future.  <br/><br/> In his speech the Minister said he is carrying out research on the effects of Covid-19 on children, which I welcome.  The Government is not doing enough research on the effect of its policies on poverty throughout the country at the moment.  We do not have the necessary research on mortality and morbidity from non-Covid health issues.  We do not have the necessary research on what is happening economically to many of our families.  If the Government is involved in delivering such a radical economic policy without carrying out that research, that means it is, in many ways, operating blind and is operating a policy which shows that it does not understand the ramifications of that policy for the people of the country.<br/><br/>Hundreds of thousands of families have had their incomes radically reduced.  The families who own small businesses throughout the country have had their incomes massacred.  There is no doubt that the biggest driver of poverty is currently Covid and the Government's response to it.  We are adding &euro;30 billion of deficit debt onto the State this year.  The State already has one of the largest national debts of any country in the world <i>per capita</i>.  It is likely that within, three, four or five years - perhaps within the lifetime of the Government - we could have a debt of &euro;300 billion a year in this State.  That would be a radical debt and would mean we would have to increase our interest repayments significantly.  Interest repayments currently cost the State about &euro;6 billion per year, which is two-thirds of the education budget from preschool right up to fourth level.  If that has to be increased to about &euro;9 billion over the next number of years in order to meet that new debt, that is an opportunity cost.  It is money that will come out of housing, education, healthcare and the pockets of families throughout Ireland.  It will add significantly to child poverty within the country.  It is time for the Government to challenge and fight Covid in the best way it can, but we need some level of proportion, balance and understanding of the ramifications for the rest of society of those policies.</p></speech>

We need to take into consideration the ramifications Covid-19 will create for low-income families over the next number of months and into next year.  Anybody studying the statistics which show the number of young people who are in, or are in danger of being in, poverty at present will know that this is indeed a very frightening time.</p>  <p>  Social welfare payments will be extremely important over the next number of months.  It is very important that, now more than ever before, our community welfare officers, who do excellent work, play an important role.  They have knowledge of their local communities.  I remind the House that there were plans by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to do away with social welfare inspectors and community officers.  Thankfully, the Department has realised how important those eyes and ears are and how important it is to have people on the ground who know local families who are what I would call vulnerable and are in need and who can ensure those needs can be addressed.  It is terribly important to retain that connectivity.</p>  <p>  Welfare inspectors cannot have the type of face-to-face meetings they used to have, but when they see applications for supplementary welfare allowances for whatever a need may be they can deal with them using their local knowledge which is terribly important.  The next number of months will be vital and it is important that we protect children from poverty by protecting their parents from it.</p></speech>

I agree 100% with the motion in that child poverty is a criticism of the Government.  What does poverty do to children?  It takes away their childhood that they do not understand is missing.  It can impair their education, health and well-being.  Child poverty rates in Ireland doubled during the last recession.  One in five children is currently at risk of poverty.  Who knows what figures Covid will bring?  According to the Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions published in 2019, more than 200,000 Irish children are living in poverty.  The survey indicated that 689,000 people, including 202,000 children, are living under the poverty line.  There are 36,000 more people living in poverty compared with the number a decade ago.  It is worth mentioning that the number of people aged 65 or over living in poverty has risen staggeringly since the previous report in 2008, from 20,000 to 78,000.  I strongly support the motion on child poverty.  The Government must recognise that children and the elderly are the most vulnerable people in society.  We need to look after the well-being of children and others around the country.  The Government should do the right thing.  I support the motion 100%.</p></speech>

As the Minister stated, we all know how important children are and how vital it is that they are protected.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  As the adage goes, praise the young and they will come on in leaps and bounds.  Surveys carried out by Family Carers Ireland indicate that many children are family carers.  This issue involves significant amounts of money.  Imagine teenagers or younger children caring for sick people because the Government will not step in and does not have proper care systems in place.  Imagine the damage that is doing to those children.  They are being denied their right to take part in sport, the arts, creative work or whatever else they wish to do.  Some of them are even being denied their right to attend second level education.  In my opinion, that is noting short of child abuse.</p>  <p>  We need to deal with this issue.  The motion is fine but there should be no more talk.  What is going to be done?  Will these children be looked after properly?  The House has passed legislation dealing with children.  There was a children's referendum.  It involved very pious platitudes, but what came out of it?  Tusla is going around doing investigations and, in many cases, intervening and taking children from homes.  It is a shocking indictment of the State that in 2020 and even before Covid there are no proper supports or respect for na daoine &oacute;ige.  Young people are our future.  They are our brightest and best and will go on to fulfil their promise if they get the proper opportunities.  There should be equal opportunity.  There is much talk in this House about equality.  Much of it is tokenism.  Where is the equality for the many children who are in poverty or being encouraged to act as drug mules and money mules and other things like that?  That was addressed last week in the House.  The opportunity for such children to be exploited in that way is there because the legislation is not strong enough.  Do we care enough about children?  We should care more about them.  They certainly should not be expected to have to be the carer for a grandparent, parent or sibling.  The State should employ the necessary staff to work as carers.  I support the motion.</p></speech>

It gives us an opportunity to discuss this issue.  Low- and medium-income families are under savage financial pressure.  The cost of providing a home, by renting or otherwise, and putting food on the table is a real problem for many families.  I wish to appeal to community welfare officers, who are doing very good work, to continue to look after low-income families and ensure that children have food and that all their needs are met.  Some children go to school hungry in the mornings.  The schools discreetly look after them and give them the opportunity to get food.  That is one aspect of the matter that we, as elected representatives, should address by insisting that schools get financial assistance to provide this service for children who go into their classroom hungry.  It is not a widespread problem, but it is a real problem that is happening in rural and urban schools.  It is a problem that arises because money is scarce.  For those who are living on the bread line, money is very tight.  Whatever else happens, we must ensure that children are not left hungry.  In these times, many people are eating more than they ought.  I may be one of them.  We must ensure that school children and other young children have enough to eat and that their needs are met.  We have a duty to do so.</p></speech>

As the country entered the current crisis, 700,000 people were living below the poverty line and 225,000 of them were children.  The ESRI sounded a stark warning on a big increase in child poverty this year.  Social supports are very important and I support all measures called for in the motion.  The Government has committed to maintaining social welfare payments but they are not enough.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul estimates that an individual needs at least &euro;250 per week for a basic standard of living.</p>  <p>  I wish to concentrate on a key factor in widespread poverty, namely, the prevalence of low pay and precarious work and the high number of part-time workers who wish to be allocated more hours.  Some one in five workers is low paid.  Many of them, such as porters, cleaners, catering staff, retail workers, workers in the HSE and other workers across the board, played a front-line role in the pandemic.  Dublin is the second most expensive city in the EU in which to live, with only Copenhagen being more expensive.  It is impossible to survive on a minimum wage or working part time with limited hours.</p>  <p>  Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Gerry Light of Mandate Trade Union were absolutely correct to withdraw from the Low Pay Commission.  A rise of less than 1% in the minimum wage is a derisory offer.  We need to move to the living wage, which currently stands at &euro;12.30.  It should be at least &euro;15 per hour.  The minimum wage is supposed to be a floor, but for many workers it is a ceiling.  In the hospitality sector in particular, it is the maximum wage and the norm, leaving workers to rely on tips, if they get them.  In the past, sectoral employment orders were used in areas in which it was difficult to organise workers into unions.  This is now a significant problem for workers on low pay or with limited hours and precarious employment.  There is a virtual reign of terror by management and workers are afraid to raise their voices, never mind join a union.</p>  <p>  The key to combatting low pay and child poverty is a well-organised, unionised work force.  Legislative change is necessary to help unions and workers to organise.  Two things are required.  First, unions should have a right of access to workplaces for health and safety inspections, to check conditions for compliance with labour law and to talk to workers without threats or reprisals by management.  Second, workers should have the right not just to join a union, but to be represented by a union of their choice.  I raise these issues while fully supporting the motion because as long as we have widespread low pay, we will have widespread child poverty.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Whitmore and the Social Democrats for bringing the motion before the D&aacute;il.  It is a reflection on how seriously the House takes this subject that there was barely a quorum to deal with this business today.  The silence of the D&aacute;il speaks volumes.</p> <p>In that sense, I feel sorry for the Minister, but perhaps that will give him more inspiration to begin to lead.  While I welcome the Minister's speech and the positive things the Minister has said, I am disappointed that there is no commitment to the eradication of poverty.  We do not want a reduction in policy.  We want an eradication in policy.  If we do not that, we cannot call ourselves a republic.</p> <p> Many references have been made to the Constitution, which I have not time to go into.  I refer to Article 42A, where we committed to cherishing all of the nation equally.  Here we are in 2020 and we cannot call ourselves a republic if we tolerate poverty.  The figures are startling and it does not matter where one quotes them from.  There is no getting away from it.  I welcome the steps that have been taken but those steps have failed to realise, as has been pointed out by other speakers, that poverty is a direct result of Government policy over the years.  For example, one of the strongest messages from myself, from other Deputies and from Social Justice Ireland is that there is a need to build public housing on public land and stop privatising our housing, which is one of the major contributors to poverty.  For a long time, social welfare expenditure was up around &euro;19 billion.  It is higher now with Covid.  Without social welfare, we would have a country full of poverty.  It is social welfare that is lifting people out of the poverty.  Notwithstanding social welfare, in 2018 almost 680,000 people were living below the poverty line, of whom 200,000 were under 18.  I could quote many figures but I do not want to quote figures.  I want to appeal to the Minister to begin to look at the policies of the Government and to poverty proof them.  Years ago, the Combat Poverty Agency attempted to do something like that before the Government abolished it.  We are back now with a motion drawing attention to the levels of poverty in Ireland without directly looking at the cause.</p> <p> Europe and the European Court of Auditors have been mentioned.  One of the articles of the Lisbon treaty, on which we were forced to vote twice to get the right answer, includes a strong commitment to increase our military spending progressively.  Can the Minister imagine if we had an article in the Lisbon treaty requiring us to increase progressively our spending to eradicate poverty by 2025?  Can the Minister imagine the difference that would make?  We can do it with military spending.  Can the Minister imagine that we have it in black and white that all countries, including Ireland, will progressively increase our military spending?  Following up on that, they have regular meetings to examine how much is being spent and how effectively it is being spent with a view to going forward to a European army, which is for another day's discussion.  If we can set such targets for military spending, surely we can set a realistic target to eliminate poverty in Ireland, not only for the sake of eliminating poverty but also because we would then have a thriving economy.  Our economy will thrive when we do not have poverty and we realise that we should not be concerned with lifting adults and children out of poverty for their own sake, but for our sake.  That is when we will have a true republic and a truly thriving economy, and that is when we will be able to call ourselves one of the fastest growing and richest countries in the world with pride.  We will have pride in having eliminated a gap that is a direct result of Government policies.</p> <p> The Minister has a golden opportunity.  We will be behind him.  We will work with him, but he must have a target to eradicate poverty and to poverty proof all his policies.</p></speech>

Up the road in the Rotunda, some children will be born today and during this week into situations where they will virtually have every opportunity in the world open to them.  There will be others who, by chance of birth, will be born into poverty.  The unfairness and wrongness of that should eat us all to the core.  For children born into that situation, their window of opportunity starts to tighten almost immediately.  It is our job to slow that tightening to keep that window of opportunity open.</p>  <p>  I feel very strongly about this issue.  I am glad to have an opportunity to work on this issue over the next few years and glad to be working with my colleague for some years, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on the issue of child poverty.</p>  <p>  A range of important issues have been raised throughout the course of this debate.  I would like to be clear that from my point of view and that of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Government as a whole, tackling child poverty is a Government priority, especially in the context of the potentially destructive effects that will come from the impacts of the Covid crisis, the full extent of which we have yet to learn.</p>  <p>  As the House may be aware, the programme for Government commits to the publication and implementation of a successor to the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures strategy, as mentioned earlier by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  Continuing to address child poverty will be a central component of this strategy, according to an ambitious target-led strategy, and I welcome the commitment from the Minister in that regard today.</p>  <p>  The programme also commits to implement the current First 5 strategy for babies, young children and their families, which outlines a number of poverty prevention measures.  We have also committed to work across Government to address food poverty.  The school meals programme is a key component of this and with the co-operation of our schools around the country, this programme continued during the summer months and during the pandemic.  I was also pleased to see that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, recently announced a &euro;152 million package for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance which has been extended to include parents receiving the pandemic unemployment payment.</p>  <p>  The current target in relation to child poverty is to lift 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, which would represent a reduction of at least two thirds on the 2011 level.  Significant progress has been made in addressing child poverty in recent years, although I acknowledge, as others have, that significant work remains if we are to achieve a truly meaningful reduction.  It is important to acknowledge progress because it gives us hope and makes us realise that this is achievable.  In that regard, it is important to mention a couple of figures.  In 2013, the consistent poverty rate for children peaked at 12.7% or 150,000 children.  By 2018, we had reduced that to 7.7% or 92,000 children.  This means that 58,000 children, or over one third of the peak total, were taken out of consistent poverty between 2013 and 2018.  This is achievable.  The 2018 rate of 7.7% was the lowest since 2008, when the rate was 6.2%.</p>  <p>  The previous four budgets have introduced a number of measures that will continue to have a direct and positive impact on poverty, particularly child poverty.  The full impact of these measures is still being realised, although I acknowledge that Covid-19 creates further challenges.</p>  <p>  In terms of my own direct responsibility, the Roadmap for Social Inclusion was adopted in January of this year and is the latest in a series of national inclusion strategies dating back to 1997 and the time of the Combat Poverty Agency, to which Deputy Connolly referred.  This overarching statement of Government strategy acknowledges a range of sectoral plans with social inclusion as a core objective.  The roadmap sets targets against a number of key aspects of social inclusion with a view to positioning Ireland as a top performer within Europe.  With regard to child poverty, the target is to reduce the at risk of poverty or social exclusion rate for those under 18 years sufficiently to move Ireland into the top five EU countries by 2025.  To this end, the roadmap establishes a series of commitments, one of which is to continue to target a reduction in poverty among children and families on low incomes as part of the annual budget process and to establish a report on a new target in respect of child poverty.  As part of the governance process underpinning this strategy, I will chair the interdepartmental steering group tasked with monitoring progress against each of the 66 unique commitments outlined in the roadmap.</p>  <p>  I have to agree that having some 92,000 children in consistent poverty is not acceptable.</p> <p>That is why recent budgets have focused on improvements for families and children through various measures, such as targeted increases in social welfare payments and supports for families; increases in the weekly qualified child rates; increases in the income thresholds for the working family payment; increases in the earnings disregard for the lone parent and jobseeker's transition payments; the roll-out of the national childcare scheme to support parents in employment and those who wish to return to employment to take up education or training opportunities; the extension of the free GP care to children under eight years; the introduction of free dental care for children up to six years; the availability of free universal preschool provision for two years through the early childhood care and education scheme; and the introduction of paternity and parental leave to support parents of young children.  There is also the continued implementation of the DEIS action plan to address and prioritise the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities from preschool to second level.  In the context of the pandemic and what this Government has achieved, this has been a crucial anti-poverty measure to get the schools open and keep them open.  Everyone will agree that has been an important achievement in recent months.<br/><br/>When I have the opportunity to speak, I like to bring the voice of the people we talk about into the debate as much as possible.  I thank Deputy Gannon for this in particular.  I will read some short testimonies from the Children's Rights Alliance report on children in homelessness.  I have asked my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to take heed of these accounts.  This is the personal testimony from Veronica, aged 26:</p><blockquote>	It was costing me &euro;6 every morning on a lunch for Alice going to school and I&rsquo;d have to buy that in the garage.  So I was driving to the garage, getting the breakfast because I had no fridge I couldn&rsquo;t store anything.  Then coming up to the Christmas I was trying to save a few quid for Santa so I went and bought some yoghurts and butter and cheese and I left it in my car because it was freezing, so that was my fridge.  There was a communal kitchen but there were no locks on anything, so if you went and done your shopping and there was another family there that didn't, they would help themselves to your food.  When you came back later in the afternoon everything was gone.  Eventually I bought a kettle, I boiled eggs in it and steamed the baby's bottles with it, and we used it for soup, we had soup and rolls. </blockquote> <p>I will read one more, the personal testimony of Jessica, aged 24:</p><blockquote>	When we were in the hotel and moving around, Clare's behaviour got very, very bad you know.  She was very, I don&rsquo;t like to say bold but she was very bold, you know she was just acting up all the time like, attention-seeking and screaming, all this stuff.  She lashed out all the time, you know we&rsquo;d come back to the hotel, and then, if we were after booking out and booking back in, we&rsquo;d change room, like they&rsquo;d give us a different room.  Clare wouldn&rsquo;t understand.  She&rsquo;d be on the floor in the hallway shouting, 'This is our house!'  You know so I had to kind of explain to her somehow like, 'No we&rsquo;re in this one today', it wasn&rsquo;t nice to try to explain that to her. </blockquote> <p>I reaffirm my commitment and that of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Government to tackling child poverty.  The most recent data from 2018 show how far we have come but also how much further there is to go.  We have set ourselves an ambitious target which we remain committed to.  Strategies such as the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and the successor, Better Outcomes, Brighter Future, will help us to achieve the target.</p></speech>

The people we represent expect better.  I urge the Minister of State and his Department to do more and do better.  I say that respectfully, as I think he agrees.</p>  <p>  Our motion speaks to an ugly truth in Irish society.  It highlights a reality that is often overlooked.  While the "term child poverty" conjures up images of 20th century slums, the fact is that over 200,000 children are at risk of poverty in Ireland and more than 90,000 are in consistent poverty.  That is more children than the entire population of my constituency.  These children are at risk of, or live in, economic and material deprivation.  This means that they do not have guaranteed access to sufficient food, shelter, health care, and other essentials that so many of us take for granted.  These are truly shocking figures, all the more so for a country that is considered one of the wealthiest in Europe.  These children are living in households with low incomes.  They experience what it is like to go without basics, to go without food when they are hungry or heat when they are cold and to grow up with entire families in cramped hotel rooms or bed and breakfast accommodation, without room to develop or a quiet place to do their schoolwork.</p>  <p>  Analysis by the CSO has found that the risk of poverty is higher in rural areas compared to urban areas.  The consistent erosion of working conditions means that many farming and fishing families fall below the poverty line.  At the start of the pandemic, volunteers in west Cork food banks were worried that they would not be able to get enough supplies to ensure families in my constituency would be fed.  A primary school principal recently explained to me how several households were dependent on the school meals scheme.  This reality often goes unnoticed.  In both rural and urban Ireland, there are children going hungry or without the structures they need to develop healthily and to their full potential.  Their childhoods will be book-ended by two recessions, and this will leave an impact on their opportunities and ability to reach their potential for the rest of their lives.  We know children bore the brunt of the last recession.  We cannot allow that to happen again.</p>  <p>  These inequalities will perpetuate class and social division for future generations and lead to social exclusion for many of these children.  They have not made this choice.  They are victims of a society that does not see them as important as corporate tax breaks, or investment companies and housing developers.</p>  <p>  We also know that poverty affects children from minority backgrounds or children with disabilities more.  Our disability support organisations and professionals do amazing work, but they simply do not have the resources to help everybody properly.  We all know stories of children waiting years for vital operations and therapeutic services, confined to inappropriate wheelchairs, or not being able to be educated in their area.  If their family has the means, they can get these privately; if not, they must wait, sometimes in pain, for the State to get around to them.  This is the reality of child poverty in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is a huge indictment of our society that child poverty continues to persist in any form, let alone in the significant numbers that we see today.  Our youngest and most vulnerable citizens continue to be deprived of their childhood, their health and their well-being.  It does not have to be like this.  The eradication of child poverty is fully within our reach, and it can be done within the lifetime of this D&aacute;il if the Government shows ambition and provides the commitment and means to do so.</p>  <p>  Our motion today aims to address child poverty in Ireland and elicit a whole-of-Government response.  We are echoing calls by Social Justice Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent De Paul, the Children's Rights Alliance and others.  This Government needs to legislate to end child poverty and establish a child poverty unit, headed by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The only way to do this is with collaboration across all Departments, including that of the Minister of State, and by poverty proofing every piece of legislation, starting with the budget.  This motion is a means to end child poverty.  It goes to the heart of why we are public representatives.  We have a choice today.  I urge our fellow Deputies both in opposition and in government to support this motion and to make a commitment not just to reduce child poverty or increase funding, but to implement real change underpinned by legislation and end child poverty in Ireland for good.  We can and should end child poverty.  I thank other parties for their support today and thank my colleague, Deputy Whitmore, for the work she has put into this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000014#M00400"><p>I thank the Members who have supported the motion.  While I thank the Minister for his contribution, I was incredibly disappointed with it because it did not address the issue.  In order for us to solve a problem, we must acknowledge that it exists.  The Government's amendment does not recognise that there is a problem with poverty or child poverty in this country.  It suggests the Government thinks that the steps it and previous Governments have taken are sufficient for us to address the major issue of poverty that we have.</p>  <p>  Simply by setting a target to pull 70,000 children out of consistent child poverty over a seven-year period, the Government of the time acknowledged that it was okay to leave 30,000 or 35,000 children behind.  I do not believe it is acceptable for any child in this country to live in consistent poverty.  Any child who does live in consistent poverty reflects a failure by the Government in its duty of care to those children.</p>  <p>When we set such targets, we are acknowledging that we are okay with allowing a certain number of children to fall between the cracks.  That is not okay.  It is why the Social Democrats have set a target of elimination.  It is only then that we will show real leadership on addressing this problem.  We need to be ambitious.  It is not ambitious to say that we will leave thousands of children behind because our policies cannot be refined or robust enough to deal with them.</p> <p> The Minister stated that the programme for Government committed to addressing child poverty, but it does not even mention the term "child poverty".  The Minister referred to how we needed evidence to address the issue, but we already have that evidence.  We have target after target that we have not met.  We have report after report.  For example, there have been 12 reports on one-parent families and poverty.  We have the reports and evidence that we need.  We do not need any more.  Rather, we need action to address these issues.  The children who are living in consistent poverty now and who were living in it in the previous recession need us to move quickly.  Otherwise, we will burden them through our inaction and poor decisions.  It is not fair.</p> <p> I was disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity to be strong and brave on this matter.  As new Deputies, we come into the D&aacute;il and think about what we can achieve and the difference we can make.  The Minister, his party colleagues and every other new Deputy have come to the D&aacute;il with those ambitions, but it is through decisions like the one to be taken today that we will actually realise them.  It will not be done by postponing, playing politics with or ripping everything out of a solid motion and replacing it with something that is wishy-washy and has no concrete targets or objectives.  That is not how we will address this issue.  The children of the country deserve much better.</p> <p> Deputy Connolly referred to how it was difficult to get a quorum today.  I wonder whether that was because many Deputies were up watching last night's debate in the US.  This raises a point that we need to be conscious about.  We look to the US in shock, horror or, sometimes, derision.  Unless we start tackling our systemic societal issues, we will split our country in two and face the exact same situation as the US or, indeed, the UK, with whole generations left behind and feeling disenfranchised.  It is on a day like today that we can actually stop that from happening.</p> <p> Before they vote, I call on all Deputies, in particular Government Deputies, to please think about why they got involved in politics and what they wanted to achieve.  Our children need us to be brave and ambitious.  They need us in their corner.  They cannot afford to bear the burden of our inaction or bad policy decisions on their shoulders any longer.</p></speech>

It argues that the pandemic will result in a drop in the private sector supply of new homes.  This will further widen the gap between supply and demand, making housing even more unaffordable for working people.  The ESRI's central recommendation is commonsensical and crystal clear - the State must increase the supply of social and affordable homes.  This is the only way to deliver homes more cheaply and efficiently.</p><p>Yesterday, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, published its latest rent report.  Despite Covid-19, rents remain unacceptably high.  Throughout the State, they have risen by almost 2% since last June.  Outside Dublin and the commuter belt, the increase was in excess of 3%.  Too many people are trapped in a rental market with sky-high prices.  They are put to the pin of their collars with extortionate rents stifling their potential and impacting on their ability to deal with the pandemic.</p><p>Last month, Daft.ie released its latest price report.  Now, the average house price in Dublin is a staggering &euro;380,000.  Even a couple on good incomes are unable to afford a home in Dublin at such prices.</p><p>Gheall an Taoiseach go gcuirfeadh an Rialtas seo tithe inacmhainne ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine at&aacute; ag obair.  Le linn an toghch&aacute;in i bhFeabhra, ba &iacute; an tith&iacute;ocht an cheist ba mh&oacute; a bh&iacute; ann.  T&aacute; an iomarca daoine gafa i margadh c&iacute;osa le praghsanna ag ard&uacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  The Taoiseach promised that the Government would deliver affordable homes for working people.  During the election in February, housing was the main issue on the doorstep.  People were crying out for affordable homes, with families left behind because of the failure of successive Governments to deliver.</p><p>If we ever needed a reminder of the importance of a stable roof over our heads, the pandemic has provided it.  During the pandemic, people's homes have truly become their sanctuaries.  If the Ireland that emerges after this crisis is to be in any way fair and one that gives people a decent chance and a fresh start, we have to get housing right.  Decent, affordable and secure housing is the bedrock on which decent lives are built.</p><p>Despite all of the promises made by Fianna F&aacute;il during the election, the sluggish approach of the Government to get to grips with housing is astonishing.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, spent the entire summer telling everyone that the Government's housing plan was on the way.  On 7 July, he said that he would announce details of the new affordable scheme in September.  On 9 July, he reiterated this on Newstalk and said that new affordable housing regulations would be ready to launch by September.  On 12 July, he told <i>thejournal.ie</i>that new affordable home targets would be set out in September.  Speaking in opposition to our motion on affordable housing in July, he again promised to announce the details of his new scheme in September.</p><p>Today is the last day of September.  Hundreds of thousands of working people want to know where the Government's affordable housing plan is and why the Minister has not kept his and the Taoiseach's promise to launch the plan this month.</p></speech>

I want to say that, contrary to the pandemic increasing affordability issues in the sector, the ESRI is actually saying that, in the short term, affordability may have actually improved over recent months because of, to use its own phrase, "extraordinary fiscal measures [introduced by the Government] in the form of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)".  It does acknowledge extraordinary interventions by the Government.</p>  <p>  That said, it does, of course, warn that, in the medium term, there could be a significant imbalance in terms of demand and supply, and we take that very seriously indeed.  We already know that Covid-19 has negatively impacted on the building programme because of the lockdown itself.  House completions fell by 32% according to the report.  We are now looking at an expected outturn of 15,000 to 16,000 houses as opposed to the expected 24,500 because of the impact of the lockdown and the constraints that Covid has brought to the construction sector.</p> <p>That said, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was very quick off the mark with the July stimulus, with more than &euro;40 million allocated to bring 2,500 social housing units back into play to be allocated to people on the housing list before the end of the year.  That money went out to the local authorities.  It was a quick action that had not been called for by anybody in this House but the Government took the initiative to get moving on it and get it done.</p> <p> I agree with the ESRI that we need to build more social and affordable housing and, in particular, that we need to have a strong social housing programme built by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  That is something the Government will be targeting and identifying in the Estimates for next year and the budgetary framework in terms of creating the framework that will facilitate a greater supply of affordable housing in the time ahead.  The serviced sites initiative has been slow in getting off the ground, but there are concrete proposals under way which will develop results from that particular initiative.</p> <p> Aonta&iacute;m gan amhras go bhfuil ceist na tith&iacute;ochta ar an &aacute;bhar is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; s&oacute;isialta na linne seo.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil s&eacute; mar phr&iacute;omhfheidhm ag an Rialtas n&iacute;os m&oacute; tithe poibl&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine at&aacute; ag feitheamh chun dul isteach go dt&iacute; na tithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  Caithfimid n&iacute;os m&oacute; tithe a chur ar f&aacute;il agus beimid chun n&iacute;os m&oacute; infheist&iacute;ochta a chur ar f&aacute;il chun na tithe seo a chruth&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach ar fad.</p> <p> I also point out that the impact on the labour market, as the ESRI has shown, is unprecedented.  We will be looking at the construction sector as a mechanism to create additional employment over the medium term in the context of the impact of Covid-19 on employment.  Housing construction, both social and affordable, will help to underpin jobs in the construction sector and, indeed, increase the number of available jobs.  That is why there was very substantial funding made available in the July stimulus for additional apprenticeships to be provided by giving incentives to employers to hire more apprentices, which is working, and to create a whole range of skill courses to provide for additional skill needs to meet the need to build more social and affordable housing.  We agree that there is such a need.</p></speech>

Is &iacute; sin an fh&iacute;rinne.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n le r&aacute; aige ach n&iacute;l aon phlean aige.  He cited the extraordinary income support measures that were introduced by Government.  Of course, the Government has cut the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy and it has left tens of thousands of the lowest income workers out of the schemes.  Please do not brag or hide behind those initiatives.</p><p>We were promised and the people were promised a scheme and a plan for affordable housing.  We were promised we would see it in September but we have not seen it yet.  To judge by the Taoiseach's response, I can only conclude that no such plan exists.  If it does, will he tell us whether it is the Government's intention to publish it today?  This policy of <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>, <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>and putting everything on the long finger seems to be one of the hallmarks of this chaotic Government, but it is not good enough.  It is not good enough for people who, as we speak, do not have a secure roof over their heads, people who worry about rent, people who are in an extraordinarily difficult and precarious position, people who live in the box room of their mother's home, sometimes with their own children.  <i>Ma&ntilde;ana</i>, <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>is not good enough.  Talk and sound are not good enough from the Taoiseach or the Minister.  Has the Taoiseach an affordable housing plan?  Where is the plan?  We have not see it in September.  When will we finally see a plan for affordable housing?</p></speech>

They talk a lot about those things but, in my view, much of it is without substance.  If one reads the ESRI report comprehensively, it uses the phrase "extraordinary fiscal interventions" in reference to the Government's actions, which Deputy McDonald just condemns, attacks and undermines.  She has done so from the very beginning, in a very unrealistic way, and she continues to do so.</p>  <p>  As I said, &euro;40 million provided in July alone for 2,500 units was very quick off the mark.  Deputy McDonald could not acknowledge that and had to come out and condemn it because that is her stock-in-trade.  She will condemn anything that emanates from Government whether it is positive or not.  That is the Sinn F&eacute;in approach, followed by seeking to undermine Ministers one by one.  That is what the Deputy's party does.  Alternatively, what the Government is doing is of real substance in terms of economic interventions from July onwards, not just in terms of the fiscal interventions but also in terms of the capital programme in July, which was very comprehensive and substantial and will underpin the construction sector into the future, from apprenticeships and right across the sector.  In terms of social and affordable housing, we are committed to delivering it.  Historically, we did it before as a party and we are committed now to delivering social and affordable housing.  That will be clear both in the budget and in the time ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000016#O00800"><p>As I said yesterday, I welcome the fact that the acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn, has given clarity that Covid is going to be with us at least for the next six to nine months and we need to plan for it.  The economic forecast yesterday presented a very bleak picture as regards unemployment for the next 12 months, particularly in regard to unemployment in the domestic economy and for young people.  It is very worrying.  The unemployment rate for the year is expected to be approximately 16%, which is worse than during the financial crisis a decade ago, falling to 10.7% in 2021.  It is going to hit local economies especially hard because they are depending on the domestic economy, whereas the multinationals are not particularly dependent on it and they are the ones that have kept the country going to some extent as regards unemployment.</p><p>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the hospitality, tourism, entertainment and food industries.  I want to know specifically what the Government is going to do for the people working in those industries because they are bearing the brunt of the crisis more than anyone else.  I say this with some knowledge as I used to work in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which I have referenced a number of times before.  The issue for me is that it looks like we are going to have continual local lockdowns of counties depending on the way things develop.  That is something we can assume will happen.  It will have a huge impact on these sectors because from day to day, week to week and month to month, people working in hospitality, including in pubs and restaurants, people driving tour buses, accommodation providers and those working all across the tourism sector, will not know if they are going to have an income.  They will not know what their income is going to be and they will have very little notice of any lockdowns.  By the way, that is not necessarily anybody's fault.  I am saying this to be constructive and not to make a political point.  It is not necessarily anybody's fault.  We see that there are 100,000 people claiming the PUP in Dublin, which is an increase in the numbers, and most of them are in the hospitality, tourism, accommodation and food sectors.</p><p>I want to know what is going to be done for those people.  We cannot continue to have a situation where they are put into lockdowns and are unable to provide a service.  They do not know if their county or area will be next and they do not have a stable income.  Will the Taoiseach consider a full restoration of the pandemic unemployment payment on a sectoral basis for these sectors and industries, namely, hospitality, tourism, accommodation, food and drink?  We need to plan for something like that.  For more than a year, the Labour Party has called for an Irish <i>Kurzarbeit</i>modelled on Germany's short-term work scheme for these sectors so that there can at least be retraining going on while there is a PUP-type payment.  Will the Taoiseach consider a sectoral payment for all of these areas over the next six months?  If all of these people are worried about their county going into lockdown, we must have a mechanism to keep them going, keep income coming in and ensure there is continuity in regard to employment in the sector.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the impact of Covid-19 on the economy has been very severe in 2020, and especially on the domestic side of the economy.  Regarding the multinational sector, it is worth saying this, and the Deputy will acknowledge it and get it, but a lot of people in the House do not get it, that Sinn F&eacute;in and the far left have never acknowledged or accepted the extraordinary impact the multinational sector has had on our economy.  It is 250,000 direct jobs and 450,000 jobs dependent on that sector.  It has been significant in enabling the country to try to get through this unprecedented global pandemic and its impact.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly is correct in identifying the hospitality, food and accommodation sectors as those that have been particularly impacted by Covid-19.  It is no-one's fault other than Covid-19 because the virus thrives in congregated settings.  The virus also affects the other related sectors of music and entertainment, or wherever people gather and audiences are required, because the virus thrives there.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the whole variety of supports offered already, from restart grants to microenterprise loans and so on.  Many businesses, however, do not want to take on any more debt.  We get that.  Hence the various general VAT reductions.  We will have to look again at more sector-specific approaches or look at how we can keep as many businesses and enterprises in the tourism sector viable and intact over the medium term.  That is the challenge and we are working on that.  We are reflecting on how best to do that across the board to see what is the most effective way of retaining viability so that when Covid is over, businesses can re-emerge and get going again in creating employment in the tourism and hospitality sector.</p></speech>

We need a plan here for when accommodation providers and tour operators lose their bookings, and we know all about the events sector too.  I ask the Taoiseach to put sectoral changes into the budget for these specific industries.  I also ask the Taoiseach to consider what extra can be done when lockdowns are put in place.  It is obvious now that we will have to consider more localised lockdowns rather than county-specific lockdowns, something we would support.  I agree that we cannot add on debt, but we need to look at a scheme such as the <i>Kurzarbeit</i>scheme in Germany, which is very successful.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider such a scheme during his budget considerations, because I do not believe we can get through the winter, and I say this with a lot of knowledge.  We will lose a whole sector or a large percentage of the sector if we do not plan for the next six months and our budget has to do that.</p></speech>

The scheme referred to by Deputy Kelly is being looked at.  There is also the broader issue of how we sustain our hospitality sector over the medium term, acknowledging and accepting that Covid-19 will have a significant impact on our economy for the full 12 months of 2021.  If we accept that it has a specific impact on the food, accommodation, beverage and hospitality sector, then we have to look at other ways of helping the sector and the enterprises to come through, to preserve as much employment as we can in the sector, and to support people as effectively as we can.  It is the one sector that is taking a greater hit than others.</p>  <p>  It is interesting to note with regard to private coaches and other coach travel taking a big hit that it is hoped the significant allocation yesterday by the Cabinet of more than &euro;100 million to fulfil the public health recommendations for school transport may help that sector.  Education did not particularly welcome the fact that it was &euro;100 million, but it could help the coach and bus sector to get through this.  We have to be innovative in how we can get other things done while supporting this sector for when Covid is over.  Retraining and the human capital programme are also significant.</p></speech>

There have been recent job losses in the sector due to lost advertising revenue as a result of Covid, and many more titles, broadcasters and jobs are under threat.  This comes at a time when it has never been more important that the public can rely on trusted sources for their information at local, regional and national level, and indeed via online platforms.</p><p>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that it is essential that the make up of the commission is inclusive.  The last thing we want to see is a worthy initiative such as the establishment of this commission falling short because there are gaps in expertise.  It is also essential that the terms of reference of the commission are broad enough and cover all the key issues without being too unwieldy.</p><p>The sustainability of the media sector is impacted by Covid-19 but it has also been hugely impacted in recent years by the loss of advertising revenue to social media platforms and digital search engines.  I would have thought this aspect would have been thoroughly considered, particularly given that some of these platforms do not themselves generate content but rely on the work of others for content.</p><p>The terms of reference provide for the commission to look at Irish public service broadcasters as well as other broadcasters in addition to the print media at all levels, and to look at a sustainable future.  That is the central tenet of the work.  There are, however, other aspects that impinge on the sector's sustainability, including Ireland's defamation laws.  While everyone is entitled to his or her good name, the balance of our defamation laws often protects the individual at the expense of  society.  I would have thought the commission would have been asked to consider this important aspect, not least because it has a chilling effect.  Issues that are in the public interest on occasions are not aired because of the risk of ending up in the High Court, which has the potential to put further jobs in the industry at risk.  It often takes significant courage on behalf of an editor to air stories.  What we saw that recently in the past year with <i>The Sunday Times</i>and the very successful book written by Mark Tighe and Paul Rowan that is out at the moment articulates that very well.  Many sports journalists were frustrated over the years that they could not write those stories.  Had they been able to write those stories, one wonders if the FAI would be in the position it is at the moment.  It just demonstrates the point.</p><p>A defamation case was successfully defended last year, which was in the courts for three weeks.  The courts are not always available to citizens but they are certainly available to those with deep pockets and a zest for litigation.</p><p>The NUJ has looked for trade union and print industry representation on the commission.  Others have looked for similar representation for the digital news media and the university sector.  Will the Taoiseach consider expanding the make-up of the commission?  Will he extend the terms of reference to include social media platforms and our defamation laws?</p></speech>

A strong, vibrant and independent media on all platforms is central to our parliamentary democracy and to freedom of speech.  The Future of Media Commission is platform agnostic in that sense.  It is not taking a preferential view of one platform over another.  It is being asked to look at public service broadcasting into the future and how that should be underpinned, public service media, which are important, how to ensure ring-fenced editorial independence into the future, and financial sustainability, which is in its terms of reference.  The Deputy is correct when she says that advertising revenues plummeted when the pandemic hit.  Yet, we still depended on all media to be an enormous assistance to society and to the State in the public health messages that emerged during the pandemic, from local radio to print media to television and social media.</p> <p>There has been very significant innovation in terms of online journals and online media platforms like The Currency, Joe.ie and The Journal, among many others.  Therefore, we must look at what the future holds.  There is a lot of expertise on the commission.</p> <p> There is a commitment in the programme for Government to review and reform our defamation laws to ensure a better balance while protecting freedom of speech and access to justice and to cover the points that the Deputy has correctly identified.  No one likes the current situation because our defamation laws have a chilling effect on quite a lot of journalism and on democracy itself.  A separate look at that would probably be more effective and efficient.  The Future of Media Commission has a lot on its plate already.  The public service dimension is urgent in terms of the financial underpinning of it.  What has been happening over the last number of years is not acceptable and we need to come to a decision, not just at Government level but within the Oireachtas, collectively, on how we financially underpin good public service broadcasting and media.  If we believe in it as a core value of democracy then we have to put aside partisan party politics with a view to doing the right thing for the future of our democracy and for future generations.  This is particularly important in a world where there are lots of competing demands around media, a lot of generation of false facts, fake and misleading news and utilisation of algorithms to distort public information processes.  These practices are very extensive, as recent revelations have shown, and one of the most effective ways to combat it is through a robust, independent, financially sustainable and editorially free media.</p></speech>

I accept that there is a commitment on this in the programme for Government.  I ask the Taoiseach to tell us when he thinks that commitment will be fulfilled by way of legislation.  That said, I would have thought that asking the Future of Media Commission to look at this area would have enriched rather than diminished its work.</p>  <p>  Financial sustainability is related to advertising revenue and there is no doubt that the amount of advertising revenue that is now diverted to social media platforms, some of which do not generate content, is an obvious issue for the commission to examine because financial sustainability of media cannot be guaranteed without income sources.  Obviously RT&Eacute; is our primary public service broadcaster but I hope that the commission will not primarily focus on the sustainability of RT&Eacute; but will have a much wider remit.  I do not see how that can happen if it does not look at advertising revenue, particularly in print media.  Practical experience of the day-to-day problems in the sustainability of local, regional and national titles would have enriched the work of the commission and I am surprised that the make-up of the commission does not include that type of expertise.</p></speech>

Defamation in itself can be complex and needs a separate process involving the Department of Justice and Equality, the Minister with responsibility for media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Government as a whole.  Defamation needs to be reviewed and we will follow through on the programme for Government commitment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy said that some social media platforms do not generate content but quite a lot of them do generate their own content.  It is a new media platform which many use and for some it can be very liberating and productive.  People who may never have gotten an opportunity to contribute through traditional media fora get such an opportunity online.  There are some fantastic blogs and journals and that has to be acknowledged.</p></speech>

It also deals with the financial underpinning of media into the future and the changing media landscape.  Public service broadcasting is still a very important part of that, as is local radio.  We have seen the best of the media during the pandemic itself, which should reinforce our commitment to do something about the financial underpinning of all of that because the current licence fee and collection regime is not fit for purpose.  That will be the big test for the Oireachtas in terms of how we want to underpin media into the future from a financial perspective.</p></speech>

Illegal dumping has gotten completely out of control all over the country in the past few years and it will get worse unless drastic action is taken urgently.  I sent pictures to the Taoiseach's office on Monday to show him what is happening in just one case on the outskirts of Galway city.  I could send him hundreds of examples of cases, as could all Members in this House.  People arrive late at night and just dump rubbish on the side of the road or in a farmer's field.  I am talking here about van loads of rubbish, not just a few bags.  It is then left up to farmers, local communities and local authorities to clean up the mess, at huge cost.  These people keep coming back and keep dumping because they are getting away with it and they know that they will not be caught because garda&iacute; and the local authorities do not have the resources to catch them.</p>  <p>  This illegal dumping is destroying our countryside, towns and villages and most importantly, our environment.  I have seen rubbish, including empty paint cans and dead animals, in streams and rivers that feed into the lakes that supply our drinking water.  The craziest aspect of all of this is that councils are being prevented from using CCTV footage to prosecute people carrying out this dumping because of a ridiculous ruling by the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC.  Galway County Council is one of the local authorities that was specifically ordered not to use CCTV images by the DPC, following an audit.  To add to the craziness, many other local authorities around the country continue to use CCTV footage as evidence in court cases because they have not received a similar order from the DPC as of yet.</p>  <p>  I have always said we should hit illegal dumpers where it hurts and it must hurt them hard.  A specialist taskforce must be set up to deal with this epidemic and it must have power.  When I last raised this issue with the Taoiseach in July, he promised to talk to the Minister responsible about setting up such a taskforce.  If a vehicle or van loaded with rubbish is stopped and the person driving it has no waste disposal permit or if he or she is observed illegally dumping, garda&iacute; and local authorities must have the power to seize the vehicle and a substantial fine in excess of &euro;5,000 must be paid before that vehicle is released.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach deal with the crazy issue concerning the DPC and the non-use of CCTV footage?  Will he set up a taskforce to deal with illegal dumping involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and all stakeholders before our countryside, towns and villages are completely destroyed?  Will the Government introduce solid legislation to give power and funding to local authorities and garda&iacute; so that they can seize the vehicles of those involved in illegal dumping and introduce a fine in excess of &euro;5,000 before culprits get seized vehicles back?</p></speech>

I have the photographs here that the Deputy sent to my office during the week.  They are quite shocking in terms of the appalling levels of dumping in which people are engaging.  Illegal dumping is an attack on our society, our communities and our pristine landscape and there should be zero tolerance for that type of behaviour.  The fines are quite significant for those found to be responsible for the unauthorised disposal of waste.  There is a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and-or imprisonment for up to 12 months, with a maximum fine of &euro;15 million in the Circuit Court on conviction on indictment and-or imprisonment for up to ten years for more serious breaches.</p> <p> The Deputy raised the issue of the use of CCTV data.  As he knows, the Data Protection Commissioner provides guidance concerning statutory obligations placed on those who use CCTV systems to collect personal data and the rights of and redress mechanisms available to individuals whose personal data are collected by such means.  My understanding is the Data Protection Commissioner has written to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications concerning data protection issues with the use of CCTV cameras for litter and waste enforcement purposes.  Apparently, it is the view of the Data Protection Commissioner that although the Litter Pollution Acts and the Waste Management Act provide councils with powers to prevent, investigate, detect and prosecute littering and dumping offences, the Acts do not provide for processing of images of members of the public using CCTV footage.  This advice is currently being considered by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his Department and is subject to legal consideration and advice. </p> <p> In my view, privacy rights should not apply to people who are dumping illegally and if legislation is required to correct this, then it will be brought about urgently.  I spoke to the Minister this morning.  I understand the need for privacy and for property rights to be protected.  On the other hand, we can overdo this.  I think CCTV should be used to catch illegal dumpers and to prosecute them, and there should be no issue around that.  In my view, most people applying a bit of common sense would say that is obviously what should happen because we all know the wanton dumping going on, which is shocking and needs to be stamped out.  CCTV evidence should be available to be used in evidence against people who are doing this on a consistent basis, as the Deputy said.</p> <p> If legislation has to be brought in, it should be brought in very urgently.  I know the Minister's Department is looking to get legal advice in this regard but it is unsatisfactory that such a situation arises and that, essentially, councils are hamstrung and not in a position to pursue people who are flagrantly abusing the law. </p></speech>

One culprit was brought to court, but he was only fined &euro;200 and he was seen a couple of days later dumping illegally.  Strong legislation is needed.  I firmly believe the only way we are going to hurt these individuals and get them to stop is to strengthen the legislation and to seize the vehicle there and then.  We need to take the vehicle from them when it is observed they are dumping illegally and that is proven.  Seizing the vehicle is the only way we are going to stop them.</p>  <p>  The pictures I sent to the Taoiseach's office were taken less than 1 km from the outskirts of Galway city.  It is appalling what is happening and it is not just about Galway because it is happening around the country.  If we do not stop this illegal dumping, our countryside is going to be destroyed, including our environment.  I ask that the Taoiseach would strengthen the legislation and hit them where it hurts.  The vehicle should seized and we should give the local authorities and the Garda the resources to do that.  Hit them where it hurts, take the vehicle from them and let them pay a substantial fine before they get the vehicle back again.</p></speech>

However, the laws are strong enough in that area, for example, under current waste legislation vehicles involved in the carrying out of suspected unlawful waste activity can be seized and, if it is successfully prosecuted, such vehicles can be disposed of as the competent authority sees fit.</p>  <p>  This morning I asked the Minister responsible, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to look at this and I will also ask him if the powers and capacity of the local authorities can be strengthened to make sure there is no legal doubt about the utilisation of CCTV in terms of gathering evidence to investigate and detect illegal dumping, and to prosecute those responsible for illegal dumping.  No one in society wants to condone that or facilitate their evasion of prosecution on technical grounds.</p></speech>

This was the home of The O&rsquo;Rahilly, who was killed in action during the 1916 Rising.  As the Taoiseach knows, he was the leader of the Irish Volunteers and the campaign to save this house in which he lived received very widespread and deserved support right across the public.  Key meetings in regard to the Easter Rising took place at No. 40 Herbert Park, so it was a place of major significance.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, Dublin city councillors voted in support of a Sinn F&eacute;in motion to add this building to the list of protected structures.  For the developers to raze the building to the ground, particularly in the knowledge that decision had been taken by Dublin City Council, is truly reprehensible.  It is a grubby and calculated act of bad faith by the developers.  I understand that Dublin City Council is currently investigating the matter.  Is the Government, and the Minister with responsibility for culture and her Department, assisting in this investigation?</p></speech>

I am very clearly of the view that such iconic historic buildings and locations should be preserved or, at a minimum, incorporated in whatever developments are taking place.  I instanced the Moore Street development and the discussions that took quite considerable time and involved Deputies from all sides of this House, including Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who was particularly effective in that process, to be fair, and an outcome was achieved.  Given the significance of The O&rsquo;Rahilly in terms of the war for independence and his historic significance, to go in yesterday at dawn to destroy the building is absolutely shocking and unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council is the body charged with investigating that.  I welcome that and urge the council to investigate. </p></speech>

The national strategy, Housing First, identifies people who have been rough sleeping, or in and out of emergency accommodation for a number of years, who would benefit from a place under Housing First.  The national strategy goes on to say it would provide enough Housing First places for half the people identified as having high needs.  Under the expansion of Housing First, as promised by the Government, will the Taoiseach commit to providing a Housing First place for every person who is homeless and who has high support needs, given about 1,350 people have been identified?</p></speech>

I also note the initiatives taken by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to date, particularly with regard to the 2,500 voids which will be brought back into use as a result of an initiative under the July stimulus package.  Although I do not have the exact figure with me, a significant number of these properties will go to homeless people.  The call for housing initiated by the Minister primarily aims to see whether councils in Dublin and across the country can quickly secure accommodation, particularly for single homeless people, who make up a significant proportion of those who are homeless right now.  There will be a particular focus on increasing the provision of homes and units to those who are homeless through the social housing programme and the call for housing initiative.</p></speech>

In my area, two post offices are under threat as a result of the outsourcing model which means that the system depends on people being willing to take up the role of postmaster.  There is no commitment to maintain the only publicly owned network to reach into every community, rural and urban.  There is no commitment to sustain that network and to run Government business of all sorts through it in order to protect jobs, communities and the vital communication network provided to all communities in which An Post is represented.

As the Deputy knows, An Post has a strategic plan for the medium and long-term future.  This covers the period from 2017 to 2021.  In order to implement the plan, the cost of which was estimated at &euro;150 million, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30 million to the company in December 2017 to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a five-day-per-week mail delivery service, the cost of each amounting to &euro;15 million.  An Post continues to undergo vital transformation as part of the delivery of its strategic plan which has seen the company split into two distinct business units, An Post mails and parcels and An Post retail.  An Post will continue to transform its retail network by delivering new products and new formats, which includes diversifying and growing the range of financial services products it provides to individuals and SMEs to include loans and so on.  The investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network aims to get communities to use the enhanced services in their local post offices.</p></speech>

I also understand that earlier this year more than 72,000 people volunteered for the HSE's On Call For Ireland initiative.  Has any thought been given to tapping into this great pool of talent, which has been completely underutilised, in order to fill contact tracing roles?  If no thought has been given to it, will the Taoiseach and his Government consider it?</p></speech>

The HSE has already commenced a recruitment campaign for 700 swabbers and 500 contact tracers as part of its plans to expand and increase permanent capacity within the testing and tracing system.  The call initiative which the Deputy referenced yielded some results but perhaps not what had originally been expected.  Of those who came forward, not all were suitable for particular positions in clinical settings or in the wider health service.  I have no doubt that the HSE will use every means at its disposal to get the requisite number of people into our testing and tracing system because the plan for living with Covid we have outlined will require more than 3,000 people working between all stages of our testing and tracing system.</p></speech>

This person runs a good premises and works hard.  There was a customer on the premises last week who this week phoned to say that he had tested positive.  The owners of the business are diligent people and went into self-isolation and closed down the business.  They have contacted the HSE and have also gone to their GP, who could not get a test for them.  They were told to wait for contact from the HSE.  They contacted the HSE only to be told that they would have to wait and that they should close their business and keep their children home from school.  The system is clearly all over the place.  They have now been told by the HSE that contact tracing operates within a 48-hour window but they are clearly outside of that.  It is totally unfair to force such a business to close.  These people cannot get tested, cannot get information and cannot get anything else.  This is happening across the country.  People such as those Deputy Berry spoke about are offering help but the Government will not take it.  The people have totally lost confidence in the system.  These people own a small business and want to live, to pay rates and taxes and to run their business.  This is totally unfair.  It is disgraceful that they have not been contacted by the HSE.  They have been left in limbo and are keeping their kids home from school.  They cannot afford this.  The contact tracing system is clearly not working.  It is a sham and it is shambolic.

It is good to see the doors open and a bit of life in rural villages such as Gneeveguilla, Brosna, Sneem and Fieries which were totally desolated and dead for six months.  I am getting very worried, however, because the first question people are asked when contacted by the contact tracers is whether they have been in a pub or restaurant in the past two weeks.</p> <p>Surely there are other questions and other places they should be asking about as well.  I wonder whether the same attention is being given to people who travel abroad and come back.  We recognise their right and need to do that.  Is there the same follow-up on quarantine when they come back from countries that are not on the green list?  Why is all the focus directed on the pubs again?  Is the Government going to close them again?</p></speech>

Different sporting organisations are interpreting the guidelines differently.  We have a situation now where players can play one day for Clanna Gael Fontenoy in Ringsend but the same players cannot play for St. Patrick's CYFC in Ringsend in the eastern women's football league the next day.  Clubs in Naas and Clontarf can play rugby but St. Patrick's CYFC cannot play soccer.  All sports clubs, including soccer, rugby, GAA and hockey, should be opened or closed on the same basis.  Can the Taoiseach give consistency in messaging and clear guidelines to sports organisations?  Some clubs are being treated unfairly and it is bonkers for the clubs.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach is aware, I raised this issue at the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting recently.  These workers have been picketing for in excess of 170 days during cold nights and mornings that are getting cooler and wetter.  These are predominantly or almost exclusively women.  I know they have the Taoiseach's admiration and my admiration.  Does the Taoiseach share my concern over the manipulation of these vulnerable workers with Private Members' motions in this House that are portrayed as potential laws establishing funds for workers who might be laid off unjustly?  Such motions would penalise good employers and have absolutely no benefit for Debenhams workers.  The implementation of the Duffy Cahill report, aspects of which I strongly support, would not be retrospective and would not benefit Debenhams workers.  This amounts to the manipulation and misleading of these workers.</p></speech>

I accept the extraordinary challenges that are facing the Debenhams workers and the fact that they have been campaigning and on strike for so long in the pursuit of the realisation of their collective agreement.  The T&aacute;naiste and others have been seeking to see what we can do with the trade unions to try to assist in some alleviation of the situation for the workers concerned.</p>  <p>  I take the overall point made by Deputy Lahart.  I have been consistent in all my meetings with workers that we have to work within frameworks and law.  We cannot pretend that we can do things that cannot be done.  Motions in themselves do not change the de facto reality.  Over time, there is need for change of legislation in terms of Duffy Cahill and other aspects of company law that may facilitate companies avoiding their obligations.  There is also a need for collective agreements to have parity with others in terms of liquidation processes.  That is important as well.  We should never create situations which can give people an impression that a motion, if passed, solves all their problems.  Of course it does not.  It is far more challenging and complex than that.</p></speech>

It promises to support staff retention and to develop career paths for childcare staff.  Our early childcare educators are skilled and dedicated workers.  However, this is not reflected in their pay scales.  The majority are surviving on minimum wages.  They need the extension and reinstatement of the childcare education payment to 100%.  They need the continuation of the employment wage subsidy scheme at the higher rate.  They need to be treated as an essential service with prioritised Covid-19 testing.  Is the Government going to look after the early childcare educators and fulfil its promises now?  Urgency is needed to help this vital sector, without which our economy would not survive.</p></speech>

There is no doubt the early childcare providers have challenges in the context of Covid-19, especially in the recruitment of staffing and staffing difficulties.  The Government has given, and continues to give, significant financial support to providers through the wage subsidy scheme to assist in recruiting and retaining staff.  I know that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been engaging actively with sectoral organisations to gather data and examine proposals to alleviate any immediate pressures.  The Department will continue to work with the sector to support it in providing vital services to children and families throughout the country.</p></speech>

They have applied to the HSE and have been told that they will not get the certificate pending a court case.  The court case is not due before the courts until July 2021.  These are some of the most vulnerable people.  Some of them have no use of arms or legs and cannot get from A to B.  Will the Taoiseach put a temporary scheme in place for these people until the court case is sorted to allow them to purchase vehicles?  It should apply whether they are driving or passengers.

It is quite radical and transformative and I hope the Deputy will support all aspects of it.  Her party opposed the cross-party approach to climate change in the previous Oireachtas and tends to take an<i>&agrave; la carte</i>approach to climate change when it suits.  We take the Supreme Court judgment on board.  The new climate change Bill will be quite comprehensive and set strong targets.  Crucially, there will be an independent oversight approach in terms of the council that will be established as a result of the Bill passing in the Oireachtas.

While we welcome the Law Reform Commission report, which is very beneficial, we are all waiting on the Judicial Council review.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform has stated there may be a need for a plan B, which is possibly legislating to deal with cases if the Judiciary does not step up to the mark.  This is about the significant pay-outs while there is the continuing travesty of dual pricing.  In my constituency, a community centre was charged &euro;6,000 last year and insurance companies would not quote it for public liability insurance this year.  The centre was then quoted &euro;3,000 on the promise that the proposals from the Government would be enacted, combined with a proposal for the establishment of an the Irish leisure industry standards association, ILISA, that I made to the Government and that would require Government supports.

The leaving certificate was postponed, the calculated grades system replaced it, the results date was postponed, and now it has been reported that for 10% of all students, there is an error in their calculated grades.  Does the Taoiseach not think this deserves more of a reaction from the Government?  Does he think it is acceptable that a party spokesperson on education, such as I, was not given any briefing or an indication of any briefing today from the Department about the upcoming statement from the Minister for Education and Skills?  Does the Taoiseach not feel that it would be appropriate for the Minister to come to the House immediately to speak about this issue, which is yet another upsetting turn of events for those in the leaving certificate class of 2020?</p></speech>

The news this afternoon is absolutely extraordinary.  I am astounded, but the ones who will be even more astounded are the many students who worked extremely hard and had their grades downgraded.  For them, there are countless questions.  One of the main ones is whether those whose grades were downgraded by standardisation can now be revised upwards.  Will they then be potentially able to access third level or will that be deferred to next year?  There are so many questions.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated the Minister was going to make a statement at 4 p.m.  That is not good enough.  She needs to come in here.  There are countless questions we need answers to and we need them now.  The Minister needs to come here this afternoon.

These are the same students whose parents paid for student accommodation on Friday afternoon, only to discover on Friday night that the accommodation might not be required because the universities and colleges they are going to might not be operating in that way for the next number of weeks or months and perhaps until Christmas.  For the Government to have let this happen is absolutely disgraceful.  The two Deputies have outlined that issue.  What further compounds it for these parents, who worked so hard to put together the money to pay for accommodation that might not now be needed, is that we all know how much of an impossibility it could prove to get that money back.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000022#U03400"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend Part X (Admission to Schools) of the Education Act 1998 insofar as it relates to taking into account a student's connection to a school by virtue of a family member having previously attended the school when deciding on an application for admission to that school, and to provide for connected matters. </blockquote>  <p>It feels strange to speak on an education Bill, considering what we just heard from An Taoiseach, but we will return to that in due course.  The Bill will remove a clause in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, which was introduced by the previous Government, that has an element of elitism in it.  Many elements of that Act are progressive and were supported by the Labour Party, not least the parts relating to the baptism barrier or to the powers granted to the Minister for Education and Skills to open special educational units within schools to facilitate children with special educational needs.</p><p>Within the Act, however, as a deliberate result, I understand, of lobbying by a particular sector within education, there is provision for any school to allow 25% of its intake to be reserved for the children or grandchildren of past pupils.  One can only imagine the type of school that would lobby for that type of provision to be placed into legislation.  It was passed with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il in the previous Oireachtas.  I tabled an amendment to the Bill at the time but it was voted down.  The Bill before us will remove that elitist element of that Act.  What if somebody's father or grandfather did not go to second level, or his or her mother or grandmother, or what if somebody is not from the area and, therefore, did not attend a second level school nearby?  What happens if a person is not from this country?  This is a deliberate attempt to keep the royal bloodline of succession through particular elitist second level schools and it was done at the behest of those elitist second level schools.</p> <p>Government was lobbied and it bent the knee.  The Government has allowed in legislation for 25% of a student intake to be reserved, not just for the children of past pupils, but for the grandchildren of past pupils as well.  It is wrong and odious and it flies in the face of any sort of progressive protestations Government would have in the education space and it allows for schools to pick and choose who they would rather have in the door, depending on whether the children or grandchildren of past pupils are the ones who present themselves.</p> <p> This Labour Party Bill seeks to eliminate that provision within the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 and to ensure that when students or families present themselves to a second level school or to any school in this country, they can do so on the same basis.  It should not matter, therefore, who one's father, grandfather, mother or grandmother was because in a republic we are supposed to cherish all of the children of the nation equally and we fundamentally understand that education is the great liberator.  We cannot have a situation of liberating children and having republican legislation when a quarter of an intake of any particular school can be reserved, if the school so wishes, for the children and grandchildren of past pupils.</p> <p> We will be seeking support from across this House for our Bill.  We got support from progressive voices for our Bill when it was presented in the last Oireachtas and we expect to get similar support this time.  We hope we can work collaboratively and progressively with the Government and that it will acknowledge that this was an error within the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, that it has been proven to be elitist and that it should be amended and removed.</p></speech>

As committed to in the programme for Government, work is under way to develop a national economic plan, which will follow after the budget with a focus on the priorities and objectives for Ireland's economic recovery.</p>  <p>  We are living through a time of high levels of economic uncertainty in terms of the pathway of Covid-19 and the final impact of Brexit.  Given this, the plan will set a framework of our priorities and policy objectives for sustainable recovery, while signalling pathways and further work streams over the years towards these medium-term goals.  Work on the plan is being overseen by the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  It will set out our approach to an inclusive and balanced recovery, building resilience across our enterprise and sectors and future-proofing our economy and society.  Transitioning to a sustainable and low carbon economy will be at the heart of the plan.</p>  <p>  The work is also an important opportunity to progress programme for Government commitments, including the development of well-being indices to aid a well-rounded view on how the economy and society are faring.  I expect that there will be consultation and engagement with stakeholders and experts as we implement this and other commitments in the programme for Government over the period ahead.</p></reply>

I know this news will be deeply concerning to students across the land and it seems quite something that errors of this magnitude have occurred but I would like to know when the Government first discovered them.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach confirm which Departments and organisations have been consulted as part of this high level review and who within the Department of the Taoiseach is heading up this important work?  It is clear that the consultative aspect of the review's work is important because whole sections of the domestic economy will face unique challenges in the months and years ahead.  As the Taoiseach knows, uncertainty is not the friend of any business.  There are sectors within the domestic economy that are blocked from trading because of public health restrictions and the acting Chief Medical Officer has warned of ongoing restraints for the next six to nine months.</p>  <p>  Government is assuming a certain level of resilience for micro and small businesses in the next 12 months that does not reflect the reality for many of them.  These local businesses employ over 1 million people.  Hospitality and local pubs are the typical employers on which many communities rely for employment.  These are not just places of social interaction, they are vital employers and stimuli for local economies.  Taxi drivers are another sector of workers who are at the end of their tether.  Many do not have the financial reserves necessary to manage the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET&rsquo;s, projected uncertainty despite their viability in normal times.  What voice do these businesses have at the Government's high level review of the economy?</p>  <p>  I also want to note the legitimate and real frustrations and concerns of the commercial events sector.  I met with representatives of the event production industry Covid, EPIC, working group last week.  It estimates that the commercial events sector accounts for 90% of the 5 million event tickets sold in Ireland each year and it directly contributes over &euro;3.5 billion to the national economy.  It is an industry that is ready to go but this readiness will not last forever.  Will the Taoiseach give a concrete commitment to include EPIC in the consultative process of the high level review?</p>  <p>  I noted that the Government dealt with the matter of ticket touting at Cabinet yesterday after a long time of those of us on this side of the House advocating and producing legislation on that matter.  I could not but be struck by the irony that the Government was dealing with matters of ticket touting, as real as those concerns are, at a time when there are no gigs, concerts or matches.</p> <p>I invite the Taoiseach to turn his attention to and engage with EPIC members and the industry as these people are finding it very difficult.  There is a real danger that this very lucrative and important part of our economy will be permanently damaged unless the Government intervenes directly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000024#W00200"><p>Despite all the talk of us all being in this together, I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government is progressively abandoning many of the workers and sectors that have been most harshly hit by the public health measures it has put in place.</p>  <p>  By definition, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is given to people who have lost employment because of measures the Government has taken.  They have done nothing wrong but they are being victimised with across the board cuts to their income.  In the same week, the halt on mortgage repayments that could be used by those people is being lifted and they can now face further harassment from the banks at a time when their employment position may be deteriorating because of renewed restrictions.</p>  <p>  Despite repeated calls that I have made for months on behalf of taxi drivers to respond to their requests for assistance, their industry has been absolutely decimated and is being decimated again.  They are going to be taking to their cars for a protest on 9 October out of desperation because of their situation but we have had no commitments or assurances.  The arts, music and entertainment sector is worth &euro;3.5 billion, with 35,000 people whose livelihood had been decimated, and there is no clear commitment or assurance of financial supports to sustain them through this period.  The Debenhams workers, whose employer used Covid-19 as a cynical excuse to execute a tactical liquidation, have now been on the picket lines for more than 170 days and the Government has completely abandoned them.  It is absolutely outrageous.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government must support all these people.  Money is being given out hand over fist to sections of big business in this country which have not lost anything close to the amount of income that these sectors have lost.  The Government has no problem giving the money to them.  People involved in arts and music, the taxi drivers and the Debenhams workers have meanwhile been just abandoned.  I ask the Taoiseach - and, more important, these people ask him - to do something for them.  They are in trouble through no fault of their own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000024#W00300"><p>First, we have not been giving money hand over fist to big business.  The funding has been directed through wage subsidy schemes and more than &euro;3.5 billion has been paid through the PUP alone.  There are 350,000 workers whose jobs are underpinned by the wage subsidy scheme.  By any standard that is an extraordinary intervention as the Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary event.</p>  <p>  This has been necessary because Covid-19 has had an impact on the very sectors mentioned by the Deputy.  Covid-19 has made congregation almost impossible.  Supporters cannot turn up to matches in the numbers we are used to and the hospitality sector is facing very challenging circumstances.  It is not the Government that is the cause of this but Covid-19.  The Government has to respond and it has done so with a suite of measures right across the board, including restart grants and human capital initiatives involving more than 200,000 placements, apprenticeships and different schemes through Skillnet Ireland and so on.  That is a &euro;200 million initiative.</p>  <p>  Likewise we have seen restart grants and loan facilities being made available.  The general feedback, understandably, is that small and medium enterprises do not want to pile debt upon debt.  The multinational sector, which the Deputy consistently rails against, is not getting huge support but is doing well, particularly with life sciences.  That is helping to underpin the economy as - guess what - many Irish-owned small and medium enterprises depend on multinationals.  The multinationals employ approximately 250,000 people but for every job they provide, they also create employment in the SME sector.  There are 450,000 jobs in that sphere, all told.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentions the self-employed and taxi drivers, and there is a range of others.  I accept the point on EPIC and we will engage with the group and representatives of the events industry.  Again, the industry has been very badly affected by Covid-19 as the excellent type of economic activity in the sector cannot easily be carried out when the virus is an issue.  In the forthcoming budget we will continue to look at ways in which we can assist sectors over and above what we have done already.</p>  <p>  We recognise and acknowledge the impact of Covid-19 on those sectors specifically and we have been consistent about that.  Severe restrictions have been introduced in Dublin and prior to that they were introduced to Laois, Offaly and Kildare, and we brought in additional measures to help those areas.  We will again look at measures that may be introduced to help those specific sectors.</p>  <p>  The Deputy argues that we are abandoning jobseekers and there are challenges in social protection.  There are 213,000 people on the jobseeker's allowance.  There is the issue with carers and there is a motion before the House on child poverty.  We must take measures and prioritise those areas outside of the extraordinary interventions we have made with the economy and employment.  That must be acknowledged and some budgetary action will be required for measures designed to help people who are really feeling the brunt of the economic downturn arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  We are specifically looking to see if we can help particular sectors because there is no rates valuation or because people have not been in a position to avail of existing schemes.  We are looking to see if we can create bespoke approaches and schemes to help them.  That is being looked at in the budget context to see if we can help people with social protection in such cases.  We will continue to do that.</p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald mentioned the leaving certificate calculated grades.  My understanding is the Department would have been alerted to this by the company, Polymetrika International Inc, which initially discovered the error in the code.  The company informed the Department about it and it has since corrected that piece of code.  It is now operating as intended.  The Department of Education and Skills found a second error while performing checks related to rectifying the first error and the Department is very anxious that it would get all the issues resolved and that it would understand fully what was involved before going public to ensure it can be comprehensive in its presentation to students and all involved.</p>  <p>  All students registered with the calculated grades student portal will receive communication from the Department.  The Minister will make a more comprehensive statement on this later today.  It is important that this is comprehensive and communicates directly to the students.</p></speech>

I do not have the specific date.  That was when it was initially alerted and then the Department had to find out what was involved and the details.</p>  <p>  The economic plan is the subject matter of this question.  We want to think about where the economy and society will go after Covid-19.  Today's Economic and Social Research Institute report mentions a potentially better balance in housing supply and economic activity in the regions, as well as investment in broadband, the climate change agenda and retrofitting and energy efficiency measures.  There is also a digitalisation agenda, which is particularly important given the lessons we have learned about Covid-19 and the capacity to bring more jobs to regions and rural Ireland in particular.</p>  <p>  The economic plan will follow the budget.</p> <p>That will provide a medium-term framework for where we heading socially and economically post Covid-19, and where we should invest more to accelerate new areas of economic development.  One key area will be construction.</p></speech>

The committee was established by the Government to review the activity of Cabinet committees, review the agenda for each week's Government meeting, discuss political priorities, and review the implementation of a specified element of the programme for Government.  I am a member of the committee, as are the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, my chief of staff and the chiefs of staff of the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of the Green Party also sit in on meetings.  The committee has held six meetings to date.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach's Cabinet co-ordination committee is not doing a very good job when it comes to education.  It is very difficult.  The few Members who are left in this House can attest that their phones are hopping because of the 6,000 students affected by this absolute cock-up.  It is extraordinary.  This would bring down any other Government at any other time.  The parents of one young lady named Aeva May were on the phone to me.  She is resitting her leaving certificate because she missed out on what she really wanted to do very narrowly.  Can the Taoiseach imagine the heartache, the absolute torture, that she and other students have gone through and are going through?  What about all the parents who have paid for accommodation, or the students who are sitting at home working on college courses and wondering if they will stay in those courses?  They will not know until later on today, and perhaps not even then.  The 6,000 students who have been affected could be in different courses next week or the week after.  This has never happened before.  It is extraordinary.  These students have gone through absolute hell and this is the cherry on top.</p>  <p>  I do not know what we are going to do, but whatever is announced this evening had better be an extraordinary response.  We cannot penalise students who have already been offered places.  Some students who are repeating their leaving certificates may in fact be going to college.  Parents are paying for accommodation which they may never need or use because their children could go to other third level institutions.  Some people who have been enrolled in courses with restricted numbers may find they are no longer in those courses based on their results.  The ramifications this will have throughout the country are humongous.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said earlier that the outside company noticed a coding problem.  The Government found out about this last week.  Then there was a second error.  Unless she has changed her mind, the Minister for Education and Skills will not be before the House this evening, although I encourage the Taoiseach to arrange it, even if her appearance is late in the evening, so she will not be able to tell us, so will the Taoiseach tell us if the second error was connected to the first or an altogether separate error?  How many errors were there?  Were there just two?  Was the second error a magnification of the first or completely separate?  Are there students who are impacted by both errors or a single error?  How in the name of God did this happen?  How did the Department not see this problem?  Was it because this aspect was outsourced to this company and there were no checks on it?  Will the Taoiseach tell us more about the second company the Government is bringing in to audit and check this?  I agree with doing that, because the Department is obviously not capable of doing it itself.</p>  <p>  This impacts on every single family network in the country.  Since the Minister will not come before the House today, will the Taoiseach answer these questions for the people watching?</p></speech>

It is quite unconscionable that they are going to suffer yet again as a consequence of a gigantic and inexplicable cock-up.  After all they have gone through and suffered, we now have this situation of uncertainty which could have very severe implications for those already in third level courses, those who may have missed out, and those who got the wrong grades.  It is truly extraordinary.  The Minister must come into this House today to make a statement explaining what the hell went on and what she will do to rectify it.</p>  <p>  The fact that outsourcing may have played a role in this is very telling.  That speaks to the general lack of investment in education, which is at one of the lowest levels anywhere in the western world.  These are the sorts of consequences that inevitably flow in difficult situations from a lack of investment in education.  The class of 2020 are going to suffer as a consequence.  We need explanations and we need to know what the Government is going to do to rectify the situation in which thousands of leaving certificate students now find themselves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000025#X00800"><p>This really is the icing on the cake, the final cock-up for the class of 2020.  It will have ramifications not just for that class, but for secondary school students in fifth and sixth year who were already anxious and went back to school at the height of a pandemic.  They look to the State and the people in charge for some reassurance that they have some idea what they are doing, and here we find ourselves now.  I am very concerned by the fact that the Taoiseach had this information last week and clearly it was kept from the Opposition.  The Minister for Education and Skills did not brief anyone or indicate that there was a difficulty.  Last week students were hoping to start their university and third level courses.  Now all of this has been thrown into disarray for a second time.  They were told at the last minute that they could not be on campus, that their teaching would be online and so on.  Now we have this.  To say this is a mess is very much an understatement.  There are two parts to it: the fact that errors were made and the fact that they were discovered last week and the Government kept them to itself.  None of this builds confidence.  All of this causes further anxiety for students and families who have already been through the mill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000025#X00900"><p>This is very worrying and upsetting for the students concerned.  Of that there is no doubt.  Covid-19 has had an extraordinarily negative impact on their educational year.  In the first instance it resulted in the cancellation of the normal physical leaving certificate exam as we knew it.</p> <p>In May, it was decided to proceed with a calculated grades process which in itself was a unique approach to dealing with the leaving certificate results and, critically, students' progression to further courses, particularly at third level.  It was an enormous logistical exercise.  Outside expertise was brought in in terms of the coding and all of that.  It was examined internally by the Department and through a parallel process.</p> <p> The key error appears to have been in the coding and has given rise to this issue primarily.  Given the questions that have been asked, the Minister, Deputy Foley, will make a comprehensive presentation.  That is why, when the Department first became aware of this, it was important to ascertain comprehensively what is involved so that when a public statement is made, as many questions as possible can be answered to reassure students, do the very best for them in terms of their situation and ensure mechanisms and portals are in place to enable individual students to access new grades as a result of results being upgraded.  The nuts and bolts of the rectification of this and the presenting of this to students were uppermost in the priorities of the Minister and the Department, which is correct.  When an error of this kind is discovered, it is important that its full implications are ascertained.  In addition, the external independent audit was introduced.  A separate company from the United States has been brought in to go through the entire system again.  That has to be done.</p></speech>

There is a set timeframe which the Minister will reveal.  It is very, very regrettable.  Believe me, it is not something about which I or anybody wanted to hear, least of all the students themselves.  I know it will cause additional alarm and worry.  The objective now is to reassure students in terms of the places they already have and, if necessary, in terms of creating additional places for students who may now qualify for third level courses.  All of that has to be still worked out in terms of the CAO and the availability of places on various courses.  I know the Minister is particularly sorry for students that this has occurred.  The system was introduced to replace the physical leaving certificate.  External expertise was brought in.  I understand the code was developed externally and it was the first error identified by the external consultant, Polymetrika International Inc.  The second error was discovered by the Department as it was going through the matter.</p></speech>

The results data are now being rerun through the corrected model.  The Minister will give a more comprehensive statement this afternoon regarding all of the issues the Deputies have raised.  There is no point coming in with piecemeal, drip-feed details on this.  A strong and comprehensive response is required to what is a very regrettable error that no one is happy about.  I am not at all happy it happened.  We are in a unique situation as a result of Covid-19 and its impact.</p></speech>

Ministers can also update the Government as necessary on security-related issues that arise in their areas of responsibility.  In addition, the national security committee is concerned with ensuring the Government is advised of high level security issues and the responses to them.  It is chaired by the Secretary-General to the Government and comprises representatives at the highest level from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice and Equality, Defence and Environment, Climate and Communications as well as representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  Representatives of other Departments also attend when necessary.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Defence Forces, depending on the issue in question, be it progressing reform measures, EU related defence issues or international peace-keeping missions, the issue may be discussed at a meeting of the most appropriate Cabinet committee or at bilateral meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence.</p></reply>

What would have happened is the spokespersons would have heard about it at 4 o'clock.  The Government should at least have had the courtesy to bring in all of the spokespeople here and to meet with them at lunchtime to explain.  It would have been the right thing to do.  They have all worked incredibly hard.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has done a significant amount of work to support the Government through this and to make suggestions.  That is the least the Government should have done.  If I had not asked the question, we would not be dealing with it.  The Government must ensure that students who have been offered places are not demoted.  That must not happen.</p></speech>

We must find additional places in very tight situations in that scenario.  I will get to the matter raised in Questions Nos. 6 and 7.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence.  It has been an unusual day.  The work to be carried out by the external company that is now coming in must not go on for too long because if it does, we could have another issue.  That must not happen.  I want to know the detail of the second error because it is a direct error by the Department.  It does not matter if something is outsourced; an error is an error.  This has been one of the worst days I have ever spent in this House.  It is appalling for the students.</p>  <p>  On the issue raised in Questions Nos. 6 and 7, the previous Government had a special Cabinet committee on defence and security matters but the current Government does not.  Why not?  Pay, allowances, recruitment, retention and career progression are among the six proposed issues listed to be dealt with in the context of the commission on the Defence Forces which is included in the programme for Government.  Through which Cabinet subcommittee will that commitment be met?  It was reported in August that personnel were leaving the Naval Service to join the Army because its allowances and conditions are better.  This has to be dealt with.  Does the Government intend to bring in emergency pay measures to address the problems that have been outlined?  Will there be progress on these matters in the budget?  Core pay is a significant issue in terms of retaining personnel.  When will we see the terms of reference of the commission?  Under what Cabinet committee is it being dealt with?</p>  <p>  My colleague, Senator Wall, who is very passionate on defence issues, has raised the issue of honouring the soldiers involved in the siege of Jadotville.  As the Taoiseach is aware, a campaign has been waged for a number of years to acknowledge and honour those soldiers for their amazing actions in the siege in 1961.  Is that being considered by the Government?  Will the Taoiseach make a statement on the matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000026#Y02200"><p>Two errors have been discovered in the calculated grading system.</p> <p>Are we satisfied that there are no other errors?  Is there a possibility that this new expertise and review might, in fact, turn up other problems or errors?</p> <p> The Taoiseach said the objective of keeping the information to themselves was to prioritise contact with students.  What has been the nature of that contact?  There has been none.  The Taoiseach said they were putting students first.  I believe the Department is establishing a helpline today.  Is that happening today?  The Taoiseach might clarify that for us.  We need at least some sense now that the information is in the public domain that it is two errors and no more.  The Taoiseach needs to give that assurance to people today.</p> <p> The pay, conditions and accommodation of the serving Defence Forces is, as the Taoiseach will be aware, a long-running issue.  Wives and partners of members of the Defence Forces have been put in the terrible position of having to campaign for fair pay and treatment for their families.  Last year, the executive council of congress agreed in principle the application by Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, for affiliation as an associate member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and that further discussions were necessary to bring the matter to a conclusion.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, stated in the D&aacute;il that he was giving the ICTU affiliation careful consideration taking into account all the concerns, specifically those of military management and the Chief of Staff who had written to him.  Has there been any progress on these matters within Government?</p> <p> The Taoiseach will also be aware of the criticism of the previous Government to adequately progress the high-level implementation plan.  What focus has the Cabinet committee given to the implementation plan and what approach will it take to expedite its delivery?  Specifically, what is the committee's view of what the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers described as the unsustainably high level of staff turnover, which last year reached 10.5%.  In July, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, warned that despite Government commitments to boost numbers, they have fallen to an all-time low of 8,485 personnel.  RACO attributed the fall in numbers to poor conditions of service, low rates of pay and outstanding pay issues.  Accommodation is also a significant concern.  I have seen at first hand these dire conditions.  What focus is the committee giving to all these critical issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000027#Z00200"><p>As I said, there is no security committee of Cabinet in the first instance.  The main focus of the questions as they evolved is around pay, recruitment and retention.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Defence are engaged in terms of what measures can be taken, in particular to assist the Naval Service in its situation without creating issues for the wider public service pay agreement and pay framework.  There are certain aspects that both Ministers and both Departments have been engaged in to facilitate some assistance for those who work in the Naval Service because, as has been articulated and as I myself have articulated, the overall strength of the Defence Forces is at 8,374.  It was 8,724 in July last when the pay commission recommendations were accepted.</p>  <p>  There are issues of both retention in, and recruitment to, the Defence Forces.  The strength levels are continually impacted, even by the Covid-19 emergency.  Covid-19 has resulted, for example, in the postponement of the majority of general service inductions that were planned to take place in the first half of the year.  The planned induction was in the order of 310 personnel for the first half of 2020.  The 2020 recruitment efforts have resulted in a total of 9,281 applications being received across 13 recruitment competitions.  That issue of retention and recruitment of members to the Defence Forces continues to receive priority by Government.</p>  <p>  The officer strength of 1,200, as of 31 August, represents 99% of the agreed establishment strength of 1,233.  Certain officer ranks are under subscribed.  Captains and others, such as lieutenants, are over subscribed.  That will balance out over time.</p>  <p>  A campaign to re-enlist and recommission former Permanent Defence Force, PDF, personnel has also yielded significant interest, with 736 applicants received.  Ten personnel were re-enlisted as of 11 September.  Three officers were recommissioned.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the commission will be a further initiative designed to improve the situation overall in terms of the retention and recruitment of personnel to the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps.</p>  <p>  Progress has been made on the implementation plan and the recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission.  There is the review of technical pay.  They are the issues that are currently under consideration.  Both Ministers are at an advanced stage in terms of the outcome of that technical review.</p>  <p>  A report on incentivised long-service arrangements for certain officer and NCO ranks was completed and will be used to inform future pay negotiations.  A final report on bespoke management training for leaders and managers was signed off by the project sponsors on 13 July.</p>  <p>  There will be further initiatives undertaken.  In terms of the commission on which the Minister will be bringing proposals to Government, that will create a further opportunity to look fundamentally at the Defence Forces and how can we ensure  they are fit for purpose in terms of strength and capacity to retain over a sustained period of time personnel who enlist in them.</p>  <p>  In terms of the union issue and ICTU, that is under ongoing consideration.  There are issues to be fully thought through in terms of the long-term implications and the need to make sure that we are not in any way prevented from doing things for the Defence Forces that we need to do.  The Defence Forces are key to underpinning our State, our society and our democracy.  I worry that the numbers have been consistently below establishment for quite a number of years.  That is something we need to redress and change for the future, and more permanently.</p>  <p>  In terms of the issues that were raised in the context of the leaving certificate examination, I indicated already that the Department said that there were no further errors following its examination.  Of course, the issues are ones that will be addressed comprehensively by the Minister later.</p>  <p>  It needed to be dealt with in a comprehensive manner.  Much of the work over the past number of days has been done by the Department officials going through what the implications of all of this are.  That is necessary.  We need to make sure that when this is announced, there are mechanisms in place to alleviate the anxiety students will undoubtedly have.  There is no point going off half-cocked on an issue of this importance.  For students and for people generally, it is important that the presentation by the Department and by the Minister is as comprehensive as it possibly can be at this juncture.</p>  <p>  On the external group that has been brought in, its work needs to be conducted in a timely manner as well, subject to capacity, etc.  My understanding is it will be done in a time-limited way so that it will not go on for any prolonged period of time.</p>  <p>  As I said, the Minister is making a comprehensive statement today.  I do not want to second guess any of that but that is the intention.</p></speech>

I am making it clear that depends on the company, as it looks at it.  I do not want to pre-empt its work but, obviously, it has to be done in a timely way.  The point is that students will have to be given assurances in terms of places they already have.</p> <p>A lot of work will have to be done with the third level colleges, the universities and the CAO system to assist students in every possible way in order that they are not in any way disadvantaged as a result of the discovery of these errors.  Prior to this, significant efforts were made to increase the number of places at third level to help students in an extraordinary year for them because of Covid-19, which resulted in the cancellation of the physical exams and the introduction of the calculated grade system.  As it has been worked through, errors have been discovered which creates further anxiety for the students.  That is deeply regretted.  The most important response is to ensure we do everything we possibly can to allay any concerns students have and assist them in their progression into third level and education more generally.</p></speech>

It is not that I expect him to be here to answer me but it would be preferable, given the importance of the issue.  We need to resolve this matter.  Many families were given a break on loans and mortgages.  The Government figures are around 89,000.  There is a now a roadmap for the pandemic which will be at least six months.  We are all meant to be in it together yet the banks have refused to continue mortgage and loan breaks.  The Government does not have a great deal of credibility when it comes to its relationship with the financial sector, especially this week.  What will the Government do about this?  It is not a regular player, it is a major shareholder in the banks.  We need solutions for people because families are crying out for them.</p></speech>

They have not repaid society for that bailout in any substantial way.  In fact, they have persecuted many mortgage holders who were in arrears and dispossessed many from their homes.  We cannot have a repeat of that.  The mortgage break ending opens up the prospect of that happening again.  I heard Government spokespeople on the radio earlier saying that the banks would deal with people individually and take their personal circumstances into account.  We have heard that nonsense before.  What actually happens is that people suffer extreme anxiety and hardship and are pursued.  That cannot happen in a context where the people are in financial difficulty because they have complied with public health measures directed by the Government.  The Government must step in and provide that protection and ensure that those breaks for those who cannot manage to meet their mortgage and loan repayments are not persecuted and further punished.</p></speech>

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State.  We bailed out the banks and my children and grandchildren and everyone else's will still be paying them back, yet they have given two fingers to more than 80,000 people and families who had got a break, first for three months and then six.  Let us just take one industry - music and entertainment - that provided so much solace and does so much for our mental health and well-being. The Taoiseach and others tell us we are all in this together but they and other small business people have been thrown overboard.  They expected some bit of solace from the banks.</p>  <p>  There is no legislation to deal with the banks and the Government has refused to introduce any, although many other EU states have brought in legislation to make the banks do so.  We need legislation to force the banks on this.  The Minister did not meet them until last Monday, three days before the freeze was due to run out.  It was only a token meeting.  The Minister has not dealt and is not dealing with the banks, and the banks have no interest in dealing with people sensitively one by one.  They brought people through the courts throughout the pandemic.  There were cases in the High Court taken by vulture funds and so on.  The Government enabled the vulture funds by law to use hearsay.  It is time the Government introduced legislation to put manners on the banks.</p></speech>

The latest figures from the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, indicates that around 89,000 payment breaks were granted to mortgage customers, and breaks were also put in place for 32,000 SMEs and 4,000 corporate borrowers.</p>  <p>  It is to be welcomed that some of the borrowers who had a payment break have now been able to resume loan repayments.  Central Bank and BPFI data indicate that over 90% of borrowers that have finished a payment break have returned to full repayments on the existing terms.  However, it is important that lenders continue to liaise and work with borrowers who are in a position to resume loan repayments and that flexible repayment arrangements are provided as necessary.  In that regard, the BPFI has indicated that the broad repayment options for borrowers who can recommence loan repayments following a Covid-19 payment break are either to return to repayments over the existing term of the mortgage or loan or to extend the term of the loan to allow the borrower to spread the repayments over a longer period of time.  These flexible repayment arrangements are important as they will facilitate and help many borrowers meet their loan commitments at the end of a Covid-19 payment break, but lenders should also fully explain the nature of the new repayment and outline the implications, in terms of cost and any other relevant factors.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is very conscious that many other borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19 and are not yet in a position to meet their loan commitments.  He is fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are still facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders and from Government.  For its part, the Government, is continuing to provide significant income support to people who cannot get back to work, while grants, credit facilities and other supports are also available to businesses which continue to be affected by the restrictions which are still necessary to control the pandemic.  Banks and lenders also need to continue to support and work with their customers and borrowers who are still impacted by Covid-19.</p> <p>As the House will be aware, the T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance met the CEOs of the retail banks and Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland yesterday, where that point was clearly and strongly made to them.  In fairness, it was accepted by the lenders, as Deputy Mattie McGrath has acknowledged.  At the meeting, the banks outlined their plans for their customers who will be coming off payment breaks and they indicated that this engagement was a priority for them.  They also indicated that they would have approximately 2,500 staff actively working on this matter, they would seek to work with and understand the individual situation of every borrower, and they wished to put in place individual solutions for borrowers if and when required.  They stressed that their focus was on engagement, assessment and solutions for those who are still impacted by the pandemic.</p> <p> The recent change in the European Banking Authority, EBA, guidelines for Covid-19 payment breaks, which the Minister for Finance wishes to emphasise refers only to the closing date for an application for a Covid-19 payment break, does not restrict or hinder lenders from agreeing appropriate further support arrangements for borrowers on a case-by-case basis.  Indeed, the EBA has made it clear that such continued Covid-19 supports can include further breaks on loan repayments.  However, other options will be available to borrowers at the end of a Covid-19 payment break and may well be better overall for them.  The best individual arrangement can only be found where there is a meaningful engagement by both the lender and the borrower.  The Government is conscious that this applies to the lender in particular.</p> <p> It is important that lenders live up to the commitments that they have made to the Government and, more importantly, their customers who are still experiencing genuine difficulty.  In that regard, I welcome the statement by the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, who has said that the Central Bank, which is the statutory regulator of banks and other lenders and has prime responsibility for protecting the consumer of financial services, will intensify its engagement with lenders to ensure they are engaging effectively and meaningfully and providing the appropriate post-payment break to borrowers who need it.</p></speech>

The only answer that I can take from the reply is that banks will be offering one-to-one solutions.  We will now be relying on the innate goodness of banks, which has not been evident in this State to date.  I want to know what the Government is actually going to do.  This issue will not end today - we will have to revisit it in many forms.</p>  <p>  We were told during the period of austerity that certain institutions and banks were too big to fail.  While I welcome the fact that fewer people are looking for breaks, approximately 39,000 people have applied for a second break according to the Government's figures.  We need to ensure that as many people as possible are covered.  Unlike the institutions, the people are far too big to fail.</p>  <p>  What we are seeing is in keeping with what the Government is doing with the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  We must keep as many people safe during the pandemic as possible and give supports to people and businesses, but we are failing miserably.</p></speech>

That is pathetic.  To call it naive would be a gross understatement.  Remember what these banks did to borrowers who got in trouble as a result of the financial crash.  They harassed and harangued them and put them through the wringer.  People tried to engage with the banks.  Banks would appear before the finance committee and say that they were being reasonable and were open to engagement, but in reality they were hounding, harassing and dispossessing people where they could.  These are the same banks that are part-owners of the Debenhams consortium, dumped 1,000 Debenhams workers on the scrapheap and are allowing them to be treated in the most contemptible way.  The Government's policy is just to let them at it.  That is not a fair or acceptable policy to protect music workers, event workers, taxi drivers and people involved in tourism, transport-----</p></speech>

It was useless, toothless and fruitless.  There has been inertia in this and the previous Governments when it comes to dealing with the banks.  We have no legislation, yet other European countries have introduced legislation to compel banks to deal with people during Covid.</p>  <p>  The reply is cold comfort to people in the music industry, taxi drivers, small businesses and everyone else.  We are all in this big boat together, but the Government has cut adrift the 50,000 small business people who have mortgaged their homes, bands and equipment.  It will all be taken from them now.  It has already started.  They are out on an inflatable dinghy that is losing air fast, but the Government does not care about them.  They need our support and help.</p>  <p>  I cannot understand it.  The Government is like a rabbit in the headlights and afraid of the banks.  The banks have treated people dastardly for decades.  There has been skullduggery and blackguarding.  People have ended their lives through suicide, families have been destroyed and mental health issues have arisen because of the situation the banks created during the previous scandal.  The current crisis is outside our control, but the banks are carrying on their merry way and the Government is intimidated by them.  We need the Central Bank to deal with them, not sweet-talk them.</p></speech>

Our Government has protected in excess of 1.3 million people through the PUP and what is now the emergency wage subsidy scheme.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett might claim that Government policy is to sit back and do nothing, but the Government has in recent months done everything in its power, and gone beyond what most EU countries have done, to protect people's incomes in the first instance and then their jobs.  In protecting their jobs, we are protecting their ability to make all of the payments within their scope, in particular their day-to-day living expenses.  Perhaps the other jurisdiction on this island could learn a great deal from what has happened on this side of the Border.  If Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has any correspondence with the North, he might pass on what the Government in the South has done.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath is right about the stresses that people are under.  That is why the T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have engaged not only in the past week, but on a continuous basis through their departmental officials, with the CEO of every bank.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett might choose not to recognise it, but we need a functioning banking sector in order to have a functioning business sector.  He might want to nationalise them all and turn them into some sort of Cuban bank, but that does not work anywhere in the world in real terms except in North Korea and Cuba.</p></speech>

We have been trying to get the Minister of State's attention and to talk to him, but he has not acknowledged the Topical Issue or turned up to the D&aacute;il to talk to us until today.  I welcome his presence.  At least he has attended today to listen to us.</p>  <p>  Before I start, I congratulate the Minister of State on his new portfolio and wish him and his family well.</p>  <p>  I will get down to business.  People around Ireland, including Limerick, are being flooded in places that are not flood plains because of maintenance issues.  There has been no maintenance because workers are only being taken on for a season.  Recently, I was in Kilmallock, where my constituency office is.  We had a flooding issue.  The Minister of State was in Cork when it happened because he had to go to Skibbereen.  There was a red weather warning and a culvert could not be opened, which meant that Main Street in Skibbereen got flooded.  It was another maintenance issue that could have been avoided, but people's premises got flooded.</p> <p> In Kilmallock, houses were flooded that are not on a flood plain.  Is the Office of Public Works, OPW, responsible in this instance or is it a matter for the local authority?  The problem is that no maintenance is being done.  A couple of days after that flooding incident, we had another high wave and heavy rain and the locations that were already flooded - as I said, they are located in non-flood areas - were flooded again because the gullies and drains had not been cleaned.  I have been involved in construction all my life and I grew up on a farm.  I know about construction and I know about waterways.  If things are not maintained, there will be problems.</p> <p> Diggers were sent into the Kilmallock area by the OPW but there was only one driver.  A 4-tonne digger was dropped on the Charleville Road and a small bit of maintenance was done on a bridge there.  We found out later from Cian &Oacute; Donaill that this bridge was not properly constructed in the first place.  It was shown as an arch bridge on his map but when he went there, he found two 3 ft 6 in. pipes.  This bridge was constructed in 1984 and it has never been maintained other than by the people who live adjacent to it to prevent their houses from being flooded.</p> <p> The River Loobagh in Kilmallock has not been dredged in 15 years.  A house located on the bridge off Orr Street in Kilmallock was flooded twice within a week.  The Government sent Derek Higgins down to look at it and he told us there were no problems with the bridge and no problem with the eyebar.  Yet when we sent him photographs of it, it became a problem and, in fact, our biggest problem.  I am hoping that the Minister of State, as a Limerick man, can resolve these issues.  I am not making this personal.  My job is to point out the issues to the Minister of State and it is his job to make sure they are addressed.  He must take control and ensure the OPW takes on the staff that are needed.  Maintenance must be carried out all year round.  The Minister of State is ultimately responsible for the maintenance of 11,000 km of waterway.</p></speech>

Topical Issue matters are selected by the Ceann Comhairle, not by me.  Any Member who wishes to come to me with a particular concern is welcome to do so.  Just before Deputy O'Donoghue spoke, another Deputy came over to me to ask me something.  I am surprised that Deputy O'Donoghue would set about making his contribution in the way he did.</p>  <p>  I thank him for raising this important matter.  At this time of the year, as we approach the winter season, it is opportune that we consider our preparedness as a country to respond to severe weather events such as flooding.  I am acutely aware of the impact the recent flooding has had on individual households and communities throughout the State.  Since taking up my current position, I have visited a number of areas affected by the recent storms, including Kenmare, the Kilmallock area, Clifden, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Bantry, Bandon and Rosscarbery.  I thank the OPW staff, the staff of the local authorities, including the one in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county, the fire services staff and others who assisted in this work.</p>  <p>  The Government's framework for major emergency management underpins the co-ordination of responses to all emergencies in Ireland.  Through that framework, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the lead Department with national responsibility for co-ordinating the response to severe weather emergencies, including flooding.  Local authorities are designated as the lead agency for response to flooding events within their administrative areas, not the OPW, and for ensuring effective arrangements are put in place to receive and respond to public service weather warnings issued by Met &Eacute;ireann. </p>  <p>  I recognise the proactive planning of the local authorities, in this case, Limerick City and County Council, in putting in place temporary flood defences and putting response staff on standby in preparation for recent weather events.  Its planning and rapid response to flood events helped to mitigate the damage and devastation that was caused.  Each local area has its own individual plan in the event of flooding.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Civil Defence Ireland and the HSE are also involved and I thank them for their contribution.</p>  <p>  In regard to arterial drainage maintenance, the OPW carries out a programme of maintenance on a total of 11,500 km of river channel and approximately 730 km of embankments.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995.  The purpose of the schemes is to mitigate flooding for agricultural use.</p>  <p> The annual national maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up.  Completed on an average five-yearly cycle, work is carried out on approximately 2,000 km of channel each year.  Maintenance is continuously done on a cyclical basis under the Maigue catchment drainage scheme, including on channels in and around Kilmallock and Ballylanders.  In Kilmallock, works were undertaken on the main channel to clear debris from bridges as recently as June 2020.  There have also been rock-armouring works undertaken downstream of the town to address bank erosion.  In Bresheen, the channel was maintained along its full length in the period from June to August 2019.  I acknowledge the work done by the OPW in this regard.</p>  <p>  In the past two months, particularly intense rainfall events have caused serious flooding in the area surrounding Kilmallock and elsewhere.  In some of these places, we have seen unprecedented river levels and properties being flooded that were never previously flooded.  The flow recorded on the River Loobagh was a record event since records began in 1985.  The OPW is now engaged with Limerick City and County Council to explore what works might be feasible under the minor works scheme to mitigate the risk in these areas.   The council has been supported through funding from the OPW under the minor flood mitigation and coastal protection works scheme.  Funding of more than &euro;2 million has been approved for 39 local-scale flood protection projects, providing local flooding solutions to 440 properties across Limerick since the scheme began in 2009.</p></speech>

I watched the works being done in Kilmallock and I offer my thanks to the fire service staff there and in all the other areas where there was flooding.  A 4-tonne digger was dropped off Orr street, a driver operated it for five hours and then left the machine there for one week.  A 4-tonne digger was also left on the Charleville Road for one week.  There is only one driver and he is being pushed and pulled all over the place.  We need year-round staff to do this work.</p>  <p>  In Abbeyfeale, a homeowner came out the back door one morning and found that the yard was gone to within 7 ft of his house.  The fisheries board would not allow a small bank of earth in the middle of a river that is 35 m wide to be moved so that a machine could be put in to save this person's house.  The Minister of State called to that location along with local councillors, so he knows what I am talking about.  The fisheries board would not allow what was needed to be done.  Derek Higgins told us he cannot do any more work in Kilmallock because the fisheries board will not allow him to do it.  The Minister of State saw for himself the flooding that took place in Newcastle West in 2008.</p>  <p>  We need full-time, year-round staff to deal with these issues.  We do not need a machine to be dropped here, there and everywhere and one driver being told to go to one place for five hours and somewhere else for another five hours.  I know the Minister of State is a good person and he will try to deal with these issues.  He needs to get a handle on the OPW and its staffing levels.  It is not just the staffing levels at the OPW that need to be increased but also in the local authorities.  Their streams are attached to the OPW streams, as we can see in all the maps. There is no point in having machines with one driver operating them.  There must be adequate staffing and maintenance all year round.</p></speech>

Similar schemes were completed in Cappamore and Dromcolliher.  Major works are ongoing in Limerick city to protect King's Island and work has been completed in Coonagh.  Immediately after I visited Kilmallock, the OPW completed a tree and vegetation control there and more work is ongoing in that regard.  Work is also going on at Bresheen South where the channel meets the River Loobagh.  The Deputy will know that silt and vegetation works have been done on the R512 at Gurteen, which is the on road to Ardpatrick.  Silt removal works have also taken place in Kilmallock.</p>  <p>  These works have been done in consultation with Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Any delays are a source of frustration to me and to the OPW but we have to go through a planning process.  The Deputy was a member of Limerick County Council for a period of time and he will know that OPW personnel cannot just arrive at a river and do whatever they like.  There must be a planning process.  The Deputy will know from his own occupation as a builder that one has to go through a process to do anything.  In regard to specific personnel within the OPW, I would not like to respond to what individuals outside the House did or did not say.</p> <p>It is important to point out that in other parts of County Limerick, such as Castleconnell and Athea, consultants have been appointed under the CFRAM report.  Limerick city and environs is also going forward, again under a CFRAM report, which is a major flood risk assessment being carried out with more than &euro;1 billion committed by the Government.</p> <p> For the remainder of the schemes in Limerick that were announced in 2018, including Rathkeale, Foynes, Askeaton, Adare and Newcastlewest, work is progressing to develop each of these within the lifetime of the national development plan.  One area the Deputy did not refer to, and maybe he was not aware of it, was the massive flood alleviation works in Foynes, which the Office of Public Works completed to the satisfaction of everybody in Foynes, during the period of the last D&aacute;il.  Not everything the OPW does is a bad job.</p></speech>

This is a national cathedral for the 400,000 strong members of the Church of Ireland.  It is also an 800 year old national monument.  Such is the cathedral's importance, its history and its place in Dublin and in Ireland that it attracts some 400,000 visitors to it and to its services annually.  Managing that number of visitors would be a challenge in itself, but managing that number in such an historic setting and in such a historically sensitive building with some of the oldest roof timbers in Ireland, is a challenge.</p>  <p>  A bigger challenge has been facing the cathedral since 2016 when a storm exposed the roof and two large holes appeared in the roof.  Works that probably needed to happen long before then had to start and were undertaken by the dean, the administrators and the congregation.  This is a huge project that will cost &euro;9.1 million.  The work started last year and the administrators have acknowledged the &euro;200,000 grant the Department gave to the project.  This funding is small, and dare I say paltry, given the importance of this building to the history of the city and of Ireland.  It is a very delicate job and one cannot cut corners with it.  We have seen with other restoration projects in Ireland how some costs can rise.  As in Notre-Dame Cathedral, tragically, we can also see how these projects cannot be rushed, how care must be taken and a very delicate approach.  One of the biggest scaffolding projects ever seen in the city has enclosed the whole cathedral currently, while at the same time allowing services and tourists to visit the cathedral.</p>  <p>  Like the rest of Ireland, however, the problem is that the world stood still in March.  The expected 3,000 to 4,000 visitors a day who would normally visit the cathedral have stopped coming and have not returned.  This is when the donations dried up.  This restoration project was to be self-funded by the church.  It was not relying majorly on the State.  While the cathedral administrators have acknowledged the &euro;200,000 given by the State, they did not expect their funds and donations to dry up in such a severe way.  They are seeking help to try to bridge the gap between what they expected to have at this stage and what the project needs to ensure the restoration continues in the two years remaining.  I appeal to the Minister of State to put the hand into the pocket of the Government and to step up to the plate to help St. Patrick's Cathedral in its current dire need.  I believe this historic building is of such importance to the city, for architecture and tourism that it needs intervention from the State to make sure the project can continue and that there is no delay in it.</p></speech>

St. Patrick's Cathedral is the largest medieval church in Ireland.  It has been recorded by my Departments national inventory of architectural heritage and rated of national significance.  It is included on the Dublin City Council record of protected structures.  Although substantially restored in the mid-19th century the cathedral still retains a significant amount of medieval fabric, including medieval roof timbers.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the public health restrictions have been particularly difficult.  I understand that 90% of tourists to this wonderful cathedral, come, in normal times, from overseas.  St. Patrick's Cathedral is one of Ireland's most important historic structures, still operating for its original purpose 800 years after its construction.  I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work closely with the Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral and his colleagues with a view to bringing this very important restoration project to completion.  A further application from St. Patrick's Cathedral would be most welcome in the next round of the historic structures fund, which I expect to announce in November.</p>  <p>  My Department provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes that are, in the main, administered by the local authorities.  These are the built heritage investment scheme and the historic structures fund.  This year, 450 heritage projects across every county in the State will benefit from a combined sum of more than &euro;4.3 million under these schemes.  This funding will support the owners and custodians of historic and protected structures as they carry out hundreds of small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and safeguard our built heritage, as well as providing vital support for local jobs in conservation, traditional skills and construction.  Details of all projects approved for 2020 are published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, in 2019, my Department awarded &euro;200,000 in capital funding to St. Patrick's Cathedral under the historic structures fund for works to its roof, to be drawn down as works progressed over the course of 2019 and 2020.  This represents the maximum award that can be made under this scheme.  In addition, funding has been provided by my Department over the past number of years for work at the boundary walls and at St. Patrick's Close.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of further measures at its disposal to facilitate the restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at some 750 sites, and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  A wide range of other monuments, in the order of 130,000, are currently subject to protection under other provisions of the National Monuments Acts but my Department and the Office of Public Works do not have a direct role in their maintenance except where, as already noted, a monument is a national monument of which I am owner or guardian.</p>  <p>  I should clarify, in relation to the text of the matter, the definition of "monument" for the purpose of the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2014 is set out in section 2 of the principal Act of 1930.  I note that the definition provides that it does not include any building, or part of any building, that is habitually used tor ecclesiastical purposes such as St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The definition of "national monument" is also set out in the Acts.  As something must be a monument before it can be considered a national monument, the exclusion of buildings habitually used for ecclesiastical purposes also operates in relation to whether a building can be considered a national monument.</p></speech>

There is quite a bit in the Minister of State's reply.  I will try to deal with some of that.  I acknowledge the built heritage projects mentioned in the response, but most of them are on a smaller scale.  This, however, is a massive scale.  It has the biggest scaffold for any roof project currently.  The project will cost &euro;9.1 million and will involve stripping away the whole roof.</p> <p>During the two years that the roof is missing, the timbers in the roof will be reworked and, if needs be, treated.  The new slates which come from the same quarry used when the roof was last fixed in the 1860s, cost &euro;25 each and every one of them has to be taken by hand up and down the scaffolding.  This is an enormous undertaking by any standards and anyone with an understanding of conservation and restoration will acknowledge that.  This project does not really fit the criteria for the small grants that are available for restoration but it is of such major importance that the Government must provide a once-off grant for it.  </p> <p> The Minister of State is technically correct that St. Patrick's Cathedral is not a national monument because services are still held there.  However, one could also argue that the GPO is not a national monument because stamps are still sold there.  There must be some understanding at Government level of the national importance of this project.  St. Patrick's Cathedral is a significant tourist attraction.  It is of benefit to the local area as well as to the Church of Ireland congregation.  Anything that endangers the cathedral, like leaving it exposed to the elements because the roof has been stripped back, needs to be addressed by the State.  The Government needs to step up to the plate here.</p></speech>

The cathedral normally welcomes in excess of 600,000 visitors annually and is of strategic importance to the surrounding businesses.  The major roof conservation project currently under way at the cathedral provides employment to many skilled Irish crafts people.  As I indicated earlier, my Department has already provided substantial grant assistance to St. Patrick's Cathedral and would welcome a further application from the cathedral through Dublin City Council under the historical structure fund for 2021 when it launches later this year.  In the meantime my officials stand ready and available to provide any professional assistance that may be required to the council and the cathedral staff in order to ensure the completion of the restoration project.  I note the Deputy's very valid concerns in connection with this project and I will bring those concerns to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who has specific responsibility for this area.</p></speech>

The house to which I refer is No. 40 Herbert Park in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.  The house is of significant historical importance because Michael The O'Rahilly, his wife Nancy and their six children lived there.  People aware of Irish history will know that The O'Rahilly was one of the significant leaders of the 1916 Rising.  In fact, he was the only leader of the Rising to be killed in battle.  He died coming from the GPO heading towards a factory on what is now Parnell Street.</p>  <p>  The act of bulldozing the building was completely against the historical interests of the people of Dublin and Ireland.  Members of Dublin City Council had commenced a process to see whether this building could be put on the protected structures list kept by the council.  That process had commenced but the building had not yet been put on said list.  The council and councillors were in the process of conducting an appraisal of the building to see whether it merited inclusion on the list of protected structures.  This was a building of such significant historical importance that it would have been added to the list.  The reason it is of such historical importance is not simply because it was the house in which The O'Rahilly and his family lived but also because some of the most significant meetings leading up to the Easter Rising took place there.  This was the house in which people such as &Eacute;amon de Valera, P&aacute;draig Pearse and James Connolly met The O'Rahilly for the purpose of planning the rising which took place in Easter 1916.  It is hugely regrettable that this demolition has happened.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the Government's proposals to ensure that buildings such as this, which exist throughout the country, are protected because of their historical importance.</p></speech>

The house was built in 1907 and The O'Rahilly, the only 1916 leader to die in battle, was the first occupant of the property.  His widow Nancy lived here until her death in the 1960s.  In 1913 The O'Rahilly became one of the founding members of the Irish Volunteers.  He was in charge of the first major arming of Irish Volunteers from a consignment of German rifles and ammunition that were smuggled into Howth aboard the <i>Asgard</i>.  He joined the garrison of the GPO and was killed on 28 April 1916 while leading a charge down Moore Street.  The battlefield on Moore Street was also subject to unscrupulous developers who wanted to ignore our historical and cultural heritage.  The O'Rahilly literally fought and died by Pearse's side.</p><p>While No. 40 Herbert Park is not significant in an architectural sense, it is immensely important in an historical and cultural sense.  The <i>Asgard</i>gun-running operation was planned here and all of the signatories of the Proclamation met here.  As Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, Dublin City Council unanimously passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion to protect this property and like many, I was shocked and saddened to see it levelled to the ground yesterday.  The arrogance of the developer to completely ignore the democratic will of the people is a sad reflection on the systemic greed of some developers today.  Dublin City Council has announced that it will be carrying out an investigation into the destruction of No. 40 Herbert Park.  What assistance will the Department be giving to the council and what are the likely repercussions for the developer?</p></speech>

I appreciate that both Deputies have considerable concerns relating to the demolition of The O'Rahilly's house at 40 Herbert Park, Dublin 4.  I understand that permission for such works was granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 8 September 2020.  The Deputies should be aware that under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, Ministers and Ministers of State are specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned, except in very specific and extreme circumstances which do not apply in this instance.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister of State with responsibility for planning matters to comment on the merits or otherwise of the board's decision to grant permission for the demolition works in question or to express an opinion as to whether the works should have been progressed or not.  Under planning legislation the decision as to whether to grant planning permission on an application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal.  In making decisions on planning applications a planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, is required to have regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in determining an appeal, decides the matter as if the application had been made to it in the first instance.</p>  <p>  Under section 50 of the 2000 Act, anyone may apply to the High Court seeking a judicial review of any decision made by a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la where the person believes the validity of the decision may be in question.  The application must be made within eight weeks of the authority of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision, which in this case has not yet lapsed.  It is a matter for the relevant planning authority, in this case Dublin City Council, to decide on any further action it may wish to take.</p> <p> With regard to the safeguards for protected structures, Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on the record of protected structures, RPS.  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with any development proposals affecting them.  I understand the building in question was not included on the current RPS of Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

I appreciate he is limited in what he can do because of the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, we need to look beyond the planning decision that lies in the background of this demolition.  The more important issue is that we, as a country, need to recognise the importance of our revolutionary period and the influence that revolutionary period has, not only on this country, but on our international reputation.  I think we undersell ourselves when it comes to recognising the importance of that revolutionary period.  It was an inspiration to the colonial world.  When we look at countries which gained their independence from colonial powers, very many of them looked to the example set by Ireland during the revolutionary period that we are at present celebrating in the decade of centenaries.  We need to recognise that.  We need to go around the country and ask local authorities to identify those properties within their jurisdiction that are of historical importance, so we can preserve our vital revolutionary history.</p></speech>

However, I do not think the developer would have had a look at all that kind of stuff before he went in yesterday and bulldozed No. 40 Herbert Park.  This was an act of sheer corporate greed, the like of which will destroy Irish history and heritage in this city if it is allowed to go on.  The developer had blocked Dublin City Council from visiting the site despite two letters asking to visit it.</p>  <p>  The O&rsquo;Rahilly famously said, when he joined the fight for freedom from foreign occupiers in the GPO, "I have helped to wind up the clock.  I might as well hear it strike."  Yesterday, the developer wound up the clock of sheer wanton cultural vandalism of No. 40 Herbert Park.  If the public condemnation is followed up with political will, then the developer will hear that clock strike.  However, if this developer goes unpunished and is not punished in the strongest possible terms, then it will give the green light for more of our historical and cultural heritage to be destroyed.  I ask the Minister of State this: for what died the sons of R&oacute;is&iacute;n?  Was it for greed? </p></speech>

As I indicated earlier, it is inappropriate for me, as the Minister of State with responsibility for planning matters, to become involved in or to make any comment on this matter as the law simply precludes me from doing so.  The planning authorities and the board are independent statutory bodies under the provisions of the planning Act and, as stated previously, are independent in the performance of their functions.  The development works in question are a matter for the planning applicant concerned, the relevant local authority and the board, as appropriate, and I have no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will also be aware that the record of protected structures is a reserved function of the local authority system and is primarily its responsibility.  This matter will obviously be an enforcement issue for Dublin City Council and is wholly under its remit.</p></speech>

It was nobody&rsquo;s intention that the forestry licensing system would become blocked and unfit for purpose.  However, that is the situation we have, and we will continue to have saplings rotting in nurseries and jobs in rural areas at risk unless we, as legislators, do something about it.</p>  <p>  I am my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on climate action and I want firstly to address the Bill from the perspective of our climate crisis.  We do not have any time to waste.  We have spent years and years talking about the dangerous levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and how climate change will affect everyone, but especially the world&rsquo;s poorest.  We need to pass this Bill to get forestry licensing working again because we need to convert a lot of land to forestry to help to meet our climate goals.  We do not have time to wait another year, another six months or even another month.  Our mild climate makes our country one of the best habitats for trees in the world.  We have farmers ready to go and we have the forestry industry ready to go.  We cannot, in good conscience, allow an administrative system to hold everything up.</p>  <p>  I want to say something about the farming community because much of both my own party&rsquo;s approach and the approach of the Government has been informed by the need to work with the farming community to make the significant changes we need for a sustainable future.  It is significant that we have two Ministers in the Department who are both working farmers.  They have both shown sensitivity to the challenges that farm families face.  We all want a sustainable future for farming that protects and enhances our environment and provides a stable income for those who work the land.  It is true we are going to have to change the way we do things in some ways over the next few decades but we can make the changes with a spirit of partnership, respect and flexibility.  We simply cannot tackle the climate and biodiversity crises unless we work in partnership with farmers.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has acknowledged some of the problems facing the forestry sector, and I know it is a sector she is serious about.  I acknowledge the genuine effort made at consultation on this Bill and the changes the Minister of State has made as a result of this consultation.  Most of us in this House share concerns about the over-reliance on a single species and I know the Minister of State wants to work in partnership with landowners and the forestry industry to find sustainable ways of changing how we plant that can benefit both farmers and biodiversity.</p>  <p>  We want to have more forest cover in this country.  We want forest cover that supports wildlife, gives a decent income for farmers and provides materials that can be used to make sure the carbon that is sequestered is locked in.  We need more timber used in construction in particular.  However, none of that can happen if we have a licensing system that is not fit for purpose.  Even though our forest coverage is the highest it has been in centuries, at 770,000 ha, or 11% of our land area, it is still one of the lowest in the EU.  Half of this is owned by Coillte, and I want to particularly acknowledge the work of Coillte Nature recently in some of its innovative work to increase biodiversity.  Conifers represent over 60% of our forest cover and although I share very legitimate concerns about monoculture plantations, it is also important to acknowledge that coniferous species will continue to be important in construction and other areas.  Yes, we need more continuous cover and less clear felling and we need more species diversity in our forests.</p>  <p>I know the Minister of State has ambitious plans in that regard but, again, none of these plans can be addressed unless we fix our forestry licensing and appeals processes.  I know there is some frustration about the direction forestry has taken over recent decades.  As urgent as the biodiversity and climate crises are, we still have to work with landowners to make the changes we all know we need.  To advocate solely on the basis of castigating others wins us no friends.  Anger alone cannot achieve the changes we need.  It will take some time to steer this ship in the direction we want to go.  Providing a working licensing system is a good first step.</p></speech>

The issues facing the forestry industry have long been mooted and were mentioned in an article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>as long ago as December 2019.  As per usual, when questioned about this in May, the previous Minister, Deputy Creed, made out that this was only a temporary setback which would be soon sorted but look at where we are now.  We now have our backs against the wall and are rushing through legislation which is required to save jobs.</p><p>Just last Friday, I met local representatives of the Irish Farmers Association in Clare to discuss the association's pre-budget submission.  Among the several issues discussed was that of the delays in granting felling licences.  Approximately 17% of the land in County Clare is planted and this delay in granting licences is causing stress across the sector.  Felling companies are running out of work and landowners are not able to harvest their crops.  We must all understand the need for sustainable forestry management but we have concerns and our party has submitted a few amendments to address these.</p><p>It is claimed that this Bill will streamline the work of the forestry appeals committee and allow it to operate along the lines of An Bord Plean&aacute;la but the process to be appointed to the committee is questionable.  Simply put, our amendment will ensure that the Minister's appointments to the board will take matters such as biodiversity, water quality and climate change into account and will ensure that his or her appointees will have the required experience in these fields.  That is not an unreasonable request.</p><p>There are also concerned about the timeline for appeals allowed for in this Bill.  It is quite clear that the time limit of 28 days to lodge an appeal is insufficient.  This is why we propose extending the period to 42 days.  We would also like to ensure that the timeline will begin from the day of public notification of a licence being granted rather than the day on which the decision is made.  This would prevent any underhanded moves against the public's right to appeal.</p><p>Another aspect of the Bill about which I have concerns is that it allows the Minister the right to reduce the timeline for appeals but not to extend it.  This provision beggars belief and needs to be removed as it makes no sense.</p><p>Finally, I would like to address some issues regarding the fees for lodging appeals.  It is worrying that no provision has been made for caps on these fees.  This means that the Minister could stand before the House in the coming months and announce that outrageous amounts will be charged for lodging appeals, which would prevent many people from doing so.  While we agree in principle with the introduction of fees for appeals, such fees must be reasonable.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that they be capped at &euro;50.  Again, this is not an unreasonable request.</p><p>None of these amendments is irrational.  We have agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill to ensure that jobs are protected but we must ensure that the Bill stands over the basic fundamentals of both sides in this discussion.</p></speech>

We need transformative change in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I know that bringing about such change will be challenging but it is essential and I really look forward to working with both the Minister of State and the Minister to achieve it.  I really hope this legislation is a bad start to a brilliant term.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State explained yesterday, there is a crisis in the forestry sector.  The licensing and appeals system has been overwhelmed by delays, an issue which was not addressed until it was, in many ways, too late.  This has been detrimental to our afforestation strategies, the industry and a great many jobs and it is now detrimental to an important appeals process as well.  We all agree that an efficient appeals system is needed.  However, this Bill is not that.  The Government&rsquo;s argument is that the appeals process needs to change but many of us believe the Department should simply deal with the appeals it gets.</p>  <p>  Imagine if we dealt with other situations in the same way in which the Government is dealing with this one.  Imagine if there was a really long waiting list for the driving test and, instead of carrying out more tests, we made it really hard and expensive to apply.  It is quite difficult to imagine and that is why so many people are aghast at the approach being taken.  This legislation fails to address the problem we have.</p>  <p>  This is not a new crisis, as those in the sector have pointed it out repeatedly.  In the four years for which the forestry appeals committee has been in existence, it has only heard 33% of the appeals lodged.  The current average rate at which appeals are heard is 20 per month so, predictably, there is now a backlog of two years.  We knew this would happen so why wait until breaking point to address it?  I know the Minister of State is new to this brief and is not responsible for the inaction of previous Governments but it is worth acknowledging that this is ridiculous.</p>  <p>  The sector understandably supports the Bill.  However, it is the only solution the industry, which is on the brink of collapse, has been offered.  Of course it is in favour of some kind of action.  As with the national broadband plan and the children&rsquo;s hospital, we are being presented with a unsuitable proposal at a time when people are so desperate that they are forced to accept it.</p>  <p>  While the Government buys into its own rhetoric that it is saving the industry, it does not acknowledge that it is its own inaction and underinvestment that put the sector in this position and at risk in the first place.  In future, a new approach is essential.</p>  <p>  Time and again, when it comes to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we see the same ridiculous turn of events unfold.  We first see shortcomings on the part of the Department and its policies, this is then somehow not the focus of the debate and instead the industry is pitted against environmentalists and we have that pointless debate.  The result is that the industry and the individuals who will be most affected by climate change are most worried about climate action.  This is happening in every sector for which the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible.  The situation we are in today is a classic example of this.</p>  <p>  From meeting representatives of the industry over recent months, I know that they do not take issue with an accessible appeals process.  Their issue lies with the snail&rsquo;s pace at which the Department is getting through them.  Nobody I spoke to in the forestry sector has any kind of intention whatsoever of damaging the environment.  The opposite is the case.</p>  <p>  We know the forestry sector has to play a key role in addressing the climate crisis we are facing and the industry knows that too.  It is a sad reality that this is not what we are discussing here today.  That policies are not anywhere near good enough to address this, that these inadequate policies shape everything in the sector, and that the Department has not been able to process appeals adequately is not the fault of the industry nor the fault of people who have genuine concerns about planting and felling licences.</p>  <p>  We can all agree that we need more resources and expertise in the licensing and appeals system to clear the backlog.  There are solutions here that will not negatively affect a democratic appeals process and I seriously urge the Minister of State to consider them.</p>  <p>  One of my amendments seeks to introduce a statutory obligation for "appeals to be heard in a timely manner".  This simple change, which does not represent a redrawing of the whole system, will resolve the sector&rsquo;s key concerns.</p>  <p>  This legislation does not address some other major issues for the sector such as climate change and Brexit.  More than 80% of our forestry exports go to the UK.  We need to make sure we learn from mistakes like this.  We cannot wait until this industry is in the midst of another crisis before doing something about it.</p>  <p>  If we learn anything from the Covid crisis, it should be to prepare for future crises, particularly those we know are on the way.  This Department should be leading the way with solutions to the climate crisis rather than creating the problems.  Forestry needs to be recognised as one of the most important solutions here.  The Department cannot continue to treat it like a poor relation of other agricultural industries.  I would love to work with both the Minister and Minister of State to achieve this.</p>  <p>  We need ambitious policy to help this sector not only to survive Brexit but also to create a sustainable industry.  Given the Minister of State's specific brief, we should be using the little time we have on forestry to discuss a national forestry programme and its role in increasing biodiversity.  Stakeholders have been calling for this for years.  The programme for Government commits to creating one.  We need to concentrate on this rather than on eroding regulations.</p>  <p>  This Bill is being pushed through at a very irresponsible pace.  The heads of the Bill and public consultation process were published on the Friday afternoon of the August bank holiday weekend, a tactic formerly used by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government when releasing ever-increasing homelessness figures.  That public consultation ran across August, when we know that people are less likely to engage.</p>  <p>  This Bill is being rushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On Thursday, we were asked for amendments to the Bill before the Seanad had even made its amendments.  At first I thought that, as a new Deputy, I did not quite understand the process but I quickly learned that this is extremely unusual and represents poor practice.  The stages of the Bill are basically being rushed through as a box-ticking exercise.</p> <p>Our primary role is to make legislation.  We need to ensure that we scrutinise laws.  Along with others, I am deeply concerned that due to the speed of the passage of the Bill, nuanced and subtle aspects have been overlooked that will potentially leave the State open to criticism and liability under national and international environmental commitments.</p> <p> While there are welcome additions in the Bill, there are also many items which are not fully developed or are concerning for public involvement.  The ability of the forestry appeals committee, FAC, to sit in all divisions will allow more appeals to be heard, and I welcome that.  However, we must ensure this does not result in a diluting of expertise.  There is no guidance in the legislation to ensure the divisions will have sufficient expertise to guarantee informed decision making.  I have submitted amendments to secure the independence of the appeals committee.  It is essential that the committees are populated with the right people and are separate from the Department.  The Minister of State has likened this system to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in which case the FAC should similarly consist of experts from relevant representative bodies.</p> <p> We need commitments that the committee and its divisions will have sufficient knowledge of the industry, good forestry practice, biodiversity, water quality, climate change and environmental legislation.  We also need commitments that the Minister will not appoint officers from the Department or the Government to the committee.</p> <p> The legislation provides the Minister with the power to make regulations for the forestry appeals process.  On the face of it, this is good as it allows changes to be made to address future obstacles.  However, there is no clear Oireachtas oversight of this.  It is a concentration of power in the Department without the necessary checks and balances.</p> <p> The Bill introduces reasonable fees for appeals.  I emphasise the term "reasonable" because the Minister of State said that the fees would likely be &euro;20 for a submission and approximately &euro;200 for an appeal.  Similar to Senators Ruane and Higgins, I have submitted an amendment to change this to fees which are "fair and equitable".  I urge the Minister of State to seriously reconsider her thinking on the issue of fees.  I imagine the Minister of State would agree that the ability to participate in the licensing and appeals system should not be an economic privilege.</p> <p> The Bill highlights the Government's perspective on public participation in decision-making.  At the heart of a vibrant democracy is the engagement of citizens.  The State needs to encourage involvement from communities, NGOs and everyone.  This principle needs to underpin how government functions.  However, in Ireland this is often not the case.  Communities may believe they are struggling against the State.  The Protect Our Native Kelp campaign in Bantry and the Save Our Skibbereen campaign against a plastics factory are two recent examples from my constituency of Cork South-West.  It should not be left to such communities to raise vast amounts of money to put right these wrong decisions in court.  Regrettably, in attempting to resolve the forestry appeals backlog, the Government is rolling back on one of our more progressive participatory systems.  This is undoubtedly a mistake.  Attempts to define who can be involved, financial barriers and the use of complicated mechanisms, such as the access to information on the environment regulations, erode the ability of people to contribute to decisions that affect their areas.  This is at odds with good public participation practice.  Furthermore, I remain unconvinced that it meets our commitments under the public participation directive and the Aarhus Convention.  How robustly has this legislation been scrutinised?  Can the Minister of State guarantee that this law will not be found in breach of the right to participate in environmental decision-making and to challenge public decisions?</p> <p> Forestry can make a significant contribution to a sustainable economy that supports rural communities.  The current forestry system is failing communities, the industry and workers.  The erosion of regulation and the introduction of fees will do nothing to address these underlying issues.  We need a new forestry programme, and we need it yesterday.  The sector is in desperate need of reform.  Stakeholders are ready for the challenge of developing an ambitious scheme that will define a new era in Irish forestry.  We should be focusing on forestry policy that takes urgent climate action and supports the industry to do the same.  We know importing timber is not the solution.  We know using concrete instead of timber is not the solution.  We know placing barriers into an appeals process is not the solution.</p> <p> Ireland is the most deforested country in Europe.  While reforestation is ongoing, most of it is with non-native plantations used for commercial forestry.  While this is better than importing timber, these forests are poor habitats for wildlife.  We need more broadleaf forestry.  Government policy needs to incentivise both these approaches - the latter with urgency - for the industry to be able to do that.  We need clear rewilding strategies, the conversion of portions of agricultural land to native forestry and the establishment of wildlife corridors.  We need forestry on every farm, with special incentives in place along watercourses and special areas of conservation to generate connected wildlife corridors throughout the country.</p> <p> I am supportive of aspects of the Bill but I also have serious concerns about it.  I have submitted several pragmatic amendments based on my engagement with the forestry sector in west Cork, farmers, environmental groups, constituents and colleagues in the Seanad.  I have balanced a variety of perspectives in addressing the appeals backlog, the right of public participation and the sustainability of the sector.  Issues, including the independence of the appeals process, the involvement of experts, the participation of the public, the current crisis in the sector and the timely processing of appeals, need to be addressed.  I call on the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to look seriously at how they can accommodate the amendments that I and like-minded Deputies have submitted, as agreed at last week's briefing.</p></speech>

I imagine we would happily use that too.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for the opportunity to address this Bill.  I welcome the legislation on the whole.  We badly need to address the long backlogs from concerned communities, in terms of appeals that are awaiting outcome, and the forestry industry.  For the first time ever, the industry is in real danger in terms of continuity of supply for various products, including timber and forestry residue, for the second quarter of next year.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, like An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we are going to split.  As the previous speaker has said, it is important that we get the range of expertise right.  It is neither preferable to have too many ecologists nor no industry representatives.  A balance of both is required so that we can achieve the environmental responsibilities and targets we yearn for as well as cater for the supply of timber.  There are some 12,000 employees throughout the country.  One example in my area is Masonite in south County Leitrim.  The company employs 140 people and pays some &euro;8 million in wages each year, predominantly to people in Leitrim, Longford and Roscommon, as well as &euro;500,000 in rates.  That is the sort of contribution at issue.  The company uses the residue from forestry in the products it makes.  Such companies are important to our economy and it is important that we support them.  Timber mills throughout the country are in difficulty over supply.  Timber auctions have been cancelled.</p><p>Anyway, I am not simply here to hold a candle for industry, although it is important and I believe the measures in this legislation must be immediately followed up with the appropriate resources.  When the Bill is passed later this week, please God, the job will not be done.  The job will only be done when we quickly recruit those who need to be recruited and get the additional deputy chairpersons involved so that the appeals board can divide and take appropriate decisions in the interests of communities and the industry.</p><p>Again, as someone from the north west of the country and as someone who is conscious of our environment, as all of us are in the north west, I am mindful of the fact that if all counties were pulling their weight in terms of forestry, then we would be in a better position.  County Leitrim, instead of hanging around 11% in terms of national cover, has a higher rate of coverage.  Coverage in Ireland is the lowest in Europe, as previous speakers have said.  The average Europe-wide is 30%.  In Leitrim we are probably closer to the 30% figure.  As Deputies may be aware, the official figure for forest cover in County Leitrim is 17%.  It is argued locally - I have seen it myself - that up to 50% of agricultural land is afforested.  That is difficult for communities.  They do not want over-afforestation in a particular location and the Government needs to be conscious of this.  The appeals board and those assessing applications need to be conscious of this when they are assessing applications.  They need to listen to local communities.  I do not like the removal of &quot;relevant person&quot; or the idea of someone from a particular perspective or <i>modus operandi</i>on the Falkland Islands being able to dictate what might be grown in Sligo, Kildare or Dublin.  I do not believe this is the right thing to do.  I believe we can trust our people.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could take some of these points on board.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on her appointment and wish her all the best in her role.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill, which remedies a problem in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but also assists us in achieving not just targets we have set in the programme for Government but also in regard to afforestation.  While the State has been a little late in its response, the Minister of State and the Department have been very responsive in setting about finding a resolution to the issue with the appeals process that was highlighted effectively by environmental groups and citizens.  Those issues are addressed in the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill will improve the circumstances in which the industry finds itself and clear the backlog of applications and appeals.  We can now begin, I hope, to transform the industry and to make it a more efficient and productive sector within our environment and economy.  As a people, we have a long and proud tradition and respect for our land and environment.  It has sustained us through centuries of hardship and struggle, building a bond between us and the land.  In some respects, this makes Ireland an outlier when compared with many other countries.  Ireland's commitment to afforestation, for example, is an area we should be proud of and one in which we should be even more ambitious.  A number of colleagues mentioned the difficulties with some of the afforestation of non-native species that has taken place in recent years.  It is an important aspect of the consideration of the climate and biodiversity crisis we have declared in the State and that is recognised globally.</p>  <p>  The destruction of forests throughout the globe has had a dramatic effect on our environment and lives, which is why it is important that Ireland take the lead, not only to catch up with our European colleagues, who have a much higher afforestation rate, but to pass them out.  We have been world leaders in many areas over many years, and I would like afforestation to be yet another in which we take that lead.  The benefits are plain for everybody to see, from improved air quality to preventing soil erosion and providing new habitats for flowers and animals that have been increasingly driven out of their environments.  Perhaps the most important aspect of wide-scale afforestation is that trees act as a carbon sink, removing carbon from the atmosphere that we have put there.  Recent studies have shown the dramatic effect these carbon sinks can have.  One study published in a science journal in October last year suggested that the correct level of afforestation could remove up to two thirds of CO2 emissions created by humans.  This is a staggering figure in the context of the ambitions we have in front of us and the commitments we have given.</p>  <p>  Our country and our international community have seen major changes this year in the advent of Covid-19, but these pale in comparison with the challenges we face in respect of climate change.  Indeed, it is the greatest challenge our generation and subsequent generations will grapple with.  Our success or failure in this battle will determine our future as a species on this planet.  I support the ambition of the Bill and the broader ambition of not just the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications but also of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

This is an industry in which thousands of jobs are at risk in rural areas where there is little or no alternative employment.  In Laois-Offaly alone, for example, almost 100 workers are reliant, either directly or indirectly, on the forestry sector in timber production, sawmills and so on.  Some of these workers are already on short-time work due to the crisis.  The crisis is very real for sawmills in the likes of Coolrain, Mountrath and Portlaoise, where families are worried.  Supplies of wood are reaching a critical point for the construction and biofuel industries.  The sawmill in Portlaoise has scaled back production of wood pellets and cannot meet demand.  It is estimated that only about 25% of logs that are needed are in the supply chain and have been approved for licences.</p>  <p>  It has got to the point where we are importing timber into Ireland to meet demand.  Some Deputies will be aware of the alarming case of timber imported from Germany that was contaminated with the bark beetle, an insect that led to 32 million cu. m of German timber having to be disposed of in 2019.  We cannot allow such an incident to occur in Ireland.  We need to reduce our dependency on imported timber and allow our industry to get back to work.</p>  <p>  We support the substance of the Bill and will certainly not argue it is not needed, but we will submit a number of amendments aimed at dealing with bottlenecks in the granting of licences and to make the appeals system work more efficiently and fairly.  We support the proposal for a modest fee for those who want to lodge appeals or submissions on the granting of licences, but it must be capped at a reasonable sum; it should not be a barrier.  The forestry appeals committee must be adequately resourced to clear the backlog to allow it to deal with licences much more quickly.  Farmers in Laois have forestry they cannot harvest and their applications are lodged in the queue of the appeals system, going nowhere for months on end, which is not good enough.  Legislation will be worthless unless we invest the resources.</p>  <p>  We need a new forestry policy to increase the number of broadleaf trees, improve biodiversity, increase carbon sequestration - forestry can play a major role in this - and promote unfarmed forestry, not forestry as a replacement for farms.</p>  <p>  We ask that these issues be taken on board.  We will support the Bill, although we will table amendments to it.</p></speech>

It is clear from the figures, and from any visible comparison of Ireland with other European countries, that we have a problem with afforestation here.  There is a total of 11% in Ireland, versus an EU average of 30%, and very low levels of afforestation at the moment, combined with higher harvesting rates.  It is a problem that needs to be addressed but it needs to be done so in the correct way, not with the expansion of Sitka spruce monoculture, which is environmentally damaging, and not by eliminating public participation and a public process of appeals and so on.  It needs to be addressed as part of a sustainable plan and as part of a green new deal that involves sustainable jobs and so on.</p>  <p>  In my opinion, however, that is not the approach the Government has taken in this case.  There are a large number of problems with the Bill, the first of which are the procedural ones.  The number of tricks and manoeuvres the Government has used to try to force through the Bill without proper scrutiny is striking.  It is reminiscent of the worst old days of overall majority government, ramming through guillotines, avoiding pre-legislative scrutiny and so forth.  Every sly move possible has been used.  The consultation period started on the Friday of a bank holiday weekend and ran for the summer holidays.  The details of the submissions to that consultation are not available.  Even the Oireachtas Library and Research Service has stated it has not been given enough time to analyse the submissions.  The need for pre-legislative scrutiny was waived and now tonight's debate will be guillotined.</p>  <p>  We will, therefore, debate on Second Stage, which is the debate in principle, for another couple of hours and at that point we will have until 9 p.m. to deal with a huge number of amendments.  What will happen, for the benefit of people who are not in the Chamber, is that not only will those amendments not be discussed, they also will not be voted on.  It is a completely inadequate process and it will be striking to people when they compare it with how proposals for sick pay for workers or proposals for dying with dignity are dealt with by the Government.  Those matters can be kicked to touch and tied up in knots for six months but it is another rule in this case.</p>  <p>  It is the Green Party that is doing this.  It is dirtying its hands with this grubby deal.</p> <p>What makes it worse is that those involved in campaigning on these issues know that if it had not been participating in this Government, the Green Party would have been on the opposite side of this debate and it would be criticising both the lack of public participation and process around the Bill and the contents of the Bill itself.  It has its Cabinet seats and like in <i>Animal Farm</i>, one can look from blueshirt to green and from green to blueshirt but already it is impossible to say which is which.<br/><br/>On the content of the Bill, last year a report for the Fine Gael-led Government complained about an appeals system which allows third parties, at no cost, to challenge the decisions of the Department.  It will not surprise people that Fine Gael was giving out about a system that allows ordinary people and community groups to challenge the Department but now we have the Green Party joining in with trying to silence the voices of those environmental groups that it once claimed to support.<br/><br/>The Bill would allow the Minister to impose whatever fees he wants on people who bring appeals to the forestry appeals committee.  In the Seanad transcript I read speculation that this could cost people up to &euro;220, which was not refuted by the Minister of State.  Some families and communities that are heavily affected by this due to where they live could have many such appeals to make, and they have the right to make many such appeals, meaning they could be charged thousands of euro in order to be able to have their voices heard.  The Government's hope is to silence people so that only the wealthy and those with resources can appeal these decisions.  The Green Party should be ashamed of itself.<br/><br/>When the Green Party went into Government, some undoubtedly hoped it would mean the Government would take seriously the need to take on the big business polluters and to invest in green jobs.  Instead, this week we have a Green Party Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport standing over a massive attack on intercity bus services and now another Green Party Minister of State is rushing through a forestry Bill that is being described as truly shocking by environmental organisations.  It is clear how the Green Party is being used as a mudguard and these proposed changes for forestry are one more example of that.<br/><br/>I have a few points to make on amendments that might not be reached at all or if they are reached, unfortunately I will not be here because I have to go to the picket line of the Debenham's workers at The Square in Tallaght where there is an attempt to remove the stock.  It is ironic because in justifying this legislation, the Government says it is introducing it to protect jobs but when jobs are actually under attack in the case of Debenhams, the Government has stood idly by.<br/><br/>The Minister should drop the proposal to give himself the power to impose whatever fees he likes.  In my opinion, there is no need for such fees whatsoever.  If the Government wants to truly support the principle of the Aarhus Convention of promoting public participation, the idea of fees should be completely scrapped and at the very least, the Government should support the various amendments that are proposed to restrict those fees.<br/><br/>I welcome the fact the Government was forced to drop the restriction on who could submit an appeal.  It is a testament to the pressure that was brought to bear by various organisations and campaigners in the Environmental Pillar and beyond.<br/><br/>On jobs, there is much spin and bluster seeking to make out that environmentalists are against cutting down trees for timber or are out to make those working for the industry unemployed.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The reality is that timber production can be done in an environmentally sustainable way and can be an important part of a socialist green new deal for Ireland.  However, if the Government is relying on the for-profit motive and on big corporations to drive that, they will not do so in an environmentally sustainable way.  When profits rule, it is inevitable that people's interests and the interests of the planet are put second and communities and biodiversity are sacrificed in the search for profits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="15:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000038#QQ00200"><p>We will be opposing this Bill for a number of reasons.  First, the manner in which this Bill is being pushed through is a disgrace.  Even at this point, we are scrambling around and trying to get our heads around huge numbers of amendments, which will never be debated and discussed in any event.  All of those amendments have been collapsed into the Second Stage debate and the legislation will be rammed through in a way that makes a mockery of legislative scrutiny and the democratic process.</p>  <p>  The fact the Green Party is a party to this is shocking beyond belief because I do not know how many times I heard members of the Green Party wax lyrical about the need for a sustainable forestry model and the critical importance of forestry in terms of climate change and biodiversity.  Yet, it is assisting the bigger parties in the Government in ramming through this Bill, which will not address the huge crisis we face in a fundamentally dysfunctional forestry model and which could do significant damage.</p>  <p>  Aside from almost anything that is in the Bill, the process is a disgrace.  That is a good enough reason to oppose this Bill because we will not have time to properly scrutinise it.  Then we must consider what the Bill is facilitating, namely, the propping up of a rotten, dysfunctional and environmentally damaging forestry model.  This model is driven by profit and that does not even come close to reaching the economic and employment potential that a proper forestry model would have.</p>  <p>  We are propping up a forestry model that is carrying out intense environmental damage.  To give an indication of why I say that, in one day in 2019, some 824 separate felling licences were issued to clear 6,669 ha of public forest.  Over the next three months, a further 345 more felling licences up to December 2019, covering a total of 9,527 ha of public forest were issued.  Many of those might be subject to appeal.  We should think about those figures.  That is 15,000 ha of public forest that will be felled and that is just in the period of about half of last year.  Many of those fellings could cause potentially significant environmental damage and be subject to appeal.  Those figures are telling when one considers that we are planting about 4,000 ha of forest per year and for the most part, it is the wrong type of forest.  In a short period of time, licences seeking to fell 15,000 ha were issued but we are only planting 4,000 ha.</p>  <p>  The Irish National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, has talked about us reaching our afforestation targets and getting from the abysmal level of forest cover, which has been mentioned a number of times, of 11% as against a European average of 30%, in a country that has the best conditions for growing trees anywhere in Europe and we have consistently gotten nowhere near those targets.  When one adds together what I have just said and what we are planting against a push for accelerated harvesting, it is not surprising that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, among others has expressed deep concern that we may be in a situation of net deforestation.  We are going from an already bad situation to a worse situation, therefore.</p> <p> I had some lobbying from some of my colleagues earlier who legitimately worry about the people who move the logs, the hauliers and so on, and those who participate in the work of cutting down trees or planting forests.  Those concerns for employment and for people who earn their living from forestry are legitimate but I ask those colleagues to consider that in Wallonia, which is a quarter of the territory of Belgium, there is a timber industry worth &euro;4.5 billion employing 18,000 people.  In other words, in an area much smaller than this country, they have far more people employed in forestry and the revenue is far greater.  There are 12,000 people employed in Irish forestry.</p></speech>

We are massively underperforming in terms of the employment and revenue we could generate if we had a good and sustainable forestry model instead of the monocultural industrial forestry model that may result in net deforestation.  As the model is largely based on one species of tree, it is quite damaging to soil and water.  As it makes our forests more prone to disease and so on, it is a fundamentally unsustainable industry.</p>  <p>  It may also be worth pointing out that this industry does not generate quality employment.  For example, when Coillte was set up in 1989, there were 2,500 staff in the forest service but today there are 600, with half of those being administrative staff.  The people getting jobs in forestry are often poorly paid.  It can be immigrant labour with very insecure work that does not amount to a job at all.  Bogus self-employment is rampant, with worker rights, pay and conditions subject to widespread abuse.  It is not a sustainable or beneficial forestry model from an employment perspective, a macroeconomic perspective and a biodiversity perspective.</p>  <p>  Against that background is the idea that we will try to restrict the right of people to object to planting or felling that is contributing to sustaining or propping up an unsustainable forestry model.  That is not acceptable as far as I am concerned.  We need a thoroughly independent review of the entire forestry sector rather than something that is trying essentially to cover the tracks of a failed policy.</p>  <p>  If we did forestry right we could create thousands of new, decent and quality jobs.  It could be a forestry model based on diverse forest species, native woodlands and tree species that would generate all sorts of knock-on industries from a different type of forestry.  It is a shocking fact that in a country where we were once covered with native hardwood trees, there is almost no native hardwood industry at all and we import much of our hardwood.  It is shocking when we have supreme conditions for growing quality hardwood trees but it is not the short-term profit model favoured by pension funds, sawmills and the big corporate interests who dominate Irish forestry.  It would nevertheless have a genuine benefit on the environment, employment, the economy and real communities with ordinary working people.  It would of course also contribute to addressing the climate and biodiversity crisis, as we must.</p>  <p>  On this basis, we will oppose the Bill.  We have tabled a number of amendments, most of which have been suggested by environmental groups, which should give the Green Party pause for thought in its support for the Bill.  Those groups have described the Bill as shocking and the Green Party would have worked with these people closely.  Perhaps its Deputies will explain why many of the people they have campaigned and worked with over many years believe this Bill to be retrograde and in need of being radically amended.  It is not the legislation we need to develop an environmentally sustainable and genuinely economically beneficial forestry sector in this country.</p></speech>

At the foundation of the State, there was less than 1% forest cover and today that figure is over 10%.  Whereas past policies were in place to create rural employment, the current model is creating permanent cover and allowing biodiversity and recreational facilities for communities across the country.</p>  <p>  Mr. William Bulfin wrote in 1907 that "the problem of deforestation is tragically eloquent of the evils of foreign rule in Ireland".  We lost 90% of our natural forest cover and by 1923 our founding legislators inherited an exhausted forestry industry.  In spite of this, and beginning from 1% cover, an afforestation programme planted 388 ha in that first year, accelerating to 10,000 ha in the 1960s and beyond.</p>  <p>  Today through modest means we have restored our cover to over 10%.  Se&aacute;n MacBride's afforestation policies in the 1948 inter-party Government played a large role in this forestry restoration, meeting the coverage Ireland had some 400 years ago.  Notwithstanding the approvals and environmental protocols that must be met when procuring Irish timber, the following are just some of the benefits coming from our forestry sector: there are 12,000 rural jobs working with a locally grown and sustainable construction material; forestry is a carbon sink, currently sequestering 312 million tonnes of carbon, while it also purifies water and prevents soil erosion; and trees can be a biofuel and they produce oxygen.</p>  <p>  Education is paramount to secure and sustainable forestry.  Dr. Annette Harte, a structural engineer from NUI Galway, has played a vital role with many other stakeholders in the research into the use of home-grown timber in the construction sector.  Considering we have a multigenerational knowledge vacuum in the procurement of timber construction methodologies, her pioneering work is fundamental to the future of Irish forestry and its production of timber in the construction sector.  There is a growing international movement to build sustainably, and the use of timber will meet the criteria of reducing embodied carbon in our built environment.</p>  <p>  Countries all over the world are legislating with "wood first" policies in public procurement.  South Dublin County Council was the first and only local authority to pass unanimously a "wood first" motion in 2017 with the intention of setting example and promoting the use of timber in the construction sector.</p>  <p>  The State must ensure that the sector protects rural communities and the environment they live in.  Modern policies are evolving, creating an holistic approach to our forestry and taking account of local jobs, amenities, biodiversity and climate.  It is also of paramount importance that we create a more sustainable building sector where we can build sustainably and safely, learning from current international paradigms.</p></speech>

The position with delayed applications and appeals was allowed to fester by the previous Government and it really needs to be tackled so we can get planting and felling moving once again.</p>  <p>  The supply of timber has been dwindling and jobs are very much at risk locally.  For example, in Lissarda people have been put on a three-day week and many harvesters have been parked throughout the summer around me.</p> <p>The vast bulk of farmers would plant less than 10 ha.  They have been waiting for approval to plant and are very concerned that the season will slip away from them.  I also draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that planting is not equally distributed throughout the country.  There are large tracts of plantations in many areas, such as north and west Cork.  The Minister of State needs to look at ways to distribute planting much more widely across the country so the same areas are not planted more and more intensively.</p> <p> T&aacute; an Bille seo d&iacute;rithe ar an gc&oacute;ras achomhairc foraoise a fheabhs&uacute;.

Tomorrow, the first Thursday in October, is Tetra Pak Tree Day.  This Bill does not come a moment too soon.  Forestry is a crop which needs to be planted and harvested in a timely manner.  Our forestry industry is in crisis.  The logjam in the licensing system and the appeals process is causing significant damage to the whole sector.  This has dragged down the afforestation rate and put severe pressure on timber supplies.  Those considering investing are turning away from forestry and towards other options because of the long delays in processing licences.  The industry directly employs 12,000 people in rural Ireland and contributes &euro;2.3 billion per annum to our economy.  It also absorbs 3.8 million tonnes of CO2 every year.  This is a significant carbon sink.  If we do not increase our afforestation rate to at least 15,000 ha per annum, we will face increased fines for greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>  The forestry sector in County Clare is vibrant.  Forestry makes an enormous contribution to Irish society, the Irish economy and our environment.  One of the biggest concentrations of forestry in the country is in the Slieve Aughty Mountains in north-east Clare.  Some 55,000 acres of significant forest are planted on public and private landholdings throughout County Clare.  At present, some sawmills are having to resort to importing raw materials to survive.  This crisis puts our entire forestry sector at risk of importing dangerous insects and infections such as the bark beetle.  We are all aware of the damage that ash dieback has done to ash species in this country.  There are several other issues which I would like to raise with the Minister of State, but due to time constraints I cannot do so.  I ask her to bring her new forestry policy to this House and arrange a debate as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I will conclude with three short questions.  Will the new regulations be published within days of the enactment of this Bill?  How many additional staff will be recruited for the forestry appeals committee?  Have these vacancies been advertised?</p></speech>

After reading this Bill, many of us feel the need to follow him there.  The appeals process outlined here, to which we in Sinn F&eacute;in have proposed many amendments, seems in many ways to be contrary to the Aarhus Convention's provisions on the citizen's access to justice.  The appeals process outlined is unnecessarily closed, patriarchal and internally focused.  It is exclusive instead of inclusive.  It is a remnant of the old politics, carried out over the heads of the community rather than with its involvement.  It is reminiscent of the afforestation which makes too many communities feel they live in the shadow of the forest rather than in its shelter.  I do not say this to be negative.  I am trying to be helpful.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to help.  We want to get right the overall planting process and the appeals process which we are addressing today, and we can do so.  If we work together on this we can achieve a much better result for forestry, communities and modern political and administrative transparency.</p>  <p>  The cost of appeals alone is prohibitive.  I know that the Minister of State will agree that a citizen's access to justice and appeal should never be reliant on capacity to pay.  I make a special appeal to the Minister of State to exempt environmental NGOs from fees, particularly as many of these NGOs are home to members of her party, from whom I am sure she is hearing the same request.  The right type of forestry has the capacity to transform our communities for the better, as does the right kind of appeals system.  Trees that were grown well into the 21st century cannot be bound by a system of planning and licensing that did its best and worst work in the 20th century.  We need more synergy here.  We need a forestry appeals process that comes from a sense of collaborative flourishing, that gives to counties and communities rather than withholding from them.  The appeals process in this Bill falls a long way short of what is needed.  I urge the Minister of State to pay close attention to the amendments Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed and to do the right thing.</p></speech>

It is very necessary and I commend the speed with which the Minister of State has brought it forward in her short time in office.  The forestry industry as we know it is in dire straits.  I come from the constituency of Galway East, a rural area with a lot of forestry.  We also have sawmills and a huge number of people employed in the construction industry.  I have received a lot of correspondence from builders' providers, building contractors, sawmills and farmers about the stagnation of the forestry industry.  The jobs created by the forestry industry are regional and local jobs.  These jobs are under serious threat.  Starting from today, there is a waiting time of years to get an appeals process under way.  This Bill is to be welcomed for that reason.  That said, once the legislation passes through the D&aacute;il, action must be taken and the resources must be put in place to process the licence applications of those who wish to grow forests and those who wish to fell trees and build roads.  We need to see forestry developed in a timely manner.</p> <p>We need to put confidence back into the industry.  We must ensure that we have continuity of supply such that people understand that when they are looking for timber, they will be able to get it.  I know of a farmer who sold some of his cattle because he was going to plant part of his land.  He is awaiting a licence to do so.  He will miss the opportunity to plant it this year.  He has no income from that land and, as he told me yesterday evening as he walked through it, it is going wild because he cannot do anything with it.  That type of situation should not be tolerated.</p> <p> On the other side of things, it is important that we ensure the appeals process is fair to those who wish to make appeals.  We must also ensure that, whatever we do, we do not lose sight of the fact that people have a right to make a submission on any kind of planning application.  However, that needs to be done in a way that is sustainable in order that people can still conduct their business and ensure the industry thrives, as it can and should.</p> <p> I look forward to the new Minister of State bringing forward policy relating to afforestation.  I visited County Leitrim last year to see first hand how over-intensification of forestry has nearly destroyed a county.  As a Deputy stated earlier, we need to have balance.  Life is a balancing act.  The Minister will be charged with the objective of ensuring we have a balanced forestry industry which will be good for people.  It will be good for workers, sawmills, the environment and the land.  We need to ensure that the policies that are put in place, and the rules and regulations that are put around them, are balanced.  There must be balance in terms of the number and type of trees that are grown and the locations in which they are grown such that they are spread across this lovely island.  We must ensure that people who wish to object do so in a balanced way.  That is what everybody is seeking.</p> <p> I do not think there are barons involved in the forestry sector.  The sawmills in my constituency and county and those in County Roscommon are family-run businesses.  The haulage businesses are family run by people of farming stock.  Those who cut down the trees are local people, as are those who sow the trees.  This is a vital component in the regeneration of the rural and regional areas of Ireland.  We must do it with the tools we have.  Forestry is one of those tools and I am quite confident the Minister of State will use it to the best of her ability to ensure we have a balanced and growing forestry sector.  We do not wish to import anything, particularly diseases from other countries.</p></speech>

It is a very important business sector for the south east.  We have companies such as Medite in Clonmel and SmartPly in Waterford which provide MDF and cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternatives to tropical plywoods for use in structural and non-structural applications.  Those two companies directly employ more than 320 workers and support more than 500 additional jobs indirectly.  They also support downstream processes in Cork and Carlow, particularly sawmills.  They operate in a highly sustainable way, purchasing timber from across the 26 counties.  They use biomass from their processing waste to provide energy to the plant.  Timber from the west of Ireland is ferried by rail network to Waterford, augmenting the Irish Rail freight business and its overall bottom line.  They operate a low carbon footprint and a circular system in sustainability.  They continue to innovate in their product mix to provide ever more durable and environmentally sustainable product lines and some of their pressed board has displaced traditional tropical plywood, given its superior insulation and strength qualities.</p>  <p>  The forestry industry in Waterford and elsewhere in the south east is made up of vibrant indigenous manufacturers.  These companies, along with their downstream processes, are committed to supporting a mix of sustainable afforestation in the region.  That supports economic need, but it also dovetails with the social, community and amenity values of traditional forest and woodland areas.  Like any manufacturing business sector, these business entities depend on a secure pipeline of raw materials of the required standard and grade.  They need to be able to access timber of the required quality to continue to produce the high value product on which customers rely.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill and hope that it will lead to the forestry appeals committee being resourced to be efficient, provide for the streamlining of appeals for felling and planting and for the protection of roads and support the issues relating to replanting, which has become very difficult and uneconomic.  I hope it will provide industry supply chain visibility, the lack of which is an impediment to commercial growth and economic development.  In essence, I hope it will make the system significantly more efficient and transparent and enable the planting of the right trees in the right areas, as well as building a vibrant timber sector, protecting rural jobs and the economy and providing operational clarity on the appeals committee.  Ultimately, it must result in an increased number of felling and planting licences.  I hope we will see an economic dividend in the future forest policy and that it will integrate closely with the climate policy espoused by the Government.</p></speech>

The aim is to increase that percentage to 18%.  That growth is significant and needs a proper legislative framework in place to support it.</p>  <p>  The forest industry transport group was formed in 1999 and reflects the significance of transport in the sector.  There are 97,600 movements annually, or approximately 390 haulage movements per day.  The forest industry transport group was formed to facilitate communication on matters relating to timber transport.  Very detailed guidelines were drawn up to advise on all matters relating to forestry transport.  The guide aimed to develop a partnership approach for the management of round timber transport to ensure the activities are carried out in an environmentally sustainable and economically viable manner.  It also assists local authority roads managers, timber haulage managers, forest owners and agents on how to resolve timber transport issues.</p>  <p>  Forests are mainly located on roads that have not been strengthened.  It is frequently a challenge left to the haulier or transport operator to survey the roads and adapt equipment to suit the terrain.  This can mean significant cost for the hauliers, usually involving expensive equipment adaptions to ensure maximum weights are carried with minimum impact on the roads.  Round timber is a relatively low-value, high-volume product.  The transport costs can form a significant portion of the delivery costs of round timber, often accounting for as much as 40%.  Vehicle specifications for forestry are often the most expensive to purchase due to the demands incurred as a result of the on-road and off-road terrain.  Specification demands include onboard weighing units, vehicle tracking units, centre tyre inflation and maxi-wide tyres, etc.  These add significantly to all the other requirements.  Many of the vehicles need special permits to operate on public roads.  All of this expense comes on top of what are regarded as normal costs, such as a haulage licence, insurance, vehicle testing and driver training to name just a few.  All the aforementioned expense equates to the huge operating costs of round timber haulage.</p>  <p>  The operators are an integral part of the sector and they are also part of the outrageous situation that has been allowed to develop due to the delay in issuing felling licences.  At no juncture has any thought been given to the financial strife caused to timber hauliers as a consequence of the collapse of the forestry industry.  Why would it be considered necessary to go to such lengths to set up a forest industry transport group to deal with a situation in which they are all but forgotten?  I would like the Minister of State and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to consider that when they are looking at the number of appeals building and building, with the prospect that felling will diminish to the point that there will be no work for these hauliers.  They should consider that a combined outfit on a felling operation includes a harvester costing circa &euro;500,000, a forwarder which will stack the timber and costs circa &euro;400,000 and a truck and trailer at a minimum reserve circa &euro;250,000.  That is more than &euro;1.1 million of equipment that must be purchased before a tree is felled and which will be left sitting idle.  I ask the Minister of State to please consider the hauliers who are financially strained to the pin of their collar.  Anyone with that much skin in the game understands the necessity of the "relevant person" aspect of this legislation.  Anyone listening to these proceedings will understand that too.  Given the impact on all those involved in the sector, I ask the Minister of State please to accept and support the amendment that has been tabled to the section of the Bill dealing with relevant persons.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister of State will look seriously at and accept the amendments that have been put down by the Rural Independent Group because they are put forward with a view to strengthening the legislation and giving greater protection to those in the industry.</p>  <p>  It saddened me to read some time ago where managing directors of several top sawmills in Ireland stated publicly that the only reason they had not run out of logs was because of the unexpected consequences of lockdowns.  Because of the shutdown of builders' merchants and building sites, these sawmills managed to remain open.  Otherwise, their stocks would have run out and their sawmills would have since been closed.</p>  <p>  The forestry industry in Ireland is in crisis.  Indeed, it may be more correct to say that it has gone beyond crisis point at this time.  What makes this crisis all the more frustrating and worrying for those involved in every sector of the industry is that it is a home-grown crisis that needs a home-grown solution.  We have now gone beyond the eleventh hour and are fast approaching the finish line for this industry if action is not taken immediately.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of new forestry licensing procedures in 2019, the processing and issuing of forestry licences have been seriously impacted leading to widespread disruption across the sector.  Currently, felling licence approvals are only at 25% of the required rate.  Consequently, the industry is being starved of necessary supplies.  The potential impact is severe, both financially and with respect to jobs, as sawmills will run out of logs within a frighteningly short time unless the current impasse is resolved as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  This directly threatens jobs in my constituency of Tipperary.  The management of Medite was on to explain the position.  It has 150 employees producing MDF panels for use in construction projects, furniture and many other essential applications in Ireland and around the world.  These jobs are vital to Tipperary.</p>  <p>  It beggars belief that a central part of the licensing process, the forestry appeals committee, has caused significant difficulties.  At present, there are roughly 400 outstanding projects appealed but not yet processed, including planting, felling and roads.  This cannot be tolerated.  Over the space of one week in early August, objectors stalled the production of 100,000 cu. m of timber, enough timber to build 5,000 homes.  At the present rate at which appeals are being processed, it will take 15 months to clear the backlog and the rate of new appeals continues to grow.  Resolving this is gone beyond urgent.  This industry makes a &euro;2.3 billion contribution to the Irish economy and supports 12,000 jobs.  Keeping it running is all the more crucial as the economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic continues.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the vast majority of appeals are lodged by a handful of individuals and target forestry policy generally rather than any specific project.  This issue is severely undermining a fast-growing green industry which provides rural jobs, contributes to climate action, facilitates tourism and recreation and produces technologically advanced timber and biofuel products.</p>  <p>  The current impasse is having wide-reaching consequences.  Farmers in Tipperary and across the country are unable to clear and free up their land.  They cannot harvest the trees.  As they have invested over the past few decades, they are losing out on millions of euro in valuable income in their farm enterprises.</p>  <p>  This impasse threatens to cause problems and disruption to the country's pallet manufacturing sector.  This, in turn, will affect exports, the house building sector and the price of housing as well as the hardware stores through the need to import foreign timber.  This importation of foreign timber exposes Ireland to the risk of infestation of damaging bark beetles that may take years to eradicate.</p>  <p>  It is unconscionable that delays in dealing with hundreds of indiscriminate appeals that have the potential to destroy a valuable and indigenous industry and cause widespread redundancies across the industry have not been addressed as a matter of urgency before now.  In fact, for those impacted, it is an unforgivable delay.  This situation should never have reached the point where individuals and groups can hold an entire industry to ransom.  A situation like this must never be allowed to happen again.  That is why strong legislation is required now to ensure something like this can never reoccur in Ireland again.</p></speech>

The industry is in an absolute crisis.  It is unacceptable that mounting issues discussed here today and the ones I will touch on shortly have been allowed to develop to this level of crisis.</p>  <p>  The forestry industry will not even hit 2,000 hectares of planting this year.  This is less than a quarter of the envisaged targets that we need.  Nurseries, timber contractors, planters - the entire industry - are in agreement that forestry works are in a state of complete and utter stagnation.  This is having a massive negative impact on our environment, our economy and our jobs.</p>  <p>  From having spoken to many in the industry affected by these mounting issues as well as my own understanding of how forestry must operate in this country, I do not believe that this Bill will solve all the issues in order to get the industry operational again.  All this Bill will do is fill a pothole when the entire road needs to be resurfaced.  It is a start in getting the forestry licensing process into order, but it is only a start.  Much more action must be taken on top of this.</p>  <p>  Bureaucracy, red tape and a complete disconnect from stakeholders has become the norm in the past number of years.  The people on the ground who know how this industry operates are not being listened to.  There are individuals facing these constant bureaucratic hurdles and this Bill will not facilitate them in getting their industry operating again.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill and I will speak again later on Committee Stage.  It is a start and, hopefully, it will speed up the appeals process and get the appeals dealt with much faster.  However, the licensing structure that is operating in forestry at present is dysfunctional and it needs to be addressed urgently.</p></speech>

It has been stifled and brought to its knees, as I stated earlier.</p><p>We also must look at serial objectors in relation to other planning issues right across the country.  We must be bold.  We must say enough is enough and that they should not have the authority to do this.  We must look meaningfully at how our planning laws are interpreted and practised because the challenges that are out there are grave.</p><p>This Bill is to be welcomed, but we must look at forestry in the round.  We must look at the new issues - the issues that have been discussed.  I hope to discuss it later tonight on Committee Stage.</p><p>There are many issues in forestry.  We have brought it to its knees.  Many people who have considerable skin in the game have been tied up.  It is necessary that we move forward with this legislation as a matter of urgency and more to follow to ensure that we have a proper functioning industry.</p></speech>

Most of us here would agree that it is an issue which is not going away.  Whatever legislation is put forward, good or bad, is useless without resources.  The industry employs 12,000 people, mostly in rural areas.  It is worth &euro;2.3 billion.  It highlights the Government's lack of understanding of rural Ireland.  It does not get it and does not have a plan.</p>  <p>  We need to look at what can be done to try to resolve the crisis in forestry.  Many sawmills are coming to a standstill because of what is happening.  As someone who comes from an urban background, I am often told that I do not know much about forestry, but my constituency is surrounded by forest.  The Minister noted the role that urban representatives can play around forestry.  We can encourage more plantation in our parks and there is the concept of the stepping stone forest which is good for ecosystems and helps to harmonise our environment.  That is something the Minister could look at outside this legislation.  We need to start doing things differently.</p>  <p>  Irish forestry policy is in dire need of an overhaul.  Sitka spruce, a non-native species, is the most commercially profitable species and is planted across the State, often making up 100% of plantations.  That should not happen.  Their canopy blocks out all sunlight and creates a monoculture with no birds or wildlife to be found.  Current afforestation policy aims to plant 30% broadleaf trees to address this.  I would argue that proportion ought to be increased.  I appreciate there is a commercial necessity to plant Sitka spruce but we are turning hundreds of hillsides and acres of land here into barren wastelands.</p>  <p>  Many Irish growers of healthy saplings have been forced to shred thousands of good planting trees because of a lack of demand.  It is criminal we are allowing this to happen.  We need someone to act as an advocate and stop this.  It is crazy that healthy trees are being destroyed because there is nowhere to plant them, considering the impact they could have on our environment and our carbon footprint.  Ireland has an opportunity to plant thousands or even millions of trees.  The impact this would have on our carbon footprint alone is worthy of pursuit.  While this Bill does not seek to change forestry policy, it is a conversation that needs to be had.</p>  <p>   The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the previous Government seemed to think that reforming the appeals process was not worth his attention.  Now we are forced to introduce emergency legislation.</p></speech>

As others have said, the Minister in the last Government, Deputy Creed, ignored everything to do with agriculture and rural Ireland.  He would not deal with the beef barons and other issues.  This legislation is an effort but it is feeble and a little inept.  We have tabled many amendments to try to strengthen the Bill, and I thank Brian in our office for putting them together.  I hope the Minister of State will not reject amendments that are well meant, as she did in the Seanad.  We understand rural Ireland.  We are all from rural Ireland.  I am not being anti-Dublin.  We have no issue with Dublin people.  As Deputy Crowe said, there should be more planting in parks.  Beyond that there is a huge housing crisis.  I hear Deputy Boyd Barrett and everyone else talking about that every day, but we do not have the timber to roof the houses.  We are importing it from Russia and other places.  It is shocking.</p>  <p>  I salute Medite in Clonmel and Smartply in Waterford for their excellent skills and the employment they provide, as well as the excellent use they make of the finished product.  They have come on in leaps and bounds.  Pat Beardmore is the manager in the Medite plant.  They provide 300 jobs between them.  At the moment, the sector is grinding to a halt - it is below its knees - because of objections.  The Department must take some responsibility because it has not dealt with it fast enough.  As I said yesterday, the tree huggers started objecting, often from hundreds of miles away.  I have no problem with planning, whether it is planning for a hen house or a Georgian building, because there has to be a process and a right of objection where someone is materially affected with light, roads or anything else, but people hundreds of miles away do not have a right to object and hold up progress.  It is shocking.  There are farmers who planted forests 45 years ago as a pension scheme.  Some of them got grants to do it and some of them planted good land, which is a shame, but they played their part.  Now it is ready to harvest and they are not allowed to cut it.  They are being held up for two years.</p>  <p>  Some forestry contractors have equipment worth &euro;2 million.  They were encouraged to buy it because a far greater output was expected.  We are only at a quarter of the output we should be producing.  Then there are the hauliers and the many sawmills.  I salute Sheehans in Burncourt, O'Gradys in Hollyford and indeed Drohan sawmills in Clonmel, named after the late Frank Drohan, a freedom fighter, which is now run by Junior Pollard.  There are many sawmills, and I have only mentioned a few.  They give employment and are a source of joy especially at this time of year as people order their Santa cribs and playhouses and other goods for Christmas.  They supply an urban market as well as a rural one.  </p>  <p>  This is now complete chaos.  The last Fine Gael Government and its Minister, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il under the confidence and supply agreement, forgot completely about rural Ireland.  One would think none of them lived there.  They abandoned rural Ireland across a plethora of issues, as did successive Governments over the last 15 years.  However, this is a crisis.  We talk about the environment, emissions and what new planting can do but all these people want to do is harvest their crops.  They will be getting contractors in soon and then they can plant anew - and they can look at planting different types of trees - but they cannot cut them.  What other section of society would put up with not being allowed to have their harvest?  We saw what happened with Keelings, which brought people in from abroad in the middle of the Covid lockdown to do its harvest.  We have seen supports for the harvest of corn in different years.  If the harvest is rich the labours are few.  If there is no harvest, industry has nothing.  They are being denied all that.  It is time that the serial objectors are stopped.</p>  <p>  It is worth &euro;2.3 billion to the economy, mostly the rural economy.  I have seen how the forestry sector can build roads better than most county councils, to be fair to them, and could teach the councils a thing or two and they have drainage systems that are impeccable.</p>  <p>  We need to look after the jobs, the farmers and the contractors.  These are people who have made huge investments, including in machinery and trucks.  The sawmills have upgraded their machinery to make the final product for building houses and roofs.  I am doing a renovation myself and the builder has had great difficulty in getting timber.  How are we to build houses if we do not have the materials?  We have the cart put before the horse.  I need honesty, integrity and openness with this legislation.  We need a review mechanism that will allow us to see how it is working after six months.  This cannot come fast enough to allow these people to breathe.  Some of them have sick siblings or spouses, and they want to pay their pension scheme.  We should remember that these farming and business people are denied the fair deal.  We cannot be kicked all the time because we need to be allowed to live.  We will generate the work, employ people and improve the economy.</p></speech>

Some 12,000 jobs are at risk, all in rural Ireland.</p> <p>Forestry and timber are critical for anyone who cares about rural development and rural jobs.  There are 500 jobs on the line in GP Wood in Enniskeane and its associated companies, where hours are being reduced next month.  Forestry is an industry worth &euro;2.3 billion.  The industry estimates that 2 million tonnes of timber are held up in appeals and the licensing application process in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That is enough timber to build 100,000 houses.  Timber shortages are close at hand.  There will be an immediate problem for Ireland's house building programme when timber starts to run short.  Imports are expensive and difficult to come by, with strong demand for timber worldwide.  GP Wood has managed to source some supplies, which will start arriving next month, but doing so goes against everything GP Wood stands for - shipping across Europe, the environmental impact and supporting jobs outside Ireland.</p> <p> The appeals debacle is holding up many afforestation projects.  Farmers are the collateral damage.  They are stuck in the middle because they cannot plant or harvest.  The Government, including the Green Party, cannot hit its tree planting targets during this situation.  The delays are killing the tree planting programme, with only 2,500 ha to be planted this year even though the Government's target is 8,000 ha per annum.  The impact on our climate change goals is significant.  Tree planting is a key weapon in the fight against climate change.  The difference will be millions of tonnes of CO2 left in the atmosphere because trees have not been planted to soak it up.</p> <p> We need to be using more wood.  The way to get it is to plant our own forests and stimulate more wood usage in our built environment.</p> <p> It is critical that the forestry appeals committee, FAC, legislation be implemented quickly and backed up by resources.  The Department must be ready and able to implement the reforms contained in the Bill immediately upon its approval by the Oireachtas.  There can be no delays in making that happen.  Will the Minister of State assure us that it is under way and will be in place in the coming days?  The fee is a critical aspect and must be introduced immediately.  The Minister must ensure that all necessary resources are in place in the FAC to make the reforms work.  The legislation is no good unless people are hired to enable an increase in the FAC's output.  We understand that the FAC is in the process of hiring additional personnel.  It is critical that this happen immediately and that the numbers are sufficient.  An extra ten people are needed.  The FAC should target getting through at least 20 appeals per week instead of the current 20 appeals per month.</p> <p> The concept of the FAC meeting in division is critical.  Running multiple divisions in parallel will achieve the necessary throughput.  The other important reform is the removal of an automatic right to an oral hearing.  The FAC should decide that oral hearings are only required in a small minority of cases.</p> <p> In the longer term, we need to move away from this forestry licensing system and change the regulatory model.  It should not be necessary to apply for a new licence at each stage of the process.  Doing so is a waste of time and resources and inhibits the sector's development.  In other countries, there is a greater reliance on forestry management plans that are approved, implemented and monitored.  It is a much more efficient system.</p> <p> Our Department has failed the industry badly.  The industry is coming through the Covid-19 crisis well, yet it is being damaged by our own failure to provide an adequate regulatory platform.  Without the right platform, the industry cannot grow and prosper.  Like many colleagues, I am disgusted to think that people as far away as Dublin can object to a forestry being felled in west Cork even though they do not know what they are on about or where the place even is.  There must be some kind of reform to stop that happening, and I hope that our amendments to that effect will be accepted.</p></speech>

Rural Ireland has been forgotten about.  Not only have Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in now learned this through Covid, but they are all roaring "Rural Ireland".  Since the Government's formation, 83% of those Members have mentioned rural Ireland in their contributions.  Before the Government's formation, no one mentioned rural Ireland except the Independents and one or two other parties in the D&aacute;il.  All Governments have forgotten about rural Ireland.  Now, Covid has told the Members in question that rural Ireland is what has been putting food on their tables.  They need to listen to us because we have the experience.</p>  <p>  The Bill is completely out of date.  My constituency office is inundated with people who are frustrated at being unable to source timber.  Timber is needed for building new houses and extensions, farm improvements, maintenance and many other projects.  Hardware stores and building providers are unable to purchase timber from their suppliers.  In fact, people are now ordering timber 12 weeks before they undertake projects.</p>  <p>  The Bill's aim is to make the forestry appeals system more efficient and reduce the FAC's backlog of appeals.  Licences need to be issued in order to plant and harvest trees and build roads.  There is a backlog of 1,850 applications with the forest service, of which only 25% are currently being processed.  Some 12,000 jobs are at risk in the forest industry.  The FAC is being deliberately swamped by appeals, which is creating a large backlog.  Everyone has a right to appeal, which is welcome in a democracy, but most of these appeals are being lodged by a small handful of individuals who are deliberately targeting the forestry appeals system as opposed to local projects.</p>  <p>  This issue severely undermines the issues of climate action, tourism, recreation and biofuel.  The forestry industry is worth &euro;2.3 billion to the economy.  We are importing timber from Norway, Sweden, Russia and Scotland.</p>  <p>  This situation needs to be changed, serial objectors need to be stopped and the Government needs to listen to the people of rural Ireland because we know what we are talking about.</p></speech>

I have consistently highlighted it through the tabling of a Topical Issue matter last year and many parliamentary questions.  I am a Deputy from Laois-Offaly, where forestry is a large sector that creates considerable employment and supports our rural and, indeed, regional economies.  I have been in contact with many frustrated employers, forestry workers and farmers who want this issue sorted.  It has gone on for too long, and we must ensure that we have a robust system in place.</p>  <p>  Clearly, this is a major sector and anything that happens within it that destabilises the internal licensing process will have serious and detrimental side effects.  I was dismayed to hear that the "relevant person" provision in the Bill might have been removed.  That is shocking.  This provision would prevent continual objections from people who live 300 miles away and do not know anything about rural Ireland or the rural economy.  If it is the case that it has been removed, then we will need to insert a similar safeguard to ensure that the chaos being caused in the forestry sector by objections does not recur.  Those objections have become ludicrous.  There are too many.  At the current rate at which appeals are being processed, it will take 16 months to clear the backlog.  In one day in early August, objectors stalled the production of 100,000 cu. m of timber, enough to build 5,000 homes.  This issue will affect the construction sector significantly if it is not sorted out and robust safeguards are not put in place.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the majority of appeals are lodged by a small handful of individuals who target forestry policy generally rather than any specific project.  I am calling for something to be done in this regard.  We accept that people have the right to appeal, but we do not accept that they have the right to disrupt and obstruct people in their work.  It stands that this could damage the rural economy.  Currently, 12,000 jobs are at serious risk.</p></speech>

This means that, before the Bill can have any impact, the Minister needs to make a commencement order.  Sometimes, an Act is commenced all in one go, but it is quite common for an Act to be commenced on a phased basis, in other words, in dribs and drabs.  A delay to the commencement of this legislation is the last thing that the industry needs at present.</p>  <p>  The enactment would not be an end in itself, only the beginning, because a number of issues need to be addressed immediately.  First, once the Bill has been enacted, the Minister needs to move immediately to bring it fully into force.  Second, there needs to be a speedy appointment of appeals officers to the FAC.  Third, the FAC needs to organise itself into divisions quickly.  Fourth, progress on reducing the volume of appeals currently before the FAC needs to be made quickly.</p> <p>Fifth, we need to see the introduction of an appeals fee under the new section 14F of the 2001 Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Bill.  As everybody knows, serious fees must be applied to prevent the whole practice of misusing the appeals system.</p> <p> It is quite clear that the existing appeals process has indeed been misused.  There is no doubt about that, as I highlighted two weeks ago during my speaking time on Leaders' Questions.  It is important that the FAC be able to function effectively.  All too often, the appeals process has been used by appellants for purposes that are not directly linked to what is happening in a particular forest.  The provisions in the new section 14B of the 2001 Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Bill, would introduce a requirement for an appellant to set out very clearly the grounds on which his or her appeal is based, spell out the link between the grounds of appeal being stated by the appellant and the licensing decision that is being appealed, and set out precisely what his or her interest is in making an appeal in the first instance.</p> <p> My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group have worked diligently to set out the amendments we feel need to be made to the Bill.  I hope they will be looked at in a sensible, intelligent and fair way and that they will, if at all possible, be accepted.  They are brought forward on behalf of forest owners, hauliers, timber dealers, millers and the end users of forestry, who include the hardware store owners who sell timber and the builders, farmers and other people who buy it.  It is totally ridiculous that at a time when we are talking about reducing our carbon footprint, we have farmers producing timber in Ireland who cannot sell it or get it to the mills and, at the same time, timber is bring brought into the country from as far away as Russia.  Ireland is a country that can grow timber better, faster and quicker than it can be done elsewhere but we are importing it from Russia.  It does not make any sense.  I plead with the Minister to take our amendments into account.</p></speech>

I know only too well what has gone on with forestry in the past two years.  It is the total height of blackguarding.  I have raised this issue several times on the Order of Business and at every chance I got over the past couple of years.  I could see what is happening coming.  We are very near to a situation where the sawmills will close, the hauliers will stop working, the harvesters of the forests will have nothing to do and the planters will have no ground to plant on.  What is going on is the height of blackguarding.  People are appealing from as far away as 200 miles, with no connection at all to forestry or to the felling licence they are appealing against.</p>  <p>  What happened in the first place is that farmers and Coillte planted marginal lands and got grants to do so from the Government of the day, which was proper and right.  It was marginal land that was fit for nothing else.  This had the effect of creating income for the State and for the landowners and the lands were replanted.  However, the whole thing has been at a standstill for the past two years and it is now coming to a head.  If action is not taken, 1,200 jobs will be lost and &euro;2 billion could be taken out of the economy.  When I am in Kilgarvan, all the lorries are travelling westwards, bringing products that are costing people money.  The only lorries I see going eastwards are the forestry lorries, which are creating an income for people, and the fish lorries, which we talked about last night.  There are also farmers taking cattle from the Kenmare mart through the town and eastwards.  If we are not careful, we will lose the forestry industry because farmers will have to decide, before planting land again, whether they will be able to fell it.  They have to put up with all the nuisances such as deer, badgers and foxes that are coming out of this forestry but they cannot cut it down and realise the income to which they are rightly entitled.  There are places like Clondrohid, Enniskeane, Palfab Limited, Grainger's in Clonmel and MEDITE in Clonmel, all of which could close down.  All the lorries we see on the roads taking the timber to the sawmills will be no more.</p>  <p>  I am appealing to the Minister not to rush the Bill through and to take our amendments into account.  We must be sure the legislation is adequate to deal with the blackguarding that is going on.  I get very hurt and annoyed when I hear Dublin Deputies interfering and meddling in something they know nothing at all about.  I appeal to the Minister to take our amendments on board.</p></speech>

As I am sure she is well aware, the whole area of forestry is one fraught with difficulties at many different levels.  In my view, the major contributory factor to the current difficulties is that we do not have a proper forestry policy.  We have generous tax-free incentives and grants, so much so that we had to apply to the European Commission for permission to offer them under the state aid rules.  It was the Commission which insisted that 30% of the planting should be of native trees.  However, in Ireland, we follow the money, not the policy, and that always means some people are discriminated against while others are advantaged.</p>  <p>  I represent Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and north Roscommon, where forestry is a very contentious issue, especially in Leitrim.  We have a situation where forestry grants have increased the price of land out of the reach of local farmers, who cannot afford to buy it for agricultural use and must watch it passing over to others, many of whom are not from the county.  Indeed, no bank in Leitrim would give money to a farmer to purchase land for agricultural purposes because the price is artificially high.  In many instances, local people are being pushed out of their own home place while the Sitka marches across the county consuming townlands and parishes in its path.  Leitrim has the highest percentage of planting in Ireland, at 30%, much of it Sitka.  Instead of promoting agroforestry and native species, instead of ensuring we have a proper spatial forestry plan, instead of engaging farmers and communities in the process, we have thrown money at the issue.  That is one of the main reasons we are where we are today.  We are also here because when we transposed the environmental impact assessment directive, we did not put in place the structures, supports and resources necessary to ensure its implementation.  There is nothing new in that.  We have a proud tradition in Ireland of doing that type of thing.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a reasonable attempt at dealing with the logjam of appeals.  It ensures a right of appeal for people, and I support the Minister of State in that.  I have submitted a few amendments, the most important of which proposes that the persons appointed to the FAC have the knowledge, experience and requisite skills to deal with appeals in an efficient, timely and fair manner.  The process needs to be speeded up because sawmills and timber-processing enterprises are on their knees.  We are importing timber from countries that have the same regulations in place as we do.  That is just crazy.  When the Bill is passed, there must be an immediate start on drawing up and implementing a forestry policy.  I look forward to co-operating with the Minister of State in that regard.</p></speech>

The reckless comments from certain Deputies today in this regard are unacceptable.  There is absolutely no evidence presented to us in the D&aacute;il that serial objectors are a problem.  The irony is not lost on me that the day the Minister of State published this Bill was the same day the Supreme Court published its judgment in favour of Friends of the Irish Environment and quashing the climate mitigation plan.</p> <p> I represent Galway West.  It is a rural community with the city also.  I am completely behind a sustainable industry.  The Government commissioned Jim Mackinnon CBE, to review the forestry licence process.  He reported back in 2019 and his report has not been mentioned by the Minister in her speech or by a single Deputy here today.  Mackinnon said in his report: "If these principles are put into practice, this should go a considerable way to creating a vibrant, confident and sustainable forestry industry which enjoys support, not just across the sector, but from community and environmental groups who can benefit and take pleasure from a more diverse woodland cover in Ireland."  I fully support that.  This is the expert who was commissioned by the last Government.  In addition, we have declared a biodiversity emergency and a climate emergency.  Mackinnon, who was commissioned, set out for us the issues, then set out the recommendations and then set out the steps forward, with two steps forward.  Time precludes me from going into the details but there is specific onus on the Government to do something, to have a meeting by March 2020, and that the forestry programme implementation group would be the forum in which to push the programme ahead, with a second one.</p> <p> On the issues raised on the report, none of them had to do with serial objectors.  In a week where we have listened to demands from the media, which I agree with, that a report should be based on facts, and when last night we had the most despicable so-called debate between the President of the United States of America and hopefully the future President of the United States of America, then it is difficult that in this instance facts do not appear to come into it.  Inadvertently, we are doing the same in this D&aacute;il.</p> <p> We need a vibrant forestry industry.  I am acutely aware of the value of this to rural areas.  I am acutely aware that 12,000 jobs are involved and if we were doing it right there should be a lot more.</p> <p> The Minister, Senator Hackett, came to the House yesterday with her speech and failed to mention Mackinnon.  I do not wish to be personal in any way.  I appeal to her as Green Party Minister to show leadership and not to get entrapped with the Department, which is really under pressure.  I am not saying it is under pressure; the Mackinnon report says it is under pressure.  Let us consider what Mackinnon identified as problematic.  He said: "Significant hurdles remain if the Irish Government's planting target is to be met [and that the] perceived lack of political priority given to forestry is a major concern."  I repeat again there is a lack of political commitment and priority.  The report also said that there is an overarching need for a statement on the Government's policy on forestry and that forestry should not be the "sole preserve" of one Department.  Of the Department, Mackinnon said: "Low morale has become endemic and more resources, along with improvements to iFORIS, could help restore this".  The report recommends additional inspectors and said that inspectors feel isolated and not sufficiently supported, that concerns of many Inspectors over increasing and more complex workload are accepted and that perceived complexities over compliance with the Habitats Directive were consistently raised.  It was also noted that there were not enough pre-planning meetings, there were inadequate applications by those putting in an application and on many occasions the applications were not sufficient.  The list goes on and on.  Mackinnon recommended better consultation, pre-planning meetings and so on.</p> <p> The Minister then comes to the House with a Bill that feeds into a narrative that objectors are the cause when repeatedly Governments have failed to put in resources to help those in the Department to do the job properly and have failed to have any feedback or to work on feedback to provide sufficient training.  The Minister comes to the D&aacute;il with that Bill and reduces public participation in the guise of improving the system.  That is completely and utterly false.  I have a great difficulty with that in the week that is in it.  Tomorrow is plant a tree day.  We will tell children and schools of the State to plant a tree.  In 120 years we have gone from 2% to 11%.  That is some progress is it not: 9% in 120 years.</p> <p> We have set up a system that is geared to fail and when it fails we do not look at why it fails; we blame people who put in submissions.  On what do we base this?  There are no figures in the Minister's speech and no figures from any Deputy who spoke here today who referred to serial objectors.  I understand the appeals are as low as 1%.  There are different types of appeal, which the Minister would know better than I.  There are appeals with regard to afforestation, felling or aerial spraying, for example.  There has been no breakdown or analysis whatsoever.</p> <p> At this point I ask the Minister to walk out of her imprisonment in the Department.  Let us help the Department to do its job right.  I cannot think of any better way to put it than to say the Minister cannot see the forest for the trees in this situation.  The Government is blaming the wrong people.  I ask that the Minister goes back to the Supreme Court judgment.  I welcome that Friends of the Irish Environment had the courage to take the Government to court to get the mitigation plan quashed.  Repeatedly the Supreme Court, the High Court and all the other courts have pointed to the importance of the trinity in planning laws: the authority, the developer and the public.  Without the public we would have absolutely no declaration of climate change and no recognition of biodiversity.  For the Minister to stand here is doubly duplicitous and it is disingenuous to allow the blame fall on objectors.  I ask the Minister to correct that in her statement.  I ask her to stand up to Deputies who are taking the easy way.  I am standing up for my rural area and I believe in a vibrant and sustainable woodland forestry policy.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to read the Mackinnon report to see what he said in his 21 issues, 26 recommendations and the two steps forward.  Only one point in the report relates to introducing fees.  It is also disingenuous to say the Bill is aligning with the planning process.  Planning has a whole set of laws and an independent appeals board.  The Minister is not doing that here.</p></speech>

I believe that Clare is one of the most afforested counties given the proportion of the county and the size of forestry there.  I have invited the Minister to my home town of Scarriff to see Sliabh Aughty, to which I have not yet received a reply.  I look forward to the courtesy of a reply.  One can travel from Scarriff to Gort, which is about 25 miles give or take, and from Gort over to Loughrea which is another 25 miles, and back to Scarriff, and one sees mainly forestry.  I was in Cappaghabaun recently, which is a townland at the foothills of Sliabh Aughty, about which is a huge plantation.  A farmer said to me one could go from there to Gort and not see a single person.  There is lots of forestry but that forestry is dead.  There is no life in that forestry.  Yes it is a cash product and yes that product does need to be harvested at some point, but we also need to ensure that never again will we have tracts of land planted like that for very little benefit to anybody who lives nearby.</p>  <p>  There was once a chipboard factory in Scarriff.  It ceased production in December 2010 and pulled out completely shortly thereafter.  Notwithstanding having this huge amount of forestry on our doorstep, almost no benefit accrues to the local community.  Coillte owns a large amount of it, some is privately owned, but in any event very little benefit accrues to the local community.  It is not surprising in those circumstances that people would object to afforestation of that type and on that scale.  I completely sympathise with that.  I believe that farmers need to be able to plant their land and the farmers who have planted their land in good faith need to be able to fell those trees.</p>  <p>  That said, we need to ensure that plantations, and especially what is replanted, is done responsibly and in an environmental and ecological manner and that landowners are incentivised to do so.  We are all aware that if one fells an acre, ten acres or a 1,000 acres it has to be replanted, but there is very little incentive to replant with anything better than monoculture, which is dead.  There is nothing living inside those plantations.  There is very little incentive to replant with anything different or better.  There is very little supervision with what Coillte in particular is doing.  As the water courses of east Clare are being degraded farmers are regularly consulting with each other and are being consulted by Clare County Council about it.</p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister is doing but we do need to strike a balance.</p> <p>This is about balance.  We must make sure that people can make decisions and that decisions are made quickly but also that environmental concerns are taken into account adequately.</p></speech>

I will support this Bill but to be clear, it will not solve the problem.  It might solve the problem with applications going forward but it will not solve the problem of the 2,000 applications that are caught in the trap at the moment.  As the Minister of State is aware, 12,000 jobs are at stake.  In my neck of the woods we have companies like ECC, Murray Timber Group and Masonite Ireland.  All is not well in the timber industry, as has been highlighted by others.  We have got to solve the current logjam affecting 2,500 ha.  Farmers have the right to plant trees on their land if they want to but I know of applications that have been up to 700 days in the system.  While this legislation can be enacted straight away, what will happen to the 2,000 applications in the system at the moment?</p>  <p>  I can give examples of what we are dealing with in terms of the Department.  It is not today nor yesterday that this started happening.  If one looks at the period from 2016 to 2020, we have planted just over 50% of what we said we would plant.  Why?  It is because the Department knew there was a problem but it did not deal with it.  In Mayo, there was brashing to be done and fertiliser to be spread and there was a grant available for same but applicants were waiting three and a half years for a decision from the Department.  I know of an incident in Roscommon where a person gave a road away in part of a plantation to enable a community to get out.  There was an acre to be knocked and the grant was taken from the person.  A return of the money was sought from the person even though the road was given to the council for free.  That is the mentality of the Department with which the Minister of State is dealing.  </p>  <p>  People need to understand that this all started with the habitats directive.  If ports, roads or forestry are within 20 km of an area covered by the habitats directive, they are nailed.  Our current President signed that directive into law in 1997 and it is causing major problems.  The Department has not determined how it can go round the directive.  The same person 40, 30, 20 years ago or now, under the terms of the habitats directive, makes a decision on an application to plant trees but it just does not add up at the moment.  That person cannot screen out an application until it is decided that a different person in the band will get that piece of paper; that it is not the drummer any more, it has to be the guitar player.  There are serial objectors and I, above all people in the world, am no fan of them but people have a right to object.  They have seen the gap that we have left.  Applications are sent in but the person making the decision on them is not suitably qualified to do so.  Every application that goes in has to be screened in whereas if we had a person who is suitably qualified, he or she would conduct an overall analysis and get it out, after which the forestry inspector could deal with it.  Until we decide to do that, we are going nowhere.  The system has to change.  If the Minister of State spent four years watching over a situation where we went from planting 7,000 ha to 2,5000 ha, would she be getting votes in Offaly?  There is a serious problem in the Department and someone has to have the liathroid&iacute; to say so.  We are beating around the bush here about it and if we keep at that, we are never going to solve it.  We have got to face up to the fact that there was a loophole that environmentalists could exploit.  They went for it and they got it.  We have to close that loophole but we will not do so unless properly qualified people are able to screen something in or screen it out.  Let it be screened out straight away, before ever getting into the appeals process.  That is the first part of the process that has to be resolved.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State has an important decision to make today.  Many Deputies have submitted amendments, some of which I would describe as very good.  However, there will be a whisper in the Minister of State's ear by a Department that has failed for the past four years to resolve this issue.  I went to the Department about this three years ago.  I saw this coming even though I am no expert on forestry.  In actual fact, I have problems with it in certain places but the reality is that there will be forestry and farming.  We need the 12,000 jobs and we need the lorries to keep going.  There is a danger now that the pharmaceutical industry will not have pallets on which to ship its goods out.  Yesterday we were lauding our pharmaceutical industry, saying that it was keeping the country going.  That is how serious this is but is the Minister of State going to listen to the whisper in her ear from the Department telling her not to accept the amendment from one or the other Deputy because it is never done in here, the Government has a majority and can drive the Bill through?  What will we drive through?  We will drive through legislation that might solve the problem going forward but we will still have the basket of problems that has been left behind.  The Minister of State has to decide today whether to build a new road and to listen to what people are saying.  We are not saying this just to make up stuff.  We are saying it because we see what is happening on the ground.  We are saying it because we want the industry to move forward.  We do not want to see it on its knees.  The Minister of State has a choice.  She can either consider the amendments and work with Deputies or she can listen to the whisper in her ear from a Department guilty of four years of non-activity and backward steps resulting in a reduction in planting from 7,000 ha to 2,500 ha.  It is not just me saying this - the Department's own figures show it.  The Minister of State should listen to the stories I told about the person who gave the ground and still the Department took the money from them, or the person who wanted to spread fertiliser or do some brashing.  If a Department cannot make a decision in four years, then something must give.  I agree with Deputy Connolly about the Mackinnon report.  I have heard that the procurement has been done but nobody has been appointed.  Can the Minister of State confirm that?  When will somebody be appointed?  In fairness, that report said everything that I am saying and it is the way forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000047#ZZ00300"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing this Bill before the House.  It is urgently needed on two fundamental fronts.  First, we need to promote afforestation, biodiversity, habitats and rewilding and without this urgent legislation, that cannot happen.  The second front, which has probably gotten the most airing here today and rightly so, is the need to save the timber industry which is coming to a crashing halt.</p>  <p>  On rewilding and the planting of trees, the programme for Government, contrary to what has been said previously, is very strong on balanced afforestation, the planting of a much higher percentage of broadleaf species, rewilding and biodiversity.  For example, the programme is strong on supporting community groups to plant native woodland species in their areas.  These are projects that are ready to go across the country but they cannot proceed because of licensing issues.  It is also strong on the planting of trees in urban areas, in our cities and towns.  Community groups and tidy towns committees are coming together all over the country with these fantastic projects and this legislation is needed to support such projects.  We hear many calls in this Chamber for a strong agri-environment scheme or a REPS II and part of that will be the planting of native woodland species that promotes biodiversity, habitats and rewilding.  That will come to a standstill unless we get this legislation through the House.  That is the importance of the Bill  in terms of the balanced approach to afforestation being taken by this Government.</p>  <p>  The second fundamental point is that the timber industry needs this legislative intervention.  As has been stated by almost every contributor, 12,000 jobs are dependent on it.  That is the national picture but if one takes it back to a micro level one can look at GP Wood in Enniskeane, right on the border of my constituency of Cork South-West which employs about 500 people.  In an area encompassing Enniskeane, Ballineen, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Bandon and Coppeen, 500 hundred jobs is absolutely enormous.</p> <p>It is vital but it is struggling, and it is coming to a halt at the moment.  It is being forced to import timber, which has other impacts in terms of carbon footprint, and it is being forced to reduce the hours of employees because of the issue of supply.  This legislation addresses that and it cannot come soon enough.</p> <p> I want to raise an issue which has not been touched on enough in the Chamber.  There is a huge mental health aspect that I feel this legislation addresses.  There are landowners and forestry owners throughout the country who have mature woodland that is ready to be felled.  They are waiting for the income from that, but due to the situation with forestry licensing, they have to wait two or three years, which has a massive impact on their mental health.  This needs to be addressed.</p> <p> We need extra resources in the forestry appeals committee and we need the extra ecologists who are being provided, but we also need this legislation.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on her appointment.  I have always felt that, in any system where there are undue delays in making decisions, justice delayed is justice denied.  Everybody should have the right to object, but decisions should be made speedily.  I know farmers who have been waiting three or four years to fell a small amount of timber that was grown for ecological purposes.</p>  <p>  The second point is that the timber industry is very important.  As has been said many times in the House today, there are 12,000 people employed.  Nationally, we need 3 million cu. m of timber and as a lorry with a trailer contains about 30 cu. m, we can figure out how many truckloads of timber we need.  For the commercial sector, the bread and butter, like barley for making beer, is Sitka spruce, which is needed for the timber milling industry.  We need to have this debate.</p>  <p>  We have to recognise that we have a great climate for growing trees.  Trees grow to maturity here in 30 to 35 years whereas it would take 80 years or more in some of the Scandinavian countries.  Therefore, we have a competitive advantage, and the timber we grow now, due to modern technology, can be made suitable for the construction industry.</p>  <p>  Good work has gone on in the past ten years.  I set up Comhairle na Tuaithe and, since then, there has been a great opening up of forests to rural recreation.  Coillte has done a great job, using it for both rural recreation and for commercial purposes.  However, we need a decision on the felling part of the licence.  I cannot understand why people cannot be given permission to fell, subject to agreement on replanting and with the actual details of that to be agreed.  If we do not do something very fast, the timber industry will come to a halt.</p>  <p>  To give the example of the timber mill near my home, ECC Timber, which is in a very rural area, employs 140 people and 50 to 60 local hauliers draw in timber on a full-time basis.  Other local businesses would employ five to ten people who are dependent on the mill, and outside hauliers and harvesters, including in the forest area, would add another 150 to 200 people.  In other words, this business is the Intel of north Connemara.  To give the Minister of State some idea, the wage bill is &euro;8 million, the contractors are paid &euro;25 million a year, and 20 loads of top-quality timber are exported to Britain every day.  When we look at the socioeconomic effect of this in the area in which I live, which is a very rural area, we see the standard of living there is above the national average.</p>  <p>  We need this issue dealt with immediately.  We then have to look at the proper mix of planting into the future.  In the meantime, however, the house is on fire and the mills are ready to stop.  We need a release of timber for felling and, as I said, we can agree the planting later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000048#AAA00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I welcome that there has been a healthy engagement with the Bill by the Members of the House.  I would reiterate that the purpose of amending the existing legislation is to improve the functioning of the forestry appeals system, a system put in place to facilitate those who wish to make an appeal, that is, to appeal the decision of a Minister in regard to the issuing of a forestry licence.  I believe the proposals in the Bill will provide people with a full and open opportunity to make their views known on forestry projects to an independent and adequately resourced forestry appeals committee.  This will mean timely decisions on such appeals and a fair and just response to applicants and interested third parties alike.</p>  <p>  I note the support I have received in the House for the Bill and I thank those Deputies who have spoken to that.  The concerns of the sector and those who work in it are very real, and this resonates throughout the country.  I appreciate there are concerns about the Bill and I thank those who have engaged in this regard also.  On balance, I am of the view that, taking into account the public consultation exercise and having taken on board certain amendments last week in the Seanad, I have presented a Bill which reflects the majority support expressed but has also addressed the main reservations put forward. </p>  <p>  I will address some of the individual points raised by Deputies.  I welcome the support of my colleague, Deputy Leddin, and agree with his assertion that we need to work with farmers in any future forestry model.  My colleague, Deputy Duffy, gave an eloquent account of forestry in Ireland, the benefits of forestry and its uses in the construction sector.  That "wood first" policy should certainly be rolled out across the country.</p>  <p>  Deputies Aindrias Moynihan and MacSharry highlighted the need for a fairer and more balanced approach to where we plant trees across the whole country, and this was echoed by other Deputies.  I note also the support from the Independent groups.  Deputy Harkin effectively highlighted the concerns about forestry in her constituency, of which I am very aware, and it is something we need to address moving forward. </p>  <p>  I welcome Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan's highlighting of the progressive measures within the programme for Government, as well as the jobs under threat in his constituency.  In addition, his highlighting of the mental health issue raises an important aspect. </p>  <p>  There were specific comments and questions.  Deputy Sherlock yesterday asked specific questions about the regulations, and this was echoed by Deputies Carey, Michael Healy-Rae and others.  It is my intention to introduce the statutory instruments immediately on enactment of the Bill and we are working on that now.  Not all of the regulations listed in section 14E are needed to give effect to the Bill. </p>  <p>  Concerns were raised by many Deputies, including Deputy Fitzmaurice and others, about the backlog in licensing, which in essence is a separate issue to that dealt with in the Bill.  This is something my Department has been addressing in the past 12 months or so, which is before my time.  It has overhauled the assessment process to deal with this, revised the procedure, increased resources, developed training and guidance, and strengthened to a great extent its ecological team, which was where a lot of the delay in this process lay.  The Department now has 14 ecologists whereas, this time last year, it had just one, so that is a significant shift in staff in that area. </p>  <p>  Deputies Connolly and Fitzmaurice highlighted the Mackinnon report.  The Government has committed to appointing an independent chair to oversee the implementation of that report.  I  can assure Deputy Connolly that I have no one whispering in my ear.  I am well able to make my own decisions and I can interpret the Bill.  I am aware of the necessity to get this Bill enacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I know there were concerns about the timing of the Bill and the speed at which it is being pushed through the Oireachtas procedure, and I share that concern.  It is not ideal and it is not a situation I am particularly comfortable with.</p> <p>It is, unfortunately, reflective of the grave circumstances in this sector and of the real risk to many thousands of jobs based in rural areas.  Some may suspect that the industry is calling our bluff and I have seen people call for me to withdraw the Bill entirely but that is not something on which I am willing to gamble.  I am not willing to gamble with those jobs.  I have been on the phone to many distressed farmers and I have heard the concerns of unions.  Farmers have contacted me who are watching diseased trees dying in their plantations and who are unable to do anything about it.  Other farmers contact me to ask why their applications to plant native woodland are not going through, which is because of the delays in the process.  It is absolutely imperative that the Bill be supported and I believe that support is there.  The announcement of the public consultation at the end of July brought about exponential growth in the number of appeals and put more pressure on the system.</p> <p> Some comments were made which do not relate to the Bill but to the wider forestry model.  I take most of those on board.  It is something at which we will be looking very shortly and into the future.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that there is more scope for employment within the sector.  This is again something towards which we need to work, although it is outside the scope of this particular Bill.</p> <p> Some Deputies raised issues as to the independence and competence of the membership of the forestry appeals committee.  These issues were raised yesterday by Deputy Farrell and today by Deputies Cairns and Harkin.  I assure the Deputies that the committee operates totally independently of the Department and that it has the required skill set to discharge its functions.  The current chairperson has significant expertise, experience and competence in matters relating to planning and planning appeals.  We will be extending the membership of the committee, but all members of the committee are required to operate in an independent and impartial manner.  The new members of the committee will be selected based on their range of skills and on their competences in environmental legislation, land use, knowledge of the appeals process and so forth.  Deputies should rest assured that those on the committee will be competent in the relevant areas.  Indeed, the forestry appeals committee can bring in additional expertise if it deems it necessary.  It is always open for the committee to do so.</p> <p> It is welcome to hear that there is overwhelming support for a new model of forestry for Ireland.  That is really positive.  Everyone in politics and some outside of the Oireachtas will be needed to help us design and shape that model.  We will bring on as many as we can.  We will bring with us those communities who have felt left behind so far, and we will address the issues relating to climate action and biodiversity.  It is a really exciting time.  This Bill has been greeted with some contention but it is just one step which is absolutely necessary.  Beyond it, we will have the scope to develop what I hope will be a wonderful model of forestry for Ireland.  This Bill will strengthen the forestry sector which, as many have outlined, is tremendously important in our society.  We will deal with the other challenges very soon afterwards.</p> <p> There is an issue with fees.  The purpose of this legislation is, in part, to align the system with the planning system, in which the charging of modest fees for submissions and appeals is well established.  This provision is Aarhus compliant, as is the Bill.  Deputy Cairns queried the robustness of the legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  This was robustly examined by our legal team and by the Attorney General.  We also consulted the Aarhus unit in the office of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  We are satisfied, therefore, that the Bill and the modest fees, which I indicated would be in the region of &euro;20 for a submission and &euro;200 for an appeal, are compliant with the Aarhus convention.  The fees are not intended to remove people from the process.  It is reasonable to recoup some of the costs of the appeals process.</p></speech>

This cannot keep dragging on.  Any relevant information from either party, the person applying for the licence or the person objecting, would have to be submitted so that everything could be completed within eight weeks.

Instead it seeks to erode the appeals process.  The backlog of appeals has crippled the industry and if, as Deputy Fitzmaurice has suggested, we could get through appeals in a timely manner, it would make a massive difference.  One of my amendments seeks to introduce a statutory obligation for appeals to be heard in a timely manner.  This simple change, which does not redraw the whole system, would resolve the sector's key concerns.</p></speech>

It introduces a statutory provision that appeals must be dealt with within 60 days.  The whole objective of this legislation is to address the backlog in respect of appeals.  It is pointless to bring forward legislation to address a backlog if we do not set a specific target for how long it will take to process applications, such as we see with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities.</p> <p>That is the case with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities with regard to how long it takes for an application to be processed.</p> <p> The reality is that justice delayed is justice denied.  It is the case that the focus of the debate up to now, rightly, has been on the chaos this is causing within the industry.  The Minister of State should look at it from the other side as well.  What about a homeowner who has a plantation going up beside the home?  It takes years for a decision within the licensing process and then further time, a further two years, for an appeal to be decided.  That means the homeowner is left in limbo for four or five years before knowing what will happen beside the home.  No individual should be left in that situation.</p> <p> Our amendment is simple and straightforward.  We are looking to have a clear target set so that every appeal would be dealt with within 60 days.</p></speech>

Section 18 of the Forestry Act 2014 sets out the timeframe within which the Minister and officials are required to make a decision on an initial felling licence application.  The wording of section 18 is loose and, therefore, the timeframe of four months is merely an objective.  It is an aspiration and need not be met.  Therefore, the deadline of four months is not a deadline at all.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the fact that the Bill does much to improve the appeals process, I believe that by not accepting this amendment an opportunity is being missed to more clearly define the time limits that should apply for the consideration of initial applications.  The purpose of the amendment is to replace section 18 of the Forestry Act 2014 and introduce a mandatory eight-week deadline for the making of initial decisions on licence applications.</p>  <p>  There is no reason in the world we should not deal with this situation in the exact same way as we deal with an application for planning permission to a local authority.  In that case, an applicant makes an application.  Then, after eight weeks the applicant is told one of three things.  He is told the application is granted or refused or else he is told the authority is seeking further information or clarification of some aspect of the application.  An applicant would have a statutory time in which to submit the further information requested.  The authority - in this case it is the Department and in the case of my example it was the local authority - would have to come back within a given timeframe.  These would all be statutory due dates.  In other words, people making applications would have a good idea on the day they apply and could gauge when they would know exactly what they were doing.</p>  <p>  That is what Deputy Fitzmaurice and the rest of us are trying to do.  We are simply trying to assist the Minister of State.  There is one thing we want to make clear.  I know that I speak on behalf of virtually everyone in the Chamber - I must put on my glasses to see the Minister of State when I am saying this.  By working this evening with the Minister of State we are not working against her.  We are trying to work with her.  We agree with what the Minister of State is doing.  All we are trying to genuinely do is make a tighter and better Bill when it is finished compared to what it is at present.  We are not criticising what the Minister of State is doing or the work she has done.  All we are genuinely doing is trying to get our amendments accepted by the Minister of State so that we will have a watertight Bill afterwards that we can all be proud of.  That is all we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment is in that spirit.  I put it to the Minister of State that we have to clear this backlog of appeals.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State should give consideration to setting up a farmer's charter, like what has operated in the past for different farm schemes in place.  The charter put strict timeframes in place for payment dates for different schemes.  I sat on the body operating the charter of rights in a previous role and it worked well.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State should look to have such a charter for all licence applications.  A charter of rights could be set down.  There could be a clear timeframe so when an application is made, there would be a timeframe for when an answer had to be got.  The charter of rights body would meet on a regular basis.  It would also have the added benefit that officials operating the system would have to sit before stakeholders and answer questions if dates and timescales were not being met.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give the notion of a charter of rights for stakeholders in the industry consideration.  If the Minister of State is reluctant to put a timeframe in legislation, this could be a way of giving stakeholders confidence that a timeframe would be in place and that officials in the Department would be answerable to stakeholders in the industry.  They would be forced to comply and meet standards.</p>  <p>  We have an industry in crisis.  I have visited nurseries like None-So-Hardy.  It simply cannot survive another year with planting at current levels.  We are not going to hit a fraction of the targets.  We are going to be at approximately 20% or 25% of the planting that we have envisaged in the country and that our nurseries need to stay viable.  Only for the options they have at the moment to plant in Scotland their gates would be closing.</p>  <p>  This is urgent and we have to get it right.  Deputy Fitzmaurice made a point about the licensing process earlier and having ecologists involved at the starting gate when the applications come in.  That has to be done.  I believe we need to bring in a consultant immediately, within a short timeframe, to examine how the whole licensing process is operating.  The Minister of State should bring in a consultant and give him four weeks to come back with a report on how the licensing can be speeded up.  The appeals process is simply one cog in the wheel.  We have a whole draft of applications that have not even gone to the appeals stage.  They are held up in the system.  Farmers are losing faith and are taking other options.  They are not looking at forestry as a viable option because of the amount of delays, paperwork and bureaucracy that arise.</p>  <p>  The licensing system is not working.  The Minister of State is addressing the appeals and I welcome that.  As I said, I urge the Minister of State to look at the charter of rights as a way of putting a timetable in place.  The whole licensing process has got to be addressed because it is simply not working.  Having ecologists at the start when an application is first looked at could be a way of speeding up the process.  I urge the Minister of State to bring in an outside consultant to look at the whole process and come back quickly with a report to the House.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to look at designated land too.  We have to increase our planting acreage in the country.  We have a great deal of land subject to a blanket ban on plantations.  There is evidence that different stages of afforestation in these designated areas would actually improve the habitats.</p>  <p>  The directive from Brussels on designated land has taken away approximately 80% of the capital value of that land.  If we allow that land to be planted in different stages, we could help to restore some of the capital value.  In my time I have never known a directive to have eroded the capital value of land to such an extent.  It is a direct attack on the property rights of landowners.  This could be a way of restoring the capital value and meeting our afforestation targets as well.  By providing a proper compensation scheme for designated land and allowing afforestation in a staged way we could go a long way towards benefiting our environment and the capital value of the land as well as giving farmers a viable enterprise on their land again.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to consider a charter of rights.  It would be a great way of ensuring a timeframe is put in place.  We have to give stakeholders confidence again in this industry.  Timber contractors at the moment are being forced to sell some of their expensive machinery to meet bank repayments.  If this industry is not helped it will disappear.  We have an opportunity now.  This is the first stage in building a block for the forestry industry.  Far more needs to be done.</p> <p>We will get this appeals system correct and then we will have to work on the licensing process.</p></speech>

It is a dangerous rush and it is one that may well lead to people cutting off their nose to spite their face.  I fully understand the anxiety, concern and pressure among small farmers who invested in forestry and who feel the need to gain a return on that investment.  They should certainly be supported, as should people who rely for an income on forestry and investments they made in that regard.</p>  <p>  If, however, proper oversight of the impact of the felling of forests or the planting of the wrong types of forests is thrown out, it will ultimately damage not just the environment but also the conditions, the soil and the environment that allows a living to be made and employment gained.  Of course we need to speed up the appeals process but we have to remember what we are we dealing with.  I understand Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's analogy, and this is not a criticism of him, but building a house, with all the objections and the planning permission that go with it, is one thing; a forest is very different, and particularly a large one.  It has huge implications for the stability of the soil and the mountains, which forests keep up, and for ensuring there is not dangerous, poisonous run-off that affects water and so on.</p>  <p>  I do not want to overstate this but it cannot be overstated.  Take, for example, Derrybrien and what happened there because a proper environmental impact assessment had not been carried out.  We are still paying the price as a State.  The damage was done because a proper environmental impact assessment had not been carried out.  In the broader scope of history, however, the issue is even more significant.  The truth is that places such as Iraq or huge parts of Greece that are now deserts were not always deserts.  They became deserts because the trees were cut down, and the trees were where moisture gathered.  The environment there was destroyed, with a short-term objective of felling wood, and in achieving a certain objective, the conditions in which the people made a living were destroyed.  The lowlands below them were destroyed too, as a result of the damage done to the sides of mountains and so on when trees were being cut down.</p>  <p>  These are serious matters.  It is not that some sort of vexatious objector is concerned about them; they have real implications for farmers, rural Ireland, the stability of soil, the quality of water and our wider environment.  That is the nub of the debate on this.  We should speed up the appeals process but qualified people who know what they are talking about should assess the applications and what the consequences might be.  That means beefing up the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the forest service with jobs for people who have the skills, such as ecologists, who can process these matters properly, and not just because we are in a rush to get it done.  If that means there is some delay, the farmer should certainly be compensated.  Let us not set good ecological and forest management against the farmer, nor make them enemies of each other.  Farmers should be compensated and supported.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we must bear in mind what I mentioned earlier.  These are facts that were given to me.  Coillte last year granted 800 felling licences in one day for 6,000 ha of forest to be felled, and on another day in December, 350 licences for another 9,000 ha.  That is some of the backlog.  These are not small farmers; they are large plantations that can have very serious consequences.  Similarly, there is the sort of planting that is alienating communities and is not doing any good.  It is not creating the sustainable model we want or employment.  There is not much employment in this monocultural-type forest model.</p>  <p>  There is some employment for planting and felling but very little in between.  As I pointed out earlier, a point my attention was brought to is that there are 12,000 jobs but, given the conditions for forestry that exist in this country, there should be a hell of a lot more.  It should be generating a hell of a lot more revenue.  The forestry model in many other countries throughout the world, on the same or less land, generates many more jobs and much more revenue because they have a proper forest model, or a better one, than what we have.  Simply processing all these appeals rapidly, without properly doing the necessary assessments and ensuring we are making the correct decisions, with properly qualified people looking at those appeals, is a mistake that will ultimately damage farmers and rural Ireland and will not help us move towards the sustainable and better forest model we need.  It will have the opposite impact.</p>  <p>  I had intended to read out the following earlier.  It is such a brilliant quote from a surprising source and it puts the whole debate in historical context.  It is from Friedrich Engels.</p></speech>

He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Let us not [...] flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature.  For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us.  Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second and third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first.  <br /><br />The people who, in Mesopotamia, Greece, Asia Minor and elsewhere, destroyed the forests to obtain cultivable land, never dreamed that by removing along with the forests the collecting centres and reservoirs of moisture they were laying the basis for the present forlorn state of those countries.  <br /><br />When the Italians of the Alps used up the pine forests on the southern slopes, so carefully cherished on the northern slopes, they had no inkling that by doing so they were [...] thereby depriving their mountain springs of water for the greater part of the year, and making it possible for them to pour still more furious torrents on the plains during the rainy seasons [...] <br /><br />Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature &mdash; but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly. </blockquote>  <p>To me, that is the basis of a sustainable forestry and ecological policy that bears considerable relevance to the debate.  It is in that context that I intend to move our amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 59.</p></speech>

I do not know if that includes a stipulation that five weeks should be allowed for the appellant to make the appeal or a submission.  That should be part of it as well in the same way it is for a planning application for a house or for the biggest commercial venture ever thought of.  Those are the rules that the local authorities insist on in those scenarios and they have worked fine in thousands and maybe millions of applications.</p> <p> I have to say to Deputy Boyd Barrett that I respect him an awful lot.  He does an awful lot of talking and good work but he has gone off the rails this evening and he is off the track.  It is a good job that he is elected here and that he has a salary out of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann because if he did not, he would not make a living out of forestry anyway.  I can guarantee him that because he just does not know what he is talking about.</p> <p> Many of the forests we are talking about are being cut down for the third time.  They were planted back in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they were cut down 30 years after that and they were cut down 25 or 30 years after that again because they grow quicker the second time as there is more vegetation.  It is a recognised fact that forests grow quicker the second time and even the third time.  I can even point out one forest in Kilgarvan to the Deputy that has been planted three times and one little patch of it has been cut.  My father worked there in the early 1950s with a spade and a shovel and that is where he learned to drive a bulldozer as well.</p> <p> The owners of these forests had no problem in getting the felling licences the first two times.  It is only at this stage, and I am going back about two years, that these blackguards started appealing the applications for felling licences.  When landowners, Coillte or whoever planted their forests and got grants for same, they should have had a fair presumption that they would be allowed to cut them down.  It is wrong of anyone here, there or anywhere to suggest that the people who own those plantations would be denied the right to cut them down.  There are other natural trees in different places and they are a different story altogether.  These were plantations that had to be planted and fenced to get the grant.  These poor people, entities, companies or whatever all have to pay their way.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett suggested giving the landowners funding while they are held up.  Who is going to do that?  This Government does not have money to pay for home help or to give elderly people the right to stay in their homes as long as they possibly can.  I suppose Deputy Boyd Barrett does not know that if a person has a place planted, receives a felling licence and then cuts it down, he or she cannot reclaim the land and try to make it arable.  If the person wanted to do that, the only way to do so is to plant another place of equal size.  Those rules exist and Deputy Boyd Barrett need have no fear in the world about that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000052#EEE00300"><p>I will be relevant to the amendment but I am just addressing what the hero before me came out with.  I want to educate him so that he will not delay us any further with any other raim&eacute;is because these are the facts of it.</p>  <p>  The people who planted the land in the first place should not have any need to apply for a felling licence because they planted it with the idea of cutting it down and selling it.  Here we are at the stage where hauliers, harvesters, forwarders and sawmills are practically at a standstill.  The Government must act now and listen to what is being put forward in these amendments.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to listen to what we are saying here because it is relevant, proper and right.  We are doing nothing wrong and we would not be going to the trouble of helping these people with these amendments if we did not mean well.  Deputy Fitzmaurice and we in the Rural Independent Group mean well and we want this Bill to go through and to make sense.  We want it to have substance so that it will mean something to the people who are looking for felling licences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1456" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000052#EEE00400"><p>Deputy Cahill spoke about the charter of rights for farmers and the charter of rights for people who have forestry planted.  In essence, the Bill is a positive move forward and I understand there is some reluctance to put the timeframe in it.  Decisions should be made in the shortest possible timeframe from when the application is put in because, as other speakers have said, this industry is out of the soil, it has grown over generations, and there is great rural employment in it.  As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has just said, the felling licences compel a person to replant the land.  It will not be complete clear-fell and it will not return to any other use.  There are stringent rules on this.</p>  <p>  We have to be very clear that we understand what is implied in the whole forestry industry and what we believe the essence of this Bill before us is.  It is to clear a massive backlog that has stifled the forestry industry and many jobs in recent years.  Anybody who is involved in it, including the companies that are trying to plant or fell land are engaging with all sectors.  They are far and away ahead of any of us here in terms of ecology and any of the rest of it.  They have studied it and put it together and they are fighting tooth and nail to try to do the right thing for the environment, their rural communities and the jobs that have been built up in rural communities where there is little else in the way of employment.</p>  <p>  We talk about afforestation and we talk in flowery language and terms of other ecological moves such as small plantations and getting people to plant more trees.  All of it is fine and I plant individual trees as well as everything else but there is one sector that also needs to be highlighted tonight, namely, the community groups that for one reason or another have built up a small amount of afforestation.  Far-seeing people bought small plots of land in the late 1960s and early 1970s and these have been invested in or are owned by community development organisations throughout this country.  They have got felling licences and they have looked at the initiatives that have been brought forward by the Department, such as the fantastic NeighbourWood scheme.  They have looked at such schemes and decided to go with them because they saw that they would empower their communities and give better resources such as walks to them.  These organisations are also in this logjam.  These communities want to do right by their environments and they are in the logjam of this process as well.</p>  <p>  We are in the D&aacute;il Chamber discussing the crisis in the forestry industry.  Each and every one of the speakers who has spoken has done so with passion to try to get this moving.  We want to get this Bill passed as fast as possible but we also want to ensure that the passing of this legislation will not be the end of it.  There has to be massive dialogue between the Department and the stakeholders.</p> <p>Deputy Fitzmaurice made a point on Second Stage about community groups.  They give small amounts of land for community or recreational facilities but they must go through a lot of red tape in the Department.  To counteract Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, they must go through the Department to try to get small pieces of land that were forested excluded from replanting so they can put playgrounds, community facilities or something else on it.  We are talking about fractions of acres being taken but there is an amount of red tape to be surmounted to get this through the system.<br/><br/>Right through the forestry legislation there are very stringent conditions and these can stifle improvements, enlightened development and engagement in rural and urban communities throughout the country.  These groups seek to bring a benefit to everybody by turning these plots into recreational areas.<br/><br/>This Bill is a first step in ensuring the logjam that has stifled the industry and brought it to a halt throughout the country is eased.  We must ensure this mechanism will not continue <i>saecula saeculorum</i>.  There must be a defined timeframe and we must move forward with proper engagement to try to ensure a proper legislative floor can be put under the forestry industry.  There must be flexibility for people who want to take small parcels of land from forestry and return it to a community facility or the like.<br/><br/>The Minister of State has the imagination to do this but she must ensure everybody in the Department is challenged on this.  If more legislation must be brought before the Houses on this, it should be done as a matter of urgency.  Forestry companies have written to me and people I know well have worked in forestry for generations at this stage.  They are waiting on decisions but there is no timeframe.  There must be a charter.  We must not have to return to this debate later by saying that legislation was good for its time but it did not address the time delay.</p></speech>

I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle deals with many representations relating to planning permission, where people make a major investment to home themselves so they do not need a house from the State.  They go through the planning and An Bord Plean&aacute;la process, as well as environment impact statements or flood plain issues.</p>  <p>  Like Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, I remember as a young boy going to national school seeing those men on their bikes cycling to the woods.  They had such pride at the time in the Irish forestry service and the work they did.  They put in the drains and fences, and the entrances were a joy to behold.  A snipe would not get through those fences, never mind a deer.  Lamentably, since Coillte took over, with its associated companies and conglomerates, there are no men on the ground and no jobs.  There is no maintenance, so God help the sheep farmers or other farmers trying to rear animals beside those forests.</p>  <p>  I agree with many of Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments.  He agrees that we must have a good forestry service.  Farmers - small farmers mainly, including mountain farmers - planted the land once, twice or three times.  There are people now held up that are ready to plant again.  There are contractors who do the planting and it is not like the wild west.</p>  <p>  I have often objected to the way Coillte has cut forestry at the roadside because it did not leave a screening, so the plantations looked desperate when they were harvested.  We need that tidied up.  There was no problem with first or second licences over 60 or 70 years, but now, all of a sudden, the loopholes are there and the Minister is trying to get around them.  The former Minister, Deputy Creed, ignored this over the years.</p>  <p>  I do not know the name of the gentleman mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett, but was it Mary or Biddy O'Connor who he said was his bean ch&eacute;ile?  God bless her.</p></speech>

M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Bhroin.  I do not know where she lives or whatever, but there are some great and wise people out there, a lot wiser than me or Deputy Boyd Barrett.  They used to lived in both&aacute;ns in the hills without electricity and water but things have evolved, but they have evolved too far.  I want the appeals system tied down.  I want a finite time and date.  T&aacute; an Teachta Naughten ag g&aacute;ire but it is a fact.  They were wise people and they knew the land.</p>  <p>  The Deputy then went to Iraq but I thought there was no oil under any of the forestry in the Knockmealdowns, the Galtees or the Comeragh mountains, in Tipperary anyway.  There is oil under the ground in Iraq but we have plenty of water, mountain sheep, foxes and deer.  There is no oil there.  The Deputy went around the houses and had great latitude.  I am not criticising the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in saying that.</p>  <p>  However, we need to be sensible here.  I always admire the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's contributions and I heard her earlier and agreed with her when she said we need the forestry bodies and all the relevant Departments dealing with this to be properly staffed and maintained with properly qualified people.  Perhaps we should also bring in the likes of M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Bhroin, people who know the land, who have feeling or empathy for it, and who know the mountains and the areas.  It is not because they went to college and got degrees in ecology and everything else that they know everything about the flora and fauna of the Knockmealdowns and Galtees.  We cannot beat the learned experience of trying to live with the land and beating the beast of the mountain in snow, floods and everything else.</p>  <p>  Forestry is very important.  Tomorrow is "Tree Day", which has been observed by young people in schools over recent years.  It is a wonderful part of education.  Big companies have not looked after forests and we have heard about bad management.  There are maps and designs.  They have the roads well drained and the water came off the country roads, in fairness.</p>  <p>  I will not delay any further.  It is a long way from Iraq to the Knockmealdowns, Deputy Boyd Barrett, and it is a long way from Iraq to the Galtees.  C&aacute; bhfuil M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Bhroin?  An bhfuil s&iacute; imithe?  An bhfuil s&iacute; beo f&oacute;s?  N&iacute;l a fhios agam.  We need common sense.</p></speech>

I stand here to support the amendment, which is quite logical and practical.  We are about being practical this evening in how the forestry appeals service could operate.</p>  <p>  I will refer briefly to the MacKinnon report, which is the template for many of us now.  In wrapping up her Second Stage speech, the Minister of State referred to it and the appointment of an independent chairperson.  In support of the amendment I will speak very briefly to the observations made on page eight of that report.  I am sure many Members, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, will have a copy of the report before him.</p>  <p>  Paragraph 22 states "The perception among [registered foresters] and landowners was that, where an appeal is lodged, it is likely to be a further 12 months before a decision is issued."  Tonight, we are looking to tidy the process up to be helpful to the Minister of State.  If the Minister of State accepted this reasonable and practical amendment, it would give ample time for staff to process applications and go through an appeals process, given that 14 ecologists have now been appointed.  This would ensure we can sustain communities throughout this land.  From the fellow driving the digger to open the road to the fellow planting the forestry to the person who thins it, everybody would have a fighting chance.  Right now, that fighting chance is not there and will not be until we see this legislation passed.  I ask the Minister of State to give consideration to the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000054#GGG00100"><p>I fully support Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment and reject everything Deputy Boyd Barrett has said.  He assumes that we in rural Ireland love to butcher trees and never plant them.  That is totally wrong.  It is unfortunate.  The Deputy needs to spend a little bit more time in rural Ireland.  I know he comes to west Cork sometimes.  I will take him for a spin the next time he is down there and show him some beautiful and careful planting done by people who respect the environment.  He should also remember that if we do not support Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment, we put 500 jobs on the line at GP Wood and its associated company in Enniskeane.  Hours are being reduced next month.  Laying off 500 workers would represent a major loss to the economy in west Cork.  They come from as far away as Schull, as well as Bandon, Clonakilty, Ballineen, Drimoleague and Dunmanway.  This will be a huge loss.  I have spoken to these workers.</p>  <p>  The industry estimates that 2 million tonnes of timber are held up by the appeals and licensing processes of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Deputy Boyd Barrett wants more houses to be built.  That is enough timber to build 100,000 homes.  He should keep that in mind.  GP Wood has managed to source some supplies from abroad, which will start to arrive next month.  Buying from abroad goes against everything the company stands for.  Imagine the environmental impact of shipping timber from across Europe.  Doing so supports no jobs in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Moreover, the Government and the Green Party cannot hit tree-planting targets while all this is going on.  The delays are killing the tree-planting programme.  Only 2,500 ha will be planted this year out of a Government target of 8,000 ha per annum.  The impact on our climate goals is massive.  Afforestation is a key weapon in the fight against climate change.  The difference will be millions of tonnes of CO2 left in the atmosphere because the trees that would soak it up will not be planted.</p>  <p>  I am trying to speak to the amendment and the importance of accepting it.  The forestry appeals committee should be aiming to get through at least 20 appeals per week rather than the current rate of 20 appeals per month.  The concept of the forestry appeals committee meeting in divisions is of critical importance.  I will be supporting this amendment.  I will not hold up this discussion any further because there are a lot of amendments to discuss.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000054#GGG00200"><p>I will discuss all of the amendments in one group.  Some of these amendments relate to a timeframe.  The need to issue decisions in a timely manner is the precise reason I am introducing these regulations.  It is not appropriate to put into the Bill a time limit on the issuance of decisions.  A time limit will not make the appeal disappear and it would be inappropriate to put undue pressure on the forestry appeals committee.  The appeals process must proceed fairly.  Dividing the forestry appeals committee into smaller units will greatly increase its capacity and will therefore speed up the whole process.  That is the purpose of that part of the Bill.  I will not be accepting the amendments on it.</p>  <p>  Other amendments to section 2 concern online publication of decisions.  The forestry appeals committee gives notice of its decisions as soon as is practical and publishes them on its own website in a timely fashion.  These notices will contain reasons for the decisions, the conditions imposed, and any assessments and reports sourced or produced by the committee in making the decision.</p>  <p>  The amendments to section 5 seek to amend the Forestry Act 2014 to allow for the publication on the Department's website of applications for forestry licenses and decisions on those applications.  I accepted an amendment concerning timely publication on the Department's website in the Seanad last week.  As I have said, the forestry appeals committee already publishes its decisions on its website.</p>  <p>  It is entirely appropriate for the forestry appeals committee to be satisfied whether a serious or significant error or a series of errors was made in making the decision which is under appeal.  There will be circumstances where the forestry appeals committee will carry out screening or conduct an appropriate assessment, such as an environmental impact assessment.  However this will not be the norm.  The committee can request such assessments if it deems them necessary.  As the licensing authority, it is for the Department and not the forestry appeals committee to carry out such environmental screening and make determinations in the first instance.  With those considerations in mind, I will not accept any of the amendments in this grouping.</p></speech>

When someone applies for planning permission or lodges an appeal in that area, a decision is made within a certain period.  We are now bringing in new legislation that allows the deciding authority to sit on a case for a year.  I know of decisions that have been awaited for 730 days, 531 days and 623 days.  We are wasting our time here if we will not set a time limit on decisions.  A time limit of eight weeks would allow certainty for both the objecting party and the applicant.  At least they would know one way or the other.  If we are not prepared to do that, we might as well not introduce a Bill because we are going nowhere.</p></speech>

We should not be debating this Bill.  We certainly should not be rushing it through in this way.  I have learned a lot from the Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and others.  I genuinely bow to their knowledge and experience of certain situations, the views of farmers and all of those points.  However, I also believe that our current forestry model is a problem.  That is not the fault of individual farmers.  Rushing through legislation that could have very significant knock-on consequences to solve a particular problem is not the answer.  We should be allowed to consider this properly and come to a solution that is beneficial to all.  That is now what this is about.</p>  <p>  I am not quite sure who is driving the agenda here, but I suspect it is far bigger players than those represented by Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae.  The forestry appeals committee should not be tied to a particular timeline.  Our amendment No. 59 is about ensuring that the forestry appeals committee carries out all the necessary checks which are required of the Minister by law and complies with all the relevant EU directives.  That must be done, however long it takes.  The forestry appeals committee should have the same legal obligations as the Minister in that regard.  Unfortunately, those obligations will sometimes take time to fulfil.  Deputy Mattie McGrath or Deputy Danny Healy-Rae might say it is just not realistic to give financial compensation to people whose decisions are held up.  I understand that, but I think we should give such compensation.  If they planted in good faith, their investment or employment is on the line and they face problems because of the requirement for proper environmental oversight, they should absolutely get support from the State.</p> <p>However, I do not think the two should be set against each other.  We need to have proper oversight and should not be tied to arbitrary timelines as proposed in some amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000055#HHH00200"><p>I am absolutely gutted by the response of the Minister of State.  She indicated that she will not put a time limit on felling licence applications or appeals.  We are going nowhere.  The Government is codding the good, hard-working people who are providing employment and creating produce.  They have invested a fortune in time and money but the Government does not wish to help them.  I can clearly see what the Government is at.  It will not listen to any of the amendments.</p>  <p>  Time is of the essence.  I point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that there are things that can be changed and improved in the planting of forests but the Bill is about felling licences for grown timber that is ready to be cut.  People's jobs are on the line.  Deputy Verona Murphy pointed out that harvesters and forwarders cost &euro;1 million per unit.  There is not much to them but they cost a savage amount of money and need significant maintenance.  The people who have bought these machines cannot continue paying for them if they have no work.  The Deputy should be clear on that.  The lorries that come through my village or through Killorglin, travelling from the Iveragh peninsula where there a significant amount of grown timber is planted, will stop rolling.  The figures for the cost of those vehicles have been given.  To learn to drive a harvester is a three-year operation.  It is not like getting a provisional licence to drive a car.  A person will not be allowed to operate a harvester without having at least three years' experience because they are so intricate and involved.  One needs experience to deal with the topography in which they operate.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to Derrybrien but the problems there arose from the construction of a road and not the cutting of the trees.</p>  <p>  I am appealing again to the Minister of State.  Time is of the essence but the Government does not wish to listen.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is also present.  He is in government now.  I also look to him to protect the farmers and landowners who have land planted in counties Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon or other places.  The were advised to plant in the first place because the land was not arable and there was no other way of deriving money from it.  There are now many places where the trees are ready to be cut.  As I have stated in the House on several occasions, we do not have deposits of oil, gold or diamonds in this country.  We must use whatever resources we have to survive.  Forestry is one of the resources we have on marginal land in rural parts of Kerry and west Cork.  I know these places well.  I have worked in every one of them.</p>  <p>  I know that if I am doing a small job on a road, I will have to put in silt traps and silt ponds and make sure that there is no run-off.  The process is perfect in that regard and the same applies to those harvesting trees.  If there is a stream, they must ensure that they have a way of crossing it without even taking the wheels of the tracks through it.  There are ways in which one can do that.  I promise that all those things are in place.  If the Minister of State has other issues with that aspect of forestry, they can be raised on another day.  We will give her a hearing and if she has a sensible story or a proposal that makes sense, we will support her.  We are looking for her support on felling licences for trees and forests that have been cut down once or twice before and are ready to be harvested for a third time.  Nothing could be cleaner or better in terms of how they are operated.  If I spilled a drop of oil on a road and an inspector came along, I would be castigated over it.  When I was in that business, one had to keep a spill kit in one's machine to ensure that any spills were cleaned up straight away.  That is how perfect and crystal clear these operations are now.</p>  <p>  It is not fair or right for the Minister of State to state that the Government is doing something about this situation by not caving in to our request for a timeline.  There must be a timeline.  There are timelines for building a house or a factory.  This is the very same but it is far more serious because there is a system in place whereby a harvester cuts the wood and a forwarder picks it up.  Those businesses are idling because they do not have a felling licence.  A haulier collects the wood and brings it to the likes of Grainger's in Enniskeane or Medite in Clonmel and they supply places such as Palfab Limited and the pallet factory in Clondrohid.  All those businesses are operating but they depend on one thing.  They are asking us to ensure felling licences are granted within a reasonable timeframe.</p>  <p>  If the Government does not accede to amendment No. 1, it would be far better for Deputies to go on holidays.  There was less harm being done when the D&aacute;il  was in recess than there is now.  We suffered through the discussion last night on penalty points for fishermen.  As I stated, the only lorries that go through Kilgarvan taking produce to the outside world are those bringing fish or timber or a few cattle to the mart.  They are the only products we have.  We do not have oil or gold or similar resources.  These are the things we have.  I am lucky to have the Minister and the Minister of State present.  This is their time to grant felling licences and do something to ensure a fair licensing system is put in place but if they will not put a deadline or a timeframe in place, they can forget about it.</p></speech>

We are now discussing it and we have fallen at the first hurdle.  A total of 102 amendments were tabled in the Seanad but the Minister of State rejected them all.  The Government is not serious about this Bill.  There is no timeline provided in the Bill and it will be unworkable without one.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and I raised the fact in the House yesterday and at the Business Committee last week that we are not being given enough time to debate the Bill.  We still do not have enough time to debate it.  We did not have enough time to submit amendments.  There was no pre-legislative scrutiny or anything else.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett and I are coming at the matter from different sides.  I do not know if he every wielded an axe or drove a mallet or tried to start a chainsaw, but I doubt he did.  I have nothing against him.  There are so many problems here in Dublin such as oil spillages and raw sewage going into the water supply.  The Government is now trying to bring water from Tipperary up to a pipework system that leaks 58% of the water in it.  Sewage and oil and other bad substances are going into the water supply.  They are being killed just to try to treat it.  The whole thing is bananas.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State and the Minister are in the Chamber.  It is their time, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae stated.  I wished the Minister of State well earlier.  She will be looking at a timeline of the Green Party being banished again from government when the next election comes.  It might not take long.  The Green Party was banished before because it got caught up in silly things instead of looking after people's lives and livelihoods and allowing them to live.</p>  <p>  In fairness to Deputy Boyd Barrett, he stated that I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group have helped him to educate himself on these issues.  I do not know things about Dublin that he knows, such as the story of Mrs. O'Connor and the expert who was brought in 150 years ago.  I asked him whether they are alive but they have been dead for 150 years or 160 years.  T&aacute; siad imithe, like the snow on the Galtee Mountains.</p>  <p>  This is so sad.  The Government has no intention of making this work.</p> <p>The Minister of State is pandering to her own supporters, many of whom are there.  One of them, I found out today, is a serial objector.  I think he is from my own town.  God knows, we went to the same secondary school.  I am not saying he is not qualified; he is.  We must have common sense but common sense has gone out the window.  That is the problem with the Minister of State and the Green Party.  The last time the Green Party was in power it destroyed coursing and anything to do with rural pursuits.  What have they got against rural Ireland?  We want to live.  As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has stated, we do not have gold and silver but we have forestry and agriculture.  We have arable land.  I am from the Golden Vale, with some of the best land in the country, but we have the mountain that need to be planted and used as well.</p> <p> Above all, we cannot build and sort out our housing crisis in any way if we have not the timber to make the roofs.  We cannot make them with rushes or bloody thatch like they had 200 years ago.  The Minister of State would love to be telling us to have all that crack.  She will not let us do that either or give us a decent grant to repair the thatched roofs we have.  What the Minister of State is doing with the Green Party here is poppycock.  It is nonsense.  It is patent blackguarding.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is sitting behind the Minister of State, his colleagues will come in here and speak like we are speaking but then they will support the Minister of State.  It is a downright double act committing fraud on the people, telling them they will do one thing and then supporting this nonsense of a Bill.  It is a waste of time.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, we might as well go home now and forget about it because the Government has no interest in sorting it out.</p> <p> If one has not a deadline on anything, one is going nowhere.  One must have a deadline.  There are deadlines for amendments.  There are deadlines for speaking time here.  There are deadlines for everything.  For anything we do in the country for all the other crops, there are deadlines.  There are deadlines for planning.  There is nothing for this.  That goes to show that the Minister of State will not accept a reasonable deadline.  I am not saying one should not give people the time.  There are forest improvement scheme, FIS, grants, environmental impact studies and God knows what.</p> <p> The Minister of State is only trying to cod us but she is codding herself.  It is herself she is harming.  The Green Party will be banished from Government again.  They will come back in ten years' time again and produce another programme for Government with some other fellows who are willing to take them in.  They do not understand.  The Minister of State is a farmer from rural Ireland.  While I do not know the density of forestry in County Offaly, I believe they have a fair bit of it and the Minister of State should understand this.  The backlogs are there for all the harvesters, all the fellows with the replanting, the forwarders, the hauliers and the mills.  Above all, one will not have the finished product for one's presses, wardrobes or anything, or even the roof.</p> <p> Where are we going?  Kindergarten children would not come up with this kind of baloney.  It is merely an effort to let on that the Minister of State is doing something and to fool the people.  The Minister of State is fooling no one.  Someone said they cannot see the wood for the trees.  The Minister of State is not codding anyone.  This is shameful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000056#JJJ00200"><p>I am disappointed with the Minister of State's performance here this evening.  The one thing that I will say to both the Minister and the Minister of State is that they should remember 30 September because the people of Ireland are watching and they listened carefully to what the Minister of State said earlier on.  There are many millers watching this tonight and many contractors who are desperately hoping that they will have work next month and the month after.  In the coming days, timber will be coming in from Scotland.  It is a disgrace to think that here we are at a stage where we are nearly at a standstill.  The industry is relying on the Minister and the Minister of State, as senior politicians, and what the Minister and the Minister of State are saying to us as legislators is they will not accept what we are seeking, which is common sense.</p>  <p>  Having a timeline and having a timeframe is the same, as I stated earlier on, as what the local authorities have.  It is merely sensible work.  It is a way of dealing with a person's right of application.  One should remember that when a person applies to the State to plant forestry, he or she obviously has an expected right to pen that forestry, to clear-fell it when its time comes and to make a road through it to make access roads to withdraw the timber of the forestry.  Those are reasonable expectations that any farmer or forester would have.  If one goes back over history's pages, one will find it was a reasonable expectation and common sense.</p>  <p>  Here the Minister of State is tonight denying us the right to have our amendments be accepted.  I told the Minister of State earlier on we were not fighting with her.  We wanted to work with her but now when I see what the Minister of State is doing, if she wants a fight we will give her as good a fight as anybody will give her.</p>  <p>  What the two Ministers are doing here is disgraceful because they are letting the industry think that they are doing something to help it but they are actually not.  They are doing nothing to help the industry by not allowing us have our amendments be accepted.  Why will they not accept our amendments?  Is it because they did not put in these provisions in the first instance?  Is it that their heads have already become too swelled in the short couple of weeks that they are there?  They should remember that any politician, whether a Minister, a Deputy, a county councillor or whatever, is only there because the people want him or her to be there.  The day the people do not want a Minister to be there, he or she will be gone, out of here and history.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is not listening to the users of the service.  The Minister of State is not listening to the poor small farmer who might be relying on having his forestry thinned or clear-felled in order that he or she can have a few euro, which he or she is perfectly entitled to have.  It was such farmers' right and expectation.  The State backed them at the time when they planted the forestry and now the Minister of State is denying them this little bit of assistance.  It is here in black and white.  The amendments are there.  They are perfectly sensible.</p>  <p>  Everybody knows I do not like saying anything against anybody but when I heard what Deputy Boyd Barrett said earlier on, to be honest I would hate to give him a chainsaw because his two legs would stand grave danger if he had a chainsaw in his hands, because he knows flip all about timber.  He knows nothing about the forestry sector to come out with what he came out with earlier on.  The Deputy should stick with what he is knowledgeable about.  I say, "My goodness" to any person who would not support what we are trying to do tonight.</p>  <p>  There is nothing wrong with what we are looking for.  All we are looking for is fair play.  When a person hears these big figures, he or she might think that they are millionaires.  When one hears that people who might be small contractors whose families are steeped in the tradition of harvesting timber are buying a machine that cost half a million euro, one might think they are very rich to be able to buy that type of a machine.  It is a balancing act.  All that happens is the person goes to a finance company and gets the finance because he or she has the experience, the operators and a proven track record of going into a forest and being able to thin it and operate the machinery.  The forwarders and the harvesters are complex machines to operate and it is a trade in itself to drive them.  Those people use their brains to borrow the money through leases or loans for that equipment.  They struggle to pay back every month.  The repayments are enormous.  All they hope to have is enough money at the end of the month to pay what they owe for the lease, the hire purchase or loan, enough money to pay their diesel bill, their transportation cost when they have to move it from A to B, and enough money to pay the driver and maybe be able to cover breakdowns.  All they are doing is making a living.  There is nothing fancy about it.  They might be sitting up on a machine that cost half a million euro or a lorry that cost &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000 but at the end of the day, it is only a struggling act all the time to keep the show rolling.  The Minister and Minister of State are doing nothing to help them by bringing this Bill before the House and not accepting the amendments.</p>  <p>  The only reason we were supporting this all along is we surely thought that the Minister and the Minister of State would have the common sense and the down-to-earth understanding that these fellows know what they are talking about and they know what they are doing.  We are supporting the millers, the hauliers, the contractors and the forest owners.  Here the Minister and the Minister of State are, turning their noses up in the sky and looking down at the lot of us and saying, "No."</p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister of State and the Minister a question here tonight, and I will not let them get away with this.  Why will they not accept our amendments?  Why will they not come down out of their high ivory towers to our level and explain properly what is wrong with what we are suggesting?  What is wrong with it and why will they not accept it?  They will alienate themselves from many people.  They will be classified as foolish, mean and horrible for what they are doing because they are hurting so many people tonight.  It is very upsetting.</p>  <p>  There are people out there who are relying on us and the Minister and the Minister of State to do the right thing.  We cannot do it because we are not the Ministers in government.  We are not the people who can have a say.  Therefore, I want the Minister and the Minister of State to explain why they will not accept what we are trying to do.  The Minister of State heard Members, such as Deputy Fitzmaurice, earlier on.  Will the Minister of State please tell us what is wrong with what we are saying or does she just want to support the cranks, the crackpots and the useless people who want to do nothing only object to everything?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State want our trees?  The Minister of State knows what happens a forest.  I hope she does anyway.</p> <p>Does she know what happens to a forest when it is not thinned or properly taken care of?  It dies standing because it does not flourish or grow.  It is well known that if 40% of the weight of a forest is removed, within five years there is over 40% regrowth in the trees left standing and it is good quality box wood, the pulpwood has been removed and there is only the good quality timber, which we so desperately need.  The Minister of State is failing to see this.  For God's sake, she should grow up, she is a Minister of State in the Government and she should understand the problem and what we are trying to do here.  Why will she not accept the amendments?  It is wrong, and what the Government is doing is inherently wrong.  It will be remembered for tonight, 30 September.  The Ministers should remember it because it will be remembered as a disaster and a failure.  When we bring in timber from Russia, the Green Party and the whole bloody lot of them can go and explain where the common sense was in this.  Why, in a country which can perhaps grow timber better than anywhere else in the world, do we have to import timber from Russia?  Where is the common sense?  Where is our carbon footprint?  Where does that make sense?  How will the users of timber, the people who want to build homes or farmers who wish to use if for construction get it?  It will be from the Russians.  My goodness.  Is the Government proud of itself?  The Ministers need to grow up and cop on a small bit and do what they are supposed to do, and do their jobs properly.  They are upsetting a lot of people tonight, and I am upset over it.</p></speech>

She did that in the Seanad, where she rejected all but one or two.  She has her own agenda.  I spoke to her in a call on Zoom last week.  While I welcomed the Bill, it was weak.  That is fair.  It was put before us and we had the opportunity to put down amendments, which now she will reject one by one as if they were not relevant.  It has been made quite clear tonight that while we were here to help, the Minister of State is not here to take that help.  She has her mind made up on every amendment we have put down and from the way she is speaking, they all will be rejected.  I cannot understand how Green Party or Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have come into the Chamber and supported what we are talking about but then the senior Minister will support her in not allowing any amendments go through.  This new D&aacute;il is becoming a game for Fianna F&aacute;il.  It did the same thing last night, where Deputies from my constituency of Cork South- West said one thing about the statutory instrument.  Tonight we will see whether they will do another thing or whether they will vote against the statutory instrument.  Last night, the Ministe, kicked the fishermen in the teeth and, by God, I can tell that they were watching last night.  Tonight the farmers, timber operators, the forestry sector and the ordinary people of this country are watching him tonight.  He should be very careful.  That goes for the Minister of State too.  There are a lot of angry people out there.  They needed assistance.  The Government has an opportunity here tonight not to reject our amendments but to work with them </p>  <p>  Many landowners are very stressed.  Many come to my clinic in west Cork all the time or have contacted me but I will give one simple example.  One person contacted me who had a very sick person at home, although that is beside the point.  The storm knocked down her forest but she cannot get a felling licence.  If she does not get it in the next few months, it is pointless.  This gives an idea of the nonsensical objections, the speed by which they should have been dealt, if there is a legitimate complaint.  Obviously someone nearby should have an opportunity to appeal but it is scandalous to think that somebody living, say, 200 miles away can object to something that they probably know nothing about but are just objecting for the sake of it.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to step back here.  It is pointless telling us that she wanted to put her Bill, and her Bill only, before the people.  As we have said, our amendments are from the heart, they were to help the Bill, which we had welcomed prior to this evening.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State decided to reject our amendments, which were meant to help people to alleviate the stress people are experiencing.  People are speaking out of both sides of their mouth.  I am getting quite annoyed with this D&aacute;il.  We have given extra speaking rights to the bigger parties and they are coming into the House, speaking one way and when it comes to a vote, they do the other thing.  Do they think they are fooling the electorate?  Do they think the people of west Cork or Ireland are all shut-ears and blind-eyes?  No, people know.  They know what the Minister did with the statutory instrument and they will know tonight what way he will vote.  If the Government will not allow our amendments, they will know that too.  I ask the Minister of State to step back and reconsider allowing this amendment, which is very helpful in its attempt to speed up the appeal process, if not get rid of the right to appeal altogether, and get a decision with a more immediate effect.  She has an opportunity to change her mind with this, but maybe she is in the House tonight simply as a box-ticking exercise, which is our worry.  We will see.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Senator Pippa Hackett" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000057#KKK00200"><p>To qualify, the justification for not including this amendment on the timing in the Bill is because there is a provision in the regulations under section 14E(1)(f) for the Minister to set a time limit.  Consequently, we do not feel it is necessary to prescribe that in the Bill itself, especially at this early stage, when the whole purpose of the Bill is to make the appeals process more efficient and to work in a more effective way.  For us to put a timeline on that at the very outset might be very foolish indeed and could be highly problematic in the short term.  In the medium to long term, such a provision is contained in the regulation, which hopefully might alleviate some of the Deputies' concerns on that point.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I have some forestry on my own farm and am quite familiar with the hazards and problems that might arise should thinning not take place on time.  </p>  <p>  There were 104 amendments in the Seanad last week, which were grouped into 14 groupings.  As I accepted two amendments, that was not too bad a turnaround.  Deputies should be aware that many of the amendments from the Seanad are also included in tonight's amendments.  </p></speech>

As she noted, that is why the capacity is provided for in the Bill for the Minister, in due course, to place timelines on how long an appeal might take.  That capacity is there.  I can assure the House that the Minister of State and I did not engage with other parties or none two weeks ago to ask for co-operation to bring this urgent legislation to the Seanad last week and to deal with it in the D&aacute;il this week in its entirety merely so that we would then end up dilly-dallying and swinging the lead and not trying to get appeals dealt with in as prompt a fashion and dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The decision not to put timelines into the legislation but to enable the Minister to do so at a future date was made because were they included in the primary legislation now, as Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment provides, where "The Forestry Appeals Committee would give their decision on an appeal within eight weeks of receipt", then the appeals committee would collapse under its own weight before it had taken its first step.  </p> <p>As we all know, there are appeals that have been in the system for much longer than eight weeks.  The backlog is the problem and it is taking too long to deal with appeals.  We in the Department have employed additional ecologists so that the appeals can be processed and dealt with promptly.  We will also ensure that the forestry appeals committee has additional personnel so that it has the capacity to deal with many more appeals.  The priority now is to ensure that the backlog is processed in the promptest manner possible.  This means providing the necessary resources and ensuring that appeals are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p> <p> Once the situation reaches equilibrium again, the backlog has been dealt with and we are in a more normal state of affairs, the legislation will give the Minister the capacity to put reasonable timeframes in place so as to provide clarity on how long appeals should take.  Were we to set out in primary legislation that all of the backlogged appeals must be dealt with in eight weeks, it would not be practical or feasible.  We must first deal with the backlog as quickly as possible and, once that is done, start processing new appeals in a timely fashion.</p> <p> There are many more amendments and we are only on amendment No. 1.  The co-operation of the House is important.  Deputies understand the urgency of passing the Bill this week in order that its provisions can kick into operation quickly.  Last week, the Minister of State gave her strong and comprehensive consideration to each of the amendments in the Seanad.  We will not have the time to address all of our amendments, but I look forward to moving through them.</p> <p> Let us first consider this amendment and read the legislation in terms of what the Bill will allow the Minister to do when it is timely to do so.  To put this amendment's provisions into primary legislation at the outset would mean that the legislation would not be operable and could not perform the functions that we all want, namely, processing appeals, supporting the sector, ensuring that timber starts flowing again and employment in timber yards and contractors continues, and preventing supply drying up.</p></speech>

The tail is truly wagging the dog.  The Green Party is practically lifting the dog of Fianna F&aacute;il, which is a pup now.  Fianna F&aacute;il was a party that I was proud to be a member of, but it is nearly facing extinction.  The way it is going, it will be extinct.  A preservation order will be placed on what is left of it.</p>  <p>  This is outrageous.  There is a backlog now.  Could the Minister not deal with it before setting out in legislation that all future applications would have a timeline applied as is the case with, for example, building a house, a factory or anything else?  I have respect for the Minister, but he came out with a diatribe.  Here we are with the Green Party and talk of touch-me-nots and political interference.  The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not happy with a former Senator being appointed to a bank.  The Green Party is the moral fibre of the Government, yet this will be at the discretion of the Minister of State.  She will decide every appeal even though we as public representatives are no longer allowed to have planning meetings on site with planners and constituents.  Everything is all above board, fancy and trimmed up now and we cannot interfere, yet a Minister of State of the self-righteous party that will put respect into politics will now have the right to decide when is long enough and how long is a piece of string.  Deputy Boyd Barrett stated that Coillte alone granted 350 felling licences on one day and 800 on another.  The Minister of State will be up all night and all day going through every appeal.  If she thinks it has gone on for long enough, she will then decide.</p>  <p>  It is being dressed up, but we know that this is a contrived and convoluted three-card trick meant to prevent forestry farmers and ordinary people from developing their woodlands and harvesting their crops.  The Minister and his backbenchers will fall in and vote for this through the lobby.  It is a con job.  If it looks like a con and walks like a con, it is a con.  That is not lost on us or the people watching, whose jobs are in peril or who have bank loans.  The Government allowed the banks to remove the moratorium today.  This Bill is just sending lambs to the slaughter, but Government Deputies will be the lambs to the slaughter.  I am just afraid that there will be no abattoirs left to deal with them.</p></speech>

I have been unavoidably absent for the past 24 hours or so.  I was waiting for a close contact to get a Covid test result.  Thankfully, it was negative and we are back in action.  I wish to record my thanks to Deputy Martin Kenny, who took over the lead for Sinn F&eacute;in during that time.  I thank all Members who have contributed on this important debate.  I hope that it will be a small part of the much larger debate on forestry policy that we need to have.</p><p>I have put on the record in the Chamber and elsewhere my belief that it would be overly generous to suggest that this State had a forestry strategy.  We do not.  A good forestry strategy should be good for the environment and, importantly, local communities.  Local communities should want to live close to forests.  If forestry is done well, then it should be seen as an amenity and a benefit.  It should also be good for the local economy.  I am using the term &quot;local economy&quot; purposely.  Local people should be employed in these forests and the economic benefit should be visible in any area where there is forestry.  The ongoing offsetting of forestry to multinational corporations has been detrimental to the ambition of ensuring positives for communities, the environment and the domestic economy.  We have a great deal of work to do.</p><p>I would appreciate it if the Minister or Minister of State indicated whether it is the Government's intention to support any of the amendments before the House.  That would be telling.  The Minister and Minister of State have acknowledged the Opposition's facilitation of this legislation.  Both of them are new in their jobs and have told us that this is an emergency, and we have accepted that there is a backlog in felling licences that needs to be addressed urgently.  As previous speakers indicated, too many jobs are on the line for us not to take this seriously.  However, the Minister and Minister of State have a responsibility to ask their Department why this situation was allowed to become an emergency.  The Bill should never have been emergency legislation.  We knew this time last year that a backlog was building.  Even if Deputies had not known, all they would have needed to do was pick up the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>or look at AgriLand on our phones.  Farming organisations and those at the coalface of the forestry sector were telling us about the backlog, yet nothing was apparently done until the summer months when we were told that emergency legislation was being introduced and the Opposition was urged to waive pre-legislative scrutiny, which we did.  During the welcome discussions on what the Bill would entail, one of the requests that my party made when facilitating the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny was that the Minister and the Department would give due consideration to the amendments.  Different sides of the Opposition have tabled amendments that are constructive and helpful and would make the Bill much better.  I hope to stand corrected, but the inference I have picked up is that the Government does not plan to accept any of them.  That would send a bad signal and would be taken into consideration the next time, if ever, we were asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p> There is a problem with forestry and a lot of it stems from the Department not taking the issues seriously.  We do not have a forestry policy in respect of climate action.  We have a timber production strategy, which is an important element but only part of it.  We have a situation where, in County Leitrim in particular but increasingly in other counties as well, communities are up in arms because they feel decisions are being made into which they have absolutely no input.  They deserve to have such input and this legislation must ensure they do.  However, the ability for people to have an input should not be used as an excuse or rationale for stalling the entire forestry mechanism of the country.</p> <p> We intend to support Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment.  I ask that the Minister or Minister of State give an indication as to whether they plan to accept any of the amendments that have been put forward.  If we know which ones are being taken on board, we can facilitate their passage through the House this evening.</p></speech>

If an inspector comes out and finds something wrong with an application, the farmer can appeal the decision by a certain date.  In every other instance one can think of, things have to be done by a particular date.  However, the Minister is saying that when it comes to the forestry appeals system, it will be a case of, "Sure, whenever we get to it."  From 2016 to 2020, the Department reached only 57% of its target in regard to the processing of applications.  There is a problem within the Department the Minister and Minister of State are overseeing, whether they want to believe it or not.</p>  <p>  The application process will not be effective without deadlines, dates and timelines for getting things done.  I am hearing that there are 2,000 applications ready to go through the door of the Department the minute this legislation goes through.  What will happen then?  Will it take another 780 days of people drinking tea and fiddling around before deciding whether to accept an application?  If we do not put deadlines on the making of decisions, one way or the other, there will be no change.  We are not pre-empting anything in our proposal.  All we are saying is that a decision should be made within an eight-week period and that whatever extra staffing is required to enable this to happen should be provided.  One will need more blocklayers to build ten houses than are needed to build one house.  It is the same with appeals; if there are more coming in, then more people are needed to process them.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that there will be more appeals coming in if we go on as we are and do not take a different road.  If we keep sending the same application back to the same person, he or she has no choice but to do the same again and away we are on the merry-go-round.  It is a very simple thing to know that in any walk of life, there are certain deadlines that must be met.  If we put in the resources, we can get the applications through in a reasonable time.  It is as simple as that.  There is also the opportunity for an oral appeal.  Everything is covered within the three months, one way or the other.  One is either in or out the gap.  The people objecting know where they stand and the people applying for a licence know the same.  If we cannot at least do that, given the situation in the forestry industry at the moment, we are failing the people involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000059#MMM00300"><p>I am very disappointed with the response offered by the Minister and Minister of State.  It is absolutely ridiculous that they would try to sell the story to us that it will be left up to the Minister to decide when an appeal will be dealt with.  We are asking for a timeline on behalf of the people involved.  They are depending on us to ensure that they get fair play but it looks like the Minister and Minister of State are not going to give them that.</p>  <p>  If I understood him right, the Minister said that at a later stage, when things cool down a bit, he might put in a timeline.  I am not sure whether he even said that much.  What he is forgetting is that the appeals are going to keep coming.  The blackguards will keep blackguarding and they are not going to stop just because the Minister says he has passed a Bill.  The Bill is worthless as it stands if he does not put in a timeline.  Maybe he should tell the fellows sending in appeals that until we get up and running and get a timeline in place, no more appeals will be taken.  The Minister is the powers that be in this case.  The Taoiseach signed a statutory instrument that will allow penalty points to be imposed on fishermen.  Can he not sign another statutory instrument to the effect that no more felling licence appeals will be accepted until the backlog is cleared, the people who are waiting for licences get them and work is again going on in the normal fashion that it did until two years ago?  He can then decide to resume appeals when they can be dealt with.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the Minister cannot deal with the appeals coming into his Department and he has no notion of doing so if he is not going to impose a deadline in respect of them.  He should put a stop to them for now and get the Taoiseach to sign a statutory instrument to that effect.  Maybe the Minister could sign it himself.  The time for blackguarding is over and it is time to sort this out one way or the other.  We need to stop any new appeals coming in for now to allow the backlog to be cleared.  The people making the appeals are not going to stop.  At the rate they are going, the whole thing will close down in one slap altogether and the Minister will be remembered forever for it.  A previous Government closed the sugar factory in Mallow and it will never be forgotten that it did so.  If this Government closes down the timber industry and the whole business of cutting timber, taking it to sawmills and cutting it up for roofing houses, people will not forget it.  If the Government presides over that, it will take a fair hammering at some stage.  Nobody knows who will survive and get through the next election.</p>  <p>  We are all trying to do our best here but I can see that the Government is not listening to us on this very serious issue.  We are talking about an area of production that has been achieved on very marginal rural land that was good for absolutely nothing else.  Governments gave people grants to plant the trees and it is only right that those people would presume that if they got a grant to plant them, then they should be allowed to cut down the trees.  We are asking the Minister to deal with the blackguards.  There may be a very small number of people who have genuine concerns and we want to assist them.  However, that is not what is going on when we have fellows 200 miles away from Kerry appealing and holding up the granting of a felling licence there.  That is truly wrong.  There are parents who want to sell their forestry to pay for their children to go to college.  I know a woman whose husband has been in a wheelchair for two years since he had a stroke.  She wants to sell a bit of forestry to get the money to adapt the house for him.  There are several cases like these right under our noses.  The man beside me has a haulage set-up and he is depending on timber to be felled.  He cannot draw it if it is not cut.  There are several thousand workers right around us who are affected by this.  We have very little in rural parts of Kerry but there is forestry production.  It is all going to go for nothing.</p>  <p>  The Minister must do something to reduce the volume of appeals coming into the Department.  The reason he gave for not putting in a deadline is not acceptable.  We do not accept that it should be left up to the Minister.</p>  <p>There are hundreds of applications going in.  A Minister will not deal with those, and will not want to deal with them.  It would be too onerous and complicated.  The Minister must include in the Bill a deadline for deciding on appeals and block any further appeals until that is in place.  Surely he has enough common sense to see that.  The Government is talking about allowing a Minister to make a decision on each appeal.  God help us.</p></speech>

Where is provision made for that and how would the D&aacute;il know this?  How would the D&aacute;il make an input into that and how would we know the Minister would do it?  That is very important.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 59, 60 and 61 deal with the timing and type information that is to be given with regard to appeals.  Will the Minister clarify what is wrong with the amendments and the reason he will not accept them?  They are about providing information to people who make appeals, having information provided within a reasonable timeframe, notifying decisions across the board and making the decisions known to the public.  These are vital amendments.  What are the Minister's views on them?</p></speech>

This all takes time.  The amendments are based on the views of stakeholders from around the State.  We did not make them up.  They are based on what the people who operate sawmills, the contractors, foresters and farmers are telling us.  We represent those people.  That the Minister is not accepting any of the amendments is very worrying and concerning because he has a duty to listen and to represent the ordinary people of the State.  Deputies come from all parts of the State and we have brought forward very constructive amendments based on what the stakeholders have informed us are the obstacles.</p>  <p>  It is undemocratic and flies in the face of democracy for the Minister to refuse to accept any of these reasonable amendments.  I fully support Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment, which is very reasonable.  We see timelines everywhere.  Farmers are under pressure all the time to meet deadlines.  Is it a case of one way traffic where the Department takes a heavy hand and tells people they have to meet deadlines but the Department can do as it pleases?  That is the clear signal and message here, which is an absolute disgrace.  We need to make sure there is a timeline built in to the legislation.  This Bill does not instil confidence in anybody.  Ordinary people viewing proceedings tonight will be shocked that a reasonable and basic request to include a timeline is being refused.  We are hearing absolute nonsense, which does not justify that position.  People are going to see through this tonight.  The stakeholders who came to us from Kerry, Cork, Tipperary, Limerick, Offaly and Laois will see the messing that is going on.  It has to stop.  The Minister has a duty to represent the State.  We have all been elected to do that.  I ask him to review her decision on this reasonable amendment.</p>  <p>  One of my constituents, Mr. John O'Connell of Glenasack forestry, made a number of important points in his submission to the Department on this Bill.  I have no doubt it was discarded and thrown by the wayside.  It appears the Department does not want to listen to anybody.  The Minister and Minister of State need to listen to ordinary people.  Mr. O'Connell has summarised very well the problems that exist, which emphasise the absolute necessity for a timeline for appeals.  He has put forward reasons such as the ludicrous situation where Irish sawmills that export much of their produce are running out of raw material and will have to import timber to process, even though there are hundreds of thousands of tonnes of Irish timber being held up by appeals.  It is beyond belief.  Nobody would believe it.  People in other countries must be asking what sort of a country Ireland is.  We do not need to go too far to see countries that have efficient forestry systems, for example, Scotland and Germany.</p>  <p>  Afforestation levels have dropped dramatically and the acreage of new planting this year is at levels not seen since the 1940s.  Clearly, there is a problem.  We need efficiency.  Some forest owners are delaying construction of forest roads until clear felled and are not thinning their plantations, further eroding the supply of timber.  Most importantly, landowner confidence in forestry as a viable enterprise is clearly non-existent.  Many forest owners have stated they wish they had never become involved in the first place.  Other landowners who were considering forestry as an option have been put off by their neighbours' experiences in dealing with the forestry services.</p>  <p>  The considerable efforts of various Governments over the last four decades in promoting forestry are being lost here tonight.  It is difficult to see how landowners will commit to planting new land or how the annual planting target of 8,000 ha under the climate action plan will be realised.  The Minister needs to go back to the drawing board and be more constructive with us.  We showed good faith and allowed the Bill to proceed in good faith, which was the right thing to do.  The fact is that the Minister is closing every door that should be opened and incorporated in the Bill.  We did not make up these amendments.  They came from constituents and we represent rural constituents.  I ask the Minister to do the same.  He has a duty to represent constituents in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Even better, people are watching and are hearing the debate, which I am certainly learning from.  They then bring to bear facts that impact on the debate we have heard.  I have received one communication that is very interesting in that regard.  It challenges very strongly the rationale behind the Bill and the rationale of many of the Deputies who have spoken in favour of this amendment.  The rationale behind the Bill is that all these blackguards are appealing felling licences and this has caused a huge problem with people employed in the forestry sector sitting idle.  To be honest, listening to the debate I thought maybe this is the case.  I thought that maybe I had missed something because forestry is not huge where I live, although it is substantial enough in County Wicklow, which is not far from me.  Of course, the Government has more or less been saying the same thing.  The rationale is that we need to fast-track the appeals process, albeit not as fast as some Deputies want, but there is the problem of a massive backlog, and also that somehow these two things are connected.  There is a backlog but is it connected to what we have heard here, factually?  The Minister has not provided any evidence.  However, somebody has helpfully provided a little bit of evidence which blows the argument completely out of the water.  Let us have a guess as to what percentage of afforestation licences in 2019 were appealed.</p></speech>

It would be short-sighted, without that evidence, to in any way short-circuit, limit or narrow the basis upon which people can, for good reason, object to or appeal licence decisions.  According to my source, the Department's ability to make decisions has dropped off because it was found that the method of appealing licences was not in compliance with EU law.  That is actually what has happened.  Compliance has required a considerable slowing up of the process.  We have a dysfunctional forestry model and the EU has found us out.  As a result, we have had to put a hell of a lot more resources into processing licence applications and that is what is slowing the process down.  What do we do about that?  It seems that we have to comply and we need to put the resources into complying with a sustainable forestry model while also clearing the backlogs and so on.  We must do so in a way that is not environmentally damaging or in breach of environmental directives, laws and obligations.</p></speech>

If we just ram a decision through in an arbitrary eight weeks and are not in compliance, we will be in court the day after anyway because somebody will take us to court for having breached the directives.  What we need is for the Department to put resources into ensuring that we are in compliance and that we change the forestry model so that we do not find ourselves in these difficulties again in the years ahead.</p></speech>

He must be asked whether he accepts that there is a crisis in our timber industry at present.  Why are we debating this?  Why is the Bill coming in here at all?  Why have party and non-party Deputies agreed to facilitate the passing of this legislation in the first instance without pre-legislative scrutiny?  It is because we all recognise that there is a crisis in the timber industry.  Why is there a crisis in the timber industry?  It is because the whole system is choked up.  The felling licences that are required are not being processed in time and here is Deputy Boyd Barrett standing up, just because somebody sent him a tweet in the last ten minutes.  He read it and is taking it as gospel from holy God.  He is so confused that he had to hold his tablet in his hand in case he was misreading what was sent to him.  He had facts there ten minutes ago that he did not have 20 minutes ago.  He is now taking what came to him through his bloody iPhone as the gospel truth, according to God in heaven above.  One would swear He sent the Deputy a message directly.  Is Deputy Boyd Barrett trying to deny that there is a crisis in the forestry industry?  Is he trying to deny that we will be importing timber this week from Scotland because if we do not do so, our sawmills will fall silent?  God help our sawmills, our farmers, contractors and lorry men.  They would be relying on a very sad individual in here tonight to help them if they were relying on what has come out of Deputy Boyd Barrett's mouth in the last 20 minutes.  The sawmills would stay completely silent and they would be silent for a long time.  I have often heard Deputy Boyd Barrett talking about the working man but he would not know a day's work if it came up and hit him between the two eyes.  I do not like being personal about anything but when I hear fellows talking rubbish, I get annoyed.  Just because some unknown person sent the Deputy a tweet, he puts it on the record of the D&aacute;il as if it is the gospel and he is denying the fact that we have respectable people telling us that the sawmills do not have timber coming into their yards.  The Deputy is coming out here tonight with drivel.  What he has just said is drivel.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000061#OOO03300"><p>I am coming back now to the subject at hand and will address the Minister and Minister of State but I could not let Deputy Boyd Barrett away with that.  He cannot come in here, talk rubbish and get away with it.  I will come back now to the Minister and the Minister of State's performance and response.  For God's sake, I must challenge them for coming along and saying that they will deal with this afterwards and that we can put in timeframes afterwards.  That is nonsense.  In actual fact, the display the two of them put on tonight would be worthy of an episode of "Father Ted".  It was hopeless to give that response to us after we genuinely put forward these amendments.  We worked at them, we believe in them and a lot of people around the country are relying on them to be enacted.  We begged the Minister and Minister of State to give a good, sensible response as to why we could not do this now.  I would have no problem if they said that they would accept this amendment but not that one and give us reasons for same.  Equally, they might want us to vary or change our amendments, by consensus or agreement, working together.</p> <p>However, they did exactly the opposite of what I asked them to do earlier.  I stood up in good faith.  I wished them well and I told them we were willing to work with both Ministers.  What do they do?  They throw it all back in our faces by telling us that every bit of work that has been done, and a lot of work and time went into these amendments, will be thrown out of the window - it is a case of &ldquo;our way or no way&rdquo;.  That is what the Ministers are saying here tonight.  One would swear to God they were infallible and that they had a monopoly on being right.  No one of us has a monopoly on being right.  I will be wrong ten times a day but I hope I am right some share of the time as well.  I know I am right in putting forward our amendments and in supporting respectable politicians like Deputy Fitzmaurice, who is talking nothing but common sense, talking from the heart and he knows what he is talking about. </p> <p> How many of those in this Chamber worked in forestry?  I worked for a long time in forestry and when I started out in forestry, it was not a machine or anything else I had, but a horse called Billy, and Dan Casey with me, a good sound local man, and the two of us working our hearts out every day, supplying timber to Grainger&rsquo;s Sawmills.  We worked damn hard pulling out timber every day for a long time, on hot, roasting days and on freezing cold days, breaking down into the ground to try to pull out tonnes of timber onto the side of the road.  I feel like I am entitled to talk about the industry because I worked in it and I know what it is about from the ground up. </p> <p> Here we are, in a position to legislate for the good of the timber industry and, instead, the two Ministers spoke for only a very short length of time.  The reason for that is they had nothing to say, certainly nothing good to say.  They only gave a bare, minimal response.  As I said, it is fit for an episode of &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo; because it did not make any sense.  One would swear to God it was a joke by them because they are not taking this seriously at all.  They are not doing anything to affect the timber industry in a positive way.  We could spend the night talking about it.  All I want them to do is to say they will work with us, but they will not.  They are throwing the whole lot in our faces - every one of us here. </p> <p> On another point, where is everybody?  I know the Acting Chairman and many of those in his party are genuinely interested and I am not personalising this to him.  However, I am asking the question.  Look around us.  Where are the people who are interested in the forestry industry in Ireland?  Where are they right now?  Why are they not here to debate this and to support us?  It is very disappointing.  I would ask the people who are going to be relying on this and who will feel the negative effects of this next month or next year, the people who will not have employment because of the inaction of this Government, to look around this Chamber as I am looking at it up on the screen.  We could all fit into the back of a bad motor car.  Where is everybody and why are they not here to fight and to stand up for the people, the small farmers who might have a small amount of ground?  They want to see it being harvested but it cannot be, and we are trying to rectify that here tonight.  It is an absolute shame.</p></speech>

It is quite unusual to see them running into the hundreds, and many of them are sensible and are trying to improve the Bill.</p>  <p>  The forestry appeals committee does not just deal with clear felling and it also deals with the issues of plantation of timber.  Many of the objections come from people in my community who have a problem with so much land being planted that they cannot get that land to farm it, and there are issues in that regard.  However, we are dealing with the legislation that is before us.  There is a crisis. There is a huge backlog and what we could almost call a blockade has been established. </p>  <p>  I have heard an awful lot of talk about blackguards putting in objections and so on.  Everyone who puts in an objection is not a blackguard.  Many of them do that for very good reason.  They are entitled to do so and that entitlement has to be upheld as well, and I hope that will be done in this legislation.  They have an absolute right to be able to say their community has a right to survive and prosper.</p>  <p>  There are also, of course, issues where people work in the forestry industry.  I have many in my area who go out and draw timber, and the hauliers who bring timber to the sawmills, and they also want to make a living and want to get something out of this.  There are many sides to this debate. </p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett was correct in one thing, that is, a large part of the reason we have this problem is that the objections that have come in during the last six months to a year are focused on a part of the legislation which was not focused on as intensely in the past.  They are forcing the Department through the wringer when it comes to looking at these appeals.  This is why this needs to be broken up so the appeals can be looked at faster, and I understand that.  More resources need to be put into the Department to ensure that.  Some of the amendments are to make sure that the correct expertise is there to deal with this issue, and that experts are in place to look at biodiversity and all of those issues, in order to ensure we get the correct outcome for everyone concerned. </p>  <p>  It is clear, given the nature of this debate, that we are not going to have a situation where we vote on the first set of amendments, then move to the second set and have a lengthy debate and then move to the third set and have a lengthy debate.  It is very clear by the way we are moving along that there will be very little discussion on the other blocks of amendments. </p>  <p>  The broad point is that the forestry industry creates a lot of jobs and does a lot of good, but it also has a lot of problems.  Those problems need to be addressed but many are not addressed at all in this legislation.  I certainly hope they will be addressed very soon because if they are not, we will have more communities around the country very disillusioned with this situation. </p>  <p>  The point was made by many speakers that small farmers want a waiver in order to cut their few trees on a couple of acres of land that is in forestry so they can get an income.  That is true and there are many like that.  However, for every one like that, there are many more with probably ten times more trees standing in forests that belong to corporations and companies that bought land from under farmers&rsquo; noses that those farmers were not able to buy.  That is a sore point and it is why forestry has got such a bad name in many parts of the country.  Where I am from, and I have spoken to people in Sligo, Mayo and other places, we have seen a corporate takeover of what was farmland.  We see whole parishes practically gone and taken over by big companies that now own the land and plant trees on it to get grants from the Government and get tax-free income on everything that comes from it - tax-free for the premiums, tax-free for the money they get for the forestry, tax-free all the way through.  However, a farmer who has a few cattle and is trying to make a living by milking a cow pays full tax on any profit made.  Farmers feel aggrieved at that.</p>  <p>  There are huge imbalances in all of this.  Part of what this Bill is trying to do is to get some of the balance right in regard to appeals and how that can work.  However, the other imbalances, the big ones, are not dealt with in this Bill.  Those imbalances need to be dealt with very soon or else we will have even more revolt in rural Ireland around this forestry issue. </p>  <p>  The points made about the small farmer and the ordinary person out there trying to survive, and the timber industry trying to get timber, are all very valid and we need to see the timber industry prosper.  However, unfortunately, the whole focus has been on that industry and not enough focus has been on the communities that have been displaced by it.  That needs to be addressed.  The Minister was with me on the agriculture committee in the past and we often discussed this issue.  It is an issue that has been left behind, totally abandoned, and it needs to be addressed. </p>  <p>  I know people who work in the timber industry.  I spoke recently to a contractor who employs 12 or 14 people.  He has trucks on the road, harvesters and forwarders, and he is trying to make a living, meet big repayments to banks, look after his family and look after the families of all the people who work for him.  He is very annoyed that all of this situation with appeals is blocking that from happening.  He also acknowledges much of what is going on in that other sector, where a lot of the land that has been planted is planted by people who have come from outside the area, and he understands why people feel aggrieved. </p>  <p>  It was emphasised that this is all marginal and poor quality land.  That marginal and poor quality land produced the finest of people in the past.  The best of people came from those communities when they were communities, but they are no longer communities.  That is a crying shame.  We need to get a bit of perspective into this.  I understand what the Ministers are trying to do and I understand what that is all about, but I also believe that many of the amendments are worthy of being accepted.  I suggest to the Ministers that they look again at this, and work and co-operate with others in this House, from all parties and none, who have co-operated with them to bring it this far.  They should look at the amendments and although some of them may not be acceptable, most are reasonable and they need to be looked at and brought to a conclusion. </p>  <p>  At the end of all of this, I would absolutely say that unless we get a forestry policy that works for communities, then we are going to have more and more problems with this issue.  It cannot be all about the timber industry.  It has to be about the people who used to live and, hopefully, will continue to live in those areas.</p> <p>If large areas of the country are to be planted, alternative employment must be ensured for the people who once lived there.  I will certainly not stand over something that results in more and more people being driven out of rural Ireland, more schools closing and more football clubs having to amalgamate.  There will be no more families living in these areas and nothing will be produced in them.  Timber will be grown before being drawn 100 miles away to a sawmill somewhere.  That does nothing for the rural communities that once lived in those places.  We need to get back to that.</p></speech>

I got notice this evening that there are no more logs at the Murray Timber sawmill in Ballon, County Carlow.  The staff of this sawmill are now without employment because there just are not any logs at that particular sawmill.</p>  <p>  I have listened to the Ministers' contributions.  They made the valid point that there is a backlog and that an opportunity to address that backlog is needed.  I understand their argument that the introduction of a strict timeline would cause a problem but I have a solution to that problem.  I tabled amendment No. 61, which is very simple.  It allows 60 days for the processing of an appeal.  I have listened to what the Ministers have said, however, and I suggest that they put a commencement order on the provision so that the time limit of 60 days might only come into force in, for argument's sake, 12 months' time, when the backlog will have been dealt with.  This would address the concerns we all have as to appeals being dealt with expeditiously but it would also deal with the immediate problem in respect of the backlog. </p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is absolutely correct that there is an issue with regard to this committee being resourced by the Department.  It has not been putting the necessary resources in.  People have called this evening for the facts to be made available to them.  The response to Parliamentary Question No. 925 of 30 July, tabled in my name, will give them the facts.  All of the data are there for people to read.  In 2017, two appeals a month were submitted to the appeals office.  There were 12 appeals per month in 2018 and 25 appeals per month in 2019.  In 2020, there were 43 appeals submitted per month.  That does not take away from the point Deputy Boyd Barrett has made, as one appeal currently before the committee was lodged more than two a half years ago and a decision has still not been made on it.  That comes down to a lack of resources being put in by the Department.  That is why this legislation in itself will not address the problem.  It will deal with the anomaly whereby one individual has to consider every single appeal made, which is unsustainable and which is why this legislation needs to be reformed and changed.  These changes are in the interests of applicants for licences and, as I said earlier, in the interests of the homeowners, who will have had this cloud hanging over them for three, four or five years.  They deserve a quick and definitive decision on appeals.</p>  <p>  We also need to ensure that a definitive deadline for the processing of applications will be introduced once the backlog is dealt with.  I ask the Minister of State to accept my amendment No. 61, and to put a commencement condition on the provision so that it will not come into force until the backlog is addressed.</p>  <p>  I want to make two final points because, sadly, I do not think we will get to the other amendments.  The first is that, as Deputy Boyd Barrett has correctly stated, there is a very significant backlog of licence applications to be processed.  My amendment No. 28 would help deal with that.  At the moment it can take as many as 900 days to get a decision on a licence application.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny is correct that we need to address the imbalances within the forestry sector, particularly with regard to communities across the country.  I represent these communities, as does Deputy Martin Kenny.  That is why I tabled some amendments to this Bill, which we will unfortunately not get the opportunity to debate, that would introduce balance and put power back into the hands of those communities.  I ask the Ministers not to dismiss those amendments purely because they come from the Opposition.  They would introduce some balance in this regard and would bring some needed fairness into the system.  I ask the Ministers to consider some of those amendments and not to dismiss them out of hand.</p></speech>

I find it difficult to accept the Government's role in the narrative being portrayed here.  I was under some pressure in respect of time earlier on and I would like to take a few minutes to go back on some of the points I was making.</p>  <p>  I absolutely believe in having a thriving woodland industry, which we need.  We need it for jobs, for sustainable life and development in our rural communities, and to deal with climate change.  We have declared a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency.  This should be a positive debate and, if the Government had led, it would have been.  I understand some of the comments made by Deputies who describe themselves as "rural" Deputies although, as I have already said, I represent a substantial rural area.</p>  <p>  The forestry programme comes to an end this year but there is no sign of a new one.  There has been no discussion of the Mackinnon report.  Perhaps the Ministers might tell us why that report was commissioned if the Government was going to ignore it.  What did that cost?  The two steps forward I mentioned earlier related to the Government.  One of these asked the Government to publish its views on this report given the urgency of the situation.  I acknowledge what Deputies here have said, which is that we do not realise there is an emergency and a crisis.  I acknowledge there is a crisis.  The Government needs to lead on that and we need to support it if it shows good leadership.</p>  <p>  Mr. Mackinnon said, "There is a clear need to establish greater impetus and momentum on woodland creation."  He used the term "woodland creation" deliberately.  He continued, "The Department should, therefore, aim to publish its views on the Review and how it plans to take forward the findings within 6 weeks of the submission of this report."  The Minister of State has not specified whether this was done.  Mr. Mackinnon acknowledged that not all actions may be accepted but he wanted the Government to make clear what actions it proposed to take and gave some other target dates.  He talked about, "Right Tree/Right Place/Right Management/Right Objectives."</p>  <p>  I am really tired of divisive debate and the division between the rural community and city life.  I am in the privileged position of representing both and I want to see the rural areas thrive.  It is not good to develop our cities out of all proportion.  The Ministers cannot, however, come here tonight and wash their hands of their role in this divisive debate.  They cannot ignore Mr. Mackinnon's findings and the issues he has clearly set out.  I will not use the word "blame" but my analysis of what he has said is that he identifies an absence of leadership by Government.  He asks for a clear guideline from the Government.  </p>  <p>  I will read out some of Mr. Mackinnon's report but I will limit my comments as I am due back in the Chair.  He said, "A consistent theme emerging during the Review was the lack of political commitment and priority from the Irish Government to woodland creation."  He compared and contrasted it with the situation in Scotland and said, "The forestry sector in Ireland does not exude a similar confidence and optimism although there is clearly an ambition", although there is no backing of that ambition.  He identifies, "a failure to tackle the problems with licensing", and also notes that the system is "overburdened with paper".</p> <p>He went on to say, "The impression gained during the review is that State bodies are not as engaged in helping deliver the afforestation programme as they could and should be".  He also stated, "The number of inspectors has remained constant" although he noted the complexity of their work has greatly increased, including the obligations under the habitats directive.  He noted how a number of inspectors feel isolated and refers to 14 locations throughout the country where many feel isolated and not sufficiently supported.  He further stated, "It was suggested that the inspectorate were too focused on individual site appraisal and had lost sight of the bigger picture in relation to forestry's role", which I understand perfectly, particularly in view of the pressure on them.</p> <p> At total of 22 issues were raised and recommendations were made, but there has been no reference to them tonight.  Instead, we have a divisive debate on people who would go to the trouble of putting in submissions - not objections.  We are utterly reliant on them.  We passed whistleblower legislation because of the value of the ordinary person in telling us what is wrong.  The courts, which are not known for their radical nature, have told us of the vital role of the ordinary person in the planning process and in this process.  Yet, tonight we are talking about a multiplicity of objections when there is absolutely no evidence of this.  Like Deputy Boyd Barrett, I call on the Minister and the Minister of State to provide the evidence.  I am a pragmatic, practical woman.  I am willing to look at evidence and change my mind if that is necessary.  However, the Minister and Minister of State have not done that.  They have disingenuously allowed this type of debate to develop when really we should be having a positive debate on the wonderful asset that is our forestry.  We should discuss the question of how, in 120 years, we have gone from 2% to 11%.  That is a scandal, not to mention the under-resourcing of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Then, the Government brings in this legislation and we blame the people who have done their utmost to alert us to what is wrong.</p> <p> I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to let sense prevail at some stage in the D&aacute;il - the seat of democracy - in respect of this matter.  All these amendments were tabled by us in goodwill.  Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State has looked at one of them or taken one on board.  One could leave here tonight despondent, except that is a luxury we cannot afford.  Having declared an emergency on climate change and biodiversity and given the necessity of this industry to jobs in rural areas, I cannot go out of here despondent.  I appeal to Deputies to unite instead of dividing and carry out an analysis of what is needed.  In that context, I cannot support the specific amendment, although I fully understand from where the Deputy is coming.</p></speech>

I will be pointing out to Deputies Boyd Barrett and Connolly that the whole point of the amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzmaurice is that we would speed up the appeals; it is not that we would not have appeals.  Many appeals are quite questionable, but that is not what his amendment is for.  It is clear what his amendment is for.  It is to speed up the process.</p>  <p>  People can read all the percentages in the wide earthly world about how many appeals are being made or how many are not.  We can argue here until the cows come home, as we used to say long ago, about how many appeals are being made, but the fact is that Deputy Fitzmaurice was clear in his amendment.  It states that we should speed up any appeals that are being made.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated that it will now be the Minister of the day's decision.  There was an old saying when I was growing up that doctors differ and patients die.  The current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine can agree with this fact: there have been four agriculture Ministers in this Government.  This Government is new but there have been four agriculture Ministers.  It may be the Minister of State today but it may not be her in several months' time.  Who knows?  Basically, every Minister who comes in makes a decision on the length of time that an appeal or a person held up waiting to have a forest felled or cleared will be allowed.  It will be at the behest of the Minister of the day.  If he or she has a different agenda to another Minister, it could be speeded up or delayed.  That is a crazy situation.  It should not be the case.  The amount of time that an appeal will be allowed and the timing of it should be clear, in black and white.</p>  <p>  I made a submission when this was put before the people maybe one month or six weeks ago.  I did not say that people did not have the right to appeal.  I will not have it thrown at me down the road that people are not allowed to appeal.  As I said, there are many suspicious appeals but I put forward a strong submission that would weed out many fake appeals.</p>  <p>  My concern is for anyone who is going to plant forestry.  As we can see, the Government will not meet its targets this year.  The Government will be far short of the targets this year, as I said earlier.  We are trying to appeal to farmers to look at different ways of farming.  In my constituency of Cork South-West, it is becoming more and more difficult to carry out types of beef farming and many farmers are looking at forestry.  I do not believe it is an attractive option at the moment given the way this is being handled and the way things are going on.  There is talk of a REPS coming along under the new CAP.  Certainly, better funding for the planting of trees has to be considered, but will it be an option?  The first question to be raised will be what if farmers can plant but cannot fell afterwards.  It will be up to the Minister of the day.  If one Minister is more extreme than the next, it may slow up the entire process and make it worse.</p>  <p>  There are 22 pages of amendments.  It looks like we can discuss them all right, but we are all wasting our time because the Minister and the Minister of State have their minds made up.  I think all 22 pages will be thrown in the bin.  Maybe they will correct me if I am wrong but it certainly looks like that.</p>  <p>  I want to go back to the main point.  Deputy Fitzmaurice's amendment is clear.  I am surprised that the Minister and the Minister of State will not take it on board.  They have their minds set that it is their show or no show.  I do not think that is the right way to do it.  They were looking for the goodwill of the D&aacute;il but they have really turned it against themselves.  I will certainly still be supporting the amendment.  I plead with the Minister and Minister of State to reconsider.  Deputy Denis Naughten gave them an option some time ago.  They might consider that option.</p></speech>

I find it bizarre and incredibly frustrating - I imagine the same goes for people watching - that the Opposition has essentially let the Government off the hook.  We will not hear how the Government will respond to the vast majority of amendments.  These are important amendments that have been put in following consultation with communities and the sector in respect of: the membership of the forestry appeals committee, the period that individuals, organisations and community groups have to appeal and deficiencies that have been pointed out to us in the Bill.</p> <p>We have spent more than three hours on amendment No. 1.  If that amendment is put to a vote, it is very likely we will not reach even amendment No. 2 and certainly not the third group of amendments.  I want to record my frustration and the disappointment that many people will have because we have effectively filibustered ourselves out of the opportunity to make our points to the Government on these important matters.</p></speech>

Another 1 million tonnes are stuck at the application stage.  Deputies, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, asked about statistics, so I will outline a couple.  In the past four years, the FAC has heard only 33% of the appeals that have been put forward.  In the middle of the greatest crisis the industry has ever seen, the committee has held no hearing since 31 July.  What message does that send to the industry?  The total number of appeals is 739 and the total number heard is 239, leaving 500 outstanding.</p>  <p>  I will not name anybody, but is it not extraordinary that 80% of those appeals were made by two individuals?  That is not right or normal.  It is similar to what happens in a local authority.  Deputies spoke about people's right to make objections and I could not agree more.  People have the right to make genuine objections.  If a person is affected detrimentally, whether because a house or a forest is being built, and if it will impact on the person or his or her family or community in some way, he or she should absolutely be entitled to make an objection or appeal.  How could it be normal, however, for two people to have made 80% of the appeals clogging up the process?  How could that be right or acceptable?  We have to legislate against such behaviour, in the exact same way that a local authority deals with objections to planning applications.  Is it not the same thing?</p>  <p>  The majority of normal people go through their lives without ever having to object to someone else's planning application, yet there are serial objectors who continually hound their friends - if they have friends - their neighbours and the people in their communities by lodging objections to planning applications.  That is not normal behaviour.  I know of individuals who at this minute have five, ten or 20 objections pending on people's planning files.  Nobody will ever convince me that is normal or acceptable behaviour.  I agreed with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle earlier when she stated people have to have the right to appeal and object.  She is 100% correct, but it is 100% wrong that there are serial objectors.  That is not normal behaviour.  It is not right and it does not make common sense for any one person or two persons to choke up a whole industry and hold it to ransom.  That is not right.  It does not make sense.</p>  <p>  I hope the Deputies who gave false information during the debate, because of some stupid tweet they read on their computers, will listen to the facts I outlined a moment ago about the millions of tonnes of timber that are standing in forests and that should be processed.  The forests have gone beyond the time in which they should have been harvested, and damage is being done to them because they are not being thinned or clear-felled in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael Healy-Rae hit the nail on the head.  We have no problem with appeals.  We understand the planning process, as was noted earlier.  There has to be a right for people to protect their property, families and communities, but 80-plus appeals should not be lodged by one person.  Surely these people are educated and smart; we will not take that from them.  They have found a major deficiency in the legislation.  We tried to amend it by providing for penalties but we have not even got to discuss that.</p>  <p>  To pick up on the points made by Deputies Carthy and Cairns, I will not take lectures from either of them.  We saw, during the debate on the first amendment, that the Government was dead set against any amendments being accepted.  That is why we are stuck on this.  It is not a filibuster; we are so horrified.  Deputy Carthy made the excuse that he had not been in the House for the past day or two.  In the Seanad again last week, the Minister of State said two amendments of 103 would be accepted.  We knew, therefore, that we would be wasting our time here, so we might as well dig in our heels here and do what we have done.  It is shocking.  We represent people too.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not the only Opposition party.  In fact, I wonder whether it is part of the Government at the moment.  I am putting that point to Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

It was always going to happen that we would be in this situation, which is why I kicked up about it on the Order of Business yesterday.  The normal process of pre-legislative scrutiny would have meant we would have dealt with much of this earlier.  We would have dug into the detail earlier, as well as the debates and the proper consultation that should have happened, and it would have been sequenced.  There would have been time between each Stage.  That is what is needed for proper legislation.  The Government, however, wanted to ram this through and it was always going to be a mess.</p>  <p>  Our group has tabled more amendments than anybody, so I am just as frustrated as Deputy Cairns.

I do not know who the person is.  It is interesting, however, that 61% of those appeals were accepted, so there is a problem.  I reiterate that rather than us tearing out one another's eyes over this legislation, which is a set-up, we should look over at the Government.

I am disappointed we are not getting an opportunity to debate them fully and in time.  If Deputy Cairns is concerned about one particular amendment she tabled that is essentially the same as an amendment in the Seanad last week, then the debate is there and my views and those of the Government still stand.  We will not have changed our views on those duplicate amendments from last week to this week.<br/><br/>I will go back to the points on the timing.  Even if there was a fixed time in the Bill and even if an appeal had not been heard, it would not fall and it would still exist.  All we would do is put pressure on that FAC and open it up to scrutiny that it would not be able to cope with at this stage.  Deputy Pringle asked where the provision was in the legislation.  Section 14E(1)(<i>f</i>) provides for a statutory instrument to be written to insert a time limit if we deem it necessary.  That would not be for one particular appeal or another.  It would be across the board.<br/><br/>To go back to Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments about appeals, all forestry licences can be appealed.  It is not only for afforestation, felling or roads.  If they are appealed, they all go through the same committee and the committee does not determine which appeals it will look at.  The same FAC will hear all of those appeals.  If it is of any use, we are willing to offer that once the Bill is hopefully enacted, after six months we could submit a report to the Oireachtas based on how the six months of the subdivisions of the appeals committee has functioned, perhaps in advance of any statutory instrument on applying a time limit for how quickly the appeals would be made and conducted.<br/><br/>The purpose of this Bill is to make the forestry appeals committee more efficient and effective and the main provision for that is to subdivide it.  We currently have one committee examining all appeals.  If more than 400 appeals are sitting in the FAC and waiting to be heard, the current legislation only provides for one appeal to be looked at.  The most significant aspect of the legislation is to allow that to subdivide.  If we can populate the FAC and subdivide it into groups of two for each committee, we could have three or four committees.  That would be a fourfold increase in the number of appeals being heard.  Hopefully, the FAC will hear multiple appeals within a week.<br/><br/>We can discuss the timeline being three months or six months but we should give the process a chance.  If it is not working, we will have to review it, and I do not want it to get to a stage where jobs are lost in the forestry sector.  This is ultimately why we are up against it in terms of time and why we do not have the time to discuss the Bill properly.  It is a crisis and it is emergency legislation.</p></speech>

My question was not about whether the Government would take amendments from the Seanad.  I know that has happened.  Will the Minister or the Minister of State consider any amendments that Deputies have put forward this evening or are we wasting our time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-30a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000066#TTT00400"><p>I regret that the Minister of State's response clearly implies that out of the 111 amendments that were put before her by this House in respect of this Bill, not a single one will be accepted by the Government because the Minister and the Minister of State have been asked on a number of occasions to clarify whether there are any amendments they are willing to accept.  I reiterate my assertion that this is incredibly disappointing.  It shows a bad faith approach, not by the Minister of State because I accept that she is new to this and she wants to get this legislation over the line, but the Department has failed in forestry.</p><p>The reason this legislation has been brought forward at the eleventh hour is the Department has been incompetent when it comes to dealing with this issue.  Did the officials in the Department not know a year ago what everybody else knew?  Is there not somebody in the Department who reads the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, if for nothing else than to see whether there is an issue coming down the line?  I sometimes wonder about that because when we table parliamentary questions in respect of issues that are being raised by farmers, the first instinct of the Department is to deny there is any issue at all.  The Department always waits until we have no fodder, prices have hit the floor, farmers are outside factory gates or some other issue such as 40 outbreaks of Covid-19 in meat factories before it will accept there is an issue at all.  There is a sense of infallibility that runs through everything the Department does that needs to change.  Departmental officials need the Minister of State and the Minister to tell them that there needs to be a change of attitude, and not only in how they deal with Opposition parties because we are just politicians at the end of the day.  Crucially, there needs to be a change in how they deal with people at the coalface of our rural heartlands, whether that be farmers, those involved in the forestry sector or those communities.</p><p>I entirely accept the right of people to raise objections.  In fact, seeing some of the forests and the disasters that have been foisted on communities in places such as Leitrim, I respect and admire those who stand up to some of the bad decisions that have been made and who see it as their job of work to frustrate.  However, I also take on board the criticisms and anger Members have over a small number of serial objectors who are simply playing games.  My previous commentary was not to have a dig or to try to deflect attention from the Government.  We would have been better served collectively if we forced the Government to outline its position on a number of amendments because some good amendments have been tabled, not just by Sinn F&eacute;in but by every Opposition group.  It is shameful that the Government has not, and will not, consider a single one of those.</p></speech>

I refute that on behalf of the Rural Independent Group.  We did not even look at the Seanad amendments because our amendments had to be submitted by 10 a.m. last Friday and the Seanad debated its amendments on Friday.  We have enough intelligence to put forward our own amendments.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins mentioned that many people, including farmers, sawmill workers, haulage contractors, timber contractors and builders have told us what the problem is.  It is as plain as the noses on our faces.  It is the inept Department and the management who are still in charge.  If that was not bad enough, when we had the situation at the gates of the factories last year, who did the former Minister, Deputy Creed put in charge?  He appointed a retired Secretary General of the Department to be an independent arbiter.  Who is codding who here?</p>  <p>  The Government cannot see the wood from the trees here, if Members will pardon the pun.  The Government is going nowhere.  Tosach maith leath na hoibre ach droch-thosach ar fad at&aacute; anseo.  It is a disaster for the Government.  Deputy Fitzmaurice made reference earlier to the pride of being elected representatives and the privilege of being in government.  The Minister and the Minister of State should have the self-respect to tell these managers to get back in their boxes, deal with the work they should be doing and not persecute farmers.</p>  <p>  There are deadlines for everything farmers want to do.  There are slurry deadlines, which are ridiculous, yet we cannot have a deadline for decisions on applications to cut trees.  The Government is codding nobody.  There are deadlines for everything, including slurry spreading, lime spreading and ploughing.  There are regulations on whether one can plough up a hill or down a hill.  It is farcical how many deadlines there are and the Government is paying fines to its friends in Europe as well but we cannot have a deadline here.  I do not buy that at all.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to clarify those points.</p></speech>
