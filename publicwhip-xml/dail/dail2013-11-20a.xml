Following a careful and thorough assessment of all of the available options, and various consultations with the European Commission, the ECB, the IMF, the President and members of the Eurogroup, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency, the decision was taken to exit the programme without a prearranged precautionary facility or backstop.</p><p>  All along I have indicated that the decision was finely balanced, and since the announcement of the decision many commentators have also acknowledged that to be the case.  That said, taking all factors into account, exiting our EU-IMF programme of financial assistance without a prearranged precautionary facility or backstop is the right decision for Ireland.  This view is widely held both in Ireland and abroad, based on the generally positive reaction to our decision. </p><p>  Market confidence in Ireland is high, the public finances are under control, we are reducing our deficit and debt levels, and economic conditions and sentiment are improving.  We have already returned successfully to the financial markets.  We have a domestic backstop in place, with cash reserves expected to be approximately &euro;20 billion by the end of the year.  This option represents greater normalisation, with Ireland now subject to EU economic co-ordination, fiscal surveillance and governance rules that apply to other EU and euro area member states that are not in a programme of assistance.</p><p>  This decision is the latest in a series of steps to return Ireland to normal economic, budgetary and funding conditions.  Like most other sovereign eurozone countries, from 2014 we will be in a position to fund ourselves normally on the markets.  Confidence in Ireland has improved considerably in recent months and interest rates on Irish Government bonds are at highly affordable levels.  This is the right decision for Ireland.  We will be exiting the bailout in a strong position.</p></reply>

The Minister has acknowledged that the decision was finely balanced, with arguments on both sides.  Two issues that arise as a result of our not applying for a precautionary credit line are important.  One is that we will be excluded from the ECB's outright monetary transactions, OMT, policy, the ultimate backstop in the event that we need it.  The other is to do with the failure to reach an overall agreement on the single resolution mechanism at last week's ECOFIN meeting.  This means that if next year's stress test shows a capital shortfall, particularly in the case of AIB and Permanent TSB, the national authority - the State - would come in ahead of the ESM to plug that hole.  Neither the Minister nor I know whether that capital shortfall could happen.  Did the Minister get a feel for the conditions that would have applied in the event that we had sought a precautionary credit line, to which we will not now be subject by virtue of our decision not to seek such a credit line?</p></speech>

However, I gathered an amount of useful information as I talked to different people.  There is a misunderstanding in Ireland, even at the highest levels of economic thinking, about OMT.  I had a long conversation with Mario Draghi and his two deputy presidents in Frankfurt.  OMT is not a policy for intervening in individual countries that are in difficulty.  If Ireland had a problem, OMT would not be the solution.  If there is a systemic difficulty with the euro affecting several countries across the eurozone, OMT is an option.  While being part of a programme is one of the conditions necessary to avail of OMT, it does not automatically make a country eligible for OMT.</p><p>  OMT has never been applied.  According to Mr. Draghi, OMT is for a systemic crisis in the euro and will apply across the eurozone.  If we got into that position it would apply to Ireland as to any other country.  For any country that would avail of it there would be conditions, so there would be some form of programme.  We have not ruled ourselves out or in, or changed our position at all.  There is a serious misunderstanding in Ireland about how OMT operates.</p></speech>

If that systemic risk exists, all countries could potentially benefit from OMT, even those that are not in a precautionary credit line.  Has the Minister received that reassurance from Mr. Draghi?  That is a very important point to clarify.</p></speech>

According to Mr. Draghi and the other ECB officials, it is a policy device to deal with a systemic crisis across the eurozone.  By definition, if that happens, several countries will need and get that assistance under certain conditions.  Because there is conditionality, they would be in some kind of programme, so they would fulfil the precondition of being in a programme.  It is all theory.  It has never happened and OMT has never been used.  It was a great announcement which calmed down the eurozone without anyone spending any money.  I have assurances along those lines.</p></speech>

However, there is serious concern now that the hope given to the people at that time that the many of billions of euro pumped into our pillar banks would be recouped to Irish taxpayers is disappearing.  I raise this question because I want to keep this issue on the agenda and to find out what discussions, if any, happened at the ECOFIN or Eurogroup meetings this week in regard to retroactive recapitalisation of our banks.</p></reply>

The Eurogroup meeting of 20 June 2013 agreed on the main features of the ESM's direct bank recapitalisation, DBR, instrument.  There is a specific provision included in those main features which states: &ldquo;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&rdquo;  Therefore, the agreement, which we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility of our applying to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  The DBR instrument will come into effect when the single supervisory mechanism is in place and operational.  This is not expected to take place until the second half of 2014.  The Eurogroup has agreed that there will be strict eligibility criteria as well as a clear pecking order for the ESM-DBR instrument, so any possible application for DBR will be determined on its own merits within the rules laid down by the ESM&rsquo;s DBR instrument.  The overall framework agreed this summer builds upon the earlier euro area Heads of State or Government agreement secured on 29 June 2012 and is an important step in the eurozone&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.</p><p>  I remain confident that the commitment made by ECOFIN in June last year to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.  The DBR issue was not on the agendas of the most recent ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings.</p></speech>

At the time I believed and said publicly that the Minister had oversold that commitment, because retrospectivity was not a part of the agreement.  That said, it has been negotiated into some text recently.  However, we must listen to the head of the Eurogroup, the German finance Minister, the troika and the head of the ESM.  All of these, in one way or another, have told us that the chances of retroactive recapitalisation of our banks are slim, that it is impossible, not likely, or words to that effect.  It seems the door is closing all the time.  The Minister talks about separating sovereign debt from banking debt, but ECOFIN has agreed rules that state clearly that in the event that a comprehensive stress test reveals a capital shortfall, the established pecking order is as follows: first private sources, then national, and then euro and EU instruments-----</p></speech>

The conclusions of the October 2013 European Council outline the hierarchy of decision-making for bank recapitalisation - to which the Deputy referred - and continue to provide for direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM as part of the process.  Of course there are different opinions, and the Deputy has mentioned some of those who see a very limited role for direct capitalisation by the ESM.  However, other countries are strongly in favour of it.  I believe the issue will only come to a head when the capital requirements of the European banking system are identified through the stress testing next autumn, but it is part of the process.</p><p>  The Eurogroup does not use the word &quot;retrospective&quot; in the piece I cited.  It refers instead to the &quot;potential retroactive application of the instrument&quot; and says it should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.  The word &quot;retroactive&quot; is the word being used, rather than &quot;retrospective&quot;.</p></speech>

There was a window of opportunity when Spain was in crisis, which was when this was agreed.  I believe many of the European leaders would not have wanted it, but that was when we should have stuck the ball in the net.  Now, 17 months further on, it will be a harder job for the Minister and the Government to deliver the commitment given, although I fully support their efforts.</p><p>  Can the Minister elaborate on what efforts are being made?  The Minister did not raise the issue at the ECOFIN or Eurogroup meetings, although the issue of the pecking order was discussed at ECOFIN.  When was the last time the Minister raised the issue at a formal meeting of ECOFIN and the Eurogroup?  What has been the response of his counterparts at those meetings?  For example, when we met with the troika recently, the ECB president did not talk about recapitalisation being off the agenda.  It is on the agenda.  What he said was that retroactive application of the instrument was off the agenda.  That is where the difficulty lies, due to political circumstances and all the rest.  When was the last time the Minister raised the issue of retroactive recapitalisation for Ireland, given that the Taoiseach took it upon himself to write to every EU leader in the past three weeks saying that the fulfilment of this commitment was required in order for us to get back into the markets sustainably after the troika exit?</p></speech>

Ultimately, this resulted in an injection of approximately  &euro;100 million from the UK group into the Irish company.  I am very concerned because this is the second time in a number of years that under-provisioning for future claims by insurance companies in Ireland has been identified.  It appears this particular issue was identified by the company through its internal audit function, rather than by the Financial Regulator or the Central Bank.

Day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.  The Central Bank of Ireland has had an ongoing programme of engagement with RSA Insurance Ireland, RSAII, since the implementation of the bank&rsquo;s probability risk and impact system, PRISM, as it does with all high-impact companies.  As part of the framework, the Central Bank of Ireland engages with firms at a level that corresponds to their impact category; the higher the impact, the higher the level of engagement.  Engagement involves reviews, inspections and meetings, and the frequency and level of engagement is associated with a firm's impact<i></i>rating.<i></i>I am satisfied that this improved regulatory framework provides for enhanced supervision of the industry and protection of the Irish consumer.  With regard to RSA, this programme included eight on-site inspections over a two-year period and ongoing meetings with key role holders such as the chief executive officer, chief finance officer and chief risk officer.</p><p>  The Central Bank carried out an on-site review of claims cases in RSAII in August 2013 and at this point identified an issue with regard to delays in increasing case reserves for large claims in a timely manner.  The identification of this issue by the Central Bank informed the terms of an internal audit that RSAII had scheduled in the same area.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised me that it has not had to take direct supervisory measures in relation to recent issues at RSAII, owing to the swift and prompt action by RSA Insurance plc and its ongoing engagement with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank will continue to liaise with RSAII and other stakeholders to ensure all matters identified are resolved to the Central Bank's satisfaction.</p><p> Separate from the current matters arising in RSAII, the Central Bank published a consultation document in September on requirements for reserving and pricing for non-life insurers.  The Central Bank proposes to introduce new measures to strengthen its supervisory framework, including requirements in respect of actuarial opinions, internal audit and the governance of reserving.</p><p> In addition to increased staffing levels and the new risk-based supervision framework, PRISM, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, passed on 11 July, enhances the power of the Central Bank to regulate, supervise and take action against financial service providers.  The enhanced powers include whistleblower protection and powers of inspection, investigation and information gathering for Central Bank authorised officers.</p><p> At EU level a directive known as Solvency I places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events.  Furthermore, on 1 January 2016 Solvency II will commence.  The Solvency II EU directive will require new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers, with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  This will ensure a modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance undertakings.  Negotiations on the directive reached political agreement on 13 November and preparations are already under way for its implementation in Ireland.</p><p> While I am concerned about the issues identified by the Central Bank in the case referred to, I am confident that the improved powers of the Central Bank and the improved regulatory framework, as described, will ensure a safe and solid insurance sector that can provide sustainable insurance products and support the real economy through long-term investments and additional stability.</p></speech>

Thankfully, RSA is part of a UK group; therefore, the State and Irish policyholders were not on the hook for the additional money.  If it had involved an Irish company only, potentially we were looking at another call on the insurance compensation fund and a possible increase in the 2% levy people pay for the losses at the Quinn Insurance group which could potentially amount to &euro;1.6 billion.</p><p>  I checked again this morning and can find no statement whatsoever on the Central Bank's website on RSA.  Is the Minister satisfied the issues the company brought into the public domain were originally identified by the Central Bank and not by the company?  The company has made the unchallenged claim these issues were identified during a routine internal audit through its own internal function.  It does not in any way state this was informed by earlier findings by the Central Bank.  This is a very important question we need to have answered.  Did the Central Bank identify these issues in the first place or was it the company which brought them to its attention?</p></speech>

According to the first point, RSA brought the findings of the internal audit report to the attention of the Central Bank as soon as they became known on 1 November 2013.  The RSA group then took action and last week injected &euro;100 million in capital after discussions with the Central Bank.  The additional capital was taken with solvency capital requirements of 228% and is in excess of the 200% level required by the Central Bank.  The RSA group has assured the Central Bank it will provide any further capital required, should it be necessary to do so at the end of the current investigation.</p><p>  On 9 November RSA suspended three senior executives, namely, the chief executive, Mr. Philip Smyth; the chief financial officer, Mr. Rory O'Connor, and the claims director, Mr. Peter Burke, pending an investigation into issues involving its Irish claims and finance functions.  RSA appointed the chief executive of its UK and western European division as acting head of the Irish business.  Another gentleman, Mr. Rash, the group chief accountant, has taken over as acting chief financial officer, while Mr. Pitt, claims director for the UK and western Europe, is taking over operational leadership of the Irish claims function.  RSA acted very expeditiously when this issue came to notice.</p></speech>

Earlier in his first response he referred to findings the Central Bank had made, perhaps as far back as June, which it claimed had forms the basis of the internal audit work RSA subsequently undertook.  It is important to get to the bottom of this issue because it is the second time in a number of years when significant market players in the Irish insurance sector have been aggressively building market share on the back of attractive premium claims while clearly under-provisioning for future losses in respect of future claims.  I want to know whether the Central Bank has a good handle on the sector.  In his first response the Minister referred to findings made in June which the Central Bank claimed had formed the basis of RSA's internal audit work.</p></speech>

The reply also states the Central Bank carried out an on-site review of claims cases in RSA in August 2013 and at this point identified an issue with delays in increasing case reserves for large claims in a timely manner.  The audit results then came in from RSA in early November and immediate action was taken by RSA in consultation with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is happy it has a full handle on the issue and it has committed that if there are other discrepancies, the obligation to fund will be with RSA's parent company in the United Kingdom, not with the Irish Government or any Irish fund of any sort.</p></speech>

Despite efforts and various proposals, it seems it is not waning substantially.  There has been much discussion on threats of repossession, the letters issued by the banks, the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, and the issue of tracker mortgages.  What communication has the Minister had with the Central Bank on these targets, particularly the legal letters issued by the banks?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000005#C00800"><p>I have stated on many occasions that it is a key responsibility of financial institutions to do more to assist those in severe financial difficulty.  The implementation of sustainable mortgage arrears strategies and solutions by individual banks for their distressed customers, with Central Bank oversight, is, therefore, a key element of the overall framework to address the mortgage arrears problem.  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank&rsquo;s mortgage arrears resolution targets, or MART initiative, which was announced last March set time-bound and measurable targets for the six main lenders, requiring them to systematically address their arrears books.  The Central Bank initially required the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages in arrears for over 90 days by the end of June.  The initial results of the Central Bank's audit of the banks' end of June returns will be available shortly.  They will provide an independent assessment of compliance by the banks with all MART requirements.</p><p>  The target for proposed solutions rose to 30% by the end of September and will increase to 50% by the end of December and 70% by end of March 2014.  Lenders have submitted their end of September returns to the Central Bank and indicated that they have met and, in some cases, exceeded the 30% end of September target.  The Central Bank is now also requiring banks to conclude sustainable solutions with 15% of their customers by the end of this year and 25% by the end of March 2014.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank publishes quarterly statistics for the levels of mortgage arrears.  As of June 2013, some 79,357 PDH mortgages had been restructured, of which over 60,000 were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangements.  The Central Bank has informed me that updated data for September 2013 are due for publication around the end of November.</p><p> Separately from Central Bank quarterly reports, my Department is publishing monthly data for primary home mortgage restructures put in place by the six main lenders covered by the Central Bank's MART process.  This will place more timely information in the public domain on the progress made by the main banks to resolve mortgages in difficulty.  This should greatly assist the objective of placing more information in the public domain on the progress being made by banks on mortgage restructures.  The recently published data from my Department for the end of September show that the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears for greater than 90 days had fallen from 82,624 to 81,156, a drop of 1,468 accounts.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p> I have previously informed the House that letters threatening repossession or legal action could not, in my opinion, be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets process and should only ever be considered after every possible avenue for a solution has been exhausted.  The Governor of the Central Bank has stated any bank proceeding lightly to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers without satisfying the protections of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, or where alternative sustainable arrangements are available, is not acting in a manner consistent with the MART regime.</p><p> Regarding the tracker issue, officials from the Irish authorities are in regular dialogue with all of the State supported banks in an effort to enhance stability and facilitate the sector's return to profitability.  The long-term profitability of the State supported banks depends on many variables, of which the impact of tracker mortgages is only one.  The Irish authorities have also engaged with the troika to discuss possible ways of funding Irish banks' tracker mortgages at an overall lower cost and in a sustainable manner.  Discussions to date have mainly focused on examining the tracker books of the domestic banks and the implications that alternative funding costs will have for the loan books and the profitability of the banks in question.  Discussions have been exploratory in nature and further analysis is being carried out.</p></speech>

However, they also told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform the same thing.  It took a great deal of digging on the part of the members of the joint committee before it emerged that 15,000 legal letters had been issued and that the process in this regard was being regarded by the banks as one of the ways in which they could reach the targets.  Has the Minister informed the Central Bank of his analysis which he has highlighted publicly to the effect that the issuing of legal letters is not acceptable under the MART process?</p><p>  As the Minister stated, his Department is publishing the relevant figures.  I welcome this important initiative because it assists us in fully understanding what is happening.  However, the figures indicate that 118,000 mortgages remain in arrears and that two thirds of them are in arrears for over 90 days.  The really eye-catching aspect is that 77% of them have not been restructured.  Worse again, the figures show that the number of mortgages in arrears for over 90 days which have not been restructured actually increased since August last year.  Is the process working?  It lacked ambition from the outset.  After five years of a mortgage crisis is the Minister satisfied that 118,000 mortgages remain in arrears and that three quarters of them have still not been restructured by the banks?</p></speech>

The Governor of the Central Bank has stated any bank proceeding lightly to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers without satisfying the protections of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, or where alternative sustainable arrangements are available, is not acting in a manner consistent with the MART regime.  It is true that quite a number of mortgages are in arrears.  The banks under the direction of the Central Bank are moving through these mortgages systematically in order to ensure proposals will be made to each mortgage holder and that sustainable restructuring will take place.  A more important statistic in respect of the people involved is that they continue to live in their own homes, despite the fact that their mortgages are in arrears.  Ensuring they remain there is the primary policy objective.</p></speech>

He should light a fire under them, as well as the Central Bank.  He is in his third year in office and I am sure he finds it unacceptable that 118,000 mortgages remain in arrears and that 77% of them have not been restructured.  These are the figures of failure.  When he entered office, the Minister was lighting fires or at least he was talking tough with the banks.  When the ECB dropped its interest rate, he stated the banks should pass on the reduction to their customers.  Would he be willing to reiterate these comments, given that the ECB has reduced its interest rate to an all-time low?</p><p>  Tracker mortgages constitute a major issue for a number of the banks.  Are there proposals on the table or is the Department developing any proposal to ease the burden within financial institutions in respect of these mortgages in order that the costs relating to them will not have to be shouldered by those with variable rate mortgages?</p></speech>

Furthermore, we will also be obliged to meet requirements to reduce our deficit and pay down huge debts that are not ours.  We must do this over a specified period and in line with the fiscal treaty, for which the Government encouraged the people to vote.

Until the end of 2015, Ireland will remain subject to the requirements of the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  These requirements are for a general Government deficit that does not exceed 5.1% of GDP in 2014 and 2.9% of GDP in 2015.  Budget 2014 targets a general Government deficit of 4.8% of GDP next year and we remain on track to correct our excessive deficit in 2015.  These are legal requirements, but, even leaving them aside, it is imperative that we bring our deficit down to more sustainable levels.  When the excessive deficit has been corrected, the public finances in Ireland will be subject to the preventive arm of the pact and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, TSCG.  The preventive arm of the pact requires member states to be at, or to be adjusting sufficiently rapidly towards, their country-specific medium-term objective, MTO.  Ireland's MTO is a balanced budget in structural terms.  From 2016 onwards, therefore, the general Government deficit, after adjusting for the impact of the cycle and other once-off factors, will be required to converge at a sufficiently rapid pace towards balance, at a minimum rate of 0.5% per annum.  Revisions to the preventive arm under the six pack introduce the concept of the expenditure benchmark.  The rationale for this is to ensure public expenditure is not permanently increased on foot of temporary tax or other revenues.</p><p>  From 2016 onwards, the requirements of the debt correction rule, as laid out in both the pact and the TSCG, will also begin to apply.  The debt correction rule states debt in excess of 60% of GDP must be reduced by an average of at least one twentieth of the difference between the actual debt ratio and 60% of the GDP threshold per year based on changes in the debt ratio over three years.  In the context of the debt correction rule, there is a transition period for member states such as Ireland that were subject to an excessive deficit procedure as of November 2011.  This means that the one twentieth rule will only fully apply from 2019 onwards.  In the interim , satisfactory progress in reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio will be needed and this will be assessed by the European Commission and ECOFIN.  My Department projects that having reached and maintained our MTO of a structural budget balance, the debt correction rule will, under reasonable growth assumptions, be achieved.</p><p>  Ireland will be required to implement fiscal policy that keeps it on the adjustment path towards its MTO of a balanced budget, in structural terms, and sustains it thereafter.  Ireland will also be required to comply with the expenditure benchmark in the Stability and Growth Pact.  This will limit the growth in nominal expenditure to very modest levels.  However, it should be noted that complying with our fiscal requirements in the post-2015 period will not necessarily require further tax increases or cuts in nominal expenditure because constraining spending growth to comply with the expenditure benchmark will help considerably towards this end.</p></reply>

On leaving the programme, Ireland will be subject to just as rigorous a regime of budgetary surveillance, monitoring and debt and deficit reduction as it endured under the programme.  Behind all the jargon, technocratic language and interesting names for the various programmes lies the fact that we will have to pay off &euro;100 billion of debt at a rate of 5% per annum after we exit the programme.  The Minister should spell that out in clear language.  He indicated there will be a lead-in time of three years.  However, during that lead-in period, we must move towards a position of paying off one twentieth of &euro;100 billion or &euro;5 billion per annum.  The growth the Minister had hoped would rescue us from this scenario has not materialised as all the Department's forecasts have been wrong.  Does this not mean that we are faced with a decade of further austerity, even after our so-called exit from the programme?</p></speech>

All 18 Eurogroup members are subject to the new rules.  The survival of the euro is a close run thing, which has resulted in agreements being made across the eurozone which, in their totality, effectively amount to a fiscal union as well as a currency union.  What I spelled out were the elements of the fiscal union that will apply across the eurozone.</p><p>  The next element to deal with the crisis is banking union.  We are moving from a currency union to a fiscal union and we will subsequently move to a banking union.  This is the way in which Europe has progressed.  While Deputy Boyd Barrett probably does not agree with what has taken place, I am simply describing the factual position.  The simplest way of putting it in ordinary language is that we cannot increase spending by more than the growth rate in the economy.  If we increase expenditure by more than our growth rate, we will be in trouble as we will run foul of the new rules. </p></speech>

As the Minister correctly stated, if growth does not materialise, Ireland will be in deep trouble because, unlike every other country in Europe, we have a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120% and a debt-to-GNP ratio of 150%.  The requirement to pay down &euro;200 billion in debt that is not ours will be a noose around our necks.  If the growth projections do not materialise - and there is little sign of them materialising - we are banjaxed.  The reality of this needs to be spelled out to people and radical measures taken to address the failure of Government policies to generate economic growth because austerity is killing growth.</p></speech>

I refer to the recent letters issued by the Revenue Commissioners and the cost of that operation, the mistake regarding first-time buyers and so forth.</p></reply>

The expenditure report for 2013, which was published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in December last, makes a provision of &euro;25.9 million in 2013 for the implementation of the local property tax.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total costs incurred in establishing the local property tax to the end of October 2013 is &euro;24.29 million, of which &euro;21.98 million was incurred in 2013.  Also by the end of October, more than 1.6 million local property tax returns had been filed for 2013 and approximately &euro;215 million had been transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer.  I understand from Revenue that more than 500,000 returns have now been filed in respect of 2014. </p><p>  The Deputy asked about the &quot;cost of reissuing the latest letter seeking payment&quot; but I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that no letters were reissued.  She may be referring to the fact that letters were issued in October to some 988,000 property owners who paid their 2013 local property tax by lump sum, that is, by debit or credit card, cash, cheque or postal order or single debit authority, or by way of regular cash payments through a service provider.  These letters were not a reissue but are a normal annual feature of the pay and file season for the local property tax.  As I have explained to the House previously in written replies, they ask property owners to decide how they want to pay their local property tax in respect of 2014 and to advise Revenue accordingly.</p><p>  Of the 988,000 letters, I am informed that approximately 950,000 were issued by post and 37,000 were issued electronically.  The specific costs associated with the issue of these letters were &euro;694,136.  The figure is broken down as follows:<blockquote>Postage: &euro;441,762<br /><br />Advertising:&euro;191,290<br /><br />Paper:&euro;30,669<br /><br />Envelopes:&euro;19,495<br /><br />Printing:<i>&euro;10,920</i><br /><br /><b>Total&euro;694,136</b></blockquote><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>  Letters were not sent to property owners who paid their 2013 local property tax deduction at source from salary or occupational pension, from certain Government payments or direct debit, or to those who opted to defer their full local property tax liability or those who claimed an exemption, as all these options will continue to apply for 2014.  This approach had the effect of reducing the cost by some &euro;200,000.  No action is required to be taken by these property owners, unless they wish to change to a different payment method for 2014.  </p><p>  On the cost and number of contractors, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that in the context of the local property tax, external contractors have mainly been engaged in two different functional areas, namely information technology development and the provision of call centre services.  The call centre costs are published on a quarterly basis on the Revenue website in accordance with Government policy that all payments exceeding &euro;20,000 be published.  A total of &euro;2.712 million has been paid to date in 2013.  </p><p>  A key aspect of the service provided to Revenue is the capacity to scale resources up and down in response to demand.  At the outset, in March 2013, 40 agents were engaged.  To support the filing dates in May 2013, up to 200 agents were engaged.  The numbers were reduced after the filing dates and the numbers engaged during the months of July, August and September were at maintenance levels only.  With effect from mid-October, there was a requirement to increase capacity to handle the 2014 filing dates and the number of agents engaged is increasing incrementally to the same levels as May 2013.  A total of &euro;6.903 million has been paid to external IT systems developers in 2013 and the average number of whole-time equivalent staff working on IT developments was 38.</p><p>  In addition to external resources, at the end of October 2013, 163 whole-time equivalent Revenue staff and 75 temporary clerical officers were assigned to full-time duties related to the administration of the local property tax. </p><p>  The total costs incurred in setting up the local property tax to the end of October 2013 under the main headings are as follows.  These are fully in line with the provisions made in the 2013 expenditure report.<table><tr><th></th><th>2012</th><th> 2013 (End-Oct)</th></tr><tr><td>Total Salaries</td><td>&euro;757,000</td><td> &euro;8,921,000</td></tr><tr><td>External IT Systems Development</td><td>&euro;1,552,000 </td><td> &euro;6,903,000</td></tr><tr><td>Postage</td><td></td><td>&euro;1,150,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Call Centre (External)</td><td></td><td>&euro;2,712,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Advertising</td><td></td><td>&euro;596,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Accommodation, Fittings, etc.</td><td></td><td>&euro;492,000</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Transaction Charges</td><td></td><td>&euro;866,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Printing</td><td></td><td>&euro;209,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Valuation Fees</td><td></td><td>&euro;66,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Training Travel Costs</td><td></td><td>&euro;37,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Security</td><td></td><td>&euro;27,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Consultancy Fees</td><td></td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>   &euro;2,309,000</td><td>&euro;21,979,000 </td></tr></table></p><p>  I am also advised that the operation of the local property tax website, like Revenue&rsquo;s other online services, is part of Revenue&rsquo;s normal business and there are no outsourced elements.  The local property tax website uses existing equipment and services and has little or no additional overhead cost.  </p></reply>

As the Minister indicated, the introduction of the property tax is a major change to the taxation system.  Does he accept that the manner in which the Government forced through the draconian property tax legislation last year caused great hardship and resulted in many errors in its implementation?  The recent letters, which have been discussed at length, caused serious disquiet and will have to be clarified, which is not good enough.  Tens of millions of euro have been spent on the administration of the local property charge.  Against the background of our earlier discussion on the ongoing problem of mortgage arrears and the number of people in arrears, is it not time the Government conceded the tax is unsustainable and considered alternatives, rather than continuing with the mistakes the Minister has presided over?</p></speech>

Nobody ever made light of the task of implementing the tax.  Notwithstanding the difficulty in introducing it, when one takes everything into account, the Revenue did a very good job and achieved a high level of compliance, more than 90%, last year.  While a difficulty arose earlier in the year, the system is on track again and it seems it will operate reasonably well again from the point of view of compliance and revenue generation in 2014.</p></speech>

The draconian nature of the legislation compelled compliance but that does not mean people agree with the tax.  How much did the error regarding first-time buyers cost?  Is it anticipated that other mistakes will come to light?</p></speech>

Rather than announce something that might adversely affect the property market, particularly in Dublin, which was just about to take off at the time, we said we would leave it go and correct it at the end of the year.  The cost of it was somewhere just in excess of &euro;3 million.  If this error had not occurred in the draft, the Revenue would have collected slightly in excess of &euro;3 million extra in the course of 2013.</p></speech>

As Minister for Finance, I do not intervene in the detail of NAMA's business and I would consider it inappropriate to do so.</p><p>  I would point out that NAMA's remit does not extend to providing assistance to start-up businesses.  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in the country.  There are a number of other State agencies with a clearly-defined mandate in that area and I am satisfied that those agencies currently provide a comprehensive suite of incentives to encourage and support business start-ups.</p><p>  NAMA continues to make a significant contribution to economic activity and job creation in Ireland, for example, through its deployment of working and development capital and vendor finance; through its work in identifying and facilitating the sale or lease of buildings to IDA Ireland clients; and through its provision of rent abatements to support struggling small and medium-sized businesses.</p><p>  NAMA is working actively with IDA Ireland to identify suitable properties to meet the requirements of foreign direct investment.  The recent announcement by Facebook that it is moving into a 120,000 sq. ft. office space in Grand Canal Square, giving it the potential to double its workforce in Ireland, is a direct result of NAMA's work with IDA Ireland.  NAMA advanced funding to complete this building and worked closely with IDA Ireland to meet Facebook's requirements.  Other recent examples include: the letting of a number of office blocks at Elm Park to the Swiss pharmaceutical firm, Novartis; the purchase by Scottish and Southern Energy of its new corporate headquarters at Leopardstown; and the investment of over &euro;100 million by the Kerry Group at Millennium Park in Naas.  In all of these examples, NAMA acted to facilitate the transactions by offering structured engagement between its debtors and receivers and the potential new investors and by providing funding to complete buildings where this was necessary.</p><p>  It is important in this context to reiterate that NAMA's interest in property is that of a lender holding security for its loans rather than that of an owner.  Through its email address, <i>info@nama.ie</i>, it helps businesses, individuals and groups to identify properties that may be suitable for their purposes.  It acts as intermediary between interested parties and the debtors and receivers who control the properties by ensuring that debtors and receivers are aware of any potential purchaser or lessee interest in their properties and by facilitating engagement between the interested parties and debtors-receivers.  I would encourage those interested in establishing premises for start-up businesses to engage with NAMA through this channel to identify properties that may be suitable.</p><p>  I would also highlight that my officials are engaging with groups across the economy to better understand and facilitate the needs for enterprise space to support start-up businesses.  We are working with city councils, business development agencies and interest groups to determine how we can be helpful in promoting business creation in Ireland, one key element of which is the creation of commercially viable enterprise space to facilitate co-working, hot-desking, incubation and acceleration of emerging businesses in Ireland such as that created by, among others, The Liffey Trust, The Digital Hub and Treehouse.</p></speech>

I was specifically trying to focus on microenterprise.  We all would accept that if there will be many jobs created, it will be in small to medium-sized businesses.  Those smaller businesses are the ones that have the potential to employ one or two persons.  Can I take if from the Minister's reply, because it will not be individuals at that level who will engage with NAMA, that there is the prospect of a direct engagement between the like of the county enterprise boards and NAMA for that purpose?  It may well be that available space is in abundance in some parts of the country but it certainly is not in others, and it is at that level on which I really wanted to focus.</p></speech>

However, if there is a property, particularly in her constituency, which she thinks would be suitable for housing small businesses, NAMA will engage, either with the Deputy or with one of the agencies.  NAMA is quite open to being constructive.  It has a social mandate under the Act and the creating of jobs is a fulfilling of the social mandate.</p></speech>

The appointment of the special manager has caused considerable disquiet among the members of Newbridge Credit Union.  Millions of euro have been spent on the manager and the assessors who were brought in to investigate the books.  The aforementioned resident went to the tribunal well in advance of the High Court decision and was told that the tribunal would be convened expeditiously to examine the matter.  However, given that it has not yet issued its findings, the horse has well and truly bolted.  Does this not make a mockery of the structures?  There is not really an appeals tribunal or any other body that can demand accountability for the behaviour of our financial institutions.  Should the Minister not be changing that arrangement?  He spoke about securing the safety of the savers in Newbridge Credit Union but if he was prepared to invest &euro;53 million in allowing a bank to take over the credit union, why could he not have invested the money in the credit union, given the implications for other credit unions in the months and years to come?</p></speech>

We tried every possible combination, including negotiations with Naas Credit Union which were made public.

The idea that the solution is to hand the credit union over, lock, stock and barrel, to a bank does not make sense when an examination of the role of the directors and the decisions made in the past could have brought better clarity and secured the savings in the credit union, with the investment being made under the credit union banner rather than having the credit union handed over to the bank.</p></speech>

It had no commercial interest in the matter but it intervened because we asked it to save the credit union and people's savings.  It is not ideal, but that is the way it happened.

While it is disappointing that ACC and Danske Bank have taken the decision to withdraw from the Irish market, one of the key features of banking strategy in the financial crisis has been the retrenchment to national borders.  One of our expectations from the financial crisis is that market shares in traditional banking services will become more fluid during the recovery as the banking landscape continues to adjust to the withdrawal of foreign players, the restructuring of our incumbent banks and the increasing price transparency of financial services.  The withdrawal of particular services and the closure of certain aspects of the business of some banks is a realisation of this expectation. </p><p>  We expect that over time this will present opportunities for the entry of new market participants that are well positioned to be confident in the future profitability of an Irish branch or subsidiary.  While the current market may not be attractive to a fully diversified bank challenger in the short term, I expect new financial services providers to enter the market on a more targeted basis - for example, as specialist lenders and non-bank finance providers.</p><p>  The Government has decided to establish the Ireland strategic investment fund, ISIF, which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  Using the ISIF, we will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create employment.  Officials of my Department are currently preparing the necessary legislation, which I anticipate will be enacted early next year.  Already in the lifetime of this Government, the NPRF has established funds that support strategic projects and a number that support SME financing.  Further assessment of the need to create a strategic investment bank over and above the contribution expected from the ISIF will be informed by the requirements of the economy once the Government&rsquo;s key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed. </p><p>  The Taoiseach mentioned in this House last week that he had discussions with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.  Germany is keen to help and, specifically, to find ways to reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.  The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities to swiftly deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.  Officials of my Department have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance.  We held a consultation with the German embassy in Dublin which helped pave the way for discussions with the German Ministry in Berlin yesterday, and further discussions will be held with KfW and other key stakeholders over the coming weeks both here and in Germany.  I am keen to see the establishment of a healthy and balanced relationship.  As we are trying to ensure that any initiative that comes out of this process is as effective as it can be, we will be discussing approaches that meet the strategic objectives of both States.</p></reply>

What he said was quite interesting.  I am aware that things move on, but prior to the election it was a major plank of the Labour Party's manifesto in particular that a strategic investment bank would be established, and this was negotiated into the programme for Government.  The Minister is now telling us there is no guarantee that it will be established and that he will examine the issue when the fund is up and running.</p><p>  There is a need for investment in the real economy.  We can talk about the fund all we want, but it was promised more than two years ago and we still have not seen its establishment.</p><p>We have not seen any programme or direction to lead us towards a strategic investment bank.  Has the Minister examined the role of the existing State banks in lending into the real economy, particularly Permanent TSB and AIB?  What role do they have in the long term?  Will the legislation committed to by the Government in terms of the bail-in and the burning of senior bondholders required before the stress tests take place next year have any impact in attracting foreign banks to the State?  Could the confusion and lack of clarity as to what the legislation will contain have led to banks taking the decision to move back within their national borders?</p></speech>

The fund is providing moneys and supporting, on a joint partnership basis, various funds for SMEs.  It is involved in investment in the economy.  The big difference between a strategic investment fund and a strategic investment bank is that if it is formulated under licence as a bank, it will be able to raise money on the markets, whereas a strategic investment fund deals with funds available to it at present.  We are not ruling it out by any means and will see how it works.  The best known and most effective strategic investment bank is the German bank to which I referred.</p></speech>

The second piece is a more permanent bail-in resolution mechanism which will be a constituent part of banking union.  It is separate and has not yet been agreed to, but the Lithuanian Presidency is ambitious that it will be agreed to before Christmas.  What took place the last day was not a debate to reach agreement but a discussion to establish positions.

This implies negative productivity growth relative to the same period last year.  While quarterly data in Ireland are volatile, my Department is nonetheless projecting a fall in labour productivity this year.  This is a somewhat unusual development.  One of the main factors behind it is the composition of output this year.  Output and exports are falling in the pharmaceutical sector, reflecting the impact of the patent expiry for a number of important products.  The pharma-chem sector accounts for about one quarter of exports and about 12% of gross value added.  In other words, the sector is very large relative to Ireland&rsquo;s overall GDP.  In contrast to its high share of output, the labour share of this sector is small, accounting for just 2% of overall employment in Ireland.  As a result, employment at an aggregate level has been largely unaffected by the decline in activity in this sector.</p><p>  For 2013 as a whole, my Department expects GDP to be supported by a positive contribution from domestic demand which, as it tends to be more labour intensive in nature, will assist continued employment growth.  Next year and over the forecast horizon, my Department does not expect the divergence in growth of GDP and employment to continue, as expansion is forecast in both the domestic and externally driven components of the economy.</p></speech>

We do not have growth, but the Minister is claiming an improved position in terms of employment and unemployment.  The ABC of economics says if we have more people working, it is contributing to GDP.  How can the Minister claim there is an improvement in the employment position when we do not have the growth to match it?  The explanation is not what the Minister has just told us about pharmaceuticals; it has more to do with the fact that many of the jobs it is claimed are being created are not real jobs.  People are being counted as employed if they are not on the live register but on schemes and through the various ways the Minister has created to massage the employment figures.  They are not real jobs; they are not properly paid and contribute nothing to GDP.  That explains the anomaly.</p></speech>

They are based on the statistics from labour force surveys and are real jobs.  What was interesting over the summer was that a movement creating part-time jobs had led to a movement creating full-time jobs.  More full-time jobs are now being created than part-time jobs.  Extra jobs are being created.  The anomaly is that normally employment creation follows growth, but last year the statistical economy showed a decline because of the movement off patent in the pharma industry for many key products.  The statistical decline does not affect the level of employment much because the pharmaceutical industry which employs 25,000 people or 2% of the labour force did not let people go.  The value of the product produced went down because there was competition from generic medicines once the key lead medicines had moved off patent.  There is a statistical quirk in it that does not fully reflect what is happening in the economy.  Other sectors grew and jobs were created, but the statistical drag back stems from what is called the patent cliff.</p></speech>

Voting in favour of exiting the programme indicates we have the confidence to take control of the decisions that will determine our future as a State.  When Ireland originally entered into the EU and IMF programme in late 2010, the country was facing significant challenges on several fronts.  The banks were in crisis, unemployment was on the rise and our overall competitiveness had declined dramatically.  Added to this, our reputation within the EU and the wider world was at an all-time low, tax revenues had fallen sharply and public expenditure had accelerated.  This combination of events, in tandem with the impact of the global economic crisis, brought the State to its lowest point in decades and forced the previous Government to request a programme of financial assistance from the EU and the IMF.</p><p>  Now, three years on, as we approach the conclusion of our programme we are beginning to reap the rewards of the sustained efforts of the Irish public.  Market confidence in Ireland is high, the public finances are under control, we are reducing our deficit and debt levels and economic conditions and sentiment are improving.  We are over 95% of the way towards meeting our target of reducing the deficit to less than 3% by 2015 and the Government is rigidly sticking to its fiscal objectives.  The 2014 budget will continue this effort and targets a deficit of 4.8%, which will deliver a primary balance or a small primary surplus.  The Government remains firmly committed to reducing the deficit to less than 3% by 2015 and to putting the debt ratio on a downward path.</p><p>  The financial sector has also undergone significant restructuring and has been stabilised.  This restructuring included deleveraging undertaken as part of the financial measures programme and the merger of Allied Irish Banks with the EBS.  Exceptional liquidity assistance has been removed from the system following the liquidation of IBRC.  NAMA has maintained a strong financial position, generating considerable cash, leaving it on track to redeem &euro;7.5 billion of bonds by the end of this year.  Private capital has been brought into the banking system by the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011 and contingent capital notes this year, and also by the sale of Irish Life this year.  Confidence in the Irish banks is beginning to return and this has helped reduce their reliance on eurosystem funding, which is now a fraction of what it was at the beginning of the programme.</p><p>  Most significantly, we have also returned successfully to the financial markets.  We now have substantial cash reserves estimated to be in excess of &euro;20 billion by the end of the year and this will act as a domestic backstop.  Domestic and international economic conditions are improving, monetary policy decisions are conducive to exit and confidence and sentiment towards Ireland has improved considerably in recent months.  We have demonstrated our commitment to getting our country back on track and to successfully regaining sustainable market access.  We have delivered over 260 actions under the programme, undergone 12 quarterly reviews and upon conclusion we will have drawn down &euro;67.5 billion in funds.  This successful implementation of our programme is what has paved the way to exit in mid December.  Exiting our programme is an important milestone in Ireland's recovery and will send a further signal that Ireland as a country is recovering, returning to normal market funding and building for a sustainable future.</p><p>  As Deputies are aware, the Government decided on 14 November that Ireland is now in the best position to exit the EU-IMF programme of financial assistance on 15 December without the need to pre-arrange a new precautionary credit line from our EU and IMF partners.  This decision followed a careful and thorough assessment of all available options, and various consultations with the European Commission, the ECB, the IMF, the President and members of the Eurogroup, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA.  As the Taoiseach mentioned last week, he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel on Germany's offer to help.  The discussions included a specific focus on finding ways to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish small and medium enterprises.  In that context the German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities.  Officials of my Department have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance, and discussions between my officials and officials of the German Ministry were held in Berlin yesterday.  Further work on this will continue with KfW and other key stakeholders over the coming weeks both here and in Germany.</p><p>  There has been some suggestion that we should take a precautionary facility to address some potential risk associated with the stress test to be conducted in advance of the establishment of the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, in the second half of next year.  There is no evidence that either this test, which is to take place next year, or the current asset quality review being conducted by our own Central Bank, will generate any additional capital requirements for our banks.  The Irish banks have, as at the end of June, strong capital ratios compared to the European average and are making good progress in returning to profitability, which is a necessity if they are to meet the new higher capital standards under CRD IV.  Our banks were stress tested in 2011 and they were substantially recapitalised on foot of those tests.  It is worth reiterating here that &euro;64 billion in total has been provided by the State to the domestic banking sector over the past five years, or some 40% of GDP, to ensure a stable capital base.  When account is taken of the private sector contribution the figure rises to over &euro;86bn.</p><p>  I should point out that the minimum core tier one capital requirement at the time our banks were recapitalised was 10.5%.  The stress tests for Spain and Cyprus were conducted on a 9% ratio and the SSM test will be conducted on an 8% ratio, although the exact details of what this new ratio will consist of have yet to be confirmed.  In addition to this, one should bear in mind that there has been some recovery in the economy and particularly in property prices since the previous stress tests were carried out, and interest rates are also substantially lower than was modelled.</p><p>  As I have mentioned, the ECB is undertaking a comprehensive assessment of European banks, the results of which are expected to be published in November 2014.  The Irish banks will be included in those tests.  Before those tests are finalised there is an amount of negotiation that has to take place at the Eurogroup to agree the terms of a European backstop for bank resolution and recapitalisation.  We are contributing fully to these negotiations and bring the perspectives and practical experience that we have gained over the past three years to the table to support a comprehensive solution to a eurozone-wide issue.</p><p>  With regard to any capital shortfalls may arise under the European stress tests for any EU banks, there is a premise in some quarters that taxpayers should be the first port of call.  This is not the case and European banks have a number of options open to them if they need to raise capital in the future.  Access to capital markets, be it debt or equity for banks, is far better now than it has been for a number of years, as evidenced by a number of recent significant transactions.  Banks can also generate capital internally by becoming more efficient and more profitable.  The ESM, admittedly funded by European taxpayers, is another potential source of capital for banks and there is still negotiation to take place at Eurogroup to agree the terms of that facility, which will be available after the single supervisory mechanism has been put in place.  The final point I would make is that applying for a precautionary credit line would not actually cover the risk should a wider problem emerge in the euro area, for example arising from the stress tests in late 2014, although I am not suggesting that such a risk might materialise.</p><p>  Since we announced our decision last week the issue of eligibility for the ECB's outright monetary transactions, OMTs, has been raised.  In this context, I would like to set out the facts regarding OMT.  The governing council of the ECB made a decision to establish OMT in August 2012 and issued a press statement in September 2012 which outlined its technical features.  According to this the purpose of OMT is: &quot;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&quot;.  It is therefore aimed at addressing systemic risks for the euro as a whole and is not country specific.  Having a credit line does not of itself guarantee access to OMT, and it is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  In that respect, in the absence of systemic risk, the position of Ireland is not fundamentally changed by the Government's decision last week not to seek a precautionary credit line.</p><p>The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB's governing council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of outright monetary transactions, OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.</p><p> I wish to say a word about post-programme surveillance.  Once we exit the programme next month we will be subject to post-programme surveillance and a different form of monitoring by the EU and the IMF than when we were in the programme.  There will be reviews every six months.  That has been a long-standing feature of IMF programmes, and is also now a feature under the new EU governance rules.  It is quite normal and is part of the wider governance changes that have been put in place at EU level for all member states to improve the way the euro area functions.  In fact, the new governance arrangements for all eurozone member states help deal with some of the major problems that faced the euro area in the past and they will help avoid such problems emerging in the future.  The new governance arrangements provide reassurance to the markets.  They provide an early warning system if problems begin to emerge.  They reduce the risk of contagion spreading from one member state to another, and they increase peer review pressure to help ensure responsible policies are pursued by all member states in the euro area.</p><p> The new governance arrangements are important for small member states with very open economies such as Ireland as it ensures that large member states pursue policies that are in the interests of the euro.  Of course, it works both ways and we must act responsibly too.  The post-programme surveillance arrangements must be seen in that context.  Already, in the past two weeks we can see how these enhanced surveillance and governance arrangements will operate with the Commission giving warnings on a number of large member states.</p><p> All along I indicated that the decision on a precautionary credit line was finely balanced and since the announcement of the decision many commentators have also acknowledged that to be the case.  That said, taking all factors into account, I am of the view that exiting our EU-IMF programme of financial assistance without a pre-arranged precautionary facility or backstop is the right decision for Ireland and now is the right time to make the decision.</p><p> I believe this is an assessment that is widely held both in Ireland and abroad, especially based on the generally positive reaction to our decision.  The complete lack of financial market reaction, in terms of no change in yields or market liquidity, illustrates the market's view that the Government's decision was both correct and timely.  Exit without a prearranged precautionary credit line represents greater normalisation, with Ireland now subject to EU economic co-ordination, fiscal surveillance, and governance rules that apply to other EU and euro area member states that are not in a programme of assistance.</p><p> The Government decision is the latest in a series of steps to return Ireland to sustainable growth and job creation.  Confidence in Ireland has improved considerably in recent months and interest rates on Government bonds are now at record lows.  Like most other sovereign eurozone countries, from 2014 we will be in a position to fund ourselves normally on the markets.  Interestingly, our yields are now lower than the yields for some of the eurozone countries that would have had to approve a precautionary credit line for us.</p><p> Following exit from our programme we will also have a clear strategy in place.  The next steps will be to continue on the path that we have been pursuing for some time - an economic strategy that is growth enhancing and managed within strict fiscal frameworks while reinforcing programmes supporting employment and opportunity.  We are preparing a medium-term economic strategy that will articulate the key principles that will underpin economic policy for the period to 2020.  This strategy will address the key policy areas such as education and training, labour market activation, industrial innovation, access to credit, competition and budgetary policy, and will complement the more short-term focus of other related policy efforts such as the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p> We have lived up to our programme commitments.  We have stabilised public finances and introduced frameworks for economic management supported by independent oversight.  Recent indicators show the continuation of the recovery with higher employment, renewed growth, lower household debt and an underpinning of residential and commercial property values.  While there are challenges and risks, we are confident that over the past three years we have demonstrated a strong track record of managing the programme and ensuring that we are now normalising the economic and financial situation into the future.</p><p> The decision the Government took is the right decision at the right time for Ireland.  As a result of the commitment and determination of the Irish people to get the job done, we will be exiting the bailout in a strong position.  I hope Deputies will put on record where they stand on exiting the programme and show their faith in the Irish people to make our own decisions.</p></speech>

The question that is being put to the House by the Government is whether the Government has made the right decision not to apply for a precautionary credit line.  That is the essence of what we are debating.</p><p>  I very much welcome the fact that Ireland is on course to exit the programme.  It is a significant and positive milestone for the country.  Entering into a formal troika programme three years ago was a dark chapter in Irish history.  The Irish people have made tremendous sacrifices both in the couple of years prior to entering the programme and in the three years since to ensure we can come out of the programme and in a sense stand on our own two feet as an independent country subject to all of the normal and extensive oversight provisions that currently exist.</p><p>  The issue we are debating this morning is whether the Government has taken the right decision to exit the programme without having a precautionary credit line or insurance policy in place.  That is the issue I will seek to address specifically.  As I said during Question Time, the conditions are very benign at the moment.  I very much hope they prevail, because if they do then the Minister&rsquo;s decision will have been the right one and Ireland will not under any circumstances need a precautionary credit line.  We live in a very uncertain world and significant risks face Ireland, as we exit the programme, and other countries.  The real test of the sustainability of our exit will be when the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, goes back into the markets probably in the first quarter of next year to issue long-term Government bonds and whether it can dispose of them at the kind of interest rates we currently see in the secondary markets - in the region of 3.5% for ten year money, which is quite a low cost of borrowing.  If that continues, then the NTMA will quite easily be able to borrow and meet our funding needs in the future.</p><p>  However, we know that the international markets are volatile.  They are responsive not just to events in this country but to events outside of this jurisdiction in the eurozone and the wider world.  My essential position is that we do not know the cost of what the insurance policy would be.  The Minister has not addressed the matter in his speech, perhaps because he does not know what conditions would have applied.  Ireland did not formally apply for a precautionary credit line so there was no formal discussion on the type of conditionality that would have applied in this case.  I am sure that in the course of his discussions with the various stakeholders the Minister would have teased out the type of conditionality that would have applied to Ireland.  Let us considers the very extensive measures to which we will already be subject - the formal post-programme monitoring, the excessive deficit procedure of which we are part, the fiscal compact requirements in terms of debt-to-GDP reduction and deficit reduction.  The fact that we have already had an extension of the loan maturities means we would be subject to more intensive scrutiny by the troika until 75% of the loans we owe them have been repaid.  It is my job to ask a question of the Minister about any additional conditionality to which we might have been subject in order to avail of a precautionary credit line.  We have not got an answer to that question.</p><p> Deputy Creed mentioned corporation tax.  From our point of view, it would be a step too far if an increase in this tax were laid down as a condition.  There is no suggestion that a change in our corporation tax rate would have been a condition of any programme.  The European partners would have had no legal basis whatsoever for seeking to impose a condition of that nature.</p><p> The Minister outlined a couple of key issues concerning the basis for his decision not to apply for a precautionary credit line.  He addressed the issue of the ECB's outright monetary transactions, OMTs, which comprise the new policy initiative announced approximately 14 months ago by the current ECB president, Mr. Mario Draghi.  That statement was unquestionably transformative.  It certainly calmed the markets and resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of borrowing for many of the peripheral member states of the eurozone, in particular.  The OMT tool has never had to be deployed since because the markets accept that it exists in the background as the ultimate backstop.  The ECB has the power to step in and buy bonds of governments if conditions require it.</p><p> Page 4 of the Minister's speech outlines the conditions.  First, there must be a systemic risk to the euro in order for the ECB to invoke the OMT provisions.  Second, the Minister stated it is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition that a country would have a precautionary credit line.  However, one should consider the actual statement the ECB issued, the press release of 6 September 2012, as referred to by the Minister.  It is important to tease this out.  It states:<blockquote>A necessary condition for Outright Monetary Transactions is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme.  Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme [or a precautionary credit line].</blockquote>In other words, there is one condition dealing with systemic risk - we accept it is in place - and another that there be a precautionary credit line in place or else the state must enter a full programme.  That is the nub of the issue and my clear interpretation of the measure.  Ireland should negotiate now from a position of strength to put a precautionary credit line in place.  If over the course of the next year we need to invoke the OMT with the support of the ECB, which would have the ultimate decision, having the precautionary credit line in place would tick the right box.  If we do not have it in place, we will face a full macroeconomic adjustment programme under the EFSF-ESM.  I ask the Minister to address that when wrapping up because it is clearly what the press release from the ECB states.</p><p> My key concern is that we now negotiate a precautionary credit line from a position of some strength.  The backdrop is certainly very benign and sentiment towards Ireland is positive.  All of the fiscal targets are being met.  We are exiting the programme.  I am confident that we could negotiate a credit line with acceptable conditions.  The alternative is taking the risk now and eventually having to avail of the ECB's OMT policy.  A condition of access would be signing up to a full macroeconomic adjustment programme which, I presume, would be akin to the one covered by the memorandum of understanding with the troika, whose programme we are about to exit.  That is a fundamental issue.  I have yet to hear it properly addressed.  I hope the Minister will do so this evening.  There is firm evidence that the precautionary course of action would be to put in place the insurance policy at this point in time.</p><p> The second issue concerns the stress tests and the banks.  It is a potential risk factor that we face.  The Minister made the point quite reasonably in his speech that there is no evidence that this test or the ongoing balance sheet quality review will generate any additional capital requirements for our banks.  I have no such evidence either.  The truth is that neither the Minister nor I knows whether the stress test next year will identify additional capital requirements for the Irish banks.  What we do know very clearly is that if a hole is identified in the balance sheets of the banks, the hierarchy pertaining to how it is to be filled will have been agreed at European level.  The first to be affected are the private markets and investors or shareholders, followed by junior bondholders that might be left and national authorities and, finally, the ESM.  The junior bondholders in the Irish banks have already been burned, and burden-sharing has been imposed on them.  Bank of Ireland will probably stand quite a good chance of raising some capital on the markets, if required, given the fact that it is mainly privately owned.  It is fair to assume that if AIB and Permanent TSB, in particular, are found next year to require additional capital, the buck will stop at national level.  In other words, the Irish Government, on behalf of the Irish people, will be required to inject additional capital ahead of the ESM.  That is what was agreed last Friday in the absence of an overall agreement on how the ESM is being invoked.  It is a potential risk for the country because there is no doubt but that if the results of the stress tests next year identify that there is a hole in the balance sheet of any of the banks, it will have adverse consequences for yields in respect of Irish Government bonds.  This is unquestionable.  The risk factor is one that we need to take into account seriously when making a decision in addition to the risk factor associated with the banks' balance sheets and whether they are recognising the losses there carrying.</p><p> There are serious questions to be asked as to whether the banks have fully faced up to the extent of the losses they are carrying on their SME loan books and mortgage books.  One reason the banks have not fully dealt with the mortgage arrears crisis is that they are concerned that if they face up to the scale of their potential losses, it will have serious negative consequences for their capital positions.  The Minister outlined the figures in his response.  On the face of it, the banks are now very well capitalised and there should be little likelihood of their needing additional capital in the foreseeable future, but that is on the assumption that they have properly recognised and provided in their accounts for the losses they are carrying on their balance sheets.  I am not at all convinced that they have done so.  It is not for me to reach firm conclusions on that; it is a matter for the Central Bank and the ECB next year.  We look forward to hearing what they have to say.</p><p> There are significant risks to economic growth.  The Minister had an exchange earlier with Deputy Boyd Barrett on the centrality of growth in respect of Ireland meeting its requirements under the fiscal treaty, in particular.  I refer to the deficit reduction and the lowering of the debt-GDP ratio to 60%.  We have made growth forecasts of 2% next year in real GDP, 2.3% the following year and 2.8% in 2016.  These levels should be achievable but the reality is that we simply do not know whether they are.  The achievement of these growth levels is largely outside our control as a small, open trading economy that is exporting 80% to 90% of the goods and services it produces.  The latest economic data from Europe are not encouraging.  The quarter 3 data are particularly weak.  France is sliding back into a contraction and German growth is weaker than expected.  Nobody hopes more than me that the eurozone economy will experience a strong recovery because that will, unquestionably, drive the Irish economy up with it.  However, there are major concerns that if the eurozone economy does not recover it will have a knock-on impact on our growth that will compromise our capacity to achieve the deficit targets and debt-GDP targets.</p><p> Even in the past 24 hours, the OECD projected that the 2015 deficit will be 3.1% and that we will miss the 3% target by a whisker.  We will not argue about 0.1% because it all comes down to whatever assumptions one uses in one&rsquo;s economic model, but it brings home the point that the margins between achieving and missing the targets are very fine.  It is not all within our control by any means, and that is a point we need to bear in mind.</p><p>The fundamental point I make to the Minister regarding his decision on a precautionary credit line is that we should be having a discussion on what type of conditions would have been attaching to such a credit line.  Perhaps the Minister does not know what those conditions would be but I suspect he has a good idea.  However, he does not know the finer detail of any such conditions because the Government never formally applied for a credit line.  I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on the radio last week making the point that because we did not apply, there was no detailed discussion on the issue of the conditions.  Therefore, we are turning down an insurance policy without knowing the cost of that policy.  I believe, as does my party, that this is a mistake.  It is a mistake which may not cost us anything if current conditions prevail but if they do not, then we could be facing very significant costs because we would have to sign up to a detailed programme with specific conditionality from a position of weakness if the markets turn against us.  We should know from experience that when the markets turn against one, they turn against one.  We can look back at the history of events three years ago to see that.  At the end of September 2010, the NTMA was borrowing long-term money at about 4.5% which, in terms of the spread between that and German bonds then and where we are now, at 3.5% and the spread with German bonds, is quite proportionate.  That was two months before the bailout.  When the markets turn, they turn completely against one and they would not think twice about putting Ireland into such a situation.  That is a key concern.</p><p> It is only two months since the Minister and the Taoiseach spoke openly about applying for a precautionary credit line and about the need for a safety net.  A figure of &euro;10 billion was put on that and the Minister said we would be entering discussions.  He certainly gave the clear impression that he was favourably disposed at that stage to making such an application, albeit without any formal decision being made.  He was absolutely right to explore that option.  I have the residual feeling that the situation in Europe and the lack of a new German Government is significant.  I know the Minister has said that Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble asserts that there is a German Government and that it has the authority and mandate to make decisions, which of course it does.  However, it certainly would have been a complication for the Germans to have to go into the Bundestag and seek parliamentary approval for a new programme for Ireland, a precautionary credit line with some level of conditionality attached.  It would have been a complication at a time when the CDU's prospective coalition partner, the SPD, is raising the issue of Ireland's corporation tax rate.  There is no doubt it was far more convenient and politically suitable for them to avoid such a scenario and they have avoided it.  </p><p> It is a statement about Europe's lack of preparedness for countries exiting a programme that there was no clear road map for putting in place a precautionary credit line.  There was no clear road map for the type of negotiations that would prevail and, more importantly, the type of conditionality that would apply.  I believe, even though the Minister will not want to admit it, that this was certainly a factor in the Irish Government's position.  There was an absolute lack of clarity from Europe as to how this would work, the type of programme to which we would be required to sign up and, most importantly of all, the conditionality that would apply and, in particular, the interest that would apply to a &euro;10 billion credit line.  The troika funds of which we have been availing for the past few years have come in at a blended rate of a little more than 3%, which is quite a good rate.  The rate dropped from the original figure of 5.8% on the back of a reduction in the interest rate secured by the Greek Government some time ago and we also availed of that.  </p><p> Deputy Doherty raised the issue of the retroactive recapitalisation of Irish banks earlier.  Our debt to GDP ratio this year is approaching 125% but without a deal on that and if growth conditions are weaker than expected, our debt sustainability will get into very real difficulty quickly and the markets will see that.  I must say that while we warmly welcome the fact that Ireland is exiting the programme, as planned, on 15 December, I believe the Minister has got it wrong in not applying for a precautionary credit line.  We are facing very significant risks as a country and it would have been prudent to take out an insurance policy against those risks.  The Minister has decided not to take out such a policy and he has not told this House what the price of such a policy would have been.  I believe that is a mistake and I regret the manner in which he has worded the motion before us because it forces us, as an Opposition party, while welcoming our exit from the bailout, to vote against it.  The question he has put is whether the right decision has been made on the insurance policy but I believe it has not.  </p></speech>

We all welcome the fact that Irish people pay more attention to economic matters and perhaps if we had done so in this House and elsewhere in days gone by, we would not be in the position we are in currently.  However, we need to get back to a point where we are talking about the weather again instead of OMTs and all the rest.  The most commonly used term in our new vocabulary is probably bailout although it does not appear in any official documents or in the troika's programme.  The term "troika" is a relatively new addition to our vocabulary.</p><p>  When one talks about a precautionary credit line, one must elaborate on what it actually means.  The credit line that was extended to us by the troika has been called a bailout, which begs the question: what is a bailout?  A bailout is when somebody lends one money and does not just ask for the money to be returned with interest but also with political conditions.  Every sovereign goes to the markets and gets money from those markets at a certain interest rate but with no other conditions attached.  A bailout, on the other hand, is money from a specific source with an interest rate attached, a demand for full repayment within a certain period and with political conditions attached.  A precautionary credit line is exactly the same.  It is a &euro;10 billion fund that would be made available by sources which would ask for it to be paid in full over a period of time, with interest, so that the sources benefit from extending the credit to us.  However, the sources would also attach political and economic conditions, forcing this State to do certain things to be able to avail of that credit.  On top of that, they would put in place a surveillance and supervision mechanism, in terms of site visits to this State, to ensure that Departments and the national Parliament are adhering to the programme as agreed.  Therefore, a precautionary credit line is a bailout which could have been negotiated which would be sitting there, in the background, that we could have entered into if required.  </p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in believes we should not have entered into a second bailout voluntarily.  We believe we should not have applied for a precautionary credit line or a renewal of the bailout.  We celebrate the fact that the programme is ending next month.  However, we are not celebrating the fact that while the troika is leaving Ireland, the troika's mind set remains here in Government buildings.  Troika or no troika, this Government is pledged to continue to implement the policies of austerity, as it has done to date.  The pursuit of austerity is why we have seen our growth forecasts decrease time and time again.  It is also why unemployment, particularly for our young people, is disastrously high and our emigration figures are so shameful.  The Government's policy of putting the banks first, as I said earlier, means that 118,000 mortgage holders are in arrears of 90 days or more.  The troika has been a failure in my view.  When I last met representatives of the troika I gave them a score card.  I said to them very clearly that in terms of reducing the deficit, not only did they pass, but they passed with honours because the deficit has been reduced.  However, it has been reduced by placing the burden on the shoulders of ordinary Irish people.  </p><p>Unemployment has gone out of control since, while 250,000 people have emigrated under the troika's watch and the mortgage arrears crisis has spiralled out of control, with 118,000 mortgage holders in arrears for 90 days or more.  In addition, the number of banks in the State has reduced by six, while additional taxes and burdens have been placed on ordinary people under the troika's watch.  The banks are still not lending properly more than five years into the crisis.  It is clear that the troika has failed the people, as has the Government.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in has demonstrated consistently to the troika and the Government the need for growth and a fair deficit reduction to begin on a road to prosperity and equality.  The alternative for which republicans have argued is only strengthened by the exit of the troika.  The decision not to apply for a credit line is the right one, but because the Minister reached the right decision does not mean that we should not ask how he came to that conclusion.  He appeared before the finance committee last Wednesday when he said of ECOFIN, &quot;There will be no discussion of Ireland's exit at ECOFIN,&quot; and of the Eurogroup, &quot;On this occasion, because of the imminence of the Irish exit, I will be speaking to many people on the margins, particularly those I have not met in my round of talks over the past couple of weeks.&quot;  The next morning Ministers were pulled from the floor of the D&aacute;il to attend an emergency Cabinet meeting and we were all told to expect statements on the exit.  What happened between the end of the finance committee meeting at noon on Wednesday and the panic last Thursday morning?  Clearly, pressure came from somewhere because given what the Minister stated to the committee, it was not his intention to inform ECOFIN or the Eurogroup that Ireland would not take a precautionary credit line.  He went further and said he would use the opportunity to speak to colleagues on the margins to whom he had not spoken so far.  Was there a late night call from a European country about this issue and what the Government should do?  In his five minute statement to the House the Taoiseach mentioned that country, Germany, twice.  German officials have agreed to use their development bank, KFW, to help our SME sector.  Any step that will help SMEs is welcome, but the timing seems odd.  In a five minute scripted speech about exiting the bailout and not seeking a precautionary credit line, the Taoiseach mentioned Germany twice.  One wonders when the Minister speaks of a benign time to leave the programme, if the prospect of the Labour Party's sister party being in power in Germany was part of his calculation.  There is a genuine question as to why this happened.  We all know this issue was causing difficulties in Germany, given the demands of the Social Democratic Party and the difficulty this would create for its members, as Deputy Michael McGrath said, in having to vote in favour of a credit line at this time.  Was the Minister pushed in this regard?</p><p> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said the calculations and the assessment of the different options provided for the Cabinet would be published.  I pushed the Taoiseach on this issue yesterday and he said the Minister could publish whatever he wanted, which is bizarre.  The Minister can do so and said on national television when asked that he would.  We should have an informed debate in the House.  I support not opting for a precautionary credit line, but I have my own reasons for doing so.  My party has its own analysis and views on what we think would have been on offer, but I would love to see the Government's analysis.  A commitment was made by a senior Minister that it would be published.  It should have been laid before the Houses yesterday in order that we could have an informed debate on this motion which we are debating in a vacuum.</p><p> My party does not believe the possibility of a second bailout or a precautionary line of credit was not fully investigated.  It is simply not credible for the Minister to say this.  I believe him when he says the Government did not apply for a credit line.  Therefore, there were no formal documents stating what the programme would be, but his trips to Washington and Brussels and talks with various serious partners in Europe led him to believe what the conditionality would be.  He is not that naive or incapable that he would talk to all of these individuals without discussing the conditionality that would be attached to such a proposal.  He was not conversing about whether the Government should seek a credit line or a second bailout without talking about the elephant in the room - the conditionality attached, cost, politics and supervision.  All of this was discussed on the fringes and it is disappointing that the Minister is unwilling to impart that information to Members of this Parliament because it is critical for us to know what conditionality would have attached to a precautionary credit line.</p><p> We are discussing an important decision which my party supports, but we need a debate on what it means for the country and its people.  A good start to that discussion would be an honest telling of the story of Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning and how the Minister went from telling me and other members of the finance committee that &quot;There will be no discussion of Ireland's exit at ECOFIN&quot; to the Taoiseach standing before us a number of hours later to tell us a decision had been made and that the Minister was to inform ECOFIN and the Eurogroup of same.  The Minister should do the House and the country the courtesy of telling us the entire story of what happened in between.</p><p> Next year stress tests begin on the banks.  That should be a concern for the people, not out of love for the banks but because they are still tied to the sovereign.  The greatest opportunity the Government had to separate banking debt from sovereign debt was not taken.  The retroactive recapitalisation of the pillar banks through the ESM to the benefit of the people must continue to be pursued, even if the Labour Party&rsquo;s and Fine Gael&rsquo;s allies in Germany disapprove.  The &euro;64 billion plus sunk into bad banks must not weigh down another generation.  The Government parties erred badly in accepting the toxic Anglo Irish Bank debt as formal sovereign debt.  They must deliver on the recouping of the rest of the banking debt.  The primary issue is how they are pursuing this issue.</p><p> We would not be discussing a &euro;10 billion credit line if the guarantee given 17 months ago to retroactively recapitalise the banks had borne fruit.  Even if the State got back half the money pumped into the pillar banks - that would not be acceptable - it would exceed the credit line and we would be in a better position to go back to the markets on a sustainable basis.  However, the Taoiseach has stated in his letter to EU leaders that it is a requirement that this promise be fulfilled if Ireland is to experience a sustainable exit from the troika programme and a sustainable entry into the markets.  I agree with him.</p><p> Many people are asking what all the high drama was about last Thursday and what it means for them, but I fear the answer is that as long as the Government is in power, the prospects for our young people and the economy will not change much.  I have lost count of how many times I sat down with the members of the troika and they said unambiguously that, ultimately, the Government parties were responsible for the decisions taken.  They said this in the most forceful way.  We put it to them that they provided a veil for the Government in the context of its actions, but they said clearly the Government had made the decisions, that the Fianna F&aacute;il four year plan was the basis of the troika programme which was voted on by the Parliament and that every decision since had been the Government's.  During the last meeting I had with them, they reiterated this, but the problem is they have never said this publicly and have allowed themselves to be used by the Government parties as a way of introducing austerity measures.</p><p> Fine Gael and the Labour Party took the decision to carry out the work Fianna F&aacute;il had begun.  They decided to place a tax on every private family home in the State, to cut unemployment benefit for the under 26s and the telephone allowance of more than 17,000 people in my home country of Donegal and many others across the State.  Now that the troika has gone, the same will apply.  Next year the Labour Party and Fine Gael will charge people for water from their taps.  The troika's leaving may change little, except to remove an excuse for this pro-austerity Government in doing what it is committed to doing - further austerity.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in was the only Opposition party this year to submit a costed alternative to the Government&rsquo;s austerity budget.  It would have made the same adjustment as was required of the Government but it would have reduced the tax burden on working families, protected our public services and created jobs.  We showed how the deficit could have been brought down in a fair way.</p><p> I challenge Labour and Fine Gael, now that their troika crutch has been removed, to show they can be fair and capable of taking the right decisions without the excuse of saying the troika made them do it.  I hope today marks a change in direction for the Government.  I hope it will look at real alternatives, like the ones Sinn F&eacute;in and many who work with the poor and marginalised have recommended.  This morning I tabled tens of amendments to the Finance Bill.  They will be voted on next week by the select finance committee, dominated by Labour and Fine Gael Deputies.  It will be their first chance with the troika on the way out to show we are not just austerity junkies.  The Government will have the chance to vote down cuts to single parents and to support real alternatives.  Troika or no troika, I will not be holding my breath.</p><p> No party in this House or in the North of our country cares more about Irish sovereignty than Sinn F&eacute;in.  That is why we have opposed elements in EU treaties that have reduced Irish sovereignty.  The full impact of the decision by the pro-austerity parties here to support not just the fiscal treaty but previous conservative EU treaties is now bearing fruit.  Maastricht, Nice, Lisbon and other treaties have culminated in the reduction of the State&rsquo;s economic sovereignty.  Next year&rsquo;s budget, as well as all subsequent budgets, will have to be signed off in Brussels and Frankfurt.  How is that progress towards the re-establishment of Irish economic sovereignty?  The European Commission will be here twice a year checking our balance sheets, monitoring our compliance with rules not made in our interest but by which we must abide.  We will also be under extra surveillance until we repay 75% of our EU loans.  Let us remember, they are loans not grants.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in is glad the Government did what it would have done and not taken out a further bailout facility.  It is sad to see Fianna F&aacute;il arguing for a second bailout, however.  Has the party learned nothing?  Yesterday, Deputy Martin argued that one reason the precautionary credit line should be taken is because of the stress test of the banks next year.  Yet, no one knows whether the banks need additional credit.  It is beyond belief that he can argue that this country should go voluntarily into a second bailout in case AIB, Bank of Ireland or any other Irish bank needs additional credit next year, a bailout for which taxpayers will be committed to pay back.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in supports the decision not to take the precautionary credit line.  However, certain actions taken in Europe could be masking long-term trouble in the banking sector.  Outright monetary transactions, OMT, is a good policy initiative taken by the European Central Bank, ECB, quelling fears in the markets across Europe.  This could, however, be masking another problem.  We know the ECB has flooded the markets with cheap money, primarily because the United States has withdrawn this type of funding.  We need to be vigilant and address these problems.  While the ECB&rsquo;s proposals have given time to financial institutions to repair their balance sheets, there is still a question as to whether the length of time given is sufficient such is their impairment.</p><p> There has been much talk about OMT as a reason why we should have taken the second bailout.  The Fianna F&aacute;il finance spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, claimed OMT is only available to programme countries or those with a precautionary credit line.  He did not read the rest of the ECB press release which stated OMT may be available to countries which were in a programme and are re-entering the bond markets.  Although I hope OMT will not be required for the State, will the Minister elaborate on what that sentence in the press release from the ECB means?  How long would such a facility be available to this State?  Would it be for three, six or 12 months?</p><p> I thank the Minister and the Government for the opportunity to debate this motion but it is a bit of a sham debate.  Without access to the information of the analysis done by the Department, the information imparted to the Minister in Washington, Brussels and Frankfurt, the information as to what happened between noon last Wednesday at the finance committee and Thursday morning with the hustle and bustle of an emergency Cabinet meeting, then we are just speaking in a vacuum.  It is disappointing the Minister has not released all this information.  This is a charade debate.  Nevertheless, we have had the opportunity to put our views on the record.  While I believe the final outcome was the right one, the process of arriving at it must be questioned.</p></speech>

We got this motion yesterday at 4.50 p.m. and amendments were to be in by 9.30 a.m. this morning.  That was before we got to hear what the Minister had to say about the bailout exit.  How are we supposed to make an informed response to this motion without actually hearing what the Minister has to say?  That is ridiculous.</p><p>  This is a bogus debate.  It is an utter charade, a political trick played by a Government that specialises in pulling the wool over the eyes of the people.  We are faced with a false choice which I, and others on this side of the House, reject utterly.  We are being asked to make the choice of whether to stay in the frying pan of the troika&rsquo;s austerity programme or jump into the fire of the international markets to become prey to the vultures, speculators and the bondholders who caused this mess in the first place.  To suggest these options are valid and that opting for the latter is a victory for the country is wrong.  To put it in simpler terms, the choice is either to borrow tens of billions of euro from the troika to pay off odious debts that belong to the banks but which the Minister will inflict on the backs of our citizens or to borrow tens of billions of euro to pay off odious debts from the very same bankers and bondholders whose debts they are.  What a choice.</p><p>  The issue is why we are paying off debts that are not ours.  Why is it that next year we will pay &euro;9 billion, the equivalent of the education budget, on interest on debts that are not ours?  No matter which choice we make, we will be dictated to by the lenders.  It is only because the Minister has agreed to take on these debts that these guys control us.  They can dictate to us through the blackmail and bullying of the international markets which we have been subject to either in or out of the programme.  If we choose not to go down that route, we will be subject to the surveillance, monitoring and diktat of the ECB, the IMF and troika which, in any event, dances to the tune of the international markets.  This is a complete joke.</p><p>  Meanwhile, our country is being beggared.  This is the real meaning of the motion as the Minister well knows.</p><p>The real purpose of this motion is to try to deflect attention away from the vicious, cruel, heartless cuts that are being imposed on some of the most vulnerable people in our society, such as taking medical cards from people who are sick or old and taking social welfare payments from young people who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  It is all very amusing in the cynical world that is D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, where everything is a game and a charade, played out for the cameras and the soundbites, presumably to give the Minister some satisfaction and a few laughs as he puts Fianna F&aacute;il into a difficult position because of that party's view on precautionary credit lines, which is an equally opportunistic position and utterly bogus.  They talk about it as though there were only two options: either to have conditions rammed down our throat or to become subject to the international markets.  The Minister is trying to lure the public and the media into an utterly false debate, played out purely for the cameras.  We reject that utterly.</p><p> When is the Government going to stand up to these vultures, whether they are the troika representatives of the financial markets or the financial markets themselves, and tell them that our society cannot take this any more and that we cannot afford to pay them &euro;9.1 billion next year?  Now that we are close to reaching a primary budget balance, we have the leverage to tell them that.  The Minister no longer has the excuse that we have a massive deficit and that we are spending more than we are taking in.  We can tell them to get lost, that we are not paying that money back, and see what they have to say to that.  Instead, we are just getting down on our knees to be screwed one way or the other.</p></speech>

The Labour Party in particular would do well to remember the words of its founder when he spoke about how it would not be enough to fly the green flag over Dublin Castle and said that unless we tackled the economic issues at the heart of Ireland, England would still rule us.  He said: "She would rule you through her capitalists, through her landlords, through her financiers, through the whole array of commercial and individualist institutions she has planted in this country and watered with the tears of our mothers and the blood of our martyrs."  If we replace England with the troika, the story remains much the same.  We are conscripted into avoiding excessive deficits forever.  We have signed up to everlasting surveillance of our economic affairs through various European treaties.  The Minister and his Government have flown the flag for neoliberalism and will continue to do so.  There is no regaining of our sovereignty.  We do not have it and we will not have it.</p><p>  We should remind ourselves of what this programme was about, what it achieved and where we are going.  At its heart, the IMF bailout was a redistribution of wealth in favour of people who were already wealthy, rewarding them for their mistakes, paying their debts from the public purse, and making the bankers' debt the people's debt.  While doing that, it facilitated the standing on its head of the welfare state and all the basic elements of decency that existed previously.  It facilitated an acceleration of privatisation and dismantled the welfare state.  That agenda of austerity is a political choice.  It is a choice that the Government is continuing to make.  Its outcome is inequality on a scale we have not seen heretofore.  The top 20% of people in this State have an average income that is five times more than that of the lowest 20%, yet the top 10% of householders have an effective rate of taxation of only 25.6%.  Many of our multinationals, which we are told give us so much, have an effective taxation rate of only 4% to 6%.  The wealthy have not borne the brunt of austerity or the troika bailout.  All of the evidence shows that the disproportionate burden of these policies has been put on the shoulders of the most vulnerable in society.  Exiting the programme under the Government's policies of neoliberalism will only ensure more of the same.</p><p>  We are being shackled to years of debt slavery and recession.  The Minister has nothing further to offer us in that respect.  This decision will leave him somewhat exposed in that he now has nowhere to hide.  He is very fond of hiding behind the crimes of his predecessors in Fianna F&aacute;il, and is fond of telling us that it was the troika that made him do things.  Now that we are outside the programme, the blame will fall firmly on his shoulders and the Irish electorate will judge him accordingly.  There will be nowhere to hide.  That is an important lesson, because there are many people who disagree with the Government's agenda.  Workers are organising in the ESB to save their pensions, junior doctors are forced to take action, young people are organising around the We're Not Leaving youth campaign, and there is an electorate that is determined to deal with the Government at the next election.  These issues will persist because once we are out, the Minister will ensure that neoliberalism prevails.  Ordinary people cannot afford to put up with that, so I believe he will be judged accordingly.</p></speech>

A range of measures has been brought in to copper-fasten the neoliberal agenda.  This is not the first Government to behave in that manner.  I found an article in <i>The Guardian</i> that was published the day after the Budget Statement in 2010.  It stated the following:<blockquote>  During the debate in the D&aacute;il Fine Gael's spokesman for finance Michael Noonan accused the Fianna F&aacute;il/Green Party government of being socially blind and said the budget was &quot;soft on the rich and hard on the poor&quot;.<br /><br />  Noonan added: &quot;This is the budget of a puppet government, doing what it is told by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank.</blockquote>The Minister was dead right.  In fairness to Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which have implemented neoliberalism lock, stock and barrel, so did Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party before them, and, sadly, we have seen Sinn F&eacute;in do the same in Northern Ireland today.  There is not really much difference between them.</p><p>  An interesting issue today is that of the fishing industry.  We have had problems in Kilmore Quay in the last week or so due to the low quotas imposed on the local fishermen.  At the moment, the French are allowed to catch six times more whitefish in Irish waters than the Irish.  There is no fairness involved here.  The notion that all our waters are European waters is a bit hard to take.  I am sure the Polish coalfields or the vineyards of Italy are not much good to us.  I do not know why other countries are entitled to catch more of our fish than we are.  That is a massive problem.  I realise that the market has to deal with the fact that overfishing is unhealthy, but we must work towards greater fairness for the Irish.</p><p>  Anybody who has had the privilege of buying <i>The Irish Times</i> today will find it contains a leaflet from Gay Mitchell, MEP, in which he states that we need to change the vocabulary:<blockquote>'Austerity' is in fact 'Consolidation'- part of the planned recovery. ... The problem at home [meaning Ireland] is not &quot;austerity&quot;, it is lack of solidarity.</blockquote>One Fine Gael spokesman described Gay Mitchell as &quot;the evil of two lessers&quot;.  It is incredible that this guy can say that austerity is not our problem, but rather a lack of solidarity.  Is cutting medical cards from pensioners his idea of solidarity?  The budget for the Traveller community has been cut by 18%.</p></speech>

Katie is a five-year-old girl with Down's syndrome and many complications, including asthma and juvenile arthritis.  Her medical card was granted based on her medical condition and although her condition has become a little worse since then, her card has been taken from her.  Her mother, Jackie Connolly, has been campaigning on this case, which illustrates the appalling impact the change in policy on discretionary medical cards has had on very sick children.  Ronan Woodhouse is a child with Down's syndrome and 13 associated illnesses.  Last February he lost the medical card he has had since his birth in 2005.  Why?  Someone said no undue hardship was involved.  His mother was outside the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis and the Taoiseach said he would meet her, but that has not happened and her son still has not got his medical card.</p><p>  The denials go on.  I have been raising this for months.  The Taoiseach told me anybody who deserved a medical card would get it, but that is untrue.  The Minister's statement that there has been no change in policy but only the application of probity is as skewed a statement as I have ever come across and is designed to hide the truth.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, stated in reply to a parliamentary question that from 1 January to October this year more than 10,000 discretionary medical cards had been taken from people.  By definition, these are very sick children and adults with significant and rare conditions.</p><p>  How long must the denials of any change go on?  Will the Taoiseach accept that there has been a fundamental change in policy with regard to the allocation of discretionary medical cards and that this change has resulted in the visiting of extraordinary hardships on people and families who deserve much better?  I have been talking about this for six months.  Shame on the Taoiseach and the Government for refusing to accept what people from all sides of the House have been saying for so long and doing nothing about it but giving us empty, meaningless rhetoric that does not accord with the reality on the ground.</p></speech>

Nobody is automatically entitled to a medical card.  The problem we had in this country for so long was that different health areas allocated medical cards based on different criteria.  Everybody is now treated equally, starting here.  Nobody is automatically entitled to a medical card.  If a parent, parents or whoever has an income in excess of the guidelines laid down, the discretionary element comes into play.  Last week I had a case in which there was a claim for a medical card for someone whose income was &euro;7,000 over the limit not just in the year but every week.  I have dealt with a number of sensitive cases in the last month and I am glad that many of these were cleared due to the application of discretion because of the nature of the applicants' medical problems.</p><p>  Deputy Martin mentioned Ronan and Katie and said that Ronan had 13 illnesses.  The director of the HSE has met Ronan's mother on two occasions.  I do not have the details of the child's illnesses, but I can understand the frustration.  Deputy Martin asked me the question, as he is entitled to, of whether this child is entitled to a long-term illness card.</p></speech>

If somebody met the person they could sort it out.  I use these cases to illustrate the problem.  I dealt with approximately 12 cases two months ago, including people with varying ages and various conditions or disabilities, including motor neuron disease.  Professor Hardiman of Beaumont Hospital said she had never written so many letters.  Why?  There has been a change in policy.</p><p>  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach gets up here every day and says there has been no change in policy.  Since the 1970 Health Act, undue hardship has been the reason in the legislative framework for giving people with particular conditions and illnesses medical cards.  This represents only 0.3% of the entire medical card allocation.  There has been a change in policy.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health keep talking about narrowing the gap and financial thresholds.  That is what it comes back to.  For the last three years the move has been on to get rid of discretionary medical cards from the system, and it is dressed up in gobbledygook.</p><p>Only this morning my office was notified of another case-----</p></speech>

The Deputy was the person who, as Minister for Health, signed the working time directive.  He was the one who said he would have the problem sorted out by 2004.  Ten years on, this is another mess which has been left to us to clear up.  The European Commission decided to bring the country before the court as a result of the Deputy's gross incompetence and neglecting his business at the time.  I refute his charge in regard to medical cards.  I do not have the medical information available to me, but if I did, I probably would not understand all of the implications of the medical requirements involved.  However, it is my understanding the long-term illness card granted to the child mentioned by the Deputy does cover the child's illnesses.  That is my information, but the Deputy has different information.  Neither of us is competent to make the judgment on medical grounds, although the Deputy might pretend that he is.</p></speech>

Very sick citizens, including very sick children, should have the right, without equivocation, to a medical card.</p><p>  I wish to raise a different issue with the Taoiseach.  As he knows, US diplomats Richard Haass and Meghan O'Sullivan are conducting intensive discussions on outstanding aspects of the Good Friday and other Agreements.  They include legacy issues arising from the conflict.  Anyone with an interest in building the peace knows that these legacy issues of the past cannot be allowed to be an obstacle in building the future.  Therefore, we need to have a measured and inclusive debate on all of the issues involved.  This morning the Taoiseach may have heard that the Attorney General in the North, Mr. John Larkin, had put forward his ideas for dealing with one aspect, the issue of prosecutions.  He has expressed the view that there should be no prosecutions for incidents that occurred before the Good Friday Agreement.  He has also said the current position favours non-state forces, but that is not the case.  We know that the British Government is in breach of a number of international agreements, including some with the Irish Government.  There is also, to all intents and purposes, a virtual amnesty for British forces and their allies, while thousands of republicans and innocent Nationalists have served lengthy prison sentences.</p><p>  I have not yet had a chance to read the Northern Ireland Attorney General's full submission, but I intend to do so.  It is good that the Haass talks have encouraged people to make submissions and that he wants to hear the voices of the people, including the voices of victims.  Mr. Haass has received a few hundred submissions.  Our society needs to have this debate.  Can we have some understanding and some measure of reasoned, rational, intelligent and sensitive debate on these issues that will recognise that any mechanism put in place must be victim-centred and on the basis of equality?  We have proposed that there be an international independent truth recovery process.  Others have different ideas, which is fair.  We need to take the opportunity to discuss these matters in order that we can move forward in a way which looks after the victims but also builds a future for the survivors.</p><p>  I am very conscious, for example, of the upcoming official visit of the President to Britain and all of the other seismic changes we have seen in our time.  These need to be measured and discussed, not just in palaces but on the streets, in the laneways and on the hillsides of this island, most particularly in the North.  Will the Taoiseach encourage a debate on these matters in the way I have outlined and will he set aside time here to allow that to happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000019#R02100"><p>I will.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and I met Dr. Haass recently in Dublin.  He was invited to come here by the Executive and look at the question of flags, parades and the past.  He has gone through a listening process and hopes to conclude his engagement, discussions and recommendations by Christmas.  It is only appropriate that there be rational and appropriate discussion.  It may well be that at the end of the day there can be some movement on the issue of flags and parades.  There is certainly a possibility of movement in that regard.</p><p>  The question of the past is different because it deals with victims on all sides of the atrocities committed.  It would not be helpful for me to comment on the personal submission made by the Attorney General in Northern Ireland.  I must respect his views as the holder of a statutory office in that context.  It would be difficult for families on either side in what was a dark time in Northern Ireland if we were to follow that advice and put in place what the Northern Attorney General has recommended and were to find, subsequently, incontrovertible DNA evidence of the involvement of a person or persons in a killing on either side.  As the Deputy knows, families want closure and there is always a yearning to find out what happened, who gave the instructions and why it was done.</p><p>  I do not object to having a proper debate in the House or at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on these matters.  We have given Dr. Haass our full support in the efforts he is making following the invitation he received to deal with the issue of flags, parades and the past.  I have offered him every assistance the Government can give him in his work.  I offered the same to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister at the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh recently.</p></speech>

I heard Margaret Irwin from Justice for the Forgotten give her view on this matter.  She more or less expressed the same view as the Taoiseach on the different impressions victims and their advocacy groups have on these matters.  Of course, there are many matters, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, where the British Government has been indicted but not come forward.  There is no single voice across the victim community.  Some want the truth and some a judicial process.</p><p>It is really important that we get to a point where we recognise there are different narratives.  I am an Irish republican and I believe the partition of the island and British involvement in our affairs are at the core of this, but Unionists have a different view and Fine Gael may have a different view.  All of these views and narratives have their own truth and we must get to a point where we lay the narratives side-by-side and respect them all.  This does not mean the Taoiseach, Unionists or British Ministers have to change, but that we recognise somewhere in the totality of these narratives lies the truth.  All of the different perspectives of what happened, who is responsible and what caused it are useful only if we can plot a way forward.  Otherwise they become debilitating, negative and totally and absolutely frustrating, particularly for victims.</p><p> How do we encourage and set out such a debate?  We must first of all recognise it is a crucial matter.  The Government is not a junior partner, but a co-equal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements.  It has responsibility to look after everyone in the North, including our Unionist neighbours, and to plot a course forward, in the way described by the Taoiseach, in dealing with the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister, Dr. Haass and others.  I thank the Taoiseach for his answer but I would like to see him facilitate here in the D&aacute;il the type of joined up inclusive thoughtful discussion aimed at unshackling us from the past so it never repeats itself and aimed at forging a more hopeful future for the people who have survived the conflict and for our children and grandchildren.</p></speech>

Since the Good Friday Agreement, when people North and South went to the polls and we had validation from the vast majority of the people of the island, this template still stands.  However, it might be appropriate if we were to wait and see the recommendations Dr. Haass will put together following his analysis, and his listening and engaging with various elements in Northern Ireland, and see what he puts on paper for consideration by the Executive.  If we were to have a debate before this happens it might be interpreted as trying to influence what recommendations he might want to make.  When we see the conclusion of his work I am quite happy that we have such a debate here, one of many, where the narratives can be laid out side-by-side and we can see whether there is a conclusion that might move this forward.</p><p>  It is quite right of the Deputy to refer to the invitation from Buckingham Palace and the Queen to Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann to visit officially.  It will be the first State visit by an Irish President since the foundation of the State to Britain.  In this sense it speaks for itself in terms of its significance and importance.</p><p>  The Deputy can take it the Government is quite willing to engage.  As I stated to Dr. Haass and other members of the party, it is in everybody's interest that we should be able to bring closure where we can and we should be able to deal with the contentious issues of flags and parades, and hopefully, in the broad spectrum of the families of the more than 3,000 were murdered, killed or maimed South and North, that we will be able to move this on in some fashion.  I am up for this, as is the Government.  It is the way we do it which is important in the sense of people understanding we are serious about moving Ireland and the island of Ireland to a new place in the time ahead.  I suggest we see what recommendations Dr. Haass makes.  He is there at the invitation of the Executive.  The House is willing to respond appropriately.</p></speech>

It has also continued to wind down the RAPID programme, leading to the effective abolition of the programme.  The RAPID programme revitalises areas through planning, investment and development.  The programmes were developed to assist deprived urban and rural communities which the Celtic tiger had bypassed.  These communities had heard of but never saw the elusive Celtic tiger.  These areas suffered deprivation for many years with a lack of facilities, services and resources.  This was reflected in high poverty and unemployment rates, early school leaving and anti-social behaviour issues.</p><p>  Since the implementation of the programme there have been improvements in these areas of disadvantage such as the provision of community policing units, the development of community centres for the youth, persons with disabilities and the elderly, the provision of outdoor facilities, training programmes and child care facilities.  As a consequence there have been significant benefits to the quality of life in local communities and decreased anti-social behaviour.  The Government is throwing all of this away at a time when unemployment in these areas is at unprecedented levels and poverty is increasing.  In my constituency the towns of Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary and parts of Clonmel are affected, as are towns and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The RAPID programme had expenditure of approximately &euro;10 million in 2009 but this has been reduced to less than &euro;2 million.  This is a reduction of more than 80%, which is ten times the reduction of public spending generally.  RAPID co-ordinators employed by local authorities have had their funding withdrawn, which has meant they have either lost their jobs or have been redeployed to other duties.  Given the huge and disproportionate scale of this cut to services for the poorest people in the country I must ask the Taoiseach whether the Government has a political agenda to attack the poorest and most disadvantaged communities in the country.</p></speech>

The Government has no such agenda.  The mandate given to the Government was to sort out our public finances and provide opportunities for jobs for our people.  We will never have the type of country we know we can have unless these two principal issues are dealt with.  Irish people have come a long way in the past three years.  When one asks people, whether they are in the town or country, what they really want, one hears all the usual answers, but essentially everybody wants to have a job and not just a job but a good one.  For this to happen we must have a country and an economy running effectively.  We did not have this in the profligacy of the so-called tiger years when some gained everything and others lost everything.</p></speech>

This includes the communities mentioned by Deputy Healy.  The RAPID programme was very effective in many cases and announcements were made about it which were never followed through.  Changes are being made to local government whereby the balance of responsibility between the elected representatives and the executive will see far greater accountability in terms of public moneys being voted and spent in urban and rural areas which have been deprived of facilities and structures for a very long time.</p><p>  I was recently in Deputy Healy's county and the values of the Irish people have not changed but have strengthened in the sense of community spirit.  I notice in the times of hardship and difficulties many people have fallen upon that communities have rallied in a way they did not before.  This is something we must encourage and strengthen, and this is part of the &euro;1.04 billion spend the Government will make next year for all areas, town and country, in terms of opportunities, particularly for young people, to live, stay and work at home if this is what they wish to do.  The point made by the Deputy is valid, but it will not happen in the way he wants or that anybody else wants unless our economy is functioning properly whereby clearly there is an emphasis from the Government on the opportunity to create jobs and employment and get people off the live register.</p><p>The aim would also be to motivate them and give them a sense that they are making a contribution to their localities, counties and the country in general.</p></speech>

The staff who occupied those jobs served deprived communities throughout the country.  In 2012 Brian Harvey presented his report, "Downsizing the Community Sector" to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Said report showed that the contraction in the sector - on foot of a policy introduced by the previous Government and continued by the current Administration - would lead to 11,150 direct jobs in the community and voluntary area being lost by the end of this year and that by 2015 a total of 17,000, or one third of the total number of jobs in the sector, will have been lost.  As already stated, these are front-line jobs which are occupied by those who serve deprived communities.  All of this is happening at a time when-----</p></speech>

I have grave concerns with regard to what the latter is suggesting and proposing.  This goes to the core of many issues that have been raised in this House on quite a number of occasions, namely, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, collusion between British state security forces and loyalist paramilitaries, the murder of Jean McConville, the lack of a resolution in respect of the those who were disappeared and whose bodies have never been found and the definition of when the Troubles begin and end for many families who are still seeking justice in respect of those who murdered their loved ones.  It seems that a pardon has been almost unilaterally decided upon in respect of the latter.  This is a very grave issue.  It might suit many people if the views of the Attorney General of Northern Ireland were carried through upon, the past was neatly buried and prosecutions were placed to one side.</p><p>  The House should debate this issue.  The Taoiseach should set Government time aside in order that we might discuss the section in the programme for Government which deals with Northern Ireland and the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  Such a debate could form the basis of an input into the Haass process.  After all, Dr. Haass has engaged in consultation and dialogue with many parties.  What is wrong with the D&aacute;il making a contribution to the process in the form of a debate?  Such a debate would be very helpful.</p></speech>

Dr. Haass was invited here by the Executive to do a particular job and make recommendations.  This House has primacy and, as has been pointed out, the Government is the co-guarantor, with the British Government, of the Good Friday Agreement.  The contribution of Dr. Haass may well be very valuable.  This matter is being raised this morning because of the personal views expressed by the Attorney General in Northern Ireland.  My view is that we should allow Dr. Haass to do his work and make his recommendations, after which we can have a debate, North and South, about how to move forward.</p></speech>

The Minister will then have three weeks to consider the service plan presented to him, at which point we can debate it in the Chamber.</p></speech>

Did the Taoiseach inform the House that it would not proceed?</p><p>  On the housing Bill, the Taoiseach may be aware from conversations with Government Deputies that public housing provision in the Dublin City Council area has collapsed and that the rental accommodation scheme is simply not working.  We have an increasing number of homeless families, many of whom face the prospect of homelessness this Christmas.  The Taoiseach is the man in charge.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for housing is not delivering even remotely near the number of homes we need.</p></speech>

Housing and homelessness are important issues and I have referred to them recently in response to questions.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing is concerned about the matter.  She is in contact with the agencies dealing with the homeless, the various categories of homelessness and the reasons for homelessness.</p></speech>

No mention was made of a deadline for amendments either when we received the motion or subsequently.  When I asked this morning whether we could table an amendment to the Government's motion, I was told the deadline had passed.  How can one amend a motion when one is not given a deadline by which to submit amendments?  It is preposterous also that we be given a deadline for a motion before we have a chance to hear what the Government has to say on it.  We should, at a minimum, be told of any deadline to submit amendments.  I request, therefore, that we be given the option to submit amendments to the Government's motion.</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald will be aware of the European court ruling in respect of the workers in Waterford Glass and it is necessary that there be a structure in place so that when this goes back to the High Court - it is listed for 3 December - there will be a structure in place.</p><p>  In regard to the Magdalens, I hope that some of the payments can be made close to the end of the year or early next year.  Yesterday the Cabinet approved the allocation of &euro;250,000 as the first allocation in respect of the women who were in laundries who are resident in England.  That would have been done earlier arising from the first Government decision but there were some complications with the registration of the charity.  It is now decided, a Government decision, that the Camden charity will be the conduit through which that money is channelled.</p><p>  The validation of the requirements of the Magdalen women is proceeding and the medical care issue is one of those.  As I am standing here, I cannot tell Deputy McDonald what the position is about many of them who have medical cards already, but the Government is clear that there will be no undue delay in giving them what the Government has already approved arising from the Quirke recommendations.</p></speech>

It calls on national parliaments to bring forward their own legislation for the bail-in, which would allow for senior bondholders to be burned.  The Taoiseach previously told the House that he does not want "defaulter" written on his forehead but, given that Europe has asked that this legislation be brought forward and that senior bondholders could be in a position to be burned, when is the legislation likely to come before this House?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000024#W01000"><p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the regulation of cannabis for medicinal and recreational use and for that purpose to establish the Cannabis Regulation Authority; to provide for the licensing of the cultivation and sale of cannabis; to provide for offences; and to provide for related matters.</blockquote>While I do not expect this House to support the Bill in the short term, I believe it will be seen in the longer term as progressive legislation.  Just as many Deputies remained quiet when people stood up in this Chamber to speak in favour of legalising contraception and divorce, in the future this issue will be regarded in the same way.  We will eventually arrive at a time when the proposals I am making in this Bill are accepted.  Policy around the world is moving in this direction.  While it is unfortunate that we are often the puppy that follows the master, we might start to think for ourselves.  It is something that will happen.  It is already happening around Europe, in the United States of America and in Central and South America.</p><p>  More than 1 million people in this country have admitted to using cannabis.  That figure includes two Ministers who have openly admitted to it.  I would be shocked if there were not more in the Cabinet.  Over 1 million people have decided the law should not be as it is.  Approximately 150,000 people regularly flout the law.  An estimated 100,000 people have received a criminal record for doing so.  That is an estimate because when I asked the Department of Justice and Equality to furnish me with a figure for the number of people with a criminal record for possession of cannabis I was told it did not have the resources to find the answer and that it was not worth its while.  From putting together the figures available to me, I arrived at my estimate that more than 100,000 people have criminal records for the possession of cannabis.  If my Bill became law, these 100,000 people could once again be actively involved in areas from which they are currently debarred, such as education.  Even if their economic activity increased by only &euro;1,000 per person, that would be worth &euro;100 million to the Irish economy.</p><p>  There is potential for a tax dividend from legalising cannabis, as well as savings in the criminal justice system, which brings more than 8,000 people to court every year for cannabis-related offences.  One of the major benefits of passing the Bill is that otherwise law-abiding citizens, many of whom are young males, would see no reason for conflict with the Garda and would be more open to co-operating with garda&iacute; on other areas of crime.</p><p>  Before the year is out I intend to get this issue debated.  Two weeks ago I raised the issue in the D&aacute;il and I was pleasantly surprised by the input from many Government Deputies.  Over the coming year, I hope to work with NORML, an organisation established to drive this issue, to convince more Deputies that my Bill is the right way to go by inviting two doctors from that organisation, Dr. Cathal &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in and Dr. Garrett McGovern, to discuss the issue with the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I also intend to ask doctors who oppose my proposal to debate the issue.  I will propose that the committee write to Dr. Donald Tashkin of the University of California, who is the foremost expert on lung capacity after cannabis use, to ask him to present the facts.  I will also ask the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to invite the former head of the Cambridgeshire police force, Tom Lloyd, to explain the issue from a criminal justice perspective.</p><p>  That is all I have to say on the issue now, but I will be returning to it regularly over the coming year.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the fishing industry was attacked over the weekend by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Navy and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  On Friday, letters were delivered to 100 fishermen on 15 trawlers, and workers in Kilmore Quay have been laid off since then.  The livelihoods of these men are jeopardised and the viability of the business in which they work is in serious doubt.  Fishing is the lifeblood of the small village of Kilmore Quay, which has been thrown into a state of crisis.  With no fish, there is no work for the people on the boats or in the factories.  The O'Flaherty brothers, who operate trawlers, are trenchant critics of Government policy on fishing quotas.</p><p>It appears the south east has been systematically discriminated against by the Department, the Navy and the SFPA in targeting fishermen under a long list of regulations.  The entire O'Flaherty fleet has been ordered to cease trading, despite only two of the trawlers having been questioned originally.  It raises the question of whether the fleet on the south-east coast is being unfairly targeted.  As these Irish boats remain in port, Spanish, Belgian and French ships continue to fish these seas.  The broader issue at stake is the need for Ireland to trade quotas with other states that are under-fishing, particularly the French.  The French only caught 38% of their monkfish quota in Irish waters, but they steadfastly refused to yield their unused quota.  It is up to the Minister to press this matter at EU level to enable fishermen to maximise the total quota available.</p><p> An effective quota transfer system between member states is the key part of the Common Fisheries Policy that delivers both for fishermen who make their living from the sea and consumers on the shore.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of a swap, whereby fishermen at Kilmore Quay could return to fishing and the men in question could return to work as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Some 170 people are out of work.  Most of them are self-employed and can receive no assistance from the State.  Some 15 boats have been ordered ashore and tied up.  The consequences are alarming and disturbing for the community and the wider industry.  This is all about the denial of an adequate quota to Irish fishermen in Irish waters.</p><p>  In area 7, out of a quota of 18,000 tonnes of monkfish, 58% was caught by the French, whereas the Irish caught 97% of a quota of only 3,000 tonnes.  The French quota in the area is six times higher.  In the same area, 33% of megs was caught by French vessels, while 92% was caught by Irish vessels.  There is a ratio of more than two to one in favour of France.  This year some 38% of megs was caught by French vessels, while the figure Ireland is at 81%.  I cannot understand how the part of the French quota that has not been caught cannot be redistributed to Irish vessels.  There is an another reason, one economically driven in favour of France which is a stakeholder in Irish waters and the Irish mixed fishery feet.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  This issue needs to be met head-on.  We cannot have Irish fishermen with boats tied up on the shore and forced to sign an affidavit before they go back to sea.  In other words, they are criminalised before they return to sea.  That is a disgrace and I want the Minister to deal with the matter.  Decent men and women who are striving to put bread on the table for Christmas as best they can are being effectively criminalised by inequality within the system.</p></speech>

Deputy John Browne, in particular, knows this and I am surprised to hear a former Minister of State with responsibility for the fisheries sector say what he said.  The issue relates to a company's compliance with sea fisheries legislation and is one for the SFPA.  The matters arising are individual matters of operational law enforcement in respect of an individual company.  The principals of the company own the biggest fleet of large whitefish trawlers in the country, with more than a dozen of its trawlers involved.  It would be inappropriate for me or anybody else to comment on matters that may be <i>sub judice</i> and may come before the courts in due course.</p><p>  This matter relates to illegal fishing.  Any illegal fishing has significant consequences for the broader fishing community and the sustainability of fish stocks.  Such activity is not a victimless crime and the impact is felt in a very real and immediate way by law-abiding fishermen who will see reduced prices at market, lower monthly quotas and, ultimately, significant stock reductions, putting livelihoods and future sustainability at risk.  All fish caught by individual vessels and companies, whether legal or illegal, are counted against the national quota and reduce the quota available for law abiding fishermen in the following period.</p><p>  The former Minster of State, Deputy John Browne, knows that the industry plays a lead role in decisions on quota management and in managing quotas.  The individual quotas for fisheries each month are recommended by representatives of the fishing industry's producer organisations on a stock by stock basis with the support of data from the SFPA and the Department at monthly meetings.  The objective of the monthly whitefish meeting is to give the industry the opportunity to recommend how the national quota can best be used for the benefit of the fishermen and onshore fish processors to achieve the highest economic return and best outcomes in terms of quota availability.</p><p>  This year we have had a higher quota in the Celtic Sea for almost all stocks than we have seen for many years.  The industry was involved in the allocation of the quota throughout the year and now that we are coming to the end of it the quota is becoming tight, but that is because large portions of it were used earlier in the year.  We cannot have a situation where, because people want to catch more fish, they break the rules and do so while other fishermen abide by the quota arrangements decided on in consultation with the industry on a monthly basis.</p><p>  With regard to the specific events that have prompted this question, I am informed by the SFPA that on three days last week there were five infringements by the company's vessels detected and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Since 2007 the SFPA has advised that it has recorded infringements by vessels operated by the company concerned on 42 occasions.  I am advised by the SFPA that the decision to direct these vessels to port under Article 43(b) of the EU Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Regulations was carefully considered and taken owing to the serious level of infringements by the company.</p><p>  There have been lengthy meetings this week, as there should be, between the SFPA and the company to try to find a way forward.  Livelihoods are at risk, specifically at a difficult time of year, in the build-up to Christmas.  I want to see these boats out fishing and obeying the rules.  What is on offer is not criminalisation; the SFPA has asked the company involved to sign an affidavit to ensure it will keep the rules in terms of the monthly allocation of quota, just like every other fishing boat off the southern coast.  We must have the same rules for everyone.  We cannot have one rule for the O'Flahertys and another for everyone else.  If I were to facilitate this or pressurise the SFPA into facilitating it, we would have chaos in the fishing industry.  If we want this to be a credible country in terms of how we manage our fish stock sustainably, everyone must have the law applied to them evenly, including the O'Flahertys.  If we do so, it will be my job in December to get the best possible deal for the Irish industry in quota negotiations.</p><p>  Relative stability with other countries is a valid issue we have debated in the House on many occasions, but this is not the reason there are 15 boats tied up.  It is because people made a conscious choice to overfish and I cannot allow this to happen.  The SFPA cannot allow it legally.  We are trying to find a practical way forward to get people back to work, while ensuring we are enforcing the rules laid down.  Otherwise, the Commission will come to Ireland and enforce the rules.</p></speech>

I do not care what facts and figures are put out but it is not right that the French Government has a stake in Irish waters to the detriment of Irish fishermen.  That is the issue.

Both Deputies know the legal practicalities of what is possible, and I have focused instead on putting the scientific arguments together to build stocks and have an increase in the quota allocation linked to the building of those stocks, as we have done with herring in the Celtic Sea, for example, which has been a great success story.</p><p>  We need to focus on what is possible rather than having the age-old argument which we cannot change about relative stability on waters deemed as European but for which Ireland has a responsibility in the allocation of stocks.  There has been mention of swaps and we have been very active in the swaps market this year with France, getting a significant increase in the amount of prawns, which is the second most valuable fishery for the fishing industry after mackerel.  I argue that it is the most important fishery in terms of the number of fishermen relying on it.  We have seen an increase because the industry made a conscious choice, of which I was a part, to catch 10% of this year's prawn quota last year, as we needed prawns at the end of last year.  We have swapped some pelagic stocks to increase the amount of prawns we can catch, and we are always looking for an active swaps market in order to get more fish for our fishermen.</p><p>  Nobody is more supportive of the fishing industry than I am.  I want to build it, employ more people, get more value for fish and work with companies like that run by the O'Flahertys, who run a very significant business in the south east.  They are very experienced and very good fishermen but they must have the same rules applied to them as everybody else.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, has a legal responsibility to ensure fair play.  If the O'Flahertys catch more fish, it means others who are legitimately catching fish would get a smaller quota the next month.  This is about an even playing field for everybody and the industry working together with my Department and the SFPA to allocate quotas on a monthly basis throughout the year to ensure we get the maximum economic return throughout the year.</p><p>  That is the process that has been happening but unfortunately, according to the SFPA, incidents last week mean the O'Flahertys have worked outside those rules, and the authority has had to take action as a result.  I hope the negotiations and conversations this week, as well as the affidavit on the table, can progress the issue so we can see the boats out fishing again, I hope as soon as in the next couple of days.</p></speech>

She also sought to ensure people in those areas did not get priced out of the market and rent allowances were suitable for the rental market that would be used by families.</p><p>  The Department used <i>www.daft.ie</i> as an area of information when it surmised the rent limits and I will quote some prices for an average three-bedroom semi-detached house.  This example would suit a couple with three children, although it relates to all other categories as well.  To rent a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Ashbourne in south Meath costs &euro;1,100, and the cost is the same in Ratoath.  In Finglas the cost to rent a similar property is &euro;1,100 and in Swords it would cost &euro;1,200 to rent a similar property.  The allowance for families in Finglas and Swords is &euro;950 but if a person tries to rent a house in Ashbourne or Ratoath, the allowance is only &euro;650.  Rents in the areas are exactly the same but there is a &euro;300 discrepancy in the supplement provided.  I could provide similar examples for two and one bedroom apartments, as well as cases where people rent rooms in houses.  In every category there is a major discrepancy between what is available ten miles down the road in Finglas versus what is available in Ashbourne.</p><p>  I understand the Department considered Meath as a county in its entirety and I appreciate that it is much cheaper to rent in Athboy, Enfield or Kells than it is in Ashbourne, Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin and Ratoath.  It is not the fault of people living in those towns that the metropolitan area of Dublin city has expanded not only just into the counties of Meath but also into Kildare, Louth and Wicklow.  Rent supplements should be reflective of that.  Although we have been beating the drum regarding rents in Meath for approximately a year, it dismays me further that rent limits in Kildare and Wicklow have been changed to reflect the fact they are part of the greater Dublin metropolitan area, and rents are higher.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider taking Meath as a county in its entirety and recognise that the south corridor of the county is in the greater Dublin metropolitan area.  The rents should be reflected as being equal to those commanded in the Dublin area, so rent supplement allowances should take that into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000026#Y01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  There are currently approximately 81,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million in 2013.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday, 17 June 2013, and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market, based on the most up-to-date data available.  The Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review.  The new rent limits have been set using the 35th percentile, ensuring that sufficient housing is available for recipients of the scheme.</p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and there have been some reductions across a number of counties, including some categories in County Meath, reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties.</p><p>Special provisions are made in exceptional circumstances, including, for example, people with disabilities in specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons.  The overall cost of the rent limit review and the changes we have made for 2013 is an extra &euro;7 million, which can be met from within the existing provision for the scheme.</p><p> There are currently 1,981 rent supplement recipients in County Meath, of whom almost 200 are in the Ashbourne and Ratoath areas.  In arriving at the appropriate rent limits for County Meath, rent levels in the major population centres in the county were tested.  Analysis shows that there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients in County Meath.  However, the number of rental properties available in the specific locations referred to by the Deputy is significantly lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county, and this has an impact on the cost of the accommodation units available for rent.  A search conducted on a leading property website shows that there are a total of 15 one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom properties available for rent in the Ratoath and Ashbourne areas.  It must be stressed, however, that the purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure the availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country.</p><p> The Department's strategic policy direction is to restore rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support - for instance, for people who have lost their jobs.  It is a temporary measure.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials of the Department of Social Protection are working with officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, who are properly leading the project.  It is the job of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities to provide appropriate accommodation.  They are developing proposals to give effect to the transfer to local authorities as set out by the Government.  The Department is advised that following the enactment of the relevant legislation, the HAP test phase will be carried out in the selected local authorities during 2014.</p></speech>

Rent supplement in areas of Meath was reduced in June this year to reflect the lower rents in those areas, namely Athboy, Enfield, Trim and Kells.  However, rent supplement limits in respect of the more significant rents in the southern corridor of the county were not increased.  The Minister seems to think that the reason rents in those areas are so high is the lack of rental accommodation available, but that is not true; they are high because of the large mortgages involved.  When they were sold, the houses were considered to be in the greater Dublin area.  It does not make sense that the Minister reviewed the figures in June of this year without being cognisant of the fact that the rents commanded for two-bedroom and three-bedroom houses in Ashbourne, Ratoath, Dunshaughlin and Dunboyne, which for all effective purposes are in the greater Dublin area, are exactly the same as those in Finglas, Santry, Clondalkin and Artane.  I agree with the Minister that rent supplement is a short-term measure and that a person should not expect to have it for the rest of his or her life.  The effect of the change will be that people who are rooted in their communities will have to move out because of a temporary glitch in their financial circumstances.</p><p>  The Minister indicated how few people are on rent supplement in the southern corridor of County Meath.  Would she please consider a further review in light of the fact that it would make a small monetary difference to the Department but would have a significant impact on communities that have developed in areas where people have decided to rear their families for the past ten to 15 years?  It would allow people to remain in these areas during temporary glitches in their financial circumstances until they get back on their feet.</p></speech>

It must be stressed that part of the issue is the lack of supply.  Deputy Doherty suggested that there was a far greater supply.  If that is the case, it is not available through the sources of information checked by the Department.</p><p>  The second and more important issue is that housing is correctly the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am most anxious to see a fundamental reform in the form of the transfer of rent supplement to local authorities.  That is in train through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  People who end up on rent supplement in the long term are heavily restricted in their ability to go back to work or set up a business because, in effect, if they start work again on a full-time basis or if they set up a business, the rent supplement may be withdrawn.  The time has come to reform how rent supplement operates in terms of getting people back to work and into activity.  It was designed as a temporary measure and I am glad the Deputy has acknowledged that.  It is also time for local authorities to properly adopt their responsibilities, including the possibilities that exist for renting houses over the medium term through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Local authorities have a significant role to play.</p><p>  I am most sympathetic to families who find themselves in a situation in which there is very little accommodation available in the area in which they want to live, and what accommodation exists is prohibitively expensive.  The Department is spending more than &euro;400 million on rent allowance for more than 81,000 families.  It is a very significant and large part of our budget.  The Deputy is graciously suggesting that the budget should be increased.  Perhaps she would take up the issue with her colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

However, one can insist on the maintenance of a waterway and that the water not be diverted away from one&rsquo;s land.  These principles should inform the debate we will have on the proposal to divert water from the River Shannon to supply Dublin.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, need have no doubt that the people of the mid-west will fight to maintain the waterway that is Lough Derg.  They would be right to do so.  In recent weeks, I have heard various proposals from Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, some sensible and some absurd.</p><p>  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of State to the most recent report from the Local Government Management Agency to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government providing the results of service indicators in local authorities.  The report published earlier this year contains some alarming figures.  The level of unaccounted-for water as a percentage of the total volume of water supplied under the water supply schemes of Dublin City Council is 40.3%.  A 2008 Forf&aacute;s report highlighted the need to address unacceptable levels of unaccounted-for water and suggested that proposals to increase capacity should not attract funding in the absence of action plans to reduce leakage.  This recommendation was reiterated by the report of the high level group on green enterprise from 2009.  One could ask what has changed since then, other than the chickens coming home to roost.  The failure of local authorities in Dublin to deal with wastewater resulted in water shortages in Dublin in recent weeks and water being cut off overnight.</p><p>  The British left a good water system in this city when they lowered their flag over Dublin Castle on 16 January 1922.</p><p>Since then, the failure of central and local government to maintain a functional water system has been a tragicomedy.  Now it proposed to veer to the farcical to compensate for that failure.</p><p> Lough Derg is designated as an SPA to comply with EU law.  Much of its shoreline is also designated as an SAC.  Under the accompanying regulations, farmers adjacent to the lake cannot take water for their livestock to drink without getting permission to do so<b>.  </b>Now it is proposed to divert that water to Dublin so people can wash their pets.  Is that really the water plan for Dublin in 2013?</p><p> Large environmental projects such as this are typically subject to litigation in Europe.  To quote a well-known television programme, we are going to look like very silly &ldquo;pixie heads&quot; if, instead of fixing the water infrastructure problem in Dublin, we propose to divert water there.  I cannot support any proposal to divert water from the Shannon until local authorities here in Dublin get their act together and put their system in order.  I ask the Government for a guarantee that what I fear will not happen.</p><p> The operating range of Lough Derg is small; it changes by about 40 cm.  That is set out in the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1934.  The water level is set at 110 to 112 ft. above the level at Poolbeg in Dublin.  I want a guarantee that any scheme that might even be countenanced by the Government will guarantee that water level.  Every infrastructural development on Lough Derg since 1934, including the piers and the waterway just opened in Killaloe, is predicated on maintaining the water level.  No more than anybody else in the mid-west, I do not want to live beside a latter-day Aral Sea but beside a beautiful waterway.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and hope he will be able to give me the guarantees I require.</p></speech>

My note suggests the Deputy is talking about robbing Peter to pay Paul.  In my reply, I want to talk about the economy and the future of the country, including the area represented by the Deputy and the greater Dublin area.  I want to broaden the issue.  The Deputy referred to pixie heads and washing cats and dogs but I am talking about saving jobs and the greater Dublin area.  It is a question of having water available to the greater Dublin area on a daily basis.  The difference pertaining to usage is very small, at approximately 1% or 2%.  If the supply is affected, as it was recently, it results in catastrophic failure right around the city.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that Dublin City Council did have to cut off the water supply.  It did not do so in the transparent way it ought to have done it.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, commented on that.  People suddenly found that they did not have water for quite a number of nights.</p><p>  We must ensure that every part of the country, be it Clare, Galway, Dublin or elsewhere, has an adequate and proper water supply.  Most important, we must ensure jobs are maintained and that people can wash themselves and work in an industry that requires considerable water.  The water supply in the greater Dublin area feeds the ICT sector and other water-intensive industries.  It also feeds agribusiness.  Dublin absolutely needs a water supply.</p><p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct about the level of unaccounted-for water.  I have a slightly different figure than the Deputy has.  The one I have been given for Dublin &ndash; I appreciate the one the Deputy gave and I will check it immediately after this debate &ndash; is approximately 28%.  I am told this is among the best figures around Europe.  The fact is that if unaccounted-for water is below a certain percentage, it is not economical to carry out repairs or make adjustments.  Significantly and properly, Dublin and Fingal, in particular, have been extremely proactive in dealing with the issue.</p><p>  We must step forward together as an economy and country.  We must deal with these issues transparently and openly, and they must be dealt with by meeting, talking and, above all, listening to one another.  I have met and will be happy to meet again people from the area the Deputy represents.  I will be happy to give them any hours or days they want.  I will be happy to go to Clare, north Tipperary or Limerick to ensure that any proposals by the Government - it is the Government of which the Deputy and I are members that is making these decisions - are transparent and accountable.  We should be running away from no issues.  We want to ensure that the people understand fully what we are actually talking about.  We are talking about improving the water supply for all the regions between Lough Derg and Dublin.  All the towns and places of employment in the areas in question will be much better placed if this project operates according to due process.  They will be able to employ more people and there will be much better amenities.  The Deputy should not mind his cats and dogs but think about the people and the jobs; that is what this is all about.</p><p>  It is also about the environment and ensuring that the people around the lake and along the river, which is the longest in Ireland at approximately 360 km, can be confident that the water will not disappear overnight.  Any water that is taken from the Shannon will have to be taken in a proper and sustainable way, as pointed out by the Deputy.  The water level must not be reduced below a certain point.  I am absolutely aware of the economic benefit to the community deriving from the Shannon.  That will not and must not be affected.</p><p>  The planning and environmental impact processes will not and must not be allowed to affect the economic and community benefits.  Rather than talk about legislating in Europe, I, as a legislator in this Parliament, would prefer to go with the Deputy to the people who expressed their concerns to talk to them and listen.  We must ensure that the bodies that will be in charge of the project, including Dublin City Council, will meet the people in question to explain their position.  Let us try to move forward together so we will not be robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We are ensuring that Peter and Paul have a job and a water supply and that there will be no adverse economic or environmental impacts.</p><p>  More than 1,000 jobs will be created through the project.  It will cost over &euro;500 million if and when it goes through all the processes.  There will be very significant benefits for everybody.  On foot of the extraction, which can happen only by way of due process, people must be happy that they will benefit as individuals and as members of their community.</p></speech>

Both are State agencies that report directly to the Minister of State's Department.</p><p>  The Minister of State spoke about jobs.  I know all about jobs and the lack of jobs where I come from.  I represent Clare in the mid-west, which has the highest unemployment rate in the country.  There is an empty Dell plant sitting in Limerick and I am damn sure that many people in Limerick city would like to work in ICT.  There is no reason that I can see why every single ICT job has to be located in Dublin rather than the mid-west.  If water is a prerequisite for this kind of work, it should be noted there is plenty of water and power in the mid-west.  Moneypoint and Ardnacrusha are both in my constituency and there are plenty of people looking for work.  They are getting planes and boats regularly.  I acknowledge we need jobs in Dublin.</p><p>  As we enter this decade of commemoration, we commemorate the democratic programme of the first D&aacute;il.  It referred to equality between men and women and stipulated that all the State's resources would be harnessed for all the people, not just the people living in one particular city.  The Shannon is a national resource and nobody is seeking to keep it for Clare, Limerick, north Tipperary or south Galway.  Rather, they are looking for a guarantee that the level of the Shannon will be maintained as it is now, and as it has been since Ardnacrusha was built.  The Minister of State referred to major infrastructure projects.  Some 20% of the GDP of this State was harnessed in 1925.  Some 5,000 men worked around the clock to get the power station built.  Is that to be sacrificed for this?</p><p>  We can have major infrastructure projects but they do not all have to be in Dublin.  They can be located across the country, as has been the case since the foundation of this State.  We can have people working in ICT and tourism on Lough Derg just as well as we can have them working in some boghole in the midlands.  If there is to be a reservoir in the midlands and Dublin runs short, the reservoir will be emptied to supply Dublin.  What will happen then?  Leisure jobs will be jeopardised in the midlands.</p><p>  There is already a nascent leisure industry on Lough Derg.  It has gone downhill.  For 20 years since I grew up, many tourists have come into the mid-west to spend money and go out on the lake to fish and sail.  Is that to be jeopardised?  I am not talking about selfishly keeping water for one area but I am suggesting we should not damage one area to benefit another.  The little water that exists in the mid-west at present needs to be guaranteed and maintained before we talk about diverting it anywhere.  The Minister of State knows where I stand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000029#BB00100"><p>The word is "abstraction", not "diversion".  Diversion suggests a change to the physical course of the river, but abstraction is the taking, by licence, of a volume of water from the river.  As the water can only be taken at particular times, as the Deputy rightly points out, the level of the River Shannon cannot and must not be affected by the abstraction.  It will be done according to a proper and due process, through the EPA and the planning system.  There is no question but that it can only be done properly in environmental terms.</p><p>  The Deputy is absolutely right about recreation on the River Shannon.  It is a wonderful waterway on which billions have been spent to improve navigation and tourism amenities.  The River Shannon cannot suffer as a result of this and there must be a clear community benefit from the project.  If that is the case and the abstraction issues are dealt with properly and planning permission is given, I do not see any problem with the project.  I have been to Ardnacrusha in the past.  An uncle of mine actually worked there and I know the fantastic, monumental progress it represented when it was built.  The Deputy might be interested to know that it was a Drogheda man, Dr. Thomas McLoughlin, who was in charge of the Ardnacrusha project.  The plant has a beautiful art deco control room which is worth seeing - it is absolutely stunning.  However, the Ardnacrusha power plant has had its day in terms of the energy needs it can supply, although that is not to say it is not functioning; it is.  It meets something like 3% of our national energy requirements.  I was actually surprised to discover the size of our current energy demands.  For the record, my mother is from County Clare and I was born in Tipperary; as a result, I am very much tuned into the Thurles and County Clare sides of the issue.  </p><p>  The bigger picture is that we must step forward together and satisfy the communities affected.  I repeat that I would like to go with the Deputy to meet them.  I would have no problem in doing so.  I would also make sure the appropriate officials were there.  Obviously, the planning process will be gone through and all of the other issues will be addressed.  We must listen to people and reassure them.  We all want what was the Dell factory in Limerick to be occupied by people who are gainfully employed, but this is not an &quot;us versus them&quot; issue.  It is not a Dublin versus Clare issue, although some might argue that it is.  It is about everybody benefiting from this project.  </p><p>  As regards the hole in the bog in Garryhinch, it will allow over 200 hectares of water to be supplied to the greater Dublin area.  An equivalent hole in the bog in Rutland Park in Anglia, England attracts over 1 million visitors per year, which is phenomenal.  I absolutely agree with Deputy McGrath that whatever happens in Garryhinch, there must be additional improvements to tourist and other amenities on the River Shannon.  That is the only way this will work and it will work if that happens.  I appeal to the Deputy not to approach the issue in terms of it being Peter versus Paul or washing cats and dogs.  This is about jobs, people, the area Deputy McGrath represents and the greater Dublin area.  It is about meeting the needs of the various interested parties involved.  Above all else, it is about listening to people, understanding the issues, meeting people's needs within and outside the planning process.  We must reassure them that we do understand the issues involved and want their concerns to be addressed properly, fairly and objectively in a democratic, appropriate and proper fashion.  I will pass on the Deputy's comments to the Department.  I am happy to check the figures he has proffered because I have not been given them. I thank him for them.</p></speech>

The issue at hand is the decision made by Garda human resources, HR, not to proceed with a number of redeployments already agreed between the local authorities in County Tipperary and the offices of the Garda vetting unit.  These transfers had been negotiated and signed off on by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government but were later blocked by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Eight staff in total, six from South Tipperary County Council and two from North Tipperary County Council, had agreed to transfer to the Garda vetting unit and received a letter of offer confirming their transfer only to have the rug pulled from under them later to devastating effect.  These employees believe they have been abandoned.</p><p>  I will outline the timeline of events.  In March this year preliminary discussions took place between North and South Tipperary County Councils and the Garda vetting unit on the possibility of having a redeployment option for staff in County Tipperary.  Following these discussions, the local authorities issued an e-mail to all staff, inviting expressions of interest.  It was indicated to staff that the vacancies were at grades three and four, with a limited number at grade six.  It was later clarified that Garda HR was seeking grade three clerical officers only.  Full clarification from Garda HR on a number of queries concerning contracts and terms and conditions was provided for the county councils in June.  In July the local authorities received an e-mail from Garda HR seeking an update on the progress of potential redeployments.  Further to this e-mail, on 24 July, a letter of offer was issued to eight members of staff who had expressed an interest and been identified as suitable for redeployment.  An e-mail was returned to Garda HR from the councils outlining the proposal to transfer eight members of staff and providing details of release dates, commencing in September.  In August confirmation of the transfers was received from Garda HR.  It was stated the transfers would initially, for the remainder of this year, be on a secondment basis, followed by permanent transfers.  All the required information on the eight staff was passed to Garda HR and following the provision of this information, confirmation was received from Garda HR that there were vacancies in both the Thurles and Tipperary town offices of the Garda vetting unit for the proposed transfer of these eight staff members.  It was agreed that the transfers would commence in September.  However, on 2 September, before the redeployments could be realised, the county manager received a telephone call from Garda HR to advise that the proposal was no longer progressing.  The eight staff were then notified of the difficulty.  </p><p>  The councils and the staff, in particular, are understandably disappointed and very aggrieved that the proposed redeployment opportunities were effectively withdrawn, particularly in view of the fact that they had already been issued with a formal contract of offer.  When the staff received these written offers, they began to make preparations for themselves and their families in the light of their new changed work circumstances.  The late removal of this offer has had a devastating impact on the individuals and families concerned.  Since their offers have been withdrawn, the staff in question have essentially been left in the dark with no information on whether the transfers could occur at a later date or where they will turn to from here.  As a result of the amalgamation of the two local authorities in County Tipperary, discussions are under way internally on where the staff will be transferred and how the single authority will operate.  The eight staff who were to be transferred to the Garda vetting unit are essentially in limbo and have been hugely disadvantaged by the conflicting information they have received.  It is grossly unfair to them that they should be so adversely affected.  They acted in good faith at all times and trusted the information provided for them.  It is now urgent and essential that due consideration be given to the request to follow through on the offers previously made.</p></speech>

I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is on official business elsewhere.</p><p>  The  Deputy and the House will be aware of the importance of delivering a vetting service that protects the most vulnerable in our society.  Significant additional resources have been provided for the Garda Commissioner in the past 12 months to decrease processing times in the Garda central vetting unit and ensure the best possible level of service is provided for organisations across the country which avail of the services of the unit.  The current processing time for vetting applications is approximately seven weeks from the date of receipt of the application in the vetting unit.  </p><p>  There are currently 136 whole-time equivalent civilian staff assigned to the vetting unit and upwards of 40 additional staff are to take up duty later this month on transfer from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This will bring the total number of staff to almost 180 compared to 93 last December.  It is expected that when these staff are fully trained in early 2014, there will be a further reduction in processing times.  This is a very good example of the value of redeployment within the public service and the contribution it can make to the more effective use of resources.</p><p>  These additional resources were obtained in recent months from within the justice sector, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other public service organisations such as the Shannon Free Airport Development Corporation.  Discussions were held with these organisations and the local authority in question to identify surplus staff who could be redeployed to the vetting unit.  The outcome of these discussions was an increase of over 90% in the resources available to the vetting unit.</p><p>It is my understanding that the discussions with the local authority were not completed by the time the latest staff became available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, therefore, it is not the case that an agreement was in place which was cancelled.  As the local authority staff were potentially transferring with different terms and conditions from those that apply in the Civil Service, these discussions were inherently more complex and protracted than those involving the direct transfer of Civil Service staff.</p><p> The Garda central vetting unit has sufficient resources available to it to provide an efficient and effective vetting service.  In the event that additional or replacement resources are required in the future, the potential for the transfer of staff from the local authority can be further explored.  Such a transfer would be dependent on the availability of the necessary sanctions and finance.</p><p> An e-vetting system is currently being developed and it is expected that this will come on stream in 2014 following the initial phase of testing, which will take place later this year.  When this is achieved, the system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.  The vetting unit provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland.  They are registered with the unit for this purpose, which employs personnel to work in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or student capacity with children or vulnerable adults.  Garda vetting is conducted only on behalf of registered organisations and is not conducted for individuals on a personal basis.  When an organisation is registered with the unit, it is entitled to receive Garda vetting services in respect of its employees.  In addition, there has been a steady increase in the number of applications for vetting.  The unit processed 328,000 applications in 2012 and it is expected that this will increase to 350,000 in 2013.</p></speech>

I believe it is totally unsatisfactory and it is in error, because an offer was made in writing.  This debacle arose following the Government's policy initiative to reform and rationalise local authorities.  Urban district councils were deliberately abolished and, in the case of Tipperary, the north and south county councils were amalgamated for administrative purposes.  The local body set up to oversee and implement the Government policy initiative had consultations with staff in the affected councils and it was agreed that eight staff would be transferred to the Garda vetting unit.  This was approved by the county manager and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and it was also understood that the proposal had the approval of the Department of Justice and Equality, as the need for more staff existed at the time in the unit.</p><p>  The subsequent change of mind by the Department of Justice and Equality showed stunning disrespect for the loyal and dedicated staff of the local authorities who were engaged in this process.  The Government and, in particular, the Department have shown appalling indifference to the plight of these staff, who have been badly let down and are feeling aggrieved.  The eight officials have been misled and they received dreadful treatment due to the bungling that took place between the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Justice and Equality.  The matter needs to be addressed at ministerial level and the situation needs to be rectified to the satisfaction of the affected staff.</p><p>  This sorry saga has left a sour taste in the mouths of all local authority staff in Tipperary.  What they consider as a reneging on previous written commitments has led to a distrust of the entire process and frustration and anger towards the system and, in particular, the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I will ensure the Minister for Justice and Equality is made aware of what he said.  Any additional resources that are made available to the vetting unit must be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Minister for Justice and Equality must have sufficient resources to pay the additional staff.  It is not expected at this time that additional resources will be required by the unit.  However, the position will be kept under constant review and monitored closely.  The objective at all times is the protection of vulnerable people and the delivery of an effective and efficient vetting service.  I appreciate what the Deputy said and I will make sure the Minister is made aware of his contribution immediately.</p></speech>

We signed over control to the European Commission, an unelected body whose president said in 2010: "The member states have accepted - and I hope they understand it exactly - but they have accepted very important powers of the European institutions regarding surveillance, and a much stricter control of the public finances."  That is a frightening message.</p><p>  Fishing is one of our oldest indigenous industries, providing vital employment for many small coastal communities such as Kilmore Quay in County Wexford.  The real issue for the fishing industry, which accepts there has been overfishing and is working towards a healthy recovery of stocks, is just how quotas are divvied up.  According to the fishing sustainability impact assessment in 2013, the 2012 total allowable catches, TACs, in waters around Ireland came to 1 million tonnes, of which Ireland got 18% of the value.  In 2009 the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, stated Ireland had benefited to the tune of &euro;56 billion in EU funds since membership in 1973.  The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea calculates, however, that between 1975 and 2010, the commercial value of Irish fisheries was &euro;201 billion with Ireland taking in a mere 11.8% of that.</p><p>  It is true when Ireland joined the EEC our fishing industry was not very advanced and, in the short term, we did not have the same reasons as Iceland and Norway had for staying out.  Now, however, Iceland lands four times more fish than Ireland, Norway eight times, despite us having more fishing waters.  Since we joined and accepted the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, we have been stalled from expanding what could be potentially one of our largest indigenous industries in our territorial waters.  While it is clear the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, is trying to secure a larger stake for Irish fishermen in the quota system, it is interesting to note that figures show Ireland subsidising the EU with &euro;140 billion over the past 35 years.  We do not have a fair deal on fishing quotas.  It must be the Government&rsquo;s priority to change that.  I know it will not be easy but it is imperative that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, succeeds in levelling the playing field for Irish fishermen in the next round of CFP negotiations.  We bailed out the European banks for them by bailing out our own.  It is about time Europe did a bit for us.</p></speech>

Let there be no mistake about it; the day these people came to town was a sad day for Ireland, a sad day for democracy and, above all, a sad day for the Irish people.  We must all recognise this because people have suffered so much from all the false promises made in the past.</p><p>  Today I am relieved and I welcome the exit.  It is completely wrong to say that many in the Opposition wanted it to fail for political reasons.  I heard a number of Ministers say that in recent days.  That is not correct, as everybody on all sides wants our country to succeed, to develop and to take its place among the nations internationally.   I reject any type of petty politics in respect of this exit.  However, it is equally unfair to let this happen without a closer examination of the terms and conditions and of why we did not go for a backup or insurance policy.  Perhaps the Government is correct; I have an open mind on the matter.  Having listened to the debate in recent days, I suspect that the Government will have to go for it in the end.  Our people need to know the facts.  They need to know the conditions and the background, and all Members of the Oireachtas needed to know the full facts and make an informed decision based on accurate information.  That is a reasonable demand and I sincerely hope it does not all go wrong after around 12 months because of some disaster in the markets or the issue of bank debt.  Too many mistakes have been made in the past, and rushed decisions and late-night votes should not happen again.  Due to these bad decisions and the actions of some greedy bankers and greedy developers, we have ended up with the austerity of the last few years.</p><p>  To make matters worse, many people are still advocating austerity.  The preachers and cheerleaders of austerity in the Irish political establishment seem to want more.  What planet are they living on?  Austerity does not work.  That is an economic fact.  It reduces growth, it increases unemployment and increases inequality.  It hammers all the people on the ground, leading to bad health in their personal lives.  Before I talk about the economic aspects of the EU-IMF exit, I think we should look at the serious health implications of the austerity policies over the last number of years.  They were severely damaging, and people are hurting.  We can see this if we look more closely at the issue of disability.  For example, the allocation for St. Michael's House has been reduced by more than &euro;12.3 million over the last number of years.  The service currently has 462 people on its residential waiting list.  St. Michael's House is doing a great job supporting the families that depend on the service.  The organisation is really struggling with reduced financial and staffing resources and with the implementation of Government and HSE policies.  That is an example of the direct consequences of what has been going on.</p><p>  I commend the Ballyhea protest group on its actions on the debt issue, along with my colleagues in the Technical Group, and we will be bringing it up again next week in the D&aacute;il.  We will be calling on the Government to lobby the ECB immediately for a one-off exemption in monetary financing to allow the Central Bank of Ireland destroy the &euro;25 billion in sovereign bonds issued in February 2013 in lieu of the remaining promissory notes, plus the &euro;3.06 billion bond being held by the Central Bank of Ireland, and to further lobby the ECB for the cancellation, in their entirety, of all interest payments currently being made on these bonds, promissory notes and related debt.  We are going to strengthen the Government's hand to do something about this debt issue.  Many people are suffering because of it, and again I would like to commend the people of Ballyhea and the Charleville Says No group, who met the Technical Group recently and made a very strong case on the debt issue.  Deep down, I know the Government and the Minister for Finance accept the reality that we need to do something about the long-term issue of the debt.  We need to deal with this issue head-on, or else we will have a major job developing growth in the economy and trying to get people back working and paying taxes so that we can pay for services in St. Michael's House and in Prosper Fingal in Swords.</p><p>  I welcome this debate.  I welcome the fact that we are exiting the programme, but the war is not over.  This is only round one.</p></speech>

If the loss of our sovereignty in 2010 was such a significant event, it is important that the D&aacute;il has its say on the matter, and I welcome the fact that the Government Chief Whip acceded to my request for a debate on it.</p><p>  It is important to put the debate in some sort of context.  When the troika came to town in 2010, our banks were bust, the number of unemployed people had trebled to 450,000 from 150,000 in 2008, our tax receipts had collapsed from approximately &euro;50 billion to &euro;30 billion, and our international reputation was in tatters.  All of those issues combined led to a loss of market confidence in the Irish economy, and in order to maintain some degree of normality, we sought outside assistance through the troika's programme.  Three years later, in a tribute to the resilience and forbearance of the Irish public, whose sacrifices have ensured the progress that has been made, our international reputation has been re-established, and I commend Deputy Costello and the T&aacute;naiste in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the leading role they have played in that respect.  All of our Cabinet representatives have equally been responsible for that restoration of our reputation, which has enabled us to renegotiate with credibility some of the worst excesses of the bailout agreement as originally foisted on us by the outgoing Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.</p><p>  The exit from the bailout is a red-letter day, but in early 2013 we had a renegotiation of the promissory note.  That represented significant progress on the liability that the Irish citizen carries as a result of this collapse.  Market confidence has been restored.  How else would we have accumulated a domestic backstop of around &euro;20 billion to give us some comfort as we put our toe back in the money markets and try to fund ourselves?  Of significance in the context of the sacrifices that the public have made, we have reduced the gap between what we spend on a daily basis and what we raise in taxes, and we are committed to reaching the 3% deficit target by 2015.  That is the backdrop to all of this.</p><p>  I am reminded of the line that the moment of absolute certainty never arrives.  To be honest, I was a bit taken aback by Deputy Martin's response last week when the Taoiseach announced the Cabinet's decision.  It seemed to me as though he were suffering from Stockholm syndrome, surrounded by former Cabinet colleagues Deputies Smith, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and O'Dea, as he was less than gracious about the efforts and the endeavour by ordinary citizens to get us to a stage at which we can exit the bailout.  I listened this morning to Deputy Michael McGrath's contribution - it is noticeable that not a single Member of the Opposition is in the Chamber for the debate at the moment - and while I agreed with many of his observations in respect of the context within which this exit from the bailout is taking place, there was an element of political cute-hoorism and having an each-way bet regarding the Government's decision.</p><p>When faced with such a decision one must make it as wisely as possible.  The moment of absolute certainty never arrives.  Deputy Martin's approach to this is regrettable.</p><p> In the context of this debate and as we contemplate the sustainability of our economic model, it is an appropriate time to raise the EU Summit of 29 June 2012 and ask where we are in breaking the vicious link between sovereign and bank debt.  The Minister, his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister for Finance Deputy Noonan and the Taoiseach are as anxious as everybody else to build on that.  However, to call a spade a spade, we have run into a cul-de-sac in our efforts to build on that.  It is worth recalling that the summit statement stated:<blockquote>We affirm that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns...The Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.</blockquote> We are some 18 months on from that and, unfortunately, we have seen practically no tangible progress on that matter.  Is it any wonder that politics stretches credulity on occasions with the public when we see that lack of progress on an issue of such enormous significance?  We have pumped &euro;64 billion into our domestic banks in an effort, originally, to stop the contagion.  &quot;Contagion&quot; was the buzzword in 2009 and 2010 when they were fears across Europe.  We were asked to take a hit for the team and we did so.  It is a reasonable conclusion that we are having difficulty getting retrospective recapitalisation, although I do not want to make that conclusion.  There is another way to skin the cat in respect of getting back that money for the Irish Exchequer.  Our level of indebtedness is unsustainable and we need a game changer on this matter.</p><p> AIB and PTSB are State-owned and we have a 15% stake in Bank of Ireland.  The Irish banks have a &euro;70 billion tracker mortgage book on which all those banks are losing their shirts.  That is somewhat akin to the &euro;64 billion we put into our banks to comply with the terms of our bailout.  It is good news for 400,000 tracker mortgage holders that last week the ECB sought to reduce its lending rate by 0.25%.  That has been passed on to those 400,000 tracker mortgage holders, but at whose cost?  There are reports that the 300,000 variable mortgage holders will see a commensurate increase in their repayments.  That is grossly unfair.</p><p> As a way of dealing with the capital we put into our banks, is it possible to take the tracker loan book out of the three banks I mentioned by virtue of the ESM, ECB or however?  PTSB has a survival strategy with the Commission.  Because of the significant drain those tracker mortgages are on our banks, could we financially engineer a solution to the tracker mortgages that takes pressure off our banks and allows them to get on to the normal business of banking?  It could allow the State to extricate itself from the banking business by selling its stake in banks that would be then viable and get something back for the money we have put into these banks in recent years, particularly the three I mentioned.  It is grossly unsatisfactory that this issue has not been resolved yet.  However, I commend the Minister and Government on their efforts in getting us to this situation where we are exiting.  We have a backstop and market confidence, and we can go back to the market early next year to further build on that backstop.  On balance, it is the right decision.</p></speech>

Nobody on the Government benches is suggesting that the job is approaching completion or that there is any sense of celebration.  There is still a fairly stern determination to continue what has been a very difficult couple of years to arrive at a point where we can look back at this period and see Ireland return to a very stable and strong economic position.</p><p>  It is important to put in context exactly where we were a number of years ago, with our tax revenues fallen by 40% from one of the narrowest tax bases in Europe, a banking system that had failed, our economy in serious decline with significant negative growth and our reputation, which is not necessarily important in itself but is vital for attracting foreign direct investment, in tatters.  Even in a time of economic crisis we were losing competitiveness, one of the core bases on which we had built up our economy.  We were borrowing almost &euro;3 billion per month, which has been now reduced to less than &euro;1 billion.  House prices were plummeting, but today we see they have stabilised and are starting to rise.  For most people the most important indicator, unemployment, had trebled over those periods, but has now, finally, started to fall to what could be considered a reasonable rate, with more than 3,000 jobs per month being created.  This is unquestionably the best time to exit the bailout.</p><p>  When we talk about the precautionary credit line, I have been struck by the absence of any discussion about what the conditionality would be, who would determine the conditionality, how much would be involved in the backstop and for how long it would be.  It is my, perhaps somewhat ill-informed, opinion that because there was such a vacuum in the conditionality, to wait and try to arrive at an agreed precautionary credit line would have given rise to far more uncertainty than that in which we now find ourselves.  That is because the quantum of money was relatively small.  One year's borrowing requirement is an approximate figure, which is approximately &euro;10 billion.  Given that we already have approximately &euro;23 billion in our own National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, a long, protracted process of negotiating to establish the precautionary credit line would have proven extremely difficult and perhaps negative in itself for our economy.</p><p>  Equally, given the reality that every economic unit or nation must ultimately, over time match expenditure with income, balance its books and function as an independent entity, it was a question of our taking the plunge and moving out on our own.  I can understand why Fianna F&aacute;il in particular would have insisted on trying to have stabilisers.  The analogy of the bicycle is being used a lot.  Last time members of Fianna F&aacute;il were in control of the bike, not only did the bike not have stabilisers, it did not have brakes or lights, they were cycling without a helmet and, some would say perhaps inebriated, and they cycled the bike off a cliff.  Of course they are extremely nervous now and are clearly neither prepared to take nor capable of taking control of a bike, an economy or a country.</p><p>That is in stark contrast to Fine Gael and the Labour Party in coalition which have confidence in the ability of the country to continue the great work the people have done to restore our economic future and democracy.  All of us on this side of the House look forward to the challenges ahead, but it will be the people who will do the work, for themselves, in the next few years.</p></speech>

I am not saying this in an unnecessary adversarial way.  However, there is something disproportionate in the way we do business in this House.  Yesterday evening we spent two hours discussing the issue of the docking of dogs' tails.  This is an important issue of contention with which the Oireachtas committee on agriculture must deal and I have no doubt it will take up more of our time, as many such issues do.  However, when we compare that issue to the one we are debating through formal statements, we see huge disproportionality in how this matter is being investigated and decided on.</p></speech>

However, it seems wrong that what happened was that a decision was made by the Government and after that decision was made, with a big fanfare the Taoiseach came into the House to make a five minute speech in which he stated the Government had made a decision not to put a backstop in place.  He gave no explanation of the rationale behind that decision or what a backstop would have involved in terms of conditions.  If the D&aacute;il was working properly, if it was working like the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the stewardship of Deputy Andrew Doyle, a marvellous Chairman, where issues of contention are thrashed out and all of the details and choices are put on the table in an open way, we could have arrived at a consensus in this case.  In other words, the D&aacute;il has been presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>.  It is obvious the choices for the Government were not that black and white.  If they were, why did it not make a decision on the issue at the regular Cabinet meeting that took place last Tuesday week?  If they were that simple, why was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine called out from the D&aacute;il at Question Time - something I had never seen happen before - to rush over to Government Buildings to take part in the Government's decision, particularly if it was to rubber stamp a decision that was so self-evident that it did not need debate?  I cannot understand why the Minister had to leave in the middle of Question Time.  I have no doubt that the truth will emerge in time and that it is that this was a decision, like most decisions in life, with many pros and cons.  I believe that after careful consideration, including of information received up to the last minute, the Government decided on balance that the price of the backstop would have been too great and that it was better to go it alone.</p><p>  Let us look at the issue with some common sense.  Let us suppose we could have obtained a backstop with no new conditions attached and that it would have been underwritten, it is evident we would have been fools not to take that precautionary line of credit.  I would accept the Government's response if I knew what the conditions were, but the Taoiseach did not tell us what they were.  If the backstop would have involved an enormous price, in terms of money or conditions or somebody trying to tamper with our independent decision making on the issue of corporation tax, the price might have been too high to pay and it would have been right to say &quot;No&quot;.</p><p>  The day he became Taoiseach Deputy Enda Kenny spoke about a democratic revolution.  He spoke about doing things a new way and involving the Legislature in the passing of legislation.  Unfortunately, we are not involved enough in that process, apart from a few areas.  Again, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is an exception in that regard.  I have my arguments with him, but when it comes to dealing with legislation, he does so in a model way, involving the Opposition and accepting valid arguments made.  I cannot understand how, when this decision was being made, the Government did not seek to put all of the options and details before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and how it did not seek to involve it in the decision making, while keeping to itself the ultimate right to make the decision.  I cannot understand how it did not seek the committee's view on what should be done.  I do not understand how it is so hard to involve wider groups in what is going on, although there is always a reluctance on the part of the permanent government to do so.  I know from experience that at times the permanent government is not over keen on telling Ministers the full extent of what is going on.</p></speech>

The Minister of State was technically correct.  There had not been a request, but the issue was being pushed from or leaked from elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>  One of the issues that arises from the way this has been done is that it gives rise to a concern that there are European elements to this issue.  It is a concern that there are elements in back rooms elsewhere in Europe who influenced the Government's decision not to seek a backstop.  Therefore, this debate is taking place in a vacuum.  It is taking place six weeks too early, before, under the Freedom of Information Act, we could obtain all of the details of all the discussions that took place leading up to the making of this important decision.</p><p>  The decision taken involves a risk.  The Government tells us that the markets are sound.  I do not doubt that they are and long may it remain the case.  It states it has the national finances under control.  I accept that because it has followed the main parameters of the four year plan to the letter of the law.  It has delivered on it with incredible enthusiasm, considering its original objections to it.  I accept that the decision made by this and the previous Government to honour their debts has an upside in terms of our ability to borrow money.</p><p>We all know that issues external to this country exist and much bigger countries than Ireland could throw the markets into turmoil.  Can anybody tell me that if a problem were to arise in one of the other European countries and its bond yields were suddenly to rise dramatically, we would be totally immune to this effect?  The Government might continue on the road to resolving the most fundamental issue in our economy, which is that one cannot forever spend more than one takes in taxes, and therefore we might create market confidence in our little nation, but it seems strange to believe that as a small, open, peripheral economy we are absolutely immune to sudden shocks that might happen outside the economy and might have an effect on our ability to borrow money.</p><p> In the coming two to three years we must roll over, borrow, or combine both to obtain a total of &euro;53 billion.  What many people do not realise is that one does not obtain government debt like a mortgage over 30 years or more.  Most government debt is of fairly short duration and is never actually paid back.  One has a loan at 4%, 3%, 5% or whatever rate it was obtained at, and when the five-, three- or ten-year duration is up one goes back to the markets to ask for the same money again at the going rate.  As long as the rates remain low one can keep replacing the money forever without problem.  If the rates rise the problem one faces is that one must replace cheaper money with more expensive money.  The idea of the backstop is similar to negotiating a loan with a bank, for example, at a rate of 5%.  If one could borrow the money at 4% or 3.5% one would do so, but if the rate had increased to 6% when the time came, one would use the facility to avail of a rate of 5%.  It is not rocket science.  We have given our guaranteed fixed-rate option away and we do not know why.  We have not been told why and we have not been involved in the decision-making.  I accept that all parties have a long history of not involving the Oireachtas in a comprehensive way, particularly in big decisions, and it is hard to change something that has a long history.  I often think there is much greater willingness to involve us in small decisions than in big ones.  This is a pity.  The more information is shared, the more people know why a decision was made and the more likely it is there will be a consensus on the decision.</p><p> I hope it is unfounded, but there might be a belief among people that the real reason for this decision was so that the Government could state we were free of the troika.  If this was the only motivating factor, I must state it would be rather disappointing.  Talk about regaining our economic sovereignty is a bit hollow because since the troika came to Ireland, for better or for worse, we have signed up to the fiscal compact treaty and all of the oversight it entails on a permanent basis.  No more than a householder does not have the sovereignty to do what he or she wants in the modern world, because everything is so interdependent, we do not have that sovereignty because we need to go to markets.  The real room for manoeuvre in any circumstances is quite limited; we cannot just decide to spend what we want, because if we spend more than we take in taxes somebody out there will have sovereignty over us, just as any lender has sovereignty over a borrower in terms of the conditions at which it will lend money.  To go back to the analogy of the householder, if a householder has no debt and a pile of money in the bank and he or she wants to do up the house, he or she can do so as long as planning permission is obtained.  However, if the householder must borrow from the bank, it will exercise its sovereignty over him or her.  It will want to know the person's income, repayment capacity and age, and will want him or her to set up a life assurance policy, along with other conditions.</p><p> This is another example of D&aacute;il reform and meaningful change which has never happened.  On the day the Taoiseach was elected I looked forward to the change.  I do not care who changes it if it is changed for the better, but unfortunately this is not what is happening.</p></speech>

It does not solve all our problems.  It leaves us, like people after a prolonged period of struggle, building and constructing a better future for our people and communities so that the sacrifices that people have made, undertaken and had imposed on them result in a better Ireland for people, families and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  When the Government took office our immediate priority was to stabilise the economy and tackle the devastation inflicted on every community by unemployment.  One of Fianna F&aacute;il's biggest failures in the bailout period, which is no surprise given the utter chaos into which the Administration had lurched, was failing to spell out a convincing vision for building employment.  It was still pretending it could hold back the flood when it should have been building the rafts people would need to stay afloat.  It completely missed the point that a viable economy must start with work, and for this to be true there must be sustainable strategies to boost employment and tackle unemployment.</p><p>  When the Government took office we were effectively starting from scratch.  We took an entirely new approach in the area of social protection and welfare by focusing on activation - that is, getting people back into work, education, training or work experience and ensuring jobseekers received not only income supports but employment supports when they went to a social welfare office.  The first visit to the social welfare office is to be the first day on a journey back to work.  The activation approach underpins our new Intreo offices, which are one-stop shops rolled out throughout the country where jobseekers can get income and employment supports in one place for the first time, aided and assisted by modern technology.  Much like the efforts to rebuild the economy, this has been painstaking work that has required time to implement, but the results are being clearly seen in the reduction in the live register.</p><p> I remind Deputies that for every 10,000 people who come off the live register and return to employment, the corresponding reduction in the overall bill relating to social welfare spending is approximately &euro;95 million.  The Pathways to Work approach serves a dual and crucial purpose, namely, getting people back to work and assisting them in building a better future for themselves and their families and reducing the social welfare bill in a way that has a positive impact in the context of reducing the country's deficit. That is why it is so important to have really strong programmes in respect of young people.  It is for this reason that, in the context of the recent budget, I have focused on ensuring that some of the money which was previously spent on young people who were simply parked on the live register will instead be spent on the really intense activation programmes we are developing in the context of the youth guarantee.</p><p> The challenge now is to ensure we continue this progress and see to it that the new economy we develop in the aftermath of the bailout will be people-centred, with full employment and a fair wage as central goals.  We must not resort to the banker-led, trickle-down con job which served as economic strategy under the previous Administration and led Ireland to the brink of collapse.  There are two dimensions to this, namely, the policies the Government pursues domestically and those implemented at international level.  At domestic level, we are now saying goodbye to the bailout programme, regaining control over our financial affairs and returning to our position as a normal eurozone member state with normal market funding arrangements.  Money markets will still dictate very definite limits to our capacity to borrow at manageable interest rates, while the new so-called two-pack and six-pack rules within the EU - as approved by the people in last year's referendum - will impose quite strict limits on future budgets.  However, the Government will be charting the course.</p><p> There are those - some on the left and others on the right - who, when we first entered office, favoured our reneging on all of the international commitments into which the country had entered.  Of course, many of those commitments were entered into by the previous Government.  Those to whom I refer wanted us to default on our debts.  The people in question are under an obligation to spell out what a default actually means.  They should also indicate what would actually have happened if we had defaulted.  Having listened to the contributions of a number of Deputies in my office, I am obliged to state that certain individuals do not seem to realise that people are understandably upset about and critical of austerity.  Had we defaulted, however, we would have triggered a level of austerity which would be infinitely worse than anything the country has experienced.  Many economic commentators have analysed this matter in detail.  The argument to the effect &quot;Ah go on, we could default&quot;, which is put forward by certain people is disingenuous.  If we had defaulted, we would have been immediately obliged to reduce the budget deficit to zero.  Can Deputies imagine what this would have done to critical areas such as social welfare, health and education?  The approach we chose has led to our engaging in a painstaking process over three budgets in order to reform the position and to start bringing the budget into balance.  There is a need for honesty from those individuals who claim that it would be okay to default.</p><p> As we say goodbye to the troika-----</p></speech>

Achieving full employment will be how we will leave austerity in the distant past, increase tax revenue, build a viable social insurance system, reduce welfare expenditure and create room for new investment in essential services.  As we recover, we will also create the space for additional investment in public services such as, for example, those relating to education.  This will bring clear benefits to Ireland, as an economy, and to Irish society in the long term.  Full employment will assist us in creating a more productive economy and a more caring society.</p><p>  Just as full employment is the right target for Ireland and will be central to the country's economic planning in the future, it must be also the goal for the EU.  A fundamental shift in thinking on the wider EU level would help enormously in that respect.  As I have stated on previous occasions, the EU needs to shift from austerity towards a policy based on investment, growth and job creation, with full employment the central target.  It is noteworthy to examine the respective approaches of the incoming chair of the US Federal Reserve, Ms Janet Yellen &ndash; the first woman set to lead America's central bank &ndash; and the new governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Mark Carney.  Both acknowledge the need for unemployment to fall further before interest rates are increased.  It is a matter of deep regret that the primary mandate of the ECB, when it was formed, was to maintain price stability and that full employment comes a lot further down its list of priorities.  In contrast, the Federal Reserve has a clear dual mandate to pursue both price stability and full employment and has shown itself to be the more effective for it.  The Federal Reserve has overseen a massive programme of quantitative easing &ndash; essentially pumping money into the US economy to act as a stimulus &ndash; which has been crucial to America riding out the global crisis.  I remain of the view that in the long term the ECB should, like the Federal Reserve, pursue a dual strategy of price stability and growth.</p><p>  It is no surprise that the OECD has suggested that the ECB could do more in this regard.  In its most recent economic outlook, OECD says the ECB should &quot;consider further policy measures if deflationary risks become more serious ... price adjustment alone will not work given the impossibility of reconciling deflation, needed to regain competitiveness, and achieving nominal growth to achieve debt sustainability&quot;.  What the OECD is stating is that as the economy expands, the significance of the totality of debt diminishes and that it, therefore, becomes more feasible to deal with it.  In other words, the interest rate cut by the ECB, though welcome, is not enough.  The ECB should also consider unconventional measures including the type of quantitative easing used successfully in both the US and the UK, which have shown stronger growth than Europe.  The euro area as a whole has a debt ratio similar to areas such as the UK and the US, where central banks are actively willing to purchase sovereign debt.  A eurobond-financed stimulus programme would, for example, be economically feasible and effective but would require a shift in thinking on the issues to which I refer.  No more than Ireland, the EU needs a new approach, based on investment, growth and job creation, with full employment the overarching goal.  A decisive shift of this sort at EU level would rapidly speed up the progress already being made in Ireland in terms of getting people back to work.</p><p>  I take great heart at the very basic rethink of economic philosophy that President Obama is leading in the US.  This back-to-basics re-evaluation in which he is engaged recognises the failure of the trickle-down approach that has been dominant since the 1970s.  The latter was the notion very often promoted by the super-rich that if we protected them, their wealth would trickle down and this would help everyone else prosper.  The entire western world bought that line.  The results were great for the super-rich but very often disastrous for almost everyone else.  Inequality thrived as a result of the philosophy in question.  In 2008 the economy collapsed largely as a result of the reckless activities that stemmed from that philosophy.  Now, out of that ruin, President Obama is forcefully reminding the world of an older truth, namely, that lasting growth and shared prosperity come from the middle out and not from the top down.  Now that battle of ideas in economics is under way, it is obvious that we in Europe will be taking part in the debate.  This all boils down to a single question: what is the best strategy for long-term prosperity for the majority of our people - an ever-increasing concentration of wealth at the top or a thriving middle class?</p><p> As a Government, we will continue to push for a further shift in the position on Ireland's bank debt.  When I was finance spokesperson for the Labour Party in opposition I warned of the perils of the bank guarantee and the massive burden it would potentially inflict on every citizen.  It was one occasion when I would have been glad to be proved wrong.  Sadly, however, the bank guarantee proved as catastrophic as the Labour Party had feared.</p><p> The most important promise my party made during the general election campaign was that we would focus on unravelling and reducing the level of toxic debt.  We could not and did not promise to simply default on the debt as to do so would have been the road to disaster for the country.  Instead, we undertook to unravel and reduce it, an undertaking on which we have made significant progress.  Agreement has been secured on reducing the interest rate and extending the maturity on EU loans and a deal has been done on the promissory note.  All these measures reduce by tens of billions of euro the debt burden and the State's funding requirement in the next decade.</p><p> The Government will continue to negotiate for further agreements on our debt, specifically on the potential use of the European Stability Mechanism for bank recapitalisation.  As Citigroup chief economist, Willem Buiter, noted recently, Ireland has an exceptional claim for the ESM to be used for this purpose given the massive levels of debt that were placed on the shoulders of Irish taxpayers to prevent wider banking contagion in the eurozone.  The Government will continue to make Ireland's case on this critical issue.</p><p> I referred to the abyss into which the country was plunged in 2010.  Through the sacrifices made by members of the public and the patience they have shown, Ireland is climbing out of this abyss.  The key issue, as I noted, is the dividend for ordinary people in terms of better services and social welfare provision.  Above all, more of our people will return to work and will, with our businesses, generate economic prosperity.  I hope this will make that which people have endured in recent years a memory from which we will learn.  We must also avoid any repetition of it in the future as we build a better Ireland. </p></speech>

We need to be clear as to the reasons it was significant.  The media hailed it as a gamble and a bold move.  While some considered it reckless, others viewed it as an achievement and an end to our humiliation.  All sorts of hyperbole and comments appeared in the media and some excitable Deputies contributed to this climate of excitement in their own way.  In all the descriptions of the decision I read, the word "opportunity", which I felt fitted best, was rarely used.  There is an opportunity for a change of direction and to take a new approach that will ease the burden on hard-pressed, ordinary citizens.  Our exit from the programme will mean nothing if it does not get people back on their feet, ease the hardship many are suffering and give back people a sense of dignity.</p><p>  Many on the Government benches will slap themselves on the back in delight and hail our exit from the bailout as mission accomplished.  That is far from the case.  The past few years have been very difficult and challenging for people.  None of us will forget the events of late 2010 and early 2011 when every day seemed to bring a fresh disaster or fiasco and no level of incompetence seemed too great.  At official level, denial seemed to be the order of the day and even Ministers seemed to have been kept in the dark.  The sense of anger and humiliation felt by citizens, particularly younger people, on hearing that the European Union and International Monetary Fund were coming to town will never leave them.  No one will forget what the country endured under the Fianna Fail-Green Party Government.</p><p>  The Government likes to point to those days and blame all our current woes, difficulties and budgetary challenges on Fianna F&aacute;il.  While there is no doubt the previous Government was responsible, that does not excuse what has taken place under this Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il is a convenient scapegoat given that all the pain people have suffered in recent years under the bailout took place on this Government's watch and this pain will be forever associated with it.</p><p>  Domestically and internationally, an attempt has been made to make the case that the programme has been extremely successful.  According to many commentators, Ireland is top of the class and a poster boy for austerity.  It is a shame they do not look more closely at what occurred in this State in the past three years.  What was the purpose of the targets set by the IMF and ECB?   It was to ensure Ireland did enough to service its debts.  The ECB and IMF were not interested in anything other than achieving that objective and certainly not interested in how it was achieved.  While the basic targets may have been met, little attention has been paid to other targets and objectives, which have not been reached.  Unemployment, at 13.2%, remains very high and far above the European average.  Nearly 400,000 people are still unemployed and the true figure is probably masked by persons in training and so forth.  The unemployment rate is particularly high among young people, an issue that will be discussed in detail when Sinn F&eacute;in's Private Members' motion is debated tonight.</p><p>  The Government has effectively sacrificed a generation of young people.  According to the Central Statistics Office, the youth unemployment rate stands at 29.6%.  When one adds to the official figure the percentage of young people who are on various schemes, one arrives at a much higher figure.  The number of young people employed in the economy has declined by 18,000 since the Government came to power.  Ireland continues to have the second worst long-term unemployment figures in the European Union.  Again, young people are worst affected, with figures showing that 61.7% of unemployed young people have been without work for one year or more compared to an EU average of 44.6%.  Despite these figures, the IMF did not set any targets for addressing unemployment because it was not interested in the issue. </p><p>  On emigration, people are flowing out of the country at a rate without equal since the Famine.  While some recent emigrants wanted to travel, many more did not and those on the benches opposite who believe otherwise are fooling themselves.  That no targets were set to address emigration is indicative of the interest the IMF showed in addressing the issue.</p><p>  Targets were not set in respect of maintaining decent public services either.  The public health system is facing cutbacks on a scale it will struggle to absorb.  It has reached the point at which the chief executives of some of the main hospitals have written to the Minister to express fear about the consequences of budget cuts for cancer services in their hospitals.  Medical cards are also being withdrawn.</p><p>  The assault local government has absorbed has been such that bewildered county and city councillors scarcely know how to respond to it or to continue to provide services.  Roads are deteriorating and housing lists lengthening.  The programme did not set a target to keep poverty below a certain threshold.  Every year since the recession began, the number of people at risk of poverty or in consistent poverty has risen.  None of these issues featured in the targets because the IMF and ECB were simply not interested and did not mind how we found the money, provided it was found. </p><p>  Two points need to be made.  The first, to which I will return presently, is that a substantial portion of the debts we are expected to pay do not belong to us in the first place.  The second is that the Government, as opposed to the IMF, ECB, EU or Fianna F&aacute;il, had responsibility for deciding how to close the deficit and cannot, therefore, obscure the harm it has done simply by referring to targets. </p><p>Nobody believes its task was easy, but closing the deficit could have been done in a much fairer way that would have led to more sustainable economic growth and less unemployment and suffering.  The Government should have sought to invest in jobs rather than cut away at public pay and at social welfare payments, which makes no sense economically, as that is money that is spent in the real economy in local shops.  This is the part of the economy that is still sluggish.  The high street is still lagging behind, and it is because ordinary people do not have the money to spend on anything other than the absolute basics and essentials.</p><p> Investment in a stimulus of the kind that Sinn F&eacute;in has advocated and detailed over numerous pre-budget submissions would have stemmed the flow of emigration and created employment.  However, the Government was not interested because, while it was happy tackling the weak on their social protection and pay, it was not satisfied to go after the powerful and vested interests, taxing wealth and raising finance from those most able to pay.  We may be exiting the programme - that is welcome, and it is positive that the Government is not going for a second programme - but the social cost of the way the Government has chosen to deal with the programme has been enormous.</p><p> The Government has still made no progress on our legacy debts.  Its strategy of meek acceptance, and not raising the issue, has clearly not worked.  We still have an unmanageable debt burden, which will hamper economic growth for a generation.</p><p> At the EU summit in June last, the Government attempted to claim that it was a game-changer and that the European Stability Mechanism would reduce banking debt and separate banking debt from sovereign debt.  This has not happened, and the international markets will charge us yields on our borrowing based on the significant bank debt.  What is more, we will still be under EU surveillance until we have repaid 75% of our debt and will be in any case subject to the fiscal compact.</p><p> The decision not to apply for a credit line is a positive move by the Government.  However, it will count for little if the Government does not seize the opportunity.  Surely it must be time for an easing-up on austerity to begin investment to get Ireland back to work.  If the Government continues with its troika-era policies, this will be looked upon as no more than a footnote.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has always taken that position, but there has been a carnival of spin about the troika leaving these shores, as if our troubles would go with them, along with our young people.  We would love to see the back of the troika, if we felt it would make any difference.</p><p>  The reality is that the Government was so craven and cowardly in the face of the bondholders and banks that it introduced austerity measures that even the troika did not demand.  The Government taxed and cut and changed eligibility and kowtowed to its European masters, while throughout it sang the chorus of regret and told us that the troika had made them do it.  That philosophy of austerity made the most vulnerable in society suffer, and they continue to suffer in the absence of the troika.  There are still plans to take a further &euro;2 billion out of the economy next year, troika or no troika.</p><p>  People are reeling at the dent in the household budget caused by increased charges and increased energy costs, the imposition of a property tax, the withdrawal of vital services even from people who need constant care, the extra school expenses and the worsening of services in health, education and social care.  If the people woke up on Thursday morning and thought that matters would improve, they were wrong.  We are still paying for the folly of agreeing to the fiscal compact, for which the Government parties and Fianna F&aacute;il campaigned last year.  The terms of that treaty mean that we have no control over our own deficits.  We cannot make decisions for the benefit of the Irish people but are forced to keep our deficits low and keep striving to reduce our debt, which is in fact unpayable and which was inflicted upon us because of the policy of bailing out the banks.  For all its talk, for all the hugging and kissing that the Taoiseach and the German Chancellor, Dr. Angela Merkel, engaged in, the Government has achieved nothing from the EU to help relieve us of our banking debt.  I glad the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is smiling.</p></speech>

We are faced with dealing on the international markets to pay our huge banking debt, and the stimulus for the economy that we need if we are to genuinely turn the corner towards exiting the recession is nowhere to be seen.  The youth guarantee has been allocated a mere &euro;14 million, despite figures showing that over 70% of emigrants are in their 20s when they leave us.  The number of young people who are leaving us is staggering.</p><p>  There is much more work to be done if we are to regain our economic sovereignty.  Our alternatives are aimed at reducing the deficit fairly and in a way that will allow us to start rebuilding the economy.  Banking debt should never have been the priority, and the focus on it created a nightmare for so many working people in the State.  The economy must be stimulated to create real jobs based on indigenous resources, not the kind of job that can be whipped away at the whim of a multinational company which has no affinity with or loyalty to this country.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that the banking debt is a noose around our necks and that progress towards economic recovery will not come until it is restructured and reduced.  The Government has not stood up and defended us or demanded retroactive recapitalisation of banking debt.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, claimed here in the D&aacute;il today that he cannot raise the issue unless it is on the agenda.  Why are we not getting this on the agenda?  We are leaving the programme, but we are left with a terrible legacy of debt and damage caused to our people by austerity which will take generations of progressive, energetic government to undo.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan and I sat here listening to Deputy Burton talking about the bailout and about what would have happened if we had defaulted or burned the bondholders.  She forgets her own programme for Government.  She forgets what the Labour Party said to the Irish people - that it would burn the bondholders - yet she stated here that the economy would have collapsed if the Government had done so.  It was complete revisionism from the Labour leadership, but when one sits on this side of the House and has my knowledge of the Labour leadership, one knows that &quot;revisionism&quot; is a word they are well used to.</p></speech>

When the troika came here to bail out the economy, it was a gentlemen by the name of Deputy Adams who stated that it should go home with all of its money.  No matter what economic funny book Deputy Martin Ferris might be reading over there, if that had happened we could only have funded the economy by creating our own currency - or perhaps they wanted us to rejoin the pound.  The image that is in my mind when I think about that sort of economics is the instability in Germany and Italy in the period between the First and Second World Wars, when there was hyper-inflation and wheelbarrows of money were used to make simple purchases such as bread and milk.  The reality is that there was no alternative but to obtain money from bodies outside the State that could fund the economy and pay for the services, such as health and education, that we wanted to provide.</p><p>  In fact, we could not borrow in the international markets.  The only reason the troika was here was that we could not fund day-to-day expenditure.  Notwithstanding the criticism that people will make about it, the fact is that the troika did bail us out.  However, there were stringent, serious and significant conditions that were signed up to by the previous Government and that we followed through.  In all, there were 260 different items that were laid down in that deal and that have been carried out.</p><p>  Everybody acknowledges that it has been difficult, particularly for the people of this country.  Everybody has made sacrifices.  Every individual in the country has suffered as a result of the bad economic management of this country by the previous Government.</p><p>The fact is we have gone through several difficult budgets but, while we are not yet out of the woods, our economy has improved significantly.  The key measure is that we are creating 3,000 jobs per month.  There is increasing international confidence in our economy and we are attracting foreign direct investment.  Existing industries are also beginning to expand.  We will not be always relying on FDI for job creation because our indigenous industries are also expanding.  Compared to the 7,000 jobs lost every month when Fianna F&aacute;il left Government, the current job creation rate of 3,000 per month gives us some idea of the transformation we have experienced in our economic position.  At the height of the crisis, our ten year bond yield was 14% or 15% but bonds can now be purchased for 3.5%.  That is an indication of the international recognition of the stability of our economic position.  International investors are returning and I understand from speaking to people around the country that the property market has recovered to some extent and there is increased economic activity.  I also understand there is increased interest in new developments in the greater Dublin area.  That is part and parcel of our plan for the future which includes, in particular, meeting future demands in our economy, such as energy and water demands, and so on.</p><p> I agree that, notwithstanding the decrease in unemployment, young people continue to face serious challenges.  Many thousands of our young people are in foreign places.  That is clearly difficult for them and their families.  They are known as the Skype generation because they speak to their parents and loved ones over the Internet.  However, while many of those who have gone abroad had no choice in the matter, they are working and learning new skills in economies which offer them opportunities to work.  It is our job to ensure the conditions are right for them to return, that their skills and knowledge can contribute to this economy and that they are happy to come back because we can offer them proper careers.  In regard to the problem of long-term unemployment among young people, I welcome the Government's constructive and positive labour activation measures.  The Youth Guarantee aims to offer young people opportunities to increase their knowledge and experience.</p><p> I am hopeful for our economy.  There is a sense of hope in the people I meet around the country.  Business people are confident that matters are improving.  There is increased confidence in our economy generally and it is good for us that we are restoring our international reputation.  People from many different countries say that Ireland is in recovery because of the sacrifices made by the people of this country.  We are successfully exiting the bailout.  That is not the be all and end all but it will restore the fundamental issue of economic independence.  We are part of the euro rather than Sinn F&eacute;in's silver dollar club or whatever it belongs to.  We have to abide by the rules and balance our budgets.  It will be difficult and we will have to make tough decisions but we are well down that road and the people I meet who are involved in job creation are increasingly confident that we are getting there.</p><p> The days of living beyond our means under the previous Government will no longer be visited on us.  While we have paid a heavy price under the deal our predecessor reached with the troika, we are restoring our economic position.  The business pages and radio stations are reporting increased confidence and job growth.  That is a direct result of our Government's actions.  I have great confidence in the capacity of this Administration to deliver the jobs that are necessary for restoring our reputation and creating a country in which all our citizens can live and work. </p></speech>

I do not think anybody who grasped what it meant was not stricken, or even heartbroken, by the news.  Leaving aside the already shocking impact on our incomes, our savings and our pensions, or any consideration of who was to blame - some would say we are all responsible but I believe it was the few rather the many - the specific impact of the bailout on the national psyche was to cause enormous sadness and a sense of national shame that after a mere 90 years of independence we had messed up so thoroughly that nobody would lend to us.  We were forced to go begging to the international lenders of last resort.  We found out very quickly, however, that we had been bounced into a bailout on very unfavourable terms that were motivated not so much by the desire to make it easy for us to overcome our problems as to save the euro.  Nevertheless, we were happy to get the money because our situation would otherwise have been much worse.</p><p>  This Government has made considerable progress on improving the deal and we hope there will be further progress but, regardless of the nature of the deal, the three year programme is coming to an end.  From 15 December we will choose our own lenders on the global bond market.  There has been considerable comment about whether we should have secured a precautionary credit line.  Some say we should have but others agree with the Government that the climate is benign for making a clean break.  Arguments can be clearly made on both sides because either choice will present risks.</p><p>  What should be celebrated, however, is not so much the choice we made but the fact that we have a choice.  It is a long time since Ireland had borrowing choices or any choices because the troika took them from us.  That we have a choice makes this a milestone worth celebrating in itself.  It is a tribute to the fortitude of the Irish people that we have a choice.  They have suffered stoically, if not gladly or willingly, seemingly relentless cuts as the Government tried to get us to the point where we could live within our greatly reduced means.</p><p>  The Government has made the right choice.  It is true that the promise of a backstop would have ensured investor confidence.  Why would they not lend if they could do so without risk?  However, at some point Ireland is going to have to take off the stabilisers and cycle on our own.  Until we do that we will never be able to test the market's assessment of our creditworthiness.  Worse, we might undermine what market confidence we have achieved by admitting that we do not have confidence in ourselves to go it alone.  As everybody knows, confidence is the essence of economic recovery and the job creation for which we hope.  It is as least as important to us as the bond market's assessment.  Of course there are risks ahead but they will be neither caused nor avoided by this decision.  I recognise that the recovery is still fragile and that we will remain highly indebted until growth rates rise sufficiently to put our debts on a downward trajectory.  The banks may have problems that require recapitalisation.  Only forensic stress testing will tell us what will happen in the future.  I believe we are on the road to recovery, albeit at a slow pace, but nobody can tell the future.  If we do, however, run into trouble the situation will be very different from that of 2010.</p><p>We have proved we are capable of responsible fiscal consolidation.  Since then, the really significant change is that the EU has committed itself to saving the euro at any cost.  We did not have that before.  It has demonstrated its commitment in its bond buying programme.  One can assume that, having made the commitment, the EU will collectively bear the pain of saving the euro rather than pass it on in its entirety to recipient countries.  If we were forced to go into a future bailout, we would go in with our eyes wide open bearing in mind the poor deal we got the first time.  The promise by the EU to save the euro is in itself a backstop for us and every other European country.  Why would we put our hands up and say we will pay for a credit line and risk undermining international confidence in us?</p><p> The risks I mentioned are largely domestically generated.  If Europe as a whole goes belly up, any promise of a backstop or a credit line is completely irrelevant.  That is something we cannot plan for.  Outside of the doomsday scenario, we have made the right choice.  While I am too aware of the many problems we have to deal with, nevertheless I unreservedly celebrate the fact that the country is in a position of having a choice.  It would be churlish not to recognise that and I support the motion.</p></speech>

An insane policy of promoting a banking and property bubble led to the more insane decision to bail out the same banks and property developers.  Odious debt was imposed on the Irish people and it has not gone away, nor will it on December 15, nor will the consequences of that insanity.  Next year, the State will pay &euro;8 billion in interest payments, a sum equal to the amount we will borrow in 2014 and to the education budget and 50% of health spending.  The figure will rise over the next years and there is no possibility of having any part of this debt reduced.  The policy of being the poster child for austerity, doing what we are told to do and hoping for a handout has been a disastrous failure.</p><p>  The policy of the Government and previous Governments has meant the imposition of a brutal, cold-hearted assault on the living standards of those who can least afford it.  A report issued today on the effects of poverty on children shows the stark figure that one in five children goes to bed or to school hungry because there is not enough food in the home.  The survey on income and living conditions released in February shows an increase to 16% of the population earning below &euro;11,000 a year and at risk of poverty.  This amounts to 733,000 individuals, one in seven of whom has a job.  Consistent poverty has increased from 4% in 2008 to 7% in 2011 and is no doubt higher now.  This is a doubling of people in need real.  Deprivation now affects one in four people, people who are unable to heat their homes, unable to buy a present, have a warm coat or buy meat.  The effect of austerity means over 100,000 families are waiting on lists for social housing, which does not exist.  Another 100,000 families are in mortgage arrears, with the prospect of mass evictions looming.  More than 100,000 young people have been forced to emigrate and mass unemployment is at a real figure of 23%, when we include the number of those underemployed.</p><p>  There is nothing to celebrate.  It is a political decision and the aim is to give the impression the bogeyman - the troika - is gone and that we can now return to the warm embrace of the kind gentle good samaritans of international bond markets.  Are we to celebrate the fact that we can borrow the money from a group of loan sharks to pay the interest on the money we previously borrowed from another group of loan sharks?</p><p>  The question of whether we borrow from the troika or the bond markets is Hobson's choice.  We should never have been in the situation.  The way out is to repudiate the odious part of the debt, which is a debt accruing from the bank bailout.  This happens every day of the week in banking situations.  We saw an example with Independent News &amp;amp; Media recently, where a whole chunk of money was wiped off the debt of Denis O'Brien's company.  It can be done and we should seek to do so, lifting the huge weight off the Irish people's shoulders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000040#NN00300"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State, who is not in the Chamber, on his speech.  It was one of those rare occasions where a Minister of State was not reading from a script.  He spoke very eloquently but when he started getting into his stride I wished he had his script back again.  I am very tired of Ministers and Government spokespersons continually telling us how pleased they are in Europe with our performance.  It is insulting to the House and to the people of the nation.  I am tired of them telling us how they go around the capitals of Europe, from Berlin to Paris, getting patted on the back for achieving so much in the Irish economy.  They have done very well by those standards.  The questions they should be asking is how they have done by the standards of the people on the ground.  They should not be captured by European congratulations on what is going on in the economy.</p><p>  I do not know the answer to whether the Government has done the right thing on the credit line.  I do not know because we have not been told the possible terms of the credit line.  The judgment can only be made on the basis of what, if anything, was offered.  There is now some doubt about whether anything was offered.  Maybe European leaders, to whom we bow and scrape with such fervour and who congratulate us on what we have done, said we could not have a credit line, not because we did not deserve it but because they want it to be a case of Ireland coming out of its debts and a programme having worked.  A credit line would put some doubt on that.</p><p>  The first question for the Minister of State is whether anything was on offer.  If something was on offer, let us hear the terms.  If a credit line was offered for nothing, no doubt we would have taken it.  If it was offered cheaply, we would have taken it.  When the Technical Group met the troika, we heard that a credit line would cost money and that there would be a fat fee although they would not specify the amount.  If it was a &euro;10 billion credit line, the fee would run to hundreds of millions of euro.</p><p>  One of the reasons put out for not taking it was that we have money in the bag in the NTMA.  It is not free money; it is pre-funding, which is a credit line.  The last estimate I received was that &euro;20 billion costs &euro;2.2 million per &euro;1 billion per month.  That amounts to nearly &euro;500 million a year.  They borrow it at one rate and put it on deposit at a lower rate.  It is losing money every day at a differential rate of 2.7%.  That is what it is costing us and a credit line is a luxury.  If we were so secure, we would not need the money that is costing us so much interest.  Instead, we could go to the bond markets in January and borrow it.  It is a precautionary credit line in itself.</p><p>I am doubtful of the wisdom of even considering a credit line in that position.  As I stated, I am not aware of the terms.</p><p> We should be very careful about being overly confident.  There is an element of theatre and macho politics in this.  There is a growing consensus that maybe this decision was taken for political reasons.  The decision was taken because we and the German, French and European powers in the European Central Bank and the Commission did not want this credit line being debated in the Bundestag, as it would have to be.  The inference of that would be that these guys are claiming sovereignty while simultaneously the minor matter of a credit line is being decided in every parliament in Europe.  If we do not have it, we can claim - quite wrongly - the restoration of our economic sovereignty.  As Deputy Collins quite rightly noted, we are simply moving from one group dictating terms to us to another group in the form of the bond markets, which will dictate terms that are just as strict as those dictated by the troika in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000041#OO00200"><p>The motion before us seeks the approval of the D&aacute;il to endorse the Government's decision on exiting the bailout without a precautionary credit line, but we are being asked to do this in a vacuum.  When the Technical Group last met representatives of the troika, we explored what the precautionary credit line would look like and what it would take to put it together.  We were told it would involve the development of a set of measures similar to the programme we are about to exit, and the process would have to be endorsed by various member states.  It is clear there would have been a political price to pay in addition to the actual price, which has just been pointed out.</p><p>  We have heard several Government Ministers and spokespersons over the past number of months indicate that we want to get out and stay out of the programme, which is true.  The reality is that we continue to have an unsustainable debt, with much assumed as a national debt on the insistence of the ECB, which is one third of the troika.  The decision of 29 June 2012 by eurozone leaders to allow rescue funds to lend directly to recapitalised banks was to be a game-changer, according to the T&aacute;naiste.  On that occasion he argued that it would be done to ease Ireland's path back to the financial markets, but that has not happened.  The payment of the debt - it is not our debt - has instead been pushed out for a number of years, and the negotiating tactic of the Government has backfired.  The German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, recently poured cold water over the idea of ESM relief for Ireland, and he was joined in that view by Finland and the Netherlands.  On Saturday, the Minister of State may have heard Mr. Daniel Gros of the Centre for European Studies on RTE when he pretty much gave us the same view.</p><p>  How will this ease the path back to the financial markets?  Does the T&aacute;naiste still believe that we need and will get this game-changer?  Professor Ashoka Mody of the IMF team that negotiated the initial so-called bailout recently stated that ultimately a lender wants to know whether a debtor has the income to repay a debt.  He argued that GDP growth is now a more credible way to repay Ireland's debt than a continued period of austerity, and his diagnosis was that some respite from austerity was needed.  That was presented to us via the &euro;2.5 billion in cuts in the last budget that were to be a relief from austerity.  The three-card trick was played, as the agreement for display to outside sources, particularly the troika, had been that this would be a budget with &euro;3.1 billion in cuts.  The Government asked us to take it on trust despite the fact that it had been so misrepresented.  We were supposed to get a game-changer but we did not.</p><p>  When the language of the Government requires forensic examination of all financial issues, trust will be in short supply.  We have heard terms such as &quot;core&quot; and &quot;headline&quot; rates for social welfare, and they tell us that cuts are very well buried.  The annual cost of servicing the debt now exceeds the total spend on all levels of education in this country, but that fact never features in the stock reply about how well the Government is doing, according to its press office.  The press office must have provided a laminated card with that patter to every Minister and Government Deputy so they can come out with the same statement.</p></speech>

Now we have been told, in a reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister, that this will depend on the regulatory status of the ultimate acquirer of the IBRC loan book.</p><p>  The Government is asking us to endorse the decision on the exit without an insurance policy, and I accept this as a judgment call.  My problem is that we have been told that this will restore our economic sovereignty, but it will do no such thing.  Economic sovereignty is about permanent control of finances, and how can we have that when we have such unsustainable debt?</p></speech>

Along with Deputy Ross, Deputy Murphy campaigned against the fiscal compact treaty, which allowed our country access to the European Stability Mechanism.  She is now standing to criticise us for not accessing a line of credit from a fund that she campaigned against.</p></speech>

The point stands.  We have had speaker after speaker standing up to criticise the Government for not accessing the fund, but the same people campaigned against the creation of the fund in the first place.  There is a requirement for some kind of consistency in this discussion.  The same consistency is required for the efforts that the State must face in funding public services in future.</p><p>  I listened with great interest to Deputy Ross's contribution, during which he was sporting what looked like a fine tie to commemorate our Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  He made the point that he did not want us to deal with the troika but then argued that he did not want us to deal with the financial markets.  With whom does he want us to deal?  There is a gap between spending and taxation, and Deputy Ross has opposed many of the measures taken to close that gap.  If he was indicating that we should not deal with the troika or the financial markets, from whom should we borrow in order to fund the gap between spending and taxation?  These are core questions, and the people criticising the approach taken by the Government - as is their full entitlement - must answer those questions if they are participating in the debate, just as they legitimately put points to us to which we must respond.</p><p> In making those points I do not wish to lose sight of the broader picture and the progress the country has made at gigantic cost to society in recent years.  At the start of the programme the country found itself in a place where nobody in the world would lend to us at a rate we could afford.  That not only applied to the sovereign but also to the banking system.  At the start of the programme the country found itself in a place where unemployment was increasing by tens of thousands on a monthly basis.  There is so much more that the Government and the Oireachtas need to do to respond to the crisis.  However, an important point that must be emphasised is that the funding crisis and the inability of the country to borrow have been addressed, but we must do so much more to tackle the unemployment crisis.</p><p> Speaker after speaker has condemned the financial markets and the behaviour of those who operate in them.  They are the same speakers who condemn any attempt to narrow the gap between spending and taxation.  They call for investment in public services and the country at the same time.  Such funding must come from somewhere.  The choice the Government has been following, with the support of the Government parties, has been to do all we can to narrow the gap and allow the country to access money at a rate of interest we can afford.  The rate was above 14% and it is now just above 3%.  That is an extraordinary difference that will give the country the ability to borrow in the future and invest in what we really care about, namely, society, jobs and public services.</p><p> Another theme I wish to address in the time available is the love that has dared not speak its name in the debate to date - default.  That is a point made by Deputy Shane Ross.  I remember being in the Chamber with him on a previous occasion when he urged us to take the route taken in Argentina.  Different options were outlined in terms of the kind of default various speakers preferred.  The question I put to them was what country had taken a decision to unilaterally default on the lender of last resort, which was what they were urging.</p></speech>

Other countries have done it such as Argentina - the course proposed by Deputy Shane Ross.  As a consequence, Argentina finds itself subject to ongoing legal trials and is still subject to rates of interest that make it difficult for it to borrow in the way it wants.</p><p>  Another option put forward is that within the existing framework we should pursue a default and use the money to make the State more creditworthy.  The argument against this is one we have made to date, namely, the rates of interest payable on a reduction in our debt level would create a platform from which we could borrow affordably in the future.  The question I put in response to the refrain we have heard for many years is that in the event of such a unilateral default from where would the money come to fund what Members in this House care so much about.</p><p>  That said, the debate on the programme, its nature and the rights and wrongs of how the Government has exited from the programme should not divert our energy from a broader debate which we should now instigate.  Given that the country has exited the bail-out programme and we are going to do all we can to ensure we stay out of a bailout programme, we must ask what kind of economy and society we want in the future to ensure we will never go down this path again and that we create a society that will be capable of weathering all of the shocks and risks that could present.  I touched on this point with my colleague, Deputy Peter Mathews, in a recent debate.  He recommended a book to me on the topic under discussion.  I thank him for making a gift of it to me, which I will return to him.</p></speech>

I meant I would give him another book in return.  One book I might give in return, one I think he would enjoy, is the recent publication by the National Economic and Social Council which updated a report carried out a number of years ago in the context of recent events.  It is called, Ireland's Five-Part Crisis, Five Years On: Deepening Reform and Institutional Innovation.  One of the summaries was that, overall, the crisis had revealed that past progress had been less comprehensive and sustainable than we had believed.  It stated we had not adequately addressed non-participation and disadvantage in the boom.  It also stated our relationship with the international system had been revealed as more one of vulnerability and dependence than we had thought and our overall system of collective decision-making and public governance had been shown to be extremely weak.  They are the challenges and questions to which we need to collectively respond.</p><p>  That leads me to the final point I wish to make on the essence and concept of sovereignty.  The argument has been made that there will not be any change following our exit from the programme.  We are going to move to a mode of governance in which others will look at the consequences of decisions we make as opposed to institutions making decisions with us, which is where we were.  That is a huge step forward in the nature of sovereignty within the country, but ultimately it will only matter if we can deliver a dividend on foot of the increased decision-making to the people we represent.  That leads me back to the need to invest again in the kind of society or future we want to have.  I hope the Government&rsquo;s publication of a mid-term fiscal strategy will provide a vision for the future on which we can all agree or disagree but at least debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000042#PP00600"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Government's decision to exit the EU-IMF programme of financial support in December without applying for a precautionary credit line.  One has to look back to see where one is going.  In three years of the programme the Administration has achieved a lot.  One only has to cast one&rsquo;s mind back to the fear of treading through the unknown territory we faced three years ago.  It was a very uncertain time.  Moneys were exiting the banks at an alarming rate and we did not know the full extent of the problem.  Not understanding the problem made the situation more terrifying.  There was a genuine fear that one or more of the banks would collapse and people might lose their savings or businesses might lose their cashflow.  It was a crisis in every aspect with the word and people were afraid a freefall could occur.  I spoke to someone at the time who was building an extension.  They were extremely anxious to get the money to the builder in time in case an institution would collapse.  The situation was frightening but there is no longer such a fear.</p><p>  Reference was made to default and the resulting consequences.  One must go back to the early years following the formation of the State when we did default on land annuities.  We paid the British state land annuities under an agreement made in good faith.  A decision was made to keep collecting annuities from farmers but not to pay them to Britain.  That was a default.  An economic war ensued which resulted in devastation.  One day the cattle in the fields were worth money and the following day they were valueless.  One could not sell one&rsquo;s produce.  My ancestors and those of my neighbours suffered.  They had nothing.  They went from having a living to being absolutely broke and the devastation was frightening.  I recommend that people examine what happened then.  They would see that a default would mean hurting the vulnerable and those trying to make a living.</p><p>  The banks are adequately capitalised.  I spoke to a banker about the matter today and he expressed confidence that the banks would get through the stress tests.</p><p>As a country, we have tackled our finances and have stuck to our recovery targets rigidly.  This approach is very businesslike but it is not often associated with the running of countries.  We have made a template.  There is a parallel between the management of this country and the management of a successful business.  There is a solid, serious, no-nonsense approach.  It has sent out a clear message that Ireland is very serious about its recovery.</p><p> Ireland was envied during the boom because of its growth rates.  People asked how we did it and said we were brilliant.  Our premiers were invited to talks to outline what we were doing.  All that led to dismay because the true nature of the bubble became evident eventually: we were people of straw.  Today Ireland is admired and respected across Europe for acknowledging its failures and having the courage to face up the issues and lay down the basis of a sustainable economy.  This is the true nature of what we have done.</p><p> The financial sector has also gone through a tumultuous period.  It is true that it got it wrong but there has been genuine positive engagement and understanding of the problem.  It was always going to be difficult to build up the expertise to deal with it.  We have returned to the financial markets and have built up cash reserves.  This is no accident.  The NTMA has done a very good job.  An informed observer would see there was no need to apply for a precautionary credit line as we already have one in place.  Being insured is sensible but being over-insured is not.  Nobody here would consider insuring his or her car for double its value.  One should remember this behaviour costs money and does not deliver a better financial outcome.  There is a contradiction associated with Ireland applying for the funding as an economy cannot be in recovery and decline at the same time.</p><p> Confidence breeds confidence and there is nothing more annoying in business than someone who fails to make up his or her mind or take responsibility for his or her decisions. Indecision is fatal as fate will show one one's destiny.  Let nobody be under any illusions that exiting this bailout and being able to do so without additional ties is a huge achievement and one of which we should be rightly proud.</p></speech>

Many people, both in the press and in the Houses of the Oireachtas, will contend international factors brought about Ireland's capacity to re-enter the market and pull back from the precipice.  Some attribute this to the reduction in interest rates in 2011 and some will cite the ECB's decision to provide &euro;1 trillion in liquidity later in 2011.  Others will cite Mr. Mario Draghi's crucial speech in London in 2012.  There is no doubt all these external factors have been of great benefit to Ireland and have had an important impact on bond market sentiment.  However, it is also true to say that none of these external factors could have improved investor sentiment dramatically in Ireland without strong, stable management of our public finances.  That is the contrast and what has been delivered over the past two and a half years or so.</p><p>  We must acknowledge that fiscal consolidation began under the late Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan.  It is important that we pay tribute where appropriate.  The policy has been continued and developed by the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  It has been a gargantuan task in the face of what was a huge existential crisis in this State.  It was probably one of the biggest since the arms crisis in the  1970s.</p><p>  The Irish have shown great maturity and willingness to exercise their democratic rights where they are best exercised, namely, the ballot box.  The exercise of democracy might not produce the sort of social discord or clash of ideologies which brings people onto the streets, which certainly sells newspapers and from which some in this House might hope to profit for their own political ends.  That said, it is a genuine reflection of the true nature of our Republic and I am very proud of it.</p><p>  In March 2011, at a time of great uncertainty and turmoil in this country, the Irish voted for something new and entirely different from what had obtained previously, and something that would remove them from the failings of the past.  They voted for more than they have received under the current Government but I commend the Government and all Members of the Oireachtas on their collective role in steering Ireland through this unprecedented period.</p><p>  It is fair to say the threats the State faces are not over.  Our enormous national debt, which is referenced by many speakers, the ongoing political instability in the euro zone, particularly in Italy and Greece, and continued economic stagnation right across the Continent mean that very serious risks continue to exist.  We must remain on high alert.  Against this backdrop, the decision not to avail of a credit line as part of our exit from the bailout on 15 December is one I simply do not support, for three reasons.  Deputy Barry has got it wrong by suggesting a credit line would actually cost Ireland rather than result in saving taxpayers' hard-earned money.  There is a &euro;600 million cost associated with maintaining the high cash reserves in the NTMA.  That cost is approximately 12 times the estimated cost of a credit line.  Those are the figures.</p><p>  The second reason is Ireland's self-imposed exclusion from the ECB's limitless bond-buying programme, or OMT.</p><p>  Third, I am seriously concerned that the independent advice of the NTMA, the agency responsible for managing our &euro;200 billion in national debt, was completely ignored in March, July and as recently as October, as was the advice of the independent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The two parties now in government called for the establishment of the latter when in opposition.</p><p>  I have listened very carefully to the comments of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  I have commented on his comments several times in recent days and do not believe his arguments stack up.  He stated the main reason he believes we ought not to benefit from a credit line is that he wants to re-enter the markets when conditions are benign.  Nobody disagrees with that.  It is a false choice as nobody is suggesting we should not re-enter the market.  It is simply being suggested that we do so with a safety net.  The other suggestion is that the German Bundestag, along with other parliaments, would vote against a proposed credit line.  That has been debunked by senior spokespeople in the German Government and elsewhere.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is anyone in this House who, deep down, was not supportive of it.  I congratulate the Government on completing the programme in so far as it has done so.  I have a concern, however.  It is epitomised by the fact that there is nobody present in this House who actually formed part of the Opposition in 2011.  This is a very important debate.  Our main Opposition parties are not present during the actual debate.</p><p>  It is fortunate that the Government allowed time for this debate because it was not scheduled last week.  There was no debate on it last week and it was not originally scheduled for this week.  It shows the danger in our democratic process.  I got a very uneasy feeling here last Thursday when the Government marched in, made an announcement and went off into the sunset.</p><p>We cannot have economic policy by confident soundbite, because people will see through it.  I really hope the decision the Government made works out, but I am not so sure it will.  I have a gut feeling that we should have gone for the credit line or at least, if we are really confident, we should have applied for it.  The Government could then have outlined to the House the various options available.  It does not make sense that we did not at least make an application.  A true sign of self-confidence, as opposed to populist, incorrect decision making, would have been to go ahead with a credit line.  It is not necessary for the Government to have policy by soundbite.  It should have the confidence to articulate every view and proposal.  Time and again we hear messages from Brussels, Frankfurt and elsewhere about game-changers, seismic shifts, retrospective recapitalisation and so forth.  What is the situation with regard to the latter?  I heard Karl Whelan saying last Saturday that he did not understand why we were still talking about recapitalisation of the banks, because it would never happen.  The Minister suggested that it will happen next year or may come up for discussion next year.</p><p> Finally, I ask that the word &quot;austerity&quot; be dropped from our political vocabulary, because living within one's means certainly is not austerity.</p></speech>

Over the past few months we have been treated to a charade of false debate and nonsense about the budget from the Government, but particularly from members of the Labour Party.  The latter have danced around every town and village in this country saying that they got a reduction in the budgetary adjustment.  However, it was revealed at the weekend that there is one message for the Irish audience and another for the bureaucrats in Brussels, with an adjustment of &euro;2.5 billion here but an adjustment of &euro;3.1 billion in Brussels.  We have been treated to lie after lie about the budget adjustments.  We hear that a secret communications strategy was drawn up between the troika and the Government about that adjustment.  The Government must come clean on whether the real figure is &euro;2.5 billion or &euro;3.1 billion.  What is the real position?  Is the Government able to address the fiscal situation competently and in a considered way?</p><p>  Those who celebrate the exit with excessive zeal ignore the fact that austerity is still with us.  What will happen as a result of the end of this so-called bailout is that the Government will not be able to hide behind the bogeymen of the troika any more.  In reality, the leading Government party, Fine Gael, would be implementing all of these policies even if the troika were not here.  That party is absolutely committed to eviscerating our public services and to demonising those on social welfare by, for example, slashing the incomes of young unemployed people.  Fine Gael is absolutely opposed to an expansionary fiscal strategy that would focus on economic stimulus.  There is still an inordinate delay in accessing capital funding from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to stimulate the economy.  That delay has been dragging on and on.  One result of the ending of the so-called bailout is that the Government will not be able to hide behind anyone when next year it decides to take a further &euro;2 billion via savage cuts and taxes, which will fall on ordinary people again, while rejecting any attempt to introduce a wealth tax, for example.  Such a tax has been costed in detail by economic analysts in TASC and other reputable organisations.  </p><p>  I absolutely reject the assertion that we were bailed out.  This country has borne the brunt of the bank bailout in a way that was completely out of proportion to the situation in Europe.  I see this as nothing more than a giant public relations exercise from the Government.  It  is a day's debate during which we are told to line up, one after another, to congratulate this Government for savaging the incomes of ordinary people in our communities and for taking medical cards away from people with very serious medical conditions.  In the context of the latter, the Taoiseach stands up during Leader's Questions, like the clown at a circus, telling us that it is not happening, but even Government Deputies know that vital supports are being taken from the most vulnerable.  Travellers, for example, are one of the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in this country.  A few years ago the budget for traveller accommodation was just over &euro;90 million, but now it stands at &euro;3 million.  The budget has been absolutely savaged because groups such as Travellers and those with disabilities, unlike the IFSC Clearing House Group, do not have access to Ministers with a click of their fingers.  Regardless of when this bailout ends, it is this Government's policy to privatise and savage public services and to eradicate any attempt at building an equal society.  That will be the legacy of this Government, which I reject.  I will not join the fanfare of support for this canard.</p></speech>

Free at last!  Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!".  However, we are not free at last.  We are not free and will never be free while this Government endures and while it continues with the appalling and dreadful austerity which began in September 2008 under the Cowen-led Government and continues to this day.  Indeed, having been a satrap State for the past three years, we are being permitted to enter a new decade as a dependent economy, firmly under direct economic rule from Brussels and Frankfurt.</p><p>  Like other Deputies, I am concerned about the lack of information from the Government about the potential terms and conditions that would have been attached to a precautionary credit line and the total lack of clarity on the further invigilation of Ireland in the post-bailout period.  The Dutch finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said that Ireland would be subjected to &quot;intensive surveillance&quot; twice a year because under the new two-pack rules, a county exiting a bailout will be subjected to extra surveillance until 75% of money owed is repaid.  I note that we got a very quiet backstop from Berlin a number of weeks ago, extending until next February.  I also note that John Corrigan of the NTMA has said that we may be able to access the outright monetary transactions, OMT, programme.  I welcome this if it proves to be the case.  The decision to involve KfW, the German development bank, seems innovative and may result in cheaper interest rates on loans to the Irish SME sector.  </p><p>  However, while there are some positive reports coming in on our situation, we continue to suffer dreadfully because of the events of September 2008.  I will probably be supporting this motion because it seems consistent with my position since this horrendous economic austerity descended on us.  We are still in desperately uncertain territory, with the socialisation of vast amounts of private debt.  Our citizens have suffered deeply and continue to suffer.  I have estimated, based on figures from the Department of Finance, that in the past few years &euro;3.7 billion has been taken from the social protection budget and approximately &euro;4 billion from the health budget, and the amount of interest that we are paying to sustain the bank bailout debt is roughly the size of the education budget.  The gallant shoulders of our people are continuing to carry the burden, with projected cuts of &euro;2 billion next year and further billions in the years ahead.  </p><p>  It is not a day on which we can feel free or even deeply hopeful.  However, I welcome the fact that at least we are getting away from the troika.</p></speech>

The first economic war was started in 1932, when today's Irish 80 year olds were just small children.  Fianna F&aacute;il started a six-year economic war with Britain by withholding land annuities.  The scheme, like a lot of other Fianna F&aacute;il schemes, backfired badly.  It was a complete disaster and our current generation of pensioners and their children paid the price with poverty and emigration that lasted into the 1960s.  In 2010 Fianna F&aacute;il launched the second economic war on the citizens of Ireland, but the effects of this second war will take a very long time to recover from.</p><p>  During my budget speech I referred to the fact that there was not one Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy in the Chamber, and I note that the same is true today.</p><p>As we leave the period of financial oversight by the three lenders which bailed Ireland out, Ireland still carries a mountain of debt.  Despite what Deputy Thomas P. Broughan said, no one is feeling particularly euphoric about this.  The portion of the debt carried by the State stands at approximately &euro;204 billion.  The cost of servicing this debt will be &euro;9 billion next year.  I welcome the exit from troika oversight.  Not only does it give the country back its hard won sovereignty but regaining our fiscal independence also gives Ireland a chance to negotiate a better deal on that interest burden.  However, the large capital sum, &euro;204 billion of borrowings and bank guarantees, remains and it will be a burden for every man, woman and child in the country for a long time to come.  We need to get that number down to a sustainable level and start discussing realistic ways of doing this.</p><p> The first thing we can do as a nation is to expect public service leaders to make decisions that financially de-risk every large decision they make.  If such a de-risking approach had been taken, for example, to the case of the Lissadell House right of way, the Sligo county manager would have been obliged to consider the risk of adding a further &euro;7 million to the national debt before taking a decision to go to court, while the cost of each of the 58 days in the High Court should have been foremost in the minds of all in question as the case progressed.  Everybody in the public service in positions of power to spend millions or even billions of euro must stop to think not just about his or her own job in managing a county or a city or a semi-State company, he or she also needs to think about how wrong decisions can badly affect the national debt.</p><p> Dublin City Council is in the news because of a multi-million euro contract with a consultant related to the Poolbeg incinerator which the European Commission is stating was not legal.  We are told the incinerator project has cost more than &euro;100 million so far and it is not even built yet.  It is not good enough to say Dublin City Council is financing this fiasco and, therefore, the rest of the country can ignore it.  The national debt is a national problem and every city and county manager needs to start considering the bigger picture.  </p><p> EirGrid is planning to spend hundreds of millions of euro building a line of large pylons between Cork and Kildare.  It is supposedly part of the bigger Grid25 project to strengthen the national grid.  As the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources explained last week, the objective of Grid25 is to ensure homes and businesses will have power into the future.  There is nothing wrong with that objective, except for that fact the consultants appointed by Eirgrid - coincidentally the same consultants about which the European Commission has been questioning Dublin City Council regarding the incinerator - say the main reason behind their design of the Cork to Kildare Grid Link proposal is not to supply power nationally but to export it to Britain and France, two countries that may not need a power supply from Ireland when this large expensive power line is built.  This country can no longer afford such a major financial risk.</p><p> I welcome the move back to sovereignty and congratulate all involved, in particular the people for getting us this far.  The road ahead is long and everybody must play a part, particularly those who make significant financial decisions with public money.</p><p> Deputy Patrick Nulty has left the Chamber, but I am sick and tired of him constantly attacking the Labour Party.  He cannot even stay in the House to listen to somebody else take him up on using the party for his own gain to get into the House.</p></speech>

We have had to face terrible atrocities and decisions as a country to get us out of the bailout programme.  Getting rid of the troika has been a national imperative since it first arrived three years ago.  It formed the basis of a general election campaign and has dominated the Government's thinking and objectives ever since.  However, its exit leaves a void.  The economic imperative will have to be different because if the restored economic sovereignty we pursued so hard leads to no change, people will wonder what we were concerned about in the first place.</p><p>  Following the troika's exit, we need to think about where we are heading with our economic freedom.  We need a new economic understanding which will encompass the Government, civil society and the citizen to make sure what we put in place is different from we had previously.  We need a people or a values-focused economy based on a number of facets, the first of which is the worker who gets up every day and brings his or her kids to school before going to work.  He or she must be at the centre of our economic thinking.  That did not happen in the past.  We put all our hopes in the speculator, the developer and big businesspeople.  The economy cherished them and they were put up by politicians in certain parties as the example of what we should follow.  That needs to stop and we need to examine every economic decision we make.  The economic model we put forward should be based on the worker.  That may sound a little callous because we often have debates about people who are vulnerable and may be suffering because of cuts and resource allocations, but unless people are working and generating wealth and paying taxes, we will have nothing to redistribute to other groups.</p></speech>

The country has never got to grips with it.  As a social democrat who believes in the power of the State to be a leveller and give everyone a leg up and the opportunity to succeed, I firmly believe in the social contract.  It states a citizen who goes to work and participates in society is not paying taxes as dead money that disappears into a black hole.  He or she pays taxes as a contribution to something he or she gets back and, therefore, his or her taxes are not wasted.  He or she pays for an excellent education system for children and an excellent transport system to take people to work.  They are part of a worker's wage, the social wage.  However, we have never accepted this in this country.  We have always begrudged and knocked taxation and, to some extent, people were right to do so.  In recent years we have been capable of producing much more with much less and if pay cuts are excluded, that inherently shows we had ineffective and wasteful public services.  That, therefore, gives credence to people's belief that their money was not being well spent.  I believe in the social contract and the social wage.  Those who believe in the new economic model we want to set up have to put efficient and effective public services at the centre of public provision.  That is why the reform unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must have a strengthened role in the time ahead.  Perhaps it should link with the Committee of Public Accounts or a similar committee and have a public forum for the work it is doing in making sure service provision is excellent and efficient.  If we do not do so and go back to a model where we take people's tax and public services for granted, the electorate will reward those who seek to tear down the social contract and that system.</p><p>  The third reform of the economy relates to making decisions about the State's role in the market.  According to the outlook of economists, the cause of our financial crisis was the housing bubble which was a speculative bubble that created a huge construction boom based on easy credit and then collapsed, but behind that bubble a policy decision had been taken which was accepted by the political elite that it was okay for workers to pay ten times their income to buy a three bedroom semi-detached house an hour and a half from where they worked.  That idea was propagated as something that was right.  In other words, it was okay for somebody who happened to live on the edge of a city to, for example, sell a few acres of land for &euro;16 million and then pass the cost on people who were doing their best to provide for a family and pay for a home.  The then Government did not interfere with the market, which was a problem.  We need to have a debate about which market injustices we tolerate and whether it is morally right for somebody to inherit land and hoard it before speculating on it and making millions of euro in profit, while hundreds of people pay exorbitant mortgages to meet the cost to the developer.  We need to get real and begin a discussion about the market and when the State should interfere in those issues that are inherent to people's existence such as education, health and so on.</p><p>Owing to globalisation in the past 20 years, Ireland can no longer believe it is an independent country when it comes to the business and the economic model it pursues.  We are part of the European Union but also part of an international system in which capital can flow from one country to another at the push of a button.  Businesses no longer decide where they want to locate simply based on which markets they can access from a location but rather where they can get the best workers, lowest corporation tax rates and so on.  Irrespective of whether we like it, we are in a race to the bottom with other markets across the globe.</p><p> Those of us who want to see a social contract in which the wealth of a nation provides for people to fulfil themselves and participate fully in society must realise we need a tax base to sustain that.  Having a global corporate market which incentivises countries to reduce the amounts of money businesses contribute to the state contradicts this and will underfund it if it continues.  The European Union, the bastion of the social economic model across the world, based on the French and German models and the one to which we aspire, needs to work together.  The Union must ensure businesses pay their fair share.</p><p> What is driving the economic model we follow?  Over the past several years, even during the boom, we have used narrow clinical terms such as GDP, GNP and inflation growth.  However, if average incomes are increasing, we still do not know whether everyone is better off.  For example, one person earning several million euro will skew the average income rate while others may be left behind.  We need a better way of measuring and monitoring our economic model.  In 2008, the French Government established the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress which was chaired by the Nobel economist, Joseph Stiglitz.  It expanded measuring average incomes to include time spent with family, commute times and the broader well-being of society.  We need to stop looking at narrow economic targets.  Instead, we need an economic model which targets, measures and follows a state of well-being for our people which is much broader than the narrow measurements such as GDP and average income.</p><p> This is a good time for the country.  We are exiting the troika bailout and regaining our economic independence.  However, this independence must be used to ensure what happened before does not happen again, that workers are at the centre of decision-making, that we get real about the idea of a social contract, the taxes we pay and the services we receive in return.  We need to have a good discussion as to what market injustices we accept, how we measure economic progress, how we value that which our economy achieves and those policies which we put towards their production.</p></speech>

It is also good that over the three years during the course of the programme Ireland met all the macroeconomic targets set down.  The visits from the troika to Ireland served a useful purpose, ensuring the Government continued to keep focused on the task at hand.  I believe the public did not have a problem with the troika overseeing the implementation of the memorandum of understanding.</p><p>  However, it is also important to note which reforms were not delivered during the three years.  Some reforms were achieved, some of which would have been achieved without the troika.  Some additional reforms could have been achieved, however.  The mortgage arrears issue has not yet been substantially dealt with.  Banks are now offering solutions to some mortgage holders advising them to dispose of their properties, which is only an attempt to reach a statistical target rather than a sustainable solution.  Neither has unemployment been adequately dealt with.  While every Member will agree there are plenty of job activation measures and that officials in the Department of Social Protection are dealing individually with those on the live register, more needs to be done.  I often wonder if the Department should be merged with the other jobs Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  We are still grappling with the financial management structures of our health sector.  Even two weeks after the Budget Statement, there is a dispute about the level of savings to be achieved in the Health Service Executive, HSE, and whether it will be &euro;666 million or &euro;1 billion.  The reason there is a struggle to meet the figures announced in the budget and to agree the annual service plan is because some of the figures for savings were plucked out of the air without any substantial backing.</p><p>  Sheltered sectors of the economy such as the legal profession have not been dealt with either.  A recent legal case concerning the contesting of a public right way at Lissadell House ended up in the Supreme Court.  Sligo County Council, which did not have the &euro;2 million to buy the house several years ago, has now ended up with legal fees almost three times that amount, some &euro;7 million.  It may well have been an issue of public importance, but it is fundamentally grossly obscene and immoral that the legal fees to determine a legal right of way across a path in front of a house could approach &euro;10 million when the property itself is a fraction of that amount.  The issue of disproportionate legal fees has not been tackled.  I have not given up on Ireland dealing with this matter itself but an opportunity was missed to tackle it when the troika was here.</p><p>  On Ireland&rsquo;s funding requirements, we must look at the commitments we have to meet over the coming three years.  Before 2016, Ireland will have maturing debt in the order of &euro;35 billion.  Some of that is government bonds while other parts of it are the payments under the EU-IMF programme from 2015.  In 2014, we have maturing liabilities of &euro;7.7 billion, &euro;10.5 billion in 2015 and in &euro;16.4 billion 2016, all of which accumulates to nearly &euro;35 billion over three years.  In addition to that, there is a deficit funding of &euro;18 billion.  While some believe we are out of our problems and will have budget surpluses, it is a bit unreal.  If one were to use primary surplus as a measure of how well a country is doing, it would mean Greece would be one of the best performers in the EU while taking no account of its financing arrangements for the level of debts it has built up.</p><p>  In the next three years, we have a funding requirement of &euro;53 billion.</p><p>That is a significant factor to be taken into account when deciding whether Ireland should have a precautionary credit line in place.  One of the most important factors in that debate is the State's underlying debt.  Our general Government debt to the end of 2013 will be around 124%.  We hope that figure will begin to reduce in 2014 to 120% and a little below that figure in 2015.  If somebody goes into a bank to borrow money, the first question it will ask is what is his or her existing level of debt.  Given that we have such a high level of debt, it makes it more difficult for us to borrow because people will be looking at the overhang of debt.</p><p> We must be fair and acknowledge that the NTMA has cash in hand of about &euro;25 billion, which is substantial and will see us through 2014 and into 2015, but we cannot run it down to the wire.  Ireland will need to be back in the international markets early next year when the season begins for raising funds.  At that stage, I believe Ireland will be able to borrow successfully in the immediate short term, which in itself will be very important.  People will wonder if we are finished with the troika, but we still owe the European Union, the IMF and the ECB a lot of money.  They will be here at least twice a year for visits, making sure we are meeting commitments and continuing to make repayments and they will be doing this for a while.  We also have commitments under the six-pack and the two-pack in our EU targets.  The most important target is reducing our debt to 60% of GDP over a 20 year period and that can only be done by achieving surpluses in that time.</p><p> Everybody accepts that the precautionary credit line is a finely balanced issue, but when I met representatives of the troika during their last visit two weeks ago as part of the Fianna F&aacute;il delegation, they told us that the mechanism for having a precautionary credit line could extend to up to 57 days.  Not only would it have to go through the European Commission, it would also have to go through several national parliaments.  That would involve going through the Bundestag and as we all know, the Labour Party's colleagues in Germany, in the SPD, have been raising the issue of our corporation tax rate.  The Labour Party Members would do us all a favour if they were to ask their party colleagues in the European Parliament to desist from raising this as an issue, which is not fair.  While we have a low rate of corporation tax, many countries have a higher nominal rate but a lower effective rate.  Other governments might take the opportunity to raise a variety of issues and it would have been very difficult if the issue of Ireland's precautionary credit line had been kicked around the floor of various national parliaments.  The Government was afraid to go down that road because we do not know what might come from a debate in the various national parliaments.  We could get drawn into an another debate unconnected with Ireland.  Parliamentarians in some countries might suggest all programme countries should come under one precautionary credit line system and not deal with Ireland on its own, even though we are the first to leave a programme.  Fees would also have to be paid for the facility.  While we might not draw down any money, the fee would have to be paid to put the facility in place and we probably would have to sign a new memorandum of understanding.  These were complications from which the Government shied away.  That is one reason it has chosen not to take that route.</p><p> I welcome the conclusion of the programme.  It was always the intention that we would leave at the end of the defined three year period.  The fiscal targets have been met and well achieved and people abroad are saying Ireland is in a strong position as we leave the ECB-IMF programme.  On behalf of my own party, I can only say we hope the entry back into the private fundraising market is a success for Ireland in the years to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1183" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000047#UU00200"><p>I thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming for sharing his time with me.  It is appreciated.</p><p>  I would like to refer to the text of the statement, on which we will be voting later tonight.  The Minister stated the Government's decision to exit the EU-IMF programme of financial support in December without applying for a precautionary credit line &quot;is the right decision for Ireland and now is the right time to make that decision.&quot;  That is a long sentence and clumsy.  It is possibly illogical because if one makes a decision, its timing, by definition, needs to be right, rather than it being the right time to make it.  There is cloudy thinking.  We are exiting a programme.  It is the effluxion of time and our arrival at a calendar date.  The programme started on 29 November 2010.</p><p>  People have forgotten that what propelled the troika to come to Dublin to arrange emergency finance for the country in an orderly way was the fact that the six Irish banks had &euro;140 billion from the ECB, the exposure of which was maddingly alarming and frightening.  That is why it came.  It had to stabilise the country's consolidation programme for the next three years in order to provide the finance that would meet the difference between expenditure and taxation during that period.  That amounted to &euro;67.5 billion in loans.  At the end of the period of disbursement - the last disbursements finish on 15 December - there will be a period of review and surveillance.  That is naturally the case because that is what lenders do after they finish disbursing a loan.</p><p>  We have not come from a battlefield of austerity into a meadow of milk and honey.  We must describe it truthfully to the people because we need to acknowledge in this debate that the sacrifices, resilience and patience of the people of Ireland in achieving that fiscal consolidation, mapped out in the framework of the troika, have been remarkable.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, spoke about the journey on which the Government had embarked.  This is like poetry.  He stated it was extraordinary that the gap between spending and revenue was now nearly 3%, which was extraordinary.  He spoke about the legacy debt that remained.  A figure of &euro;30 billion is odious.  He referred to Deputy Shane Ross looking for a write-down of that debt, using the filthy word &quot;default&quot; and stating Argentina was the example that should scare us.  After the Second World War in Germany there was creditor compression; all of its creditors agreed to write down the debt in an orderly way in the 1951 debt agreement.  Greece also recently had an orderly negotiated debt write-down.  That job remains for the Government.  Deputy Lucinda Creighton referred to the expectations of the people when there was a change of Government in February 2011; they expected more than they have received to date.  I am not trying to undermine what has been achieved, but we have not yet got there; we are not even halfway there.  There is an odious debt of &euro;30 billion that needs to be negotiated away.</p><p>  Professor Honohan was the man who alerted the troika to enter and provide the memorandum of understanding on 29 November 2010.  At the time, he saw the scariness of a debt of &euro;140 billion outstanding to the ECB by six Irish banks and the panic button was pressed.  It had to get here to enter a programme.  The last D&aacute;il - the Opposition as well as the Government parties - was hugely culpable in not understanding what had gone on with regard to policy here and that the banks had trashed the country with a turbo-charged splurge of credit.  Professor Stiglitz, to whom Deputy Derek Nolan referred, explained the situation in <i>The Price of Inequality</i> .  I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has read that book which I gave to him because it is a great analysis of economics and policy that is needed to generate growth in a western democracy to underpin a more just, fair and democratic society.</p><p> The unfinished business involves the legacy debt.  I implore the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to don the breastplate of armour and go in and negotiate on it.  I would take from Professor Honohan the keys to the desk drawer that contains the bonds, rip them up and then invite Mr. Draghi to come and show him why this was the right thing to do.</p></speech>

I would not agree with the remedy Deputy Peter Mathews suggested, but he is right about there being unfinished business and how the legacy debt should be dealt with.  I am not sure his recommendation is a genuine solution that can be agreed to, but the Government must turn its attention to this issue more strongly than ever.  Like all previous speakers, I was here for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan's statement that we were in the last few weeks of the ECB-IMF programme.  As the Minister outlined last week when it was announced that the Government had decided not to seek a precautionary credit line, the intention on entering the programme would always have been that we would leave it.</p><p>  At different points in the past three years many speculated that the country would not be able to leave the programme.  There were particularly churlish comments from people in Fianna F&aacute;il about the necessity to have a precautionary credit line and an almost complete failure to acknowledge their role in bringing us into a programme.  Deputy Peter Matthews spoke about the role of the Governor of the Central Bank.  Perhaps the greatest indictment of the last Government is that it was left to the Governor of the Central Bank to go on the national airwaves to say what was actually happening with the national finances, while Cabinet Ministers were either too incompetent to know what was happening or lied through their teeth about the presence of members of the troika in this city.  I do not know which is worse, their being incompetent or telling barefaced lies.  That is the situation the country faced.</p><p>  I was a maths teacher in a previous existence and there is no definitive correct answer to the question on the Government's decision not to seek a precautionary credit line.  We do not know and only with the benefit of hindsight will we be able to tell whether it was the correct decision.  On balance, based on the facts as we know them, the interest rates available to Ireland on the international markets and our success in exiting the troika programme, it was the correct decision to take.  Most of the commentary by independent commentators outside the House has reflected that, on balance, it may well have been the right decision, but we will not know definitively for several years to come.</p><p>  I agree with many previous speakers and have listened to most of the debate.  Deputy Derek Nolan spoke about the origins of the economic crisis of the last five or six years and the housing market bubble.  While he was correct, some political decisions made along the way led to that housing market bubble.  The Deputy said no attempts had been made to interfere in the property market.  Actually, several attempts were made.  I was not a Member but a councillor and a student when Mr. Peter Bacon who is now producing reports for private bodies was engaged by the Government to draw up reports on housing market issues.  The first Bacon report in 1998 was primarily focused on trying to squeeze investors out of the market and reduce excessive investor demand by changing the tax treatment of certain investment incomes.  His 1999 report focused mainly on the position of the many people who were renting and seeking to get on the property ladder.  As a result of his reports, in the following few years the Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il with the Progressive Democrats and their Independent friends decided to establish a committee that would examine the role of the Central Bank and regulation of the banking sector.  That committee has been largely forgotten and written out of history, but it was chaired by then Deputy Michael McDowell.  It made some worthy recommendations, the principal one being that the function of regulation should be removed from the Central Bank and an independent Financial Regulator established.  This was accepted by the Government.  That decision was subsequently reversed and the Financial Regulator is effectively the No. 2 in the Central Bank.  There is much closer co-operation, to say the least, between the two bodies.</p><p>  There was a dismal failure, in particular following the second Bacon report which examined the level of mortgage people could obtain.  It spoke about basing borrowers' mortgages on their net income rather than 2.5 times gross salary.  As a result of this, former Deputy Michael McDowell's committee spoke about the need to establish independent regulation and the entire nature of banking in this country changed in a relatively short period.  The economy also changed.  Up until approximately 2002 the economy was not as focused on the construction sector, but after 2002 the property bubble took hold and future generations will have to come to terms with the disastrous fruits of it.  Many more text books will be written about it.</p><p>  On balance, I agree with the Government's decision.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in his time in office has instilled confidence back into the country.  I have confidence in him that he has made the correct decision but only time will tell if that is the case.</p></speech>

The vacant Fianna F&aacute;il benches are reminiscent of the vacant attitude Fianna F&aacute;il took to the running of the country when it was in government.  Unless I was in a parallel universe, Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming made out in the contribution that the troika programme was somehow a good thing for Ireland and that the people did not mind having a group of outsiders overseeing what we were doing.  I find it very difficult to understand how anybody could suggest the surrender of the country's sovereignty was anything other than treachery and a bad thing.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming may get another opportunity to speak when he might like to enlighten us on how he thinks giving away the country's sovereignty is a good thing.  That remark cuts to the bone of how out of touch Fianna F&aacute;il in opposition has been about this issue.</p><p>  Last week we saw the spectacle of the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, with a belated interest in financial responsibility, coming into the House to oppose the taking of the order to announce the fact that the Government was not going to seek a secure line of credit but was going to inform European finance Ministers that we were going it alone.</p><p>The attitude of the Opposition that day, Fianna F&aacute;il in particular, smacked of a group of people who had learned nothing from the cataclysmic destruction of the economy into which they led us over a 14 year period.  This destruction was symbolised by the arrival of three people, representing three organisations, on the day Dublin Airport's new terminal was opened.  This, again, was another symbol of what the country was facing because that terminal has been used in the intervening period and is still being used for the export of some of our brightest because of our economic collapse.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that he has made an excellent start in leading the country's economic recovery.  The analogy he used at the weekend was that when one was learning to swim, sooner or later one had to let go of the bar and take off the armbands.  We may never again have the opportunity we have at this time, where the climate within the European institutions and our environment is as good as it is to make the break we need to make.  Deputy John Paul Phelan was right to say history would be the ultimate gauge of this.  Sooner or later, the country was going to have to make the decision and it was going to make it now or in 12 months time.  We do not know what circumstances will be like in 12 months or whether conditions will then be as good for us to make it.</p><p>  People have taken a massive amount of personal pain, be it through their pay packet, their mortgage or the fact that they have lost their house, their job, their children to emigration or a future generation.  They need some hope and a sense that somebody is back at the helm.  We now have the opportunity to decide our future economic destiny.  The day we surrendered it was a day when we had to ask ourselves what had been the purpose in 1916 or 1922 or in the intervening period if, at the stroke of a pen, we could give away our economic and fiscal independence because clearly we were not able to manage it.  The country was dragged through indignity and embarrassment as a result.  The damage this surrender did to families, individuals, businesses and a whole generation will take a long time to be undone.  Trust must be rebuilt in the political system.</p><p>  We have taken the first step, in which I wish the Government well.  We have opposition for the sake of opposition, but now of all times people need to get behind the country, regardless of who is in government.  They must support the country and sell it in a positive light.  They must stop knocking the Government just for the sake of knocking it.  Everything the Government has done since it took office has been knocked for the sake of it.  That record needs to change.</p></speech>

It was a very dark day for the country.  I am not telling stories out of turn about our parliamentary party, but at our parliamentary party meeting on that day Fine Gael Senators and Deputies were incensed.  Fine Gael is the party that fought for the State and set up and defended the institutions of State.  We were incensed, but I saw real leadership in the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that day.  He turned to us and said we could take on the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Union, but we would lose.  He went on to say what we were going to do.</p><p>  I am delighted that three years later, through the direction of the Minister for Finance; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin; the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes; the Taoiseach; the T&aacute;naiste and a Government that worked cohesively, we have waved goodbye to the troika.  As Members know, the country was under huge pressure; unemployment was on the rise; the banks were in crisis, and competitiveness had declined dramatically.  Our reputation with the European Union had been shattered.  We saw speculation in various areas and the property market and failed to support manufacturing and farming, an indigenous industry which effectively ensures we can have an export led economy.</p><p>  What is happening now?  We are talking about knocking down ghost estates, many of which are in my constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim.  One wonders why a Government should knock down houses that are half built.  However, when one looks at the price of houses in my constituency, one can see, as Deputy Michael Colreavy will agree, that a brand new three bedroom house can be bought for &euro;40,000 and an apartment for &euro;20,000.  After years of being told there was no future in farming or manufacturing and that the real future was in banking and financial markets, we are in a situation where the Government and local authorities must knock down half built estates.  This is probably the best solution because the cost of a new house in these areas ranges only from &euro;30,000 to &euro;35,000.  This shows where we are now.</p><p>  Fine Gael has delivered on all of the 260 actions under the ECB-IMF programme.  I commend the Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin, and everybody else who has helped to get us out of the mess so far.  There is a long way to go, but much work has been done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000049#WW00500"><p>Everyone knew we would exit the bailout programme at some point and that a decision would have to be made on whether we would go for a backstop.  Whether that decision would be taken now or in 12 months was a matter for the Government.  It was up to it to weigh up everything that was happening and make an informed decision.  It was obviously a surprise for us on Thursday morning to receive an e-mail calling us to gather in the Chamber to hear the announcement, but that said, Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with the decision taken by the Government.  Our opinion has always been that signing up for a precautionary credit line or a backstop, without knowing the full conditions that would be attached to it, would be akin to a second bail-out.  We have seen the damage the previous bailout programme has inflicted on the State and its citizens.</p><p>  It was astonishing to hear some of the mutterings from the Fianna F&aacute;il benches when they were asking us to sign up for what Sinn F&eacute;in believes would have been a second bailout or to hear them suggest that would be in the best interests of the State.  How anybody can take seriously anything a Fianna F&aacute;il leader, particularly one who was a Minister at the time the troika came to these shores, is beyond me.  It was as a result of decisions taken by the then Government and policies implemented by it in the main that we came to be in this situation.  We cannot lay the blame solely on this factor, however, as there were other external factors that led to our economic demise.  However, nobody could argue with the fact that it was the way the matter was handled, decisions made and policies implemented that plunged the State into economic crisis.  As a result, we have had a number of years of austerity and tens of thousands of our young people have emigrated because of the economic situation in which we have found ourselves.  These young people are the highly educated workforce we need to try to regain our economic sovereignty.</p><p>  It is ironic to listen to Fianna F&aacute;il Members and former Ministers lecture others in the House about regaining economic sovereignty.  Many of the measures implemented as part of the troika plan had already been agreed to in Fianna F&aacute;il's national recovery plan.  Calling it a national recovery plan is a joke in itself.</p><p> Last Thursday I watched Leaders' Questions at the RTE studios and it came across clearly that very tough economic decisions had to be made.  No one in the House is under any illusion that the troika has gone home because this is not the case.  Our budgetary process will still be scrutinised and we are still signed up to the fiscal treaty with all of its economic ramifications.  It is clear that there are still tough times ahead for Irish citizens.  The one thing that came out of the Taoiseach's statement, in particular, concerned the short-term economic strategy which would be finalised before the end of the year.  It will guide us in the coming 12 months, a time period which will be critical in terms of the economic fortunes of the State.  I am not sure what the figures are, but we probably have funding in excess of &euro;22 billion or &euro;23 billion which will probably see us through all of next year at least and perhaps part of 2015, depending on growth rates.  After this, we do not know what will happen or what the external factors in Europe will be.  We do not know how they will impact on us.  We have enough funding in place to run the State next year and for this reason, we believed it was the right decision.  The short-term economic strategy which will be put in place will be critical because if it does not work or bear fruit and we do not implement the right policies, we will not see the growth rates we need to enable us to maintain our economic sovereignty and access the bond markets year after year.  The strategy will be a key Government policy document and how it is implemented will set out the stall for the coming years.</p><p> It will not come as a surprise to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, that we will have differing opinions on how the strategy should be implemented.  We did not do enough to stimulate the domestic economy in recent budgets and many agree with me.  We kept taking money out of people's pockets and perpetuating a situation where people had less to spend in local shops.  As a result, local shops were finding it increasingly difficult to meet their overheads.  Businesses were closing, as a result of which more and more people sought State assistance through the Department of Social Protection.  It is a vicious circle and we need to re-evaluate how we do business in terms of the domestic economy.  We must start stimulating it and investing in the small and medium enterprise sector.</p><p> We must start to tackle the issue of youth unemployment.  The youth guarantee gives us the potential to start to tackle youth unemployment at least.  We are debating a Private Members' motion on the youth guarantee this week, but what Government officials and Deputies state about it does not give me any confidence.  The International Labour Organization and the National Youth Council of Ireland state approximately &euro;400 million to &euro;435 million is needed to properly fund the youth guarantee, but last year the Taoiseach returned from Paris speaking about a figure of &euro;200 million, two thirds of which will be financed by the European Union.  It will probably require approximately &euro;66 million in the next two years, but we have only budgeted for a figure of &euro;40 million this year.  I presume the strategy plan which will be published will address some of these issues and we await its publication.</p><p> It is important that we instill confidence in the domestic economy.  The only way we can do this is by putting money back in people's pockets and having spending power again.  Unfortunately, we cannot do this if we keep taxing people.  Next year we will have the property tax which will be due for a full year; we will have the introduction of water charges and are taking money from jobseekers under 25 years.  If these types of policy continue, we will not have the growth needed next year through the strategy plan to build and maintain the economic fortunes of the State.</p><p> Many people are hurting and it is very difficult to hear about some of the hardship being felt.  There is no monopoly in hearing about it on the Opposition benches.  I am sure every Government and Opposition Deputy week after week in his or her clinic hears about the hardship being experienced.  We must start instilling hope.  People come to my clinics who, unfortunately, are their wits end and suicidal.  I am sure it is the same in the Minister of State's clinic.  People come to my clinics who are working full time and trying to pay bills and find themselves accessing the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other charities.  For their sake, as well as that of the State, we must start to implement policies which not only will put money back in their pockets but also give them back a sense of hope and dignity because without these, what are we doing here?  What is the function of this Chamber if we are not here to protect and enhance the lives of the citizens we represent?</p><p> We await the publication of the strategy which will be a key policy document.  We will examine it when it is published and where there are parts to be welcomed, we will welcome them, but we also appeal to the Minister of State to take on board some of the propositions the Opposition has articulated in recent years.  The introduction of a wealth tax is not something the Government favours and we have been criticised for even suggesting it, but according to the Minister's own figures in replies to parliamentary questions, he estimates that if we were to introduce a wealth tax based on the criteria we put forward, it would raise approximately &euro;400 million, which would go a long way towards stimulating the domestic economy and easing some of the hardship and burden placed on the shoulders of citizens.  I appeal to the Minister of State to think outside the box and not dismiss every proposal coming from the Opposition as harebrained or fairy-tale economics.</p></speech>

All Deputies have received a flood of e-mails from people affected by legacy debt because a Private Members' motion on the issue will be brought before the House next week.  The volume of e-mails indicates a tremendous sense of people having been wronged and a palpable sense of anger that the issue has not been addressed.  We are exiting the programme and there is no mention of it.</p><p>  The story being told is that we are out of the trees and that other than having to deal with the public deficit, all future budgetary measures as part of the austerity programme will be aimed at tackling the need to pay for public services.  That is not accurate and misrepresents the position.  It overlooks entirely the reasons the austerity programme was introduced in the first place.  It is true there would be issues regarding the deficit in public spending in the context of any economic downturn, but this is something with which we have been dealing for the past 80 years, as have other democratic states.  What is not being talked about is the fact that not only as the economic downturn made greatly worse and partly caused by the type of speculators connected to Anglo Irish Bank but also that the debt of Anglo Irish Bank and other banks has added massively to the burden being imposed on the people of the State.</p><p>  It is dishonest in the extreme to claim, as some are doing, that the cuts being imposed and the extra taxes being raised from struggling households are necessary to pay for public services.</p><p>The fact is that the measures have been enormously magnified by the taking on and paying off of bank debts.  We will continue to strongly urge that no further repayments be made.  It will also be the case, as indicated by the troika, that the IMF will continue to exercise a role in monitoring and, to a large degree, framing the economic and financial policies of this and future Irish Governments.  This will certainly ensure that the ideology of privatisation and curtailment of public services and investment will continue.  In that context, I recall a promise to the effect that the Government was to create a new company involving a merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  I also recall a promise to the effect that &euro;1 billion in investment funding would be made available for this enterprise.  I suspect that the troika have let it be known that they are opposed to any such public entity and that what will now happen is that a report on the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na will be compiled.  I doubt the latter constitutes a major public investment programme in renewable energy.</p><p> Despite the spin surrounding the exit from the bailout, unless there is a clear change of direction on the part of the State all we can look forward to is more of the same.  We need investment, including public investment in indigenous sectors such as energy.  It is in such sectors that the potential to stimulate overall growth in the economy and create jobs exists.</p><p> My final point relates to democracy.  We are supposed to live in a democratic Republic.  If a referendum were put to the people tomorrow as to whether the Irish State should repay the outstanding promissory notes, I have no doubt whatsoever that the vast majority of people in this country would vote &quot;No&quot;.  In a democracy, the job of a elected politicians is to represent the views and interests of those who voted them into office.  The current Government is in place because it promised to do things differently from the previous lot.  However, it has not kept that promise.  It is arrogant to assume that the troika, the economic management council, EMC, and the Cabinet know better than the people of this Republic, particularly when it is the latter who are paying the costs relating to the choices made by those opposite.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach stated last week, the decision to exist the bailout without a precautionary credit line "is the right decision for Ireland and now is the right time to take this decision".  This decision has been made possible by the people, who have been obliged to endure one of the most periods in the country's economic history.  When the troika arrived, Ministers in the previous Government told the people that the attention of the EU and the IMF would be limited to measures to improve the liquidity of our banks.  The latter was, of course, total nonsense.  We were tied in to the bailout and that left us little room for manoeuvre.  When the Government entered office, there was a crisis in employment and some 7,000 people in the private sector were losing their jobs each month.  In addition, Ireland's international reputation was in tatters.</p><p>  I remind the main Opposition party across the floor that many of the controversial proposals we have been obliged to introduce, such as the property tax and water charges, were all elements of the four-year fiscal plan to which that party signed up when in government.  What the previous Administration's plan lacked was a credible growth and jobs strategy.  In the past three years we have been working to address the deficit in order to bring our public finances under control and establish the correct conditions for a clean exist from the bailout.  The economy has returned to growth and Ireland is one of the minority of eurozone countries to achieve two successive years of economic growth, which it did in 2011 and 2012.  Many organisations are predicting that growth next year will be even stronger than the 2% predicted by the Minister for Finance.  Jobs in the private sector are being created at a rate of 3,000 per month and international confidence has been restored.  The fact that our international reputation is now at an all-time high is no coincidence.  The Government has gone out and sold Ireland abroad, while at home it has continued with the task of getting the economy back on a sustainable footing and successfully meeting all of our obligations with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF.</p><p>  The views of the Opposition party leader who wants to tie the Irish people into another bailout programme are not shared by international experts or the markets.  Responding to the decision taken by the Government last week, Ms Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, stated that the Irish Government has a strong record of policy implementation and that this bodes well for Ireland's exit from the bailout.  The Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. Olli Rehn, stated that it was a good day for the country.  Ireland is the first country in the eurozone to exit its bailout programme.  The reality is that a rising tide raises all boats.  With the eurozone economy showing some signs of improvement, the Government's decision provides a much needed boost for the eurozone in general but for Portugal in particular as it reaches the end of its own programme.  It is worth remembering that the battle for a retrospective deal on the recapitalisation of our banks continues in Europe.  The fact that we are emerging successfully from our programme will enhance our reputation among our EU partners.  It will also enhance our bargaining power.</p><p>  I look forward to the verdict of the international ratings agencies.  If, as a result of last week's decision, Ireland's credit rating is upgraded to, for example, investment status, money will begin to flow back into the country from pension fund investors and others who are prevented from investing here at present.  The leader of the main Opposition party claimed last week that we should have an insurance policy in place in the context of the headwinds which may come to bear on us.  We already have an insurance policy in place.  We have this Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who has demonstrated a capacity to keep a right rein on our finances.  Unlike his predecessors, the Minister does not pursue reckless policies.  Within Europe there are strong preventive fiscal controls in place in the form of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The markets are relaxed about last week's decision in light of the transformation in our economy.  We have a strong buffer in place in the form of &euro;20 billion in cash reserves.  Our public finances are under control and economic sentiment here is at its highest point since 2007.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have seen evidence of how much our international reputation has improved during my travels abroad.  That reputation is at an all-time high.</p><p>  Now is the right time to exit the bailout.  I commend the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government whose efforts made last week's decision possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112000051#YY00600"><p>I am delighted to contribute to this debate.  I welcome the fact that Ireland will formally exit its bailout on 15 December next.  We have already exited it to a substantial degree in the context of the type of options we are taking.  I commend the Government and all those involved in the discussions in respect of this matter.</p><p>  What is the purpose of exiting the bailout?  One of the key aspects is that we will be able to borrow money on the international markets.  Before coming to the House, I had a quick look to see where Ireland stands in respect of those markets.  Our bond yields have continued to fall since we announced our intention to exit the bailout without a precautionary line of credit.  On the date on which we made our announcement, our yield for ten-year bonds stood at 3.56%.  That rate fell to 3.53% today.  This shows that the markets are comfortable with the decision the Government has made and are willing to support us by supporting funding.  Ireland will formally return to the markets in January or February.  People should not overlook the fact that we have borrowed consistently on the markets at reasonable rates of interest since 2012.</p><p>  A great deal has been made of the decision not to accept a precautionary credit line.  The key focus in this regard relates to three areas.  The first of these in the reform agenda, which must be maintained but in a way that is fair to people.  The second area is that which relates to growth and jobs.  The facts do not lie.  At present, in excess of 3,000 jobs net are being created each month.  Prior to our taking office in 2011, some 8,000 jobs net were being lost each month.</p><p>This is significant, especially as approximately 250,000 jobs were lost in the previous three years.  While growth is low, it is improving, and countries elsewhere in Europe, including our near neighbour the United Kingdom, and the United States are also experiencing economic growth.  The fundamental requirements for continuing this phase of generating employment and getting people off the live register are being met. </p><p> Banks are a key issue.  Significant progress has been made in the banking sector through restructuring and the measures taken to deal with Anglo Irish Bank.  One issue that remains to be addressed, however, is tracker mortgages, which account for 59% of the mortgage loan books of the three banks being funded by taxpayers, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  Tracker mortgages have a value of approximately &euro;46 billion.  Various analysts estimate that in 2012 they contributed approximately &euro;700 million to the losses of the three pillar banks, which is a significant amount.  Ireland has an unusually high rate of house ownership and tracker mortgages when compared to other European countries.  Tracker mortgages were offered at a time when banks were able to borrow on the EURIBOR and inter-bank markets at interest rates lower than the ECB rate.  This allowed them to manufacture a product charging 1% above ECB rates for mortgages.  However, they did so on the basis that the interest rates on the EURIBOR and inter-bank markets would continue to be below the ECB rate, which is no longer the case.  Traditionally, banks borrowed short-term funds from the European Central Bank and long-term funds on the inter-bank market.  The ECB is trying to progressively wean banks off ECB funding, which requires banks to turn to other sources of funding which cost more.  This has created an imbalance in the financing of tracker mortgages and resulted in banks losing money on them.</p><p> Banks across Europe will face a liquidity cliff risk as they switch from ECB funding to inter-bank funding.  They need to ensure they make sufficient profits from their mortgage book to cover the cost of borrowing, which is not the case with tracker mortgages.  One mechanism that should be considered, perhaps via a combination of the ECB, the ESM and long-term refinancing operations, would be to move the tracker mortgage loan books of the three main Irish banks into a special purpose vehicle financed through low-cost funding.  This would make a significant difference to the operations of Irish banks in terms of lending because a number of them have become highly risk-averse and are protecting their balance sheets.  While tracker mortgages are a specific feature of the Irish banking system, the issue must be addressed in a European context.  We need to come up with some form of financial engineering to deal with them.  </p><p> In a period of three years, we have been able to exit the bailout programme with our finances stabilised and the economy back in growth.  Employment is also growing, with approximately 3,000 jobs being created each month.  While the banking system has been reorganised, the issue of tracker mortgages must be addressed in a European context.  The funding model I have in mind would involve funding these mortgages at low cost with a view to rebalancing the balance sheets of the banks.  Any such model must not disadvantage tracker mortgage holders, as we must always be conscious of those who have borrowed from our banking institutions.</p><p> The Government will continue with its reform agenda, and I look forward to the economic strategy it will announce in December.  I have no doubt it will place considerable emphasis on growth and jobs.  As someone who was self-employed for many years, I like to be master of my own destiny.</p></speech>

While it is significant that Ireland is the first country to exit a programme, there is no cause for celebration, as many challenges lie ahead for the country and families.</p><p>  I am being generous in describing this as a debate, as debates normally involve an exchange of views and information.  The House was not given any information today.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, spoke about the Government's decision to exit the bailout without a precautionary credit line following &quot;a careful and thorough assessment of all available options, and various consultations&quot;.  The decision was, apparently, finely balanced, but we have been given no evidence in this regard, nor was any presentation made on the alternatives or their cost.  Some Deputies have been critical of the decision and argued that we will be signing up for a second bailout with more stringent conditions.  We have not seen any evidence to this effect.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform was not given a presentation on the options available to the Government.  If, to use the words of the Minister, the decision was &quot;finely balanced&quot; and the Government could easily have taken a different decision, the Oireachtas should have been consulted and the joint committee should at least have been involved to bring balance to the debate. </p><p>  While I do not doubt the Minister's word on this issue, either the Government is serious about D&aacute;il reform or it is not.  It frequently parades the idea of D&aacute;il reform.  This was a perfect opportunity to present the options available to the Government on exiting the bailout to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Even if the joint committee were involved retrospectively, as is still possible, it would still be preferable to having to wait for an inevitable leak from the German Parliament or State records on the matter.  </p><p>  We must also consider what will be the role of KfW Bank.</p><p>We have a serious problem, to which Deputy Kieran O'Donnell referred in his presentation on tracker mortgages.  Banks are not lending.  We had a two-night debate on the issue last week.  There is a programme for Government commitment to establish a strategic investment bank.  We have shown examples of and everybody on every side of the House has spoken about the difficulty in getting credit for SMEs.  The Taoiseach, to use the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan's phrase, &quot;mentioned&quot; the role of KfW bank as being a game changer last week - one will recall that old phrase that we have often heard from the other side of the House - but we do not know what they have done and what the bank's role will be.  I placed a series of parliamentary questions to the Minister and received the response this evening.  His response to the series of questions states:<blockquote>Officials of my Department have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance.  We have held a consultation with the German embassy in Dublin which helped pave the way for discussions with the German Ministry which were held in Berlin yesterday and further discussions will be held with KfW and other key stakeholders over the coming weeks both here and in Germany.</blockquote>That is all fine.  It is lovely that the German embassy knows more about the Government's plans for KfW than we do.  What will be the KfW initiative?  What will it mean?  Will it help to address the issues of bank balance sheets?  Will it allow for further lending?  Will it be specifically focused on SMEs or broader companies?  Will it have a role in personal lending?  Will it have a role in addressing the major challenge facing many SMEs which have fine and viable businesses and are good going concerns but which are being pulled down by property or legacy-related debt?  We do not know where the Government is going with this initiative, yet it is engaged in discussions with German embassy officials, as well as with the German Ministry of Finance.  In tabling a parliamentary question one receives that answer.  That is crucial.  We have economic growth and limited employment creation, but if companies are to ride the wave of growth, we need to address the banking problems, in particular for SMEs.  The Government seems to have given up on the idea of having a strategic investment bank.  The Minister's response tonight was quite vague.  This seems to be the vehicle the Government will use, yet we are as much in the dark about it as we were when the Taoiseach mentioned it seven days ago and there has been much talk about political reform here today.</p><p> Exiting the bailout programme will mean nothing for those who are unemployed.  There is job creation, but there are so many who have been parked - there is a debate ongoing in the House with private business on this issue - for the want of training places and opportunities.  Addressing the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, wearing his public sector reform hat, until such time as the Government states a Department of jobs is all about jobs and we do not have a situation where the issues of job creation and activation are shared in three Departments, the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Education and Skills and Social Protection, the way of doing government business in a silo will block opportunities which people will lose because there are three Departments involved.  If we are serious about job creation which the Government keeps stating is the next big project, the Government should create a real Department of jobs to drive it.  That is the way it will maximise opportunities and be able to state to people the economic growth and recovery about which we all are talking will mean something to them.  The way it is doing it, with three Ministers and three sets of officials squabbling over budgets, the person who is unemployed and wants to seek a path to employment is dealing potentially with three Departments.  That is not the way to do it.  That is not a crisis response for the 400,000 persons who are looking for employment in the economy.  In whatever economic plan that will be presented some time between now and Christmas, there is a need for whole-scale reform of the operation of that side of government because no job creation plan will work in the way they are operating it.</p><p> I have been listening all day to Government Deputies clapping themselves on the back and saying they are a great bunch of guys and gals for having done this.  They remind me of somebody who joins the marathon three quarters of the way through, manages to cross the finishing line and is getting his or her medal.  The T&aacute;naiste was congratulating Deputies last week for sticking with it.  The Labour Party, in particular, was elected on a programme of opposing every measure it has implemented in the past two and a half years.  Fine Gael at least stated there would be tough decisions, but the Taoiseach has forgotten the five point plan.</p></speech>

Before I came into the House, I was listening to the contributions of many Deputies.  I also looked back over some of the debates on the ECB-IMF deal when it was being negotiated in November-December 2010.  I read the contributions of some of the main Opposition spokespersons at the time in the Official Report.  What was said then and what has transpired are, at best, at variance.  It is timely that I record that I have more at stake as a citizen and parent in this country to see that the Government succeeds than I do as an Opposition Deputy to see that it fails.  My starting point is I hope the Government succeeds.  I hope its decision is the correct one.  Seeking a precautionary credit line would have been a prudent step, but that is a decision the Government made.  As Deputy Dara Calleary said, I would have liked to have seen the evidence on which the Government had based its decision not to opt for a precautionary credit line.  What were the conditions?  Were they too onerous?  Were the interest rates too high?  What was the downside in going for a precautionary credit line?</p></speech>

Three years on, as the Minister of State will be aware because he has access to the files, the Government had little choice but to accept the need for a bailout programme.  It did not give me much comfort - certainly I was not filled with pride - the day I had to vote for the EU-IMF-ECB bailout programme but at the same time, choices were limited and difficult decisions had to be made.</p><p>  In the context of the programme, let us be clear that the Government is claiming vindication.  I stand vilified on a programme that has been vindicated and the Government stands vindicated for a programme that it vilified.  That is the fact of the matter.  I do not expect great platitudes for the decisions made.  Let us be honest: we know the reasons we were in the programme.  Every political party in the House at the time had supported the expansionary policies that were being pursued, not only by Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments but also by the social partners and all other Members of the House.  Every campaign was fought on the need for increased public expenditure and reductions in taxation.  We will have to have that debate again on what we will do as a people because of the difficult decisions foisted on the people under the programme.  The programme has been vindicated but at a significant cost to society.  There are significant social pressures, of which the Minister of State will be aware.  There is massive dislocation in society.  There is significant stress among mortgage holders who are in negative equity and among those who have lost their jobs and young people to other parts of the world.  There is much work still to be done.  The programme has achieved one goal - it has stabilised the economy which was the critical issue in terms of the reason the bailout programme was essential in the first place.</p><p>  I looked at some of the debates.  I refer, for example, to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore's contribution on 15 December 2010 in which he stated:<blockquote>The Labour Party supports the programme's objectives of achieving fiscal and financial sector stability.  We have consistently argued over several years that Ireland faces a three-legged crisis - a banking crisis, a fiscal crisis and a jobs crisis.  We have supported the target of reducing the deficit in line with our obligations as a member of the eurozone.</blockquote>He went on to say:<blockquote>Our concerns about the deal are not with the objectives or the four key elements of the programme.  Our concerns are about the overall structure of the deal, the assumptions that underlie it and whether it will work, as well as with individual components within it.</blockquote>The reason I outline what the T&aacute;naiste said is there was much dishonest debate in this Chamber in 2010 and the issue must be revisited.  He continued:<blockquote>The test of this deal, therefore, is whether, over the period of the programme, it will result in a return of investor confidence to the point where money will be lent to Ireland at reasonable rates of interest and the banking system will be able to fund itself.</blockquote></p><p>The purpose of the programme was to put Ireland in intensive care, while we worked through the banking crisis, the jobs crisis and the inability of the sovereign to borrow on the bond markets.  By any independent assessment, the economy is now able to borrow on the bond markets.  It is in the market and bond yields are currently low, at 3.5% to 4%.</p><p> I would have preferred to have a precautionary credit line in place to strengthen our hand in the markets and I have yet to hear the reasons the Government did not consider one.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, will say it was not needed because there was sufficient confidence in us, but my concerns in this regard remain.  It would have been a straightforward insurance policy to put a precautionary credit line in place.  I do not know whether the conditions were onerous or the interest rates prohibitive, but I know one thing for sure - the eurozone economy is under huge stress.  Unemployment is a major problem for most eurozone countries; our competitiveness is still a big issue; we have a banking and financial crisis, as well as a currency crisis.  These issues have not yet been resolved.  While Ireland weathered the difficult storms of 2008 to 2012, we will face further storms in 2014 and should have put an insurance policy in place.  For the sake of the citizens of the country who have made considerable sacrifices and reluctantly embraced the programme because they believed it was the best option at the time, I hope the Government made the right decision in deciding otherwise.</p><p> Many of the Deputies who are now in government argued against entering the bail-out programme and urged us to default instead.  I do not think we should have defaulted.  I recognise we are now facing a huge burden, particularly in respect of the socialised banking debts that have been foisted on the people, but we can have that debate on another occasion in an historical context.  The cost of the guarantee, its implementation and the socialisation of banking debt onto the sovereign have had an impact, but I still need to know whether other options were available.  Commitments were made by certain Government Members while they were in opposition that they would address the issue of socialised banking debt.  That legacy issue has not been addressed and the Government is duty bound to address it because it sought a mandate based on dealing with the issue of legacy debt.  I earnestly hope it made the right decision.</p></speech>

I am more of an optimist than a pessimist.  I do not know what good will come from looking backwards.  Clearly, we have to make sure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, but a certain element in this country appears to be addicted to failure and does not want to recognise that the country has turned a corner such that we are beginning to see real improvements in our economic performance.  Whether that is done for party political advantage or to get certain commentators out of the hole they dug three years ago when they argued that the country should default is a question for another day.  However, we need to provoke ourselves to the understanding that, having gone through dreadful turmoil, the country is coming out the other end a better place.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister for Finance on the great judgment he has shown iin the last two and a half to three years.  The years of experience he gained in various political positions have made a huge contribution to the negotiations in which he and our officials have been engaged.  I also congratulate the public servants of the country.  The people do not know them because they are not on television, but I have seen close up, at many meetings in Brussels, Luxembourg and elsewhere, the extraordinary expertise displayed by the officials of the Department of Finance and the diplomatic community as they worked to get the country to a better place.</p><p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher spoke about our mandate to renegotiate the programme agreed by the previous Administration.  I am not going to spend my time arguing about the way in which we went about it, but history will show we have renegotiated the programme to ensure the country can exit from it.  Nobody owes this country a living.  We live or we die economically based on whether we can obtain funds from the international money markets.  Obtaining money at good rates is more important to the country than to any other eurozone member state because we depend hugely on our international reputation.  This is an open trading and highly deleveraged economy.  Unlike the Mediterranean economies, we do not have a big public sector.  We never had an industrial revolution.  This is a very nimble economy.  Financial services, pharmaceuticals and information technology are big.  All the elements that represent the global economy are in the economy of the Republic of Ireland.  Ireland is not like Greece or Portugal, which is why it is crucial that we extend our wings and fly independently of any programme or precautionary credit line.</p><p>  Opposition Deputies have posed a fair question in asking why we have chosen to exit the programme now.  All of the buying and selling that takes place in the sovereign debt market occurs in the first two quarters of the calendar year.  By May it is all done and dusted.  January and February are the months when countries go the sovereign debt market to sell their wares.  The NTMA and the Governor of the Central Bank have pointed out that people require absolute certainty on Ireland's position at that stage of the year.  If we were to apply for a precautionary credit line, I am sure the other governments would agree in principle, but unanimous agreement would be required from the 28 member states.  In some cases, the decision would have to go before countries' parliaments for approval.  A parliament might choose to delay the decision, seek additional clarification or introduce conditionality.  In these circumstances, the NTMA would be in the markets in January and February while the debate on the precautionary credit line was rumbling on.  We need certainty in circumstances where the authority mandated to borrow the money is already in the market.</p><p>  We would have required a precautionary credit line were it not for the fact that the State had amassed in excess of &euro;21 billion in cash reserves, which allow the interest rate on debt, particularly on ten year bonds, to fall to an historic low.  Last week Standard &amp;amp; Poor's stated the average cost of ten year money was 5% in the last decade.  The current cost is slightly over 3.5%, even though we are still in a programme.  My arguments are set out in a context of absolute certainty for the NTMA, the Governor of the Central Bank and the status of Ireland as we try to return to the markets.</p><p>  It is not just about the sovereign debt markets.  As an open trading economy that is highly deleveraged and much more privatised than many of the economies I mentioned, our big advantage is not only in terms of the sovereign but also in terms of the banks, semi-state companies and large public limited companies.  The markets do not distinguish between an Irish PLC and the Irish sovereign.  Diminishing risk in the sovereign diminishes the risk for PLCs, banks and all of the things that make the Irish economic engine work.  That is the essential point we are making.  We are well funded into 2015 based on the assumption that the State will be unable to raise any money next year.  Mr. Corrigan of the NTMA said at the weekend that his objective was to obtain &euro;7 billion next year.  As part of a programme, through the work of the NTMA, he has already obtained &euro;6.5 billion, albeit in short-term and long-term money.  This was the first allocation of ten year money we got away in the past three years.  This is not some kind of risky move as some would like to pretend.  This is a move based on where market sentiment lies for Ireland and the sovereign debt markets.  Thankfully, the British economy which matters more than anything else suggests a growth rate of 3% next year.  This will have a huge impact on the Irish economy because 10% of all jobs in the country are related directly to exports from Ireland and Britain.  Things are moving in the right direction.</p><p>  The Minister for Finance is correct that these are finely judged and balanced issues.  In the decision the Government has taken and its endorsement by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann we can point to a credible exit from the programme to the markets.  No one owes us a living and we live or die based on what we can afford to borrow.  If we cannot afford to borrow, the country has no future.  In the decisions we have taken we will be vindicated.</p></speech>

Having listened to the debate over the past two years, we must ask ourselves when it is a good time to make an exit from a programme like this.  The answer is when it is most advantageous to the economy and the people of this country, who made huge sacrifices albeit with the leadership of Government.  When major sacrifices of this nature are made, it is incumbent on the Government and management to ensure the decisions taken are correct for the country's economy and the people.  I am amazed there is so much negativity, so many counter questions and doubts being cast on every move.  I thought we should have some semblance of recognition that the country is progressing.  We had it from one or two Members.</p><p>  The national ship of this country was heading for the rocks before a strong wind and was in danger of destruction in 2010 when the decision was made to enter the programme because there were no other options.  Since that time, I have repeatedly heard from those in opposition about the multiplicity of options the Government had.  Where were they when the decision was entered into in the first place?  There were no options.</p><p>  I did a small calculation based on the number of occasions the Opposition, in the past two and half years, put forward proposals for greater expenditure.  It would have left this country with a further debt of &euro;40 billion.  It is time reality dawned on everyone in the House.  The Government is to be congratulated.  It has been tough this far and will not be any easier.  It was never intended to be easy.  Once we were in this situation, there were no easy ways out.  We are stuck with it.</p><p>  In any other country, the country coming out of a situation like this would have been a time for general agreement that we were going in the right direction.  Not so in this country.  We are beset with the problem of doing ourselves down.  This is part of our psyche and is something we must deal with.  It is becoming invasive and a dominant feature of this society and its debates.  There is no sense in people coming forward and suggesting that we will never get out of debt.  We are improving in a serious way.</p></speech>

I remember a Minister at the time saying the Government did not need the money being generated.  A senior Minister said the Government had so much money that it did not need it.  Deputy Billy Kelleher was inquiring about why people felt there was so much money around.  There were no options.  The Government has taken the right option, which is tentative but well-balanced and calculated.  It will have the desired benefit of stabilising the progress so far.</p><p>  It has been mentioned that there was no relief for the hard-pressed, which is true unfortunately.  Everyone in the country is hard-pressed.  Even someone as optimistic as Deputy Billy Kelleher, who was always optimistic in government, is suggesting the poor unfortunate people of the country will receive sudden overnight relief now that someone else has taken over when it took ten years to sink the economy to the depths it was in then.</p></speech>

The people accepted the option put forward by the then Government and made a wrong decision because they were given wrong information.  The information they were given at the time was wrong.  It has not been easy for the people.  It is to their eternal credit that they stuck with it.  They showed the rest of Europe they could do things that were not expected of them and in a short time.  They had the ability to resolve this country's problems with good leadership if given good leadership and shown a good example.</p><p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher mentioned Ministers squabbling in the course of the budget and in a recent debate.  That is a big change.  At least the Ministers were engaged and fighting for their Departments as they should be.  This is unlike what happened in the past, when Ministers opted out, did nothing, tore their hair, wrung their hands and beat their breasts and brows and did nothing.  They let the ship of State slide into the murky waters we found it in.</p><p>  I congratulate all concerned.  I congratulate the civil servants, members of the Opposition who have been encouraging and the Minister and even Deputy Billy Kelleher, who is looking for his social dividend.  It will come.  There have been great sacrifices and when it comes, I hope the people of the country will be able to enjoy the riches that will flow accruing from the leadership and their sacrifices.</p></speech>

The Government has orchestrated a major charade around the ending of the three-year troika programme, which meant that the Irish people were saddled with overwhelming levels of debt to rescue international bondholders and bankers from their reckless pursuit of exorbitant profits through speculation in the Irish property bubble during the first decade of the 21st century.  Two successive Governments in the State capitulated utterly to pressures from the European Central Bank, the European Union establishment and the International Monetary Fund to the effect that the gambling losses of private speculators should be heaped upon the shoulders of our people and a ruthless programme of austerity should be imposed to see through the execution of that decision.  Throughout the saga, the troika has acted not in the interests of Irish people or in the interests of the ordinary people of Europe but in the interests of European capitalism, the financial markets and the bankers and bondholders.  The troika has acted to salvage European capitalism from the chaos into which its own laws plunged it.  In so doing, it has savaged the livelihoods, incomes, public services and economic security of our people.</p><p> The conclusion of the three-year programme of bank bailouts and austerity has precipitated what we can only call an outbreak of duplicitous showmanship by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.  In a welter of spin, propaganda and stage gimmicks such as emergency Cabinet meetings and D&aacute;il debates, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have attempted to cast themselves as heroes in this issue.  They would have us believe that they orchestrated the great escape of 2013 and our intrepid leaders would have us think that the troika jailers had been slipped and we were now free men.  When we look a little closer, we find that our leaders have shackles on their ankles that lead to a gigantic millstone of debt belonging to private bankers and bondholders.  When we examine it even closer, we find the millstone is resting on the shoulders of the Irish people, who continue to groan beneath its weight.</p><p> Far from being the liberators, as the leaders of the Government would have us believe, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are only prison trustees.  They have connived in shackling the Irish people to decades of unsustainable debts and the sharks in the financial markets.  They have agreed that not only children yet unborn but the children of children yet unborn should be enslaved to the financial markets for debts that the Irish people have nothing to do with amounting to 120% of gross domestic product, the majority of which is odious debt.  The crushing burden of the debt can be seen and this year alone &euro;8.5 billion is being paid in interest, with &euro;9 billion to be paid for many future years.  It is an incredible burden on the people.</p><p> The choice before this State is not between relying on the sharks in the financial markets on the one hand or on the other depending on the wolves in the European establishment who represent the interests of the market as well; working people in Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal are victims of the dictatorship of the market in front of which so-called democratic leaders have based themselves continually.  We need to overthrow the financial market system, which is undemocratic, unelected and unaccountable, and we must bring the financial markets into public ownership and democratic control, with investment in the interest of the majority.  We should repudiate the odious debt and join hands across the borders with working class people everywhere for a democratic and socialist alternative to this system of crisis and suffering for our people.</p></speech>

We certainly should not have had policies of austerity that were followed by this and the previous Government and which arose because of that debt.  I have absolutely no confidence in this Government, particularly in any hope that it will give a fair crack of the whip to ordinary families, the poor and those on low or middle incomes across the State.  The suggestion we have recovered our sovereignty is of course nonsense.</p><p>  The real question is whether exiting the bailout - with or without a credit line - will make one bit of difference to hard-pressed families across the country.  We know the answer is &quot;no&quot;, as it will not provide one additional discretionary medical card to a sick child or adult, build one extra house for any of the 112,000 families on waiting lists around the country or give a single euro more to schemes such as CL&Aacute;R or RAPID that help disadvantaged and deprived areas across the country.  It will not restore the telephone allowance for elderly people who depend on personal alarms and it will not restore a single euro of the cuts to child benefit, despite the Labour Party giving absolute commitments not to touch it.  It will not even restore the very cynical and mean cut to the bereavement grant which came in the last budget.  It will not stop the unfair local property tax, which the current Taoiseach has in the past stated would be wrong, unfair and unjust.  It will not stop the water charges being introduced next year.</p><p>  Next year we will face another austerity budget with at least &euro;2 billion in increased taxes and cuts, and we know the current Government's policy will continue.  It is the same policy as that of the last Government, and we have had much of the pot calling the kettle black this evening.  The current and previous Government have been committed to a policy whereby ordinary people, including the poor and low and middle income families, will be made to pay for a recession they had absolutely no hand, act or part in creating.</p><p>  What will future policy look like?  The fiscal compact treaty will bring about more austerity and not less and a reduction of the debt to 60% of GDP will mean that over the next 20 years, there will be cuts in the budgets of anything from &euro;3 billion to &euro;4.5 billion each year.  The policy currently pursued by the Government means there is little or no growth, and expectations have been downgraded again as late as today.  Thousands of our young people will continue to leave these shores when they are pushed from the country by reducing the rate of jobseeker's allowance and ensuring they do not get a fair crack of the whip.  The elephant in the room is the debt and it is not ours so it should not be heaped on the backs of the Irish people.</p></speech>

When we think about prisons, people go into them and there is an idea that they are either about incarcerating for punishment or, alternatively, rehabilitation.  A person coming from prison might emerge in a crumpled suit or worn tracksuit carrying possessions in either a battered suitcase or a plastic bag.  In many cases they face homelessness and unemployment.  Some leave prison with a plan or a programme for recovery and entering society again, where they wish to play a role.  One must ask the question of which scenario is applicable to us as we emerge from this prison of the bailout.  Depending on one's perspective, our jailers - the troika - were either benevolent or malevolent.  Leaving jail is of course a positive act and leaving the bailout must be acknowledged as a positive development, although many of us might think we should not have been in that position in the first place.  It is rather ironic that those who brought the country into this scenario have not punished in any way whatever.</p><p>  Certain economists tell us the Government has had a steady hand on the country during the bailout programme and it took tough decisions.  I have no problem with tough decisions, provided they are fair and equitable, but the decisions taken certainly were not equitable, and they were tougher on certain sections of society.  It was very difficult to take the comments today from the European Commission's top official working on Ireland's bailout to the effect that the better-off sections in society had paid a heavier price, as that argument is not borne out by reality.  It is certainly not borne out in the world in which I live.</p></speech>

I am really appalled by the graphic image from the weekend of the wife of a discharged, bankrupt developer awarded &euro;9,000 a month, which is considered appropriate by a judge for monthly expenses.</p><p>That is at the taxpayer's expense, at a time when people are lucky to have &euro;90 in disposable income at the end of a week or a fortnight and we expect unemployed young people to live on &euro;100 a week.</p><p> The troika&rsquo;s loans facilitated the repayment of debt to banks and bondholders who had lent and borrowed unwisely.  The conclusion that must be drawn is that the wealth of the rich is protected at all costs.  It was very handy to have the troika to blame for the tough decisions, but at meetings with the troika it was very clear that the decisions had been made by the Government.  We have heard the metaphor &ldquo;turning the corner&rdquo;, but one could ask what we are turning into; there is a danger that it is a cul-de-sac, especially when one looks at the reality of the exit.  Everything hinges on the economy growing by 2.4%, but the extent of the debt is crippling.  I pay tribute to the Ballyhea Says No group.  The Technical Group will introduce a Private Members&rsquo; motion calling on the Government to lobby the ECB in order that the Central Bank will destroy the &euro;25 billion in sovereign bonds issued in lieu of the remaining promissory notes and also lobby to bring interest payments on bonds to an end and for all related debt to be cancelled.  What a difference that would make.  One could imagine the situation the country would be in.  The point is that we have more debt than we could realistically, let alone morally or ethically, be expected to repay.</p><p> In the docklands area of the Dublin Central constituency we have a massive reminder of the worst excesses of banking and development, namely, the carcase of the Anglo Irish Bank building, for which lots of suggestions have been made for it.  Some say it should be turned into a museum as a constant reminder of those excesses.  Another is that it be ploughed up and turned into an urban farm that could produce quality food for constituents in the area or that it could provide the site for the long-awaited primary school for the Sheriff Street-North Wall area.</p><p> People talk about positive signs, but what I see emerging is a rise in property prices and rents, an increase in homelessness and charges and a health service in crisis.  There is no doubt about this.  It is ironic that yesterday was the centenary of the founding of the Irish Citizen Army which was set up to look after the interests of working class people.  The Government has stated all our woes are over.  I would love to believe this.  I hope it is correct, but I do not think it is borne out in reality.  The Millward Brown opinion poll last week indicated that seven out of ten people thought there would be more tough budgets.  I hope they are wrong and that the three out of ten who think we are in a better place and that there will be better times ahead will prove to be correct.</p></speech>

Last week's decision by the Government was an historic one and marked the end not just of a programme but of a most difficult period for the people.  Three years ago our sovereignty was ceded by a Government that had squandered the most prosperous period in our history.  We had reached the point at which nobody would lend to the country because nobody believed in the competence and word of the Government.  Having spent 35 years of EU membership, on all sides of the House, building and developing our reputation in Europe and elsewhere, to lose it in a couple of years marks the biggest setback in our history as an independent state.  Arguably, the situation could have been worse.  As the Government of the day imploded and yet hung on to power during 2010, it was the duty of the public service to keep things afloat until a new Government was elected by the people.  That the public service succeeded in doing this is evidence of its commitment and resolve.</p><p>  Today, regaining our national credibility in so short a time is a testament to the will and endurance of the people.  Again, as I have said before, when we look back at this period from more optimistic times, we will be able to see more clearly the scale of our collective success in exiting the programme on schedule.  That is not to say for an instant that there are no difficult days and decisions ahead.  There are, but the existential threat to the very viability of the State that culminated in our entering the troika programme is well and truly behind us.</p><p>  There was nothing hasty or rushed about the decision taken by the Government last week.  It followed extensive consultations, led by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in recent months with all relevant parties.  It followed consideration of feedback across the Government and the responsible State agencies.  The decision has been welcomed by all our European partners.  I, for one, can say it is the decision to which we should have aspired.  The Government was elected on one overarching promise - to reclaim our national sovereignty in as speedy a fashion as possible.</p></speech>

Following on from it, as the democratic Government, we took a decision that we were as well positioned to exit the programme as we could possibly be in a year's time.  Our first action following the taking of the decision was to inform the people through the House of their directly elected representatives, but even that drew scorn from those who had caused our problems.</p><p>  The economic environment in which have we made this decision is good.  Our bond yields are low and have remained stable since the announcement last week.  The public finances are now under control.  Our targeted deficit for next year is 4.8% of GDP which will deliver a small primary surplus.  We have met every fiscal target required of us by the programme thus far.  As the Minister for Finance informed the House, we met in excess of 260 targets.</p><p>  The banking challenge is a pan-European one, but unlike others, our banks have already been significantly recapitalised to a higher level than that required by the European wide stress tests.  In addition, the Irish taxpayer will not be the first port of call for any future findings in the European stress tests for the Irish banks due next year.  The Irish banks have a number of options open to them if they need to raise capital in the future.  On that point the House might be aware - if those opposite were evenly marginally interested - that today both Allied Irish Banks and Permanent TSB successfully concluded significant funding transactions in the international debt markets, raising a combined total of &euro;1 billion of long-term funding.  Both transactions which were heavily oversubscribed represent another significant step forward in the rehabilitation of the Irish banking system.</p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath asked about the conditionality that would attach to a credit line.  The reality is that the Government decided, for of all the reasons set out, that there would be no application for a precautionary credit facility once we exited our programme.  In view of this, we did not get into the issue of what conditionality might arise.  I reiterate a point made by the Minister for Finance this morning, that applying for a precautionary credit line would not actually cover the risk should a wider problem emerge in the euro area.</p><p>  Both Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty sought clarification on aspects of outright monetary transactions, OMT.  In relation to OMT, it is important to be clear on one fundamental aspect, as the Minister for Finance outlined this morning.  The September 2012 press statement outlining the ECB governing council's decision to establish OMT outlined its technical features.  According to it, the purpose of OMT is: &quot;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&quot;.  It is, therefore, aimed at addressing systemic risks for the euro area as a whole and is not country specific in that regard.  Having a credit line does not of itself guarantee access to OMT.  The critical point about OMT is that its activation is a matter for the ECB acting with full independence.</p><p>On this basis the Government concluded that the time was right for a clean exit, and I am pleased that decision has been endorsed by our friends and allies across Europe and elsewhere.  It has been understandable over the past few years that we, as a people, have reflected on the catastrophe we have endured.  However, while not disregarding the challenges that still lie ahead, we must acknowledge that exiting the programme is a national achievement for which we should all take credit.  It has contributed further to our international standing.  Without gainsaying the real challenges that still lie ahead, we should, as a country, perhaps for the first time in a quite a while, be proud of what we have achieved and confident of our future.</p></speech>

The Standing Order dealing with motions requires that they be submitted four days before they are taken in this House.  The Government's motion was tabled three minutes before 5 p.m. yesterday.  Discretion was allowed to the Government to include the short-notice motion but discretion has not been given to the Opposition to amend it.  I tabled an amendment to the Government's motion at 2.15 p.m. today but it has been rejected.  Therefore, we cannot vote on it and we are being forced into either endorsing the Government's policy or opposing an exit from the programme.  We reject that choice.  Some of us will have to abstain from what is a charade.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.524" nospeaker="true" time="18:45:00" ><p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien on Tuesday, 19 November 2013:That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:notes that:

&mdash; our young people want to work and contribute but are starved of the opportunity of quality employment;

&mdash; 64,700 young people are officially unemployed;

&mdash; the unemployment rate for persons aged under 25 is almost 30%;

&mdash; since 2010, 105,000 young people have emigrated;

&mdash; under the Government the rate of overall emigration and net outward migration has increased;

&mdash; budget 2014 only provides an additional &euro;14 million for the youth guarantee scheme; and

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-11-20a.525" nospeaker="true" time="18:45:00" ><p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1: To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;notes that:

- the number of people in employment grew by 34,000 in the year ending June 2013, compared with a reduction of employment of more than 300,000 in the three year period ending March 2011;

- the rate of unemployment in Ireland has fallen to 13.2 per cent at the end of October 2013, down from a peak of over 15 per cent in early 2012;

- the number of people unemployed, seasonally adjusted, at the end of the second quarter of 2013 is 296,000, down 22,000 on the first quarter of 2012;

- the number of unemployed young people aged under 25, seasonally adjusted, has fallen to 60,000, a reduction of 20,000 since it peaked in 2009;

- the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment for young people has fallen to 28 per cent in recent months, down from a peak of over 31 per cent in early 2012;

- notwithstanding these positive developments, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment, remains a serious concern;

- the Government: - has prioritised actions to stimulate employment creation and reduce unemployment under the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work strategies; economic recovery and employment creation resulting from these policies will be the surest way to improve the unemployment situation, both overall and for young people;

 - prioritised youth unemployment as an issue to be addressed at European Union level, leading to agreement, under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, of a Council Recommendation for a Youth Guarantee; this recommendation calls on member states to guarantee each unemployed young person under the age of 25 a job, training or education opportunity within four months of registering as unemployed; and

 - is preparing a plan for the implementation of the Recommendation commencing in 2014; the plan will build on the existing large-scale provision of training, education and work experience places for unemployed young people, and will be transmitted to the European Commission by the end of 2013;- the cost of the existing provision for unemployed young people is substantial &ndash; estimated to have been at least &euro;170 million in 2012 &ndash; and expanded provision will be required; initial provisions totalling &euro;46 million have been made across several Government Departments in budget 2014;

- in this context, it is to be welcomed that Ireland is likely to receive supporting funding from the EU, under the Youth Employment Initiative and the European Social Fund, of approximately &euro;60 million in respect of each of the years 2014 and 2015; and

agrees that: - the continuing growth in employment and the reduction in unemployment are to be welcomed;

 - the Government should continue in its efforts to further increase employment and reduce unemployment, with a particular and urgent focus on youth unemployment;and - the implementation in Ireland of the Youth Guarantee, agreed under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers, should form a pivotal part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the challenge of youth unemployment.

We are not exiting anything and we were never bailed out in the first place.  The human reality of that is vicious, vindictive attacks on the least well off in our society, the old, the sick and, of course, the young, as this motion highlights.  It is sickening that this Government compounds the insult to young people.  It is unable to provide meaningful, well-paid employment for energetic, educated young people who desperately want to work and contribute to our society.  All this Government can do is kick them when they are down by cutting their social welfare in order to try to dragoon them into scam jobs in which they can be exploited by unscrupulous employers - or, with the Government's new Gateway project, by local authorities.  The aim is to create a pool of cheap labour that can be exploited.  Thus, the people who are the victims of this crisis become double victims, denied meaningful employment and then brutally exploited because of the conditions that the Government, the financial elites, the bankers and bondholders have created for them.  What puts the lie to the Government's claim that these measures are to activate young people, who apparently have no desire, according to the Government, to find meaningful work, is the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people are streaming out of the country.  If they need to be activated, how come they are showing the energy to leave the country?  Is it because they want to laze about and do nothing?</p><p>No, it is because they want work elsewhere that the Government is unable to provide for them here.  It sees young people as another group on which to unload the cost of the recession and it is using the atmosphere of recession to exploit young workers and to ratchet down pay and conditions for them.  It is an absolute disgrace and I hope that simmering agitation among young people through the We're Not Leaving campaign and the youth assembly will make the Government rue the day it picked on Ireland's young people.</p></speech>

They were elected on a platform of ensuring the least well off and ordinary families across the State would be protected.  They have reneged on that commitment and they are now targeting them for austerity while wealthy people get away scot free.  During the lifetime of the Government, approximately 18,000 young people have lost jobs, 30% are unemployed and more than 100,000 have left the country.  They are being targeted in a recession that they had no hand, act nor part in creating.  For instance, we all recall the high profile commitments given by the Labour Party about third level fees in the general election campaign, on which it has reneged.  The back to education schemes have been cut and this is seriously undermining the potential for young people to return to education.  Fees were introduced in budget 2014 for the first time for apprentices on block release while significant cuts were made to the jobseeker's allowance for those aged under 26.  This will force them out of the country to work in Canada, Australia and elsewhere.  They have shown that they are not lazy and they are willing to work but, unfortunately, they are being forced out of the country to work in other economies.</p></speech>

It is only right and proper that we focus our attention on this group.  Nationally, 30% of young people are unemployed but the percentage is higher in, for example, Donegal and Limerick, where it approaches 50%.  There is plenty of research to show that when people experience unemployment early in their lives, they are likely to experience it again later in life.  It is, therefore, an issue of major significance.</p><p>  The cuts in the jobseeker's allowance for those aged under 26 will impact on 20,853 people next year according to the National Youth Council.  That does not give us the full picture because many young people do not show up on the live register because their families marginally exceed the income threshold for welfare payments and they are simply not counted.  Only one in seven of them will be able to access the additional 3,250 training places offered by the Government and, therefore, the opportunities Ministers keep talking about will not be created for every young person.</p><p>  A fund of &euro;8 billion has been allocated Europe wide to fund the youth unemployment scheme and while that is welcome and the money that will be provided in Ireland is welcome, to put it in context, the Government will spend the same amount in one year just to service the national debt.  That is the amount being invested to tackle this unemployment crisis among young people.  The unemployment rate among this cohort throughout Europe averages 23% but that increases to 60% in Spain and Greece and 40% in Italy, Portugal and Slovakia.  It is a drop in the ocean for those to whom we pay lip service by saying they are our future.  If so, there needs to be greater investment in them.</p></speech>

The manner in which young people are being dealt with in this State does not show the Government has an eye to the future.  They are faced with unemployment, under employment and insecure employment.  If anything else, the crisis has been an opportunity for some people to undermine employment conditions that were built up over the years.  It is easier to hire and fire people and wages have been driven down.  There is a serious lack of opportunity for young people to work given the dramatic falls in consumption and investment.  It is unusual that youth unemployment has been so severe during this recession but austerity has a greater impact on young people than on those who are older, which is peculiar.</p><p>  Training schemes and apprenticeships are a good idea but they should not be used to drive down wages for others or to replace jobs with decent wages.  Given that all the young people who cannot get work are expected to pick up &euro;100 a week on social welfare or &euro;150 a week on the JobBridge scheme, their choice is emigration, if they are not in education or training, or poverty.  When the country recovers, this will leave a mark for a long time.  We will experience the effects of what the Government is doing to this generation in ten years' time.</p></speech>

However, we cannot forget about or lessen the impact on those in other age groups who find themselves without a job.  Unemployment does not discriminate on age grounds and it is equally difficult and challenging to any person who finds himself or herself in this dilemma.  The challenge for us as policymakers is to create the environment in which business can flourish and jobs will follow.  I know this because I have created jobs.  I have been in business through hard times but I have created jobs for 20 years.  It is straightforward but one needs to have the right environment to make it happen.  Strange as it may seem, during the false boom in Ireland when we were all essentially at full employment, it was a difficult place for employers such as myself and people will wonder why this was so.</p><p>Employees, particularly the younger ones, knew nothing else but full employment.  Many of them, especially those in the non-professional areas where we see the worst effects, took a relaxed view towards their career paths.  One could pick and choose a job, coming and going with relative ease.  Travelling the world for a period to find oneself became commonplace.  I lost employees to this which was a pity and disappointing when one considers the time and effort put in training them.  Job-hopping where people jumped from one employer to another for an extra euro an hour or some other false promise became the norm.  In the long run, it did no good for the employees or the businesses.  In short, bad practices were allowed to develop in the so-called good times which have become a challenge for us to rectify in the so-called bad times.  A former teacher of mine, the late Walter Cleary, used to tell us that when times are good, one should never allow people to get sloppy in time-keeping for work.  In short, one could pay them extra but one should never allow bad work practices develop.</p><p> As an employer, I have always viewed it as a positive sign if a company has long-standing staff.  It means the company has a wealth of experience and service, along with good consistent training given to newer recruits.  The significant turnover of staff during the boom years was very frustrating for me as an employer, especially as one needs experienced staff in complex work areas and who also help with training new recruits.</p><p> We need to distinguish between the positive aspects of available credit and the fall in work practices.  This has changed, although it has taken some time.  This is a great time for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, similar to mine, to build committed and loyal workforces.  Schemes such as JobsPlus and JobBridge, of which I will avail, are a huge plus to SMEs and to many of the young people involved.  It is hoped they will get permanent and long-term employment as a result.</p><p> Last year, the number of people in employment grew by 34,000.  It is a good start when one considers the economic meltdown before it.  Recognition of the problem of youth unemployment across the EU is welcome.  The youth employment initiative, with the commitment from the European Social Fund, is a positive development.  The whole issue, however, is down to job creation.</p><p> We are in the process of sorting out the banks and I recognise the work done in this area.  Many people in the banks get a terrible time and we need to recognise their work and commitment in sorting out the problem.  They are not the ones who created the problems in the first place.  The banks are lending again but forced lending so as to reach arbitrary targets is certainly not the road we want to take as it will lead to the same mistakes from the past a second time.</p><p> One cannot display one&rsquo;s talents by sitting inside four walls.  While the argument in this motion is that we are not paying enough to those under 26 who are unemployed, we need to get the message out that they need to be encouraged to get back into the workplace and training.  By doing so, they will get the opportunity to shine which will lead to full employment.</p></speech>

When one considers that in March 2011, there were 300,000 fewer people working than there in 2008, it is hard to comprehend the difficulty and misery that lies behind that number.  In a reducing jobs market, there will always be an oversupply of talented and experienced people to take the few available jobs that do come up, shutting off the job opportunities for new talented people entering the jobs market.  By 2009, there were 80,000 young people under 25 out of work.  Thankfully, this figure has now dropped to 60,000, a significant drop.  Behind that statistic, however, there lie 60,000 individual stories.</p><p>  The Government has focused sharply on reducing that stark number as quickly as possible to ensure these people&rsquo;s lives are not blighted by a lack of opportunity which resulted in an economic crash beyond their control.  At 38%, the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment among young people is still much too high.  This is why the Government must continue to stimulate employment creation and prioritise youth employment at European national and regional level.  One area the Government should examine further is offering the long-term unemployed the opportunity to upskill in areas where we know there are job opportunities waiting.  When one considers the cost of providing a third level grant to someone to stud software engineering or biotechnology versus the cost of providing unemployment assistance, one will see it would be money well spent.  I accept such courses would not suit all the unemployed.  However, if 5,000 young people were targeted for such upskilling, it would represent one in 12 of those under 25 who is unemployed.</p><p>  Research is needed into college dropout levels and the reasons behind such decisions.  Was the decision made for education, health or income reasons?  It is a tragedy young people have to drop out of college because their families cannot support them.  This is according to stories I hear weekly from distressed constituents.  Families whose only income is social welfare will qualify for the special rate of grant for third level courses.  The difficulties I have encountered in my clinics in County Galway relate to parents who may have one day of work per week which puts them over the income threshold for the special rate, putting college out of the reach of their adult children.</p><p>  It is only through rising employment levels across the economy, a development which I believe is under way, that youth unemployment can be reduced.  Far too many parents are waving goodbye to their children, fearful their grandchildren will grow up on faraway continents.  We must live up to the promise of the youth guarantee scheme and ensure those young unemployed people are offered real opportunities to progress into employment or continued education.</p></speech>

While youth unemployment is unacceptably high at 30%, it is starting to fall, a welcome development.  In the North of Ireland where Sinn F&eacute;in is in power, unemployment is rising with almost 24,000 young people out of work.  Up to 25,000 people emigrated from the North of Ireland in 2012.</p></speech>

Would Sinn F&eacute;in like the Government here to have a similar policy in the North of Ireland where young adults are paid only &pound;67 per week?  Would it implement that policy if it ever came into power here?</p><p>  When I had just qualified, I was unemployed for a while.  However, at the time, there was nothing for me such as schemes, work programmes or Pathways to Work.  Now, we have various schemes in place to assist young people find employment.  I compliment the Taoiseach on his work in prioritising the youth guarantee when Ireland held the EU Presidency.  It is important certain schemes are ring-fenced for people under 25 so they can get back into training programmes and can see light at the end of the tunnel.  I welcome the ring-fenced funding under the microfinance scheme for young entrepreneurs as they find it difficult to access credit from the mainstream lenders.</p><p> I would like to see the social welfare system adapt a little better to take account of those people who are in short-term work or have short-term contracts in order that they can get back into long-term employment as quickly as possible.  One fault with the social welfare system is that we do not receive information quickly enough on the schemes available.  I ask the Minister to make sure information on such schemes is made available as quickly as possible for young people in order that they know what is available for them.</p></speech>

We must acknowledge that we have a very significant unemployment problem in comparison to most northern European countries and North America.  In the past few months unemployment and youth unemployment, in particular, have been falling.  One issue on which the House should engage more is that of migration within the European Union.  To date, we have had a rather simplistic dialogue between the Government and the Opposition about the 2 million job vacancies in Europe.  Around ten years ago we in Ireland were actively looking at importing people to work here.  The key worry for parents and young people about leaving the country to work abroad is the sense that they will not be able to return at some point in the future.  We need to focus on the European labour market in more joined-up terms with respect to pension mobility in order that when people leave Ireland to work, they can return and pick up benefits, which is largely not the case.  There is also a need for greater harmonisation of skill sets and qualifications across a broad range of areas.</p><p>  I accept that the youth guarantee is a good measure, but, ultimately, employment is fed by growth which is a macroeconomic factor.  Until the European Central Bank's functions like those of the Federal Reserve in the United States which have an absolute link with unemployment in America, as opposed to monetary policy only which is largely the remit of the Central Bank, we will be playing catch-up.  We had representatives of the Commission at the Joint Committee on European Affairs today and the committee was the first among all EU member states to meet them to discuss how social policy would be integrated within a European monetary policy.  That is a step towards focusing on unemployment as a key economic indicator, as is done in the United States of America.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that the Government is making every effort with the jobs initiative which was one of the points in our five point plan before the last general election.  All of our young people need the Government to deliver the opportunity that many of them deserve and for which they are longing.  I am talking about those young people who are talented, skilled, well educated and enthusiastic.  Many of the issues that affect young people, particularly health related issues, including mental health issues, addiction and even anti-social behaviour, can originate from a sense of hopelessness and even the boredom that often sets in.  As has been said before, the figures remain far too high.</p><p>  During our very successful Presidency of the European Union I was particularly pleased when the Taoiseach prioritised and committed to youth job creation.  Within a very short time the country is on the up and investing in our youth will deliver tenfold.  A job, just like education, should not just be an ambition but also an entitlement.  In her opening remarks the Minister indicated that there was evidence of a significant decrease in youth unemployment, even within the past two years.  This should be recognised, particularly when we consider what we inherited just two and a half years ago.  We were left a broken economy, with only five months of money left in the kitty.  One can only imagine what would have happened if we had continued on the same pathway set out for us by Fianna F&aacute;il - again, not even one of its Members is present for this debate - and the consequences that would have had for the youth of the country, as well as for pensioners, widows and widowers, those who were unemployed and children's allowance payments.  We have made considerable progress in such a short space of time.  A young person who has a job is in a much better and a much healthier position to deal with the pressures we face in modern day society in Ireland.  </p><p>  I congratulate the Minister on the progress made in a short space of time.  I wish her well in the remaining term of this D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

While I accept that there are still far too many young people out of work in Ireland, it is clear that we are heading in the right direction in reducing the numbers on the live register.  Employment grew last year by 34,000 and, on average, 3,000 jobs are now being created a month.  That is clear evidence that progress is being made.  I have listened to Sinn F&eacute;in and others in the Opposition repeatedly ridicule the effectiveness of employment activation schemes such as  JobBridge.  This is very disappointing because we should be trying to encourage young people who are out of work to engage in schemes such as these.</p><p>  Earlier this year, as part of the Government's Momentum initiative, the WebActivate programme was launched in County Monaghan.  I was genuinely delighted by the huge level of interest expressed locally by young people in taking part.  It is an excellent programme which lasts for eight months and, when completed, jobseekers will be skilled in web publishing and digital marketing and have other web-based skills.  I know that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, met those taking part in the programme when she visited County Monaghan earlier this year.  I know that the scheme works because I was speaking to a young man only yesterday who had gained employment as a result of the initiative.</p><p>  In the area of labour activation I would like to see steps being taken to incentivise employers to take on young people in an apprenticeship role.  There are still young people who do not want to go on to further education when they complete the leaving certificate examination and the danger is that they will enter a cycle of relying on social welfare which can be very difficult to escape.  If young people could be allowed to retain a payment for their first year in work under an apprenticeship scheme and thereafter State support could be reduced incrementally, this would help to encourage young people to take up employment and avail of training, which would help to foster a work ethic.  It is good for a young person's mental health to get out to work and learn new skills.  Under such a system, local employers would liaise with local schools and identify either early school leavers or those who<b></b>would not progress to third level education and provide opportunities through an apprenticeship programme in order that they could be supported before they became unemployed.  While I welcome the JobsPlus scheme as an incentive for employers, we need a scheme specifically targeted to make it attractive for businesses to take on young people at risk of falling into the NEETs category; not in employment, not in education and not in training.  There are some very bright young people who do not want to progress to third level education and it is important that they be supported.  This idea was brought to me by a very progressive and successful local businessman in Cootehill, Mr. John Foy, who employs 50 people in his supermarket and is also the chairman of RGDATA.  That is what we need.  We need joined-up thinking with business people to create a range of job and training opportunities for young people.</p><p>I welcome the progress that is being made in the area of youth unemployment.  I commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton on the good work she is doing on labour activation and I ask her to take on board my points regarding an incentivised scheme specifically to support businesses to employ young people who are at risk at an early age of becoming long-term unemployed.</p></speech>

While internationally we are probably experiencing a city-led recovery, places in the outermost regions such as Donegal will not be on the same path time-wise.  Bright, educated and skilled people from Donegal are working all over the world but many would like to be working at home.  How does one instill confidence that the future is bright in the bright, young teenagers in secondary schools in Donegal?</p><p>  In the realistic corner the statistics are stark.  We have the third highest number on the live register, behind Dublin and Cork.  Average income is the lowest in the country.  However, most of the new and emerging jobs in the IT sector can locate to remote regions as long as there is good broadband.  If this is the case, why does nearly 70% of new industry locate in places where there is a critical mass of existing industry, such as Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin?  Many will argue that research and development needs to be located near universities.  However, the north west has a university in Derry and a third-level institution in Letterkenny which turns out very well-educated and skilled graduates.</p><p>  Others will argue that one needs broadband.  Of course one does.  However, in the north west we have Project Kelvin, an extensive submarine and terrestrial cable deployment which directly connects the north west to North America and serves local and global companies.  Where is the problem?  Access is a barrier, but a CEO of a New York company who arrives in Dublin at 7 a.m. tomorrow can get a connecting flight to Donegal at 9.15 a.m. and be there in less than an hour.  The A5 is a challenge.  While it is important to note the Government's commitment of &pound;25 million this year and &pound;25 million next year, there must be a renewed concentration of effort in Northern Ireland to get the shovel-ready project on the way.</p><p>  New industry sectors such as software and ICT solutions can locate in remote areas such as Donegal.  The broadband box is ticked in the north west.  We have the human resources.  We have a conveyer belt of skilled workers developing new skills all over the world, some of whom would like to move back to Donegal.  We have success stories with existing industries such as Primerica, United Healthcare and Zeus in Letterkenny punching way above their weight and surviving very well.  There must be an extensive critique of IDA policy.  Where are potential investors taken and what story are they being told?  Is there a commitment to the regions?</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Sinn F&eacute;in as an t-&aacute;bhar seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair anocht.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this and commend Sinn F&eacute;in on putting this very worthwhile topic before us for debate.  We can never afford to lose track of this and take our eye off the ball so I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing it back into focus.  This is a chance for us to put on record our different views and challenge ourselves on what we are doing about this issue.</p><p>  Some 5.6 million young people in the 28 EU countries are unemployed as of September this year.  That is more than one in five young people across the EU and as high as one in two in countries such as Spain and Greece.  That is a tragedy by any standards and something about which none of us can afford become complacent.  Earlier in the debate austerity was mentioned several times.  Austerity is blamed for all our problems, and youth unemployment is no different.  Germany has one of the lowest youth unemployment rates in the EU at 7.8% and there is no more austere country and no greater supporter of posterity.  The youth unemployment rate increase is almost 50% higher at 57% and Greece is one of the least austere countries, it certainly was in the last decade.  We may have to review our attitude that austerity is to blame for all of this.</p><p>  It is not a government's place to create jobs.  One of the difficulties this economy had was struggling to cope with a bloated public service and all the jobs that were created by Government but could not be sustained by the Irish economy during the last decade.  It is a government's job to create an environment that leads to the creation of sustainable and real jobs.  For every 10,000 people who leave the live register there is a saving of &euro;90 million to the Exchequer.</p><p>  I welcome the range of initiatives this Government has created.  I completely reject the criticism levelled at schemes such as JobBridge.  JobBridge offers people a choice between going to work and gaining experience for &euro;50 extra per week or remaining on the dole.  Those who challenge it falsely argue that it is a choice between a real job and JobBridge, but that is not the case.  The other criticism is displacement, but JobBridge is merely a work placement that lasts no more than nine months so one cannot say they are filling in and preventing a real job.  Gateway is another worthy initiative.</p></speech>

Fine Gael's 2011 manifesto read:<blockquote>Since the recession took hold three years ago, 300,000 jobs in Ireland &ndash; 14% of the total &ndash; have been wiped out...As a result of the jobs crisis, the ESRI forecast an additional 100,000 emigrants in the next two years &ndash; a higher rate of emigration than occurred even during the depths of the recession in the 1980s.</blockquote>The major party in government was highlighting that at the time but, unfortunately, since this Government has come to power the percentage of unemployed has dropped 0.9% with a further 266,000 leaving the State.  In my county, Laois, unemployment has increased to 8,828 since the Government came to power.  Unfortunately, 1,510 of those are under 25.  In Kildare 17,425 people are unemployed with a staggering 2,753 aged under 25.  A previous speaker mentioned the effects on mental health and I concur that unemployment is having a major effect.  Emigration, far from slowing down, has peaked at 89,000 this year from April to April, having increased from 69,000 in 2010.  This evening we had a briefing from Ciaran Staunton on the plight of the illegal Irish in the United States.  That shows how people are affected by this.</p><p>  JobBridge has yielded 312 internships in three years in County Laois but for the majority of those it has not led to jobs.  Unfortunately, it has led to some displacement.  The evidence is clear.  That political direction is not working.  Some Ministers may claim that people are choosing emigration as a lifestyle but that is not the case.  Less than 40% of those leaving say they are leaving as a lifestyle choice.  Behind each person who leaves there is a huge family story and personal story.</p><p> Despite all the talk, the Government is not providing help for young people.  I meet many of these young people.  They come in and out of our clinics looking for work experience and begging for jobs.  They do not want to be at home sitting in front of flat-screen televisions.  It is unfortunate that not only are young people caught in this trap, but that social welfare payments for young men and women under 26 were cut to &euro;100 per week in the budget.  This has had a huge effect economically, psychologically and every way for young people caught in this trap.  The clear message that went out is that if young people are not happy with that, they can leave.  It seems to many people that this cut is simply a means of squeezing out another cohort of young people.  This is unfortunate because these are the young people we need to train and get into employment.</p><p> The budget only provided an extra &euro;14 million for the youth guarantee.  That is not nearly enough.  At best, it will provide only 3,250 new labour activation places for those under 25.  The National Youth Council has said that a youth guarantee would cost &euro;400 million.  Therefore, the  Government has allocated less than 4% of what is required.  The Government is not adequately focused on providing jobs for young people and that is the reason the youth guarantee is underfunded.</p><p> Youth employment must be made a key priority.  I appeal to the Government to make it a central plank of its action plan to get young people into employment.  Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Government to leave aside the spin and the hype and to try to provide a proper youth guarantee scheme.  That will require it to commit up to &euro;400 million, as recommended by the National Youth Council and the International Labour Organization.  We advocate a wealth tax and for some of that tax to be ring-fenced for a youth guarantee scheme that would ensure that young people receive an offer of gainful employment or training within four months of becoming unemployed.</p><p> I urge the Government to think again about the cut to jobseeker's allowance for those under 26.  It is an outrage.  Another Member classed it as discrimination.  I agree.  It is discrimination against these young men and women.</p></speech>

As many of our relatives returned to make their lives here again, we believed that emigration would become a thing of the past and be banished to the realm of folk memory - to stories of uncles, sisters and cousins going to Boston or Birmingham and of tough times in the 80s.  We believed that at least we would never see times like that again.  We brought our young people up to expect more than we did - jobs, prosperity and a higher standard of living.  We promised them the world, but how tragically wrong we were.  They were let down and were betrayed.  Every town and village has been hit by emigration.</p><p>  Since the Government came to power, 266,000 people have left the State.  It could be suggested that many of these are immigrants returning to their countries, but the number of such people does not come anywhere near the total number leaving.  Irish nationals accounted for 50,900, 57.2%, of all emigrants.  We are talking about levels of emigration that we have not seen since Famine times.  It is young people, more than anyone, who are emigrating, and that is the reason we put forward this motion.</p><p>  Of the 89,000 emigrants this year, some 34,800 were between 15 and 24 and 41,000 were between 25 and 44.  These account for approximately 70% of emigrants. These are shocking and worrying statistics, but I do not believe they truly tell the full story.  The Government may argue that some of those are people who want to travel and see the world.  That may be true, and travel can be a marvellous thing, but let us not fool ourselves.  In the case of the majority of those 89,000 we are talking about young people who had not intended to leave.  These people may have spent a year or two on the dole, hunting fruitlessly for jobs or doing a handful of hours a week in menial jobs that could not provide anything near the level of income required to pay rent.</p><p>  It is not only those who leave who are hurt by emigration.  Communities are decimated, particularly in the west.  It is very tough on parents to look at the empty space at the dinner table when they imagined it would never again come to this.  My son returned recently from Australia.  I am delighted to have him home, but he has not yet managed to find employment and I do not know what he is going to do.  People left for various reasons, but for many of them it was as simple as this: they felt there was nothing here for them.  We seem to have a Government that refuses to persuade them otherwise.  It has no comprehensive youth unemployment strategy and seems to be of the view that the situation will resolve itself in good time and that if people have to leave, well, so be it.  This is an appalling and complacent attitude that we will bitterly regret in years to come.</p><p>  The Government will parade its youth guarantee, but in truth it is woefully inadequate.  The budget only provided an additional &euro;14 million for the youth guarantee.  At best this will only provide 3,250 new labour activation places for the under 25s.  The ILO has stated that a proper youth guarantee would cost us &euro;347 million, excluding administrative costs.  The National Youth Council has stated it would cost &euro;400 million.  We are a very long way from that.  Apart from the youth guarantee, the Government's youth unemployment policy is simply to point to JobBridge, which is effectively forcing many young people to work for free, displacing real jobs and devaluing work.</p><p>  Young people, many of whom are very qualified and capable, can end up on a merry-go-round of training courses and internships without any of these leading to high-quality employment.  In fact, there is no joined-up thinking.  These are only some of the many ways the Government's employment policies have indirectly affected young people.  There has been a complete demolition of the community sector and a huge reduction in the number of CE schemes.  These were areas in which, in times of difficulty and in areas where jobs were scarce, young people could do real, meaningful work and be paid for it.</p><p>  The changes to the state pension age were deeply unjust to the elderly and particularly hard on those who do heavy physical work.  They also have implications for young people, because jobs are being displaced as older people stay in the workforce longer.  There is a need for action.  Not so long ago, one of the State's assets was a young population and workforce.  That is changing rapidly.  This has implications not only for the economy but for us as a society and for these young people and their families.  If we do not take action now, I am genuinely concerned about what the country will be like in decades to come.</p></speech>

The social consequences of the number of young people leaving rural Ireland are having a desperate and devastating effect, not just on themselves and their immediate families but on grandparents and communities as a whole.  Young people living in rural Ireland face unsurmountable obstacles, and that is the reason they are leaving in droves.  They see no possibility of work.  The traditional employment in the construction sector is gone and no longer exists in rural Ireland.  People who work at home on a small farm can no longer supplement their incomes by working in the construction sector.  That is a thing of the past.</p><p>  People of my age who watched the tide of emigration in the 1980s and previously in the 1960s hoped they would never see the like again.  However, the Skype generation is now with us and broken-hearted grandparents all over the country only get to see their children's children on a computer screen.  I meet these people all the time in my area and every time I look at my grandchildren - I have ten of them - I feel so grateful and lucky that they are here with us.  Others are not so lucky.  </p><p>  The figures indicate that almost 65,000 young people are unemployed, but more than 260,000 young people have left the country.  Employment in the period since the Government took office has fallen by 18,000.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in the course of justifying the cutting of the allowances for people under 25 who are not working, suggested that they needed that incentive to take up work or training.  That is a disgraceful statement.  It is disgraceful to suggest that cutting the allowance and removing that money from the local economy is an incentive for people to find work.</p><p>How can one find work when it is not there?  The only way young people can find work is to get on a boat or aeroplane and get out of the country.</p></speech>

Young people are crying out for training or anything which will improve their chances of employment.  A youth guarantee scheme must be adequately funded and must take into account the added difficulties faced by young people living in the countryside or small towns throughout the State.  Young people in rural Ireland have problems accessing education and suitable training courses.  Cuts have been made to rural transport and it is not easy or cheap to travel to centres of education.  In most rural areas in Ireland there is no public transport.  Those who want to attend these centres must travel to the largest town in the county which in itself presents a problem.</p><p>  No pressure should be put on young people to train for something in which they have no interest or for which they do not have the aptitude, but they are being forced to do so.  The ambitions and choices of young people should also be taken into account, but there is a sense that one must accept an offer or one's benefits will be cut.  This is wrong and people should not be penalised because of the inadequacies of the Government to provide proper jobs for young people.</p><p>  If the aim of a Government is to prepare a young person for a career there is no point in cutting unemployment assistance if people discover the course they have been compelled to attend does not suit them or they are not able for it.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes spending &euro;400 million on a youth guarantee.  This is cheap at the price.  It would mean real investment in our young people whose value to the country is priceless and whose departure from these shores to expend their energies, intelligence, skills and talents in other nations is a crying shame.  It is an indictment not only of this Government but also of previous Governments.  The Minister and the Government are at the helm now and it is up to them to ensure they provide proper funding so young people can be trained on a course for which they are able and which is suitable for them, they have good jobs to go to and they are not forced out of the country by cuts to unemployment assistance.  It is an absolute disgrace.</p></speech>

This is in the face of mass unemployment and mass emigration, and all the contrary evidence which presents daily in all our respective constituencies, no doubt including the Minister's.  The European Commission, in which this person is a most senior official, has forced the austerity agenda on people across the EU, with devastating consequences for economies and societies from Greece to Ireland to Portugal to Spain and several other locations.</p><p>  What is worse is that our subservient Government has been more than content to obey the austerity diktats of the troika and, indeed, to go beyond them, by imposing hardship on the old and the young, the sick and the vulnerable, those on the margins and those struggling to survive with inflated mortgage debt and the rising cost of living.  The Government has doggedly refused to make the very wealthy pay their fair share of tax.  It claims this would be a tax on work.  In fact Government Deputies know it would be a tax on excess, greed and the lifestyles still enjoyed by a privileged minority in the State, those the European Commission's top man here claims have been hit hardest by austerity.</p><p>  In reality we know all too well it is the least well off in Irish society and those on low to middle incomes who have been hit hardest by austerity.  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion focuses on one of the hardest hit sectors, our young people.  EUROSTAT population figures released today show the State has the highest level of emigration in the EU.  With net migration at minus 7.6 per 1,000 of population we are ahead of Lithuania, Estonia and Greece in the league table for outward migration from the State.  We have the shocking rate of 30% unemployment for people under 35, and this does not include those on training schemes.  This is a huge indictment of the failure of austerity, but an even greater indictment is the figure of 105,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 who have emigrated since 2011.  The figure for those aged between 25 to 44 who have emigrated since 2011 is 112,000.  In other words, 217,000 people between the ages of 15 and 44 have emigrated over these two years.</p><p>  As a Deputy representing Cavan and Monaghan in a constituency made up entirely of small towns, villages and vast rural areas I know intimately the devastation being caused to our communities by the outflow of our young people.  The lifeblood is literally being drained from communities throughout the length and breadth of this country.  The Government is clapping itself on the back for the so-called exit from the bailout but it prefers to ignore the exit sign over the door as our young people leave our country in droves every week.</p><p>  There is clearly a concerted effort on the part of the Government to stem the tide of emigration and tackle mass unemployment among young people.  The mentality behind the slashing of jobseeker's allowance for people under 25 says it all about the regard the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government has for our young people.  Like many Governments before it, as far as it is concerned the more that leave the better because it means less dole and less rent supplement to be paid out and lower demand on health and education services.  The Government parties will deny this vehemently, but their protests will carry no weight.  The facts speak for themselves.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach tr&aacute;th&uacute;il go bhfuil an pl&eacute; seo againn anocht sa D&aacute;il agus ar&eacute;ir.  Gan a bheith ag iarraidh a bheith ag sc&oacute;r&aacute;il point&iacute; ar an Rialtas, s&iacute;lim go dt&eacute;ann an cheist seo thar na p&aacute;irtithe polaiti&uacute;la agus thar na pobail ar fad, mar n&iacute;l pobal ar bith sa t&iacute;r nach bhfuil buailte le daoine &oacute;ga a bh&iacute; orthu an t&iacute;r a thr&eacute;igint agus at&aacute; imithe thar s&aacute;ile.

Over the past two days the small amount of funding being made available for the youth guarantee has been discussed.  It will not make any substantial impact on the crisis we have with regard to emigration and youth unemployment, which stands at almost 30%.</p><p> Deputy McLellan pleaded with the Government to do something in respect of this matter and asked a very pertinent question as to the type of country with which we will be left if we do not deal with this crisis.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the number of young people who have emigrated.  In total, some 250,000 people emigrated in the past four years.  These individuals were of the view that, for one reason or another, better opportunities were to be had in greener pastures outside our borders.  It is important, particularly in the context of our earlier debate on the exit from the troika programme, to ask the very important question as to who we are and what type of nation we have created.  The public can never see them because they are for our eyes only, but all around the walls of the Chamber are busts of the patriots of 1916 and other bygone times.  When I look at them, I sometimes ask myself about the nature of our country.  Is this a country which is rearing its children for export?  Is it a country of which we can be proud, particularly now that we have cut social welfare payments for young people in order to encourage them to get out of their homes and to stop watching their flat screen TVs?  Is this a country of which we can be proud or has it ignored its young people and allowed 250,000 of its citizens, the majority of whom are young, to emigrate in recent years?  Is this a country that is proud of the fact that over 29% of its young people are unemployed?  The answer in this regard is no.</p><p> We can hide behind the troika, the financial crisis, the banking collapse, the economy etc. but if we want to take action, we can do so.  What is missing is commitment on the part of the Government.  Before I entered the Chamber I received an e-mail from my constituency office asking how to reply to a heartbreaking letter sent to me by a mother in Donegal who is concerned about her 25 year old daughter.  The latter has a degree, she was involved in and enjoyed the JobBridge programme but she cannot obtain employment.  She applies for jobs each week and visits the F&Aacute;S website regularly and looks at the same advertisements over and over again.  The girl in question volunteers in her community and helps out local farmers because she does not want to be idle.  Her only sibling has already emigrated and her mother is asking whether there is any light at the end of the tunnel for our very neglected county.  Her mother also wants to know if we can give her any hope that things will get better in order that she might convince her daughter not to emigrate.  This woman and others like her are waiting for such hope.  Far too many mothers and fathers have been put into the position whereby millions of pixels dancing on a computer screen have replaced the embrace of their sons and daughters who have fallen on hard times in, for example, Perth in Australia.  These people have been obliged to see their newborn grandchildren or their first cries or laughter via Skype.</p><p> We can take action, even within the confines of austerity, in respect of this issue.  However, what is needed is for real focus to be placed on it.</p></speech>

Austerity rules, Minister.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh the National Youth Council, SpunOut, the Union of Students in Ireland and the Mandate trade union to this debate on the youth guarantee.</p><p>  I attended events in London and New York in recent weeks which attracted large numbers of the diaspora.  I met many young people who were forced to emigrate as a result of the disastrous policies of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government and those of the current Fine Gael-Labour Administration.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour are our own little indigenous troika.  These young people do not want to be away from their families and they did not want to leave their friends and communities behind ach n&iacute; raibh aon obair ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh sa bhaile.  Many rightly believe, this is also my view, that the Government like its predecessors is using forced emigration as a safety valve as a matter of policy.</p><p>  The average level of youth unemployment in Europe is 23.5%.  Here it is 28%.  This means there are 64,700 young people in this country who are officially unemployed.  Many of them live in my constituency in Louth.  The youth guarantee scheme is supposed to help tackle this problem and offer all young people up to the age of 25 continued education, apprenticeships, traineeships or jobs within four months of leaving formal education or being unemployed.  However, it does not guarantee jobs.  This highlights the major disconnect that exists.  Jobs are a consequence of economic growth.  If there is no growth, there will be no new jobs.  All the apprenticeships and training schemes in the world will not create jobs.  As my colleagues have already noted, in the budget introduced last month the Government took almost one third of jobseeker's allowance from young people under the age of 25.  The T&aacute;naiste claimed that this is not really cutting benefits.  It was also stated that what is being done is necessary in order to encourage young people into employment.  A leaked document from the Department of Social Protection has warned that the Government cannot keep to its own commitments in respect of the youth guarantee scheme.  Perhaps the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, will respond in respect of this matter when he makes his contribution.</p><p>  The International Labour Organisation has estimated that a decent youth guarantee scheme such as that implemented in Sweden costs approximately &euro;6,600 per participant.  It also stated that &euro;435 million would be needed to provide such a scheme in this State.  To date, the Government has only committed to spending &euro;14 million or a miserly &euro;260 on each young citizen.  Following the Paris summit, the Taoiseach referred to &euro;200 million being provided by Europe.  However, no information has been forthcoming on this money.  It was also said that the State would be obliged to find one third of this &euro;200 million.  From where will the Government produce the &euro;60 million in matching funding that is required?</p><p>  The fact is that 300,000 citizens - mainly young people - have been forced to emigrate during the past four years.  There are now 18,000 fewer young people in paid employment today than was the case when the Government entered office.  There is a crisis in respect of youth unemployment and the Government must implement a real and viable job creation strategy connected to a practical apprenticeship, education and training programme.  The amendment to the motion tabled by the Government will not facilitate this.  Why will the Government not support Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to provide an adequately funded youth guarantee scheme?  Why will it not sign up to make youth employment a key priority?  The Government pretends that there is no problem and that its strategy is working.  Young people tell a different story.  They know they come from the best small country in the world to get out of.  The damage their leaving will do to their communities, society and their families will be with us for generations.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's motion proposes a practical and fair alternative to the Government's policy.  It is not austerity and we are proud of that fact.  Our alternative offers a just, fair and practical way to fund a real youth guarantee scheme.  I urge Deputies to support it.</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, described in great detail the scarring effects that unemployment can have on young people, resonating throughout their lives.  The only way to avoid those scars and to ensure that young people have access meaningful opportunities is to get the economy growing again and to generate real jobs.  That is exactly what the Government is doing.  In the three years before this Government took office, employment was falling by 100,000 per annum.  During the past year, that trend has been reversed and approximately 3,000 jobs are now being created each month.  We expect employment to continue growing at that rate into next year.  That is the general trend, but there has also been some stabilisation of the levels of youth employment since the Government took office.  The number of young people in jobs fell by close to 190,000 in the three years before the Government took office.  I accept that it fell even further, by approximately 18,000, in 2012.</p><p>Youth employment has stabilised in the past year and appears set to start growing as the economic recovery continues.  The youth unemployment rate has fallen from 31% in early 2012 to 28% in the first half of this year and continues to fall, albeit not quickly enough. </p><p> I propose to make some points on the role of education because it is important to have an informed debate about an issue as serious as the future of our young people.  I acknowledge, however, as everyone does, that more must be done and in that regard, I share the concerns of Sinn F&eacute;in.  In the past two and a half years we have begun the work of completely reshaping the interactions between unemployed persons and the State.  When people became unemployed in the past, they went to an office which assessed the level of financial support they should be given, without reference to what they would do with the rest of their lives or how they would re-enter the labour market.  There was a complete disconnect between unemployment and returning to the labour market.  We are slowly unrolling the Intreo service.  While we would like to do so quickly, this is not possible.  Under this system, if a young or middle aged person loses his or her job, he or she will be asked to state his or her family circumstances which will determine the financial support to be provided.  However, unlike previously in dole offices, persons in these circumstances will also be asked what they propose to do with the rest of their lives.  They may have a qualification for which there is no longer a demand, in which case they will be asked what they propose to do about the issue and how Intreo can help.  They will be asked to take up employment, seek work experience or training.  We are trying to develop a Scandinavian social market model.  </p><p> The live register is not a static set of figures but an extraordinarily vibrant indicator of the large number of people churning through employment and unemployment.  We must reach a point at which we provide a degree of security in order that people do not fall through the floor into abject poverty.  If someone loses his or job, for whatever reason, and presents to claim the social support to which he or she is entitled, having paid into a social welfare system, he or she will also be asked what new qualifications, training or experience he or she will accept.  Where people indicate they are not interested in an offer, there must be consequences.  Jobs are available in new areas.  For example, the current global shortfall in teachers is 16 million and there are 5 million vacancies for people with information and communications technology skills in the European Union.  There is a gap between the jobs that need to be filled and the skills available.  We are trying to match skills to jobs.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an-chuid d&oacute;ibh d&iacute;fhostaithe le tr&eacute;imhse fhada.</p><p>  Far from guaranteeing the youth of Ireland anything meaningful, the approach of the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government that preceded it has been to punish, demonise, demoralise and discriminate against young people who are unemployed and do not have access to employment because jobs are not available.  In budget 2010 the previous Government cut dole payments for those aged under 25 years.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted against the measure, arguing strongly at the time, with Sinn F&eacute;in, that the cuts did nothing to address the shortage of jobs, as there were not nearly enough places available in education and training, and that they would simply drive more young people to emigrate.  That was the response of the current Government parties to a measure introduced in budget 2010.  The very same parties have recently introduced further cuts to the dole for young jobseekers.  These cuts still do nothing to address the shortage of jobs, as there are still not nearly enough places in education and training.  On the contrary, they will exacerbate the problem of emigration among young peoplewho will, as previous speakers highlighted, move to far-flung places. </p><p>  The social welfare cuts are wrong and should be reversed on the basis that they amount to blatant discrimination against young people.  I believe they are contrary to the Equal Status Acts and would be interested if someone were to take a case against the Government, specifically on the basis of discrimination against young people.  This is not a balancing act, as the Minister would have us believe, between service support and income support.  The cut to jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance amounts to approximately &euro;32 million which will be taken directly from the pockets of poor young adults.  Deputies should remember that these payments are means tested and one must be poor to qualify for them.  The Department has confirmed to me that the only additionality in terms of activation provision for young people is the small and laughably inadequate &euro;14 million allocated to the youth guarantee in the budget.  The International Labour Organization has estimated that a decent youth guarantee, similar to that implemented in Sweden, would cost approximately &euro;6,600 per participant.  Approximately 65,000 young people are unemployed, which means that the &euro;14 million allocated by the Government amounts to only &euro;215 per person.  Even if one adds to this figure the funds available from the European Union under the youth guarantee, it still falls far short of the &euro;6,600 per person the ILO estimates is required for a meaningful youth guarantee.</p><p>  Income supports for young unemployed people have been targeted for cuts across the board.  These cuts affect young people and their families.  Not only is &euro;32 million being cut from jobseeker's allowance payments and supplementary welfare allowance payments which supposedly acts as a safety net, but the Government has also made cuts to apprenticeships and for people in training.  The contribution charge for periods spent in institutes of technology by F&Aacute;S apprentices will no longer be covered, costing apprentices more than &euro;1,000.  Training allowances for participants in F&Aacute;S and Youthreach schemes have been abolished, alongside the &euro;20 top-up paid to the long-term unemployed who take up training.  Young people will be hit by these further hidden cuts which have not been covered extensively in the media. </p><p>  Pathways to Work is the ultimate misnomer.  With 35 jobseekers for every advertised vacancy, the big elephant in the room is the question, &quot;Pathways to what work?&quot;  The Government has been relying on emigration and under-resourced activation schemes to shrink the live register figures.</p><p> Cuts to CE scheme funding have seriously undermined the training that can be delivered by those schemes.  Gateway and T&uacute;s, which involve compulsion and are not based around formal training, move us further down the dark road to workfare.  Gateway participants will be doing work that local authority full-time employees should be doing and would be doing had this Government and the previous one not continuously cut the numbers in local authorities.</p><p> Much has been made by Government Deputies here today about the current activation and training schemes, and the Minister, Deputy Burton, has heard me speak on this issue previously.  Let me set the record straight, because the Minister fails to set it straight when she speaks about JobBridge.  Of the &euro;14 million the Minister has allocated to the youth guarantee, &euro;7.5 million will be additional funding for JobBridge.  JobBridge, in its current form, has no place in any youth guarantee, if it is to be genuine.  It is &euro;7.5 million to provide more free labour to companies.  Where is the contribution of those companies?</p><p> In recent times I have noted that whenever the Minister speaks about JobBridge, she prefaces it with the words &quot;the very successful&quot;.  At what is it successful?  It is successful at providing the Government with cover for its abject failure to provide real jobs, providing employers - including those making high profits - with a supply of free labour, displacing paid employment opportunities and depressing wages.</p><p> The youth guarantee agreed at EU level in July 2013 commits to the Minister and others to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive an offer of good-quality employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  The youth guarantee should be about real employment, high-quality training and education.  JobBridge, in its current form, is not that.  Forecourt assistants, waitresses, housekeeping, car valeting, food operatives and telesales assistants are the sort of positions advertised on the JobBridge website.  It does not take 40 hours a week for nine, or even 18, months to learn to clean a car, change a bed, carry plates or flip a burger.  All of these jobs are relatively quick to learn and they include hard work, for which people should be paid and for which employers are willing to pay.</p></speech>

Why create a job and pay an employee when one can get someone for nothing from the Department of Social Protection and let the people pay the expense of providing work for one's company?  Since the Government took up office, there are 18,000 fewer young people employed in the economy.  Over roughly the same period, there have been 22,000 JobBridge internships.</p><p>  The influence of JobBridge on pay rates across the economy should not be underestimated.  JobBridge introduces a new minimum wage of &euro;3.75 an hour - &euro;100 dole plus a &euro;50 top-up.  The Minister has been fond of quoting, to me and other Deputies, the Indecon report.  I went back over the report and found I had missed some of the quotes in it.  The Minister might be interested in some of the figures.  She failed to mention that the Indecon report states: &quot;Average hourly earnings among JobBridge participants who have secured employment following their placements, are presently equivalent to around 56% of the average level of hourly earnings across the economy as a whole.&quot;  They are not getting the top jobs.  They are not getting the top rates, and yet these are persons who have skills, who have qualifications and who, often, have experience, even before they have taken up the internships.  Most JobBridge participants have both qualifications and experience.</p><p>  Here is another Indecon figure the Minister has not highlighted in the media.  Some 29% of host companies, when surveyed, stated that in the absence of the JobBridge scheme they would have offered paid employment to interns.  According to the report, &quot;6.5% of hosts stated that they would have been highly likely to have offered paid employment to JobBridge interns in the absence of the scheme, while 22.5% indicated that they would have been fairly likely.&quot;  This is proof that the Minister is providing free labour - maybe her party's name could be changed to that.  This is merely the level of displacement to which the Minister admits.</p><p>  The Government has also used the JobBridge scheme to provide labour in different Departments of State and also in local authorities.  As the Minister has given me the figures lately, she should not shake her head.  These provide free labour to Departments with no prospect of any job.  Any type of internship should hold the prospect of a job at the end of it.  In case the Minister has not noticed or has not read up on the notes she was given when she joined the Cabinet, there is a public service embargo.  The Minister has done nothing to lift that, and yet these people are expected to work for nothing for the Department at a cost to themselves.  The Minister is shameful in her protection of JobBridge.</p><p>  The Government applauds itself repeatedly for reversing the &euro;1 cut to the minimum wage that was implemented by Fianna F&aacute;il, and I applauded her at the time.  However, the Government's ultimate legacy will be the transformation of this country into a minimum-wage economy in which insecurity and poverty wages will be rife, an economy in which one will be expected to work the probationary period of nine months in any new job one seeks for free.  The long-term negative impact of the Government's approach to worker's basic rights and wages for our young people will be lasting and significant.  They should not be underestimated or ignored.  Neither should the hundreds of thousands who have emigrated, many of whom are young people who will probably never return to our shores to take up employment and who have lost homes in the economy.  These are persons in whom the State has invested.  We, as an economy, should be bearing the fruits of that investment rather than allowing some other economy abroad to benefit from it.</p><p>  Earlier, one of the Members stated that he found it strange that my party should be encouraging people to take up jobs, internships or activation.  I have no hesitation in encouraging any young person to take up a job or a place on an activation or training scheme, but I have a major problem encouraging anyone to take up a place on a scheme that advocates free labour for companies that are making millions of euro.  There are multinationals that are benefiting from this.  It is a shame, given that so much Government funding is being invested in schemes such as JobBridge, that the Minister will not even publish the list of companies that are benefiting from our investment.  She also will not publish the list of 32 companies that are blacklisted, those that have been found by the Department to have abused the system.</p><p>  Shame on the Minister and the Government for not delivering properly for young people who are unemployed.  Shame on her for forcing young people to emigrate.  I wish the Minister, even at this late stage, would rethink the Government amendment to my party's motion and support the motion, which is a logical step for anybody who believes that he or she is on the left to take, to support young people who are unemployed.</p></speech>
