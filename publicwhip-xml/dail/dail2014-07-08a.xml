I am not at this time in a position to give a precise publication date.  The report contains much detailed technical data concerning small schools in the primary sector and also a suite of recommendations and options.  The Government needs time to properly consider the report and its recommendations.</p></speech>

He is a man who has made an immense political contribution in what has been a long and distinguished career.  Looking back over the past 30 or 40 years, he is one of the figures in Irish politics who have stood out.  I know that he has some time left in this Parliament and have no doubt that once he retires at the end of this D&aacute;il, he will continue to contribute to public life.  On my own behalf and that of my party, I send him good wishes.</p><p>  I do not believe the response given by the Minister of State is acceptable in any way.  We have been listening to this for over a year and a half.  Perhaps the Minister of State might tell me whether he believes it is acceptable that it should take this long to consider a report.  While the Minister, his Department and the Government have been sitting on the report, small schools across the country have been subject to significant cuts in teacher numbers and the funding they receive.  It is unacceptable that we continue to see this approach and such measures taken that many believe are contained in the value for money review without the Government being up-front and honest and publishing the report in order that we can have a proper debate on it and ensure assurances can be given to schools on what the future holds.</p></speech>

One must examine issues such as the diversity of provision in an area, the ethos of schools, parental choice, the language of instruction, distances pupils must travel and the provision and costs of school transport, the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type and the costs of running small primary schools.  It is not something one would rush into given the important nature of educational provision.  The Government seeks to ensure proper and due diligence is done on public policy and educational policy.</p></speech>

The Minister is sitting on a report commissioned to assess how small schools are working and what future policy should be in this area but he will not publish it in order that there can be a full debate.  Instead, the Minister of State said the Minister is continuing to consider issues relating to the report long after it was put together and these considerations were made.  This is unacceptable.  This is happening at the same time as measures are being taken to put the same schools under massive pressure.  The Minister is moving on and will be replaced but the report has still not been published.</p><p>  Representatives of the Dublin archdiocese appeared before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection last week and they indicated that 10% of their schools are unsure whether they will continue to operate over the next two to three years.  That is the scenario facing them.  It is not acceptable that the Minister of State should dillydally around considering reports while that scenario pertains in our primary schools.</p></speech>

I understand that this followed the amalgamation of the former Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire vocational educational committees and the merger of the former F&Aacute;S services, which led to a review of the provision of its adult education services.</p></reply>

Nobody doubts Balbriggan is in dire need of additional training places and these VTOS places will be welcomed by the community.  However, it does not make sense to take them from a community such as Tallaght.  The Minister of State knows Tallaght as well as any other Member and he will be aware of the educational disadvantage in the community.  Training places play a vital role in helping individuals.  It is not good enough to transfer places from a community that badly needs them - if anything, it probably needs more - to another community that is also in need.  We need clear criteria and a clear, accountable process, which can be examined openly and transparently in order that people can find out exactly on what basis this decision was made.  Nobody knows why places were moved from an area in which they are badly needed to another area under the auspices of the ETB.</p></speech>

Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB has sanction for 150 VTOS places to distribute as best it can across its region of responsibility.</p><p>Very early in its life, the new ETB carried out a review that found that while Tallaght had 120 places, Balbriggan, a rapidly growing area with almost equally high unemployment, had only 20.  The ETB, taking account of the movement of the former F&Aacute;S training centre in Tallaght, decided to move those 20 places from Tallaght to Balbriggan, leaving Tallaght with 100 and Balbriggan with 40.  This involved the closure of St. Dominic's VTOS centre, which had 40 places, and its remaining 20 places were transferred to Tallaght town centre.  As I said earlier, the Department has no function or responsibility for the allocation of places within the ETBs, each of which is completely autonomous and independent.  Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB made the decision and we must and should respect it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800005#C00200"><p>I understand that the ETBs have full control over where they allocate the places.  The Minister has outlined to some degree the rationale behind the decision.  Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB has 150 VTOS places because that is the number it can afford to fund.  It is unacceptable that the Minister has taken 20 places from a community such as Tallaght, which has major disadvantage, high rates of school dropouts and unemployment, and transferred them to another community.  Balbriggan's need is as great as that of Tallaght.  Additional funding is needed to provide additional VTOS places.  It is unfair and incorrect to rob Peter to pay Paul.  We are taking from one community in need and giving to another.  It is all down to funding and resources.  While I have no issue with the fact that the ETB must work with the resources it has, we need additional resources to provide additional places.</p></speech>

As our country's economic recovery gets under way we will, hopefully, have those additional resources and be able to pass them on to our ETB structure across the country.  For the moment, within the resources available to us and to Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB, we must trust the ETB and respect its autonomy and independence in making this decision.  The ETB very carefully considered the need for VTOS places across its whole region of responsibility and determined that leaving Tallaght with 100 places and Balbriggan with 40 was the fairest and most effective outcome given the resources available.</p></speech>

While the National Council for Special Education has produced a review regarding the allocation of resources, the unions, particularly the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, have indicated grave concern and said that without reversing the previous cuts of 15% in resource posts and the moratorium on posts of responsibility, even the positive elements included in this may not be able adequately to provide for special needs and protect the integrated education model, which is important for all primary school children.</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800005#C00600"><p>I fully recognise the importance of the integrated model of education to which the Deputy referred, and I do not accept the assertion that this model is under threat.  The Government's focus in recent years has been on operating a budgetary programme that is designed to restore our finances to a sustainable basis.  Although education has been better sheltered than other sectors, it cannot be completely exempt from the budgetary programme.  The Government's approach has helped Ireland to return to a position in which we are seeing some economic growth.  A continuing improvement in our economic growth will enable us to move to a point at which we can again consider providing for additional teacher resources in schools, which could bring about an improvement in pupil-teacher ratio, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p><p>  The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system.  By 2017 we will have approximately 75,000 more young people in our system.  We are also working hard to continue to preserve the integrated model of education, which we value very much and which has been at the heart of Irish education for a number of years.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800006#D00100"><p>I do not know if it is a circle which can be squared to say on the one hand that we had no choice but to make these cuts and on the other that we will protect the integrated model of education.  Let us be clear that the integrated model of education is of critical importance for vulnerable students, including students with special needs, Travellers, and primary schoolchildren with language needs, as well as for the whole education system.  The 15% cuts in resource teachers and the removal of language support teachers and support teachers for Traveller children have created serious pressure, added to which is the fact that 10,000 extra children are going into primary school every year.  It poses very serious questions about whether that model can in fact be protected.  Indeed, it would be useful if the Minister of State could provide a guarantee that there will be no further education cuts affecting the primary school sector and special needs supports in the coming budget.  NERI said recently that these education cuts, particularly in primary education, were the most damaging socially and as regards the long-term economic future of our country.  Can we get assurances in that regard?</p></speech>

This is in response to the demographic growth to which the Deputy referred and the increased demand despite the ongoing and severe financial position.  There will be more than 11,000 resource teaching and learning support posts available to schools for the 2014-2015 school year which is the highest number of posts that has ever been made available.  The number of resource teaching posts to the NCSE for allocation to schools has increased from 5,745 last year to 6,225 next year.  I ask the Deputy to bear in mind also that the number of SNAs within our schools at the end of the year will be the highest ever.  We spend just over &euro;1.3 billion per annum on special needs education within the Department, which is greater than the whole budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our police force.  We are working hard and as best we can within difficult economic circumstances to protect and nurture the integrated model of education to which the Deputy refers.</p></speech>

There is no more important example of that than in the area of education, particularly primary education.  Providing the necessary resources for primary school children, particularly those who are vulnerable is vital for them and for the long-term economic future of the country.  If one cuts off one's nose now, one will spite one's face in the future.  We have the second-largest class sizes in Europe and have had substantial cuts in this area.  I have not heard from the Minister of State an assurance that there will not be further cuts that will affect the primary school sector and special needs in the future budget.  If the Minister of State could even provide commitments on that level, it would assure teachers and parents who are anxious about the detrimental impact of these sorts of cuts.</p></speech>

By the end of this year, we will have the highest number of SNAs ever employed in place in our schools to support children with special needs.</p></speech>

We have done that in light of the harsh winds of recession and will continue to do it.  It has been a priority of the Government and, in particular, of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, since he first assumed office to protect that investment and to protect those children within our school system.

Expenditure of almost &euro;3.88 billion is running just &euro;24 million, or 0.6%, behind profile, with &euro;7 million on current expenditure and &euro;17 million on capital.  The Department continues to closely monitor the financial position with a view to ensuring that expenditure remains within the allocation for the year.  This Government has sought to protect education spending and maintain front-line education services as far as possible.  However, levels of educational expenditure cannot be determined in a manner that ignores the economic reality.  Consequently, there is no scope to reverse the decision taken in budget 2012 to reduce the level of capitation payable.  Within the Department's overall multi-annual capital allocation, over &euro;28 million was issued to primary schools last November for the school year 2013-14 under the minor works grant scheme, while more than &euro;70 million in total has been allocated to the 2014 summer works scheme to allow more than 770 schools nationwide to undertake improvement works.  Funding for future minor works and summer works schemes is subject to funding.</p></speech>

Funding for schools is not just for election years; it must take place on a continuous basis.  The Government has had three budgets and for the first two there was no summer works scheme, no minor works grant and cuts to capitation.  In the run-up to the local elections, money was given out, which was welcome because of the pressure schools are under.  However, there is no commitment to funding in future years.  Despite the many times I pressed the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, there is no commitment to ensuring it is provided next year or the year after.  Meanwhile, many of our schools are under massive pressure and we know the Government is under pressure in regard to finances.  By withdrawing these funds from schools, the Department is transferring the pressure to fill the gap in school funding back to the hard-pressed families with young children.  It is the sector of our society that is most pressed financially.  We should look to protect them, not increase the burden on them and on our schools.</p></speech>

In a perfect world, we would have the perfect pot of money to allow us to do everything we could within the education sphere to ensure the amount of voluntary contributions made by parents through charitable donations and fundraising was lessened considerably.  There is a macroeconomic picture, however, and we must reduce the deficit to 3% by a certain year.  Fianna F&aacute;il subscribes to that philosophy and that means the education silo has a finite pot of money.  To govern is to choose, and we must make choices about where to allocate funding.  With regard to the comment about electioneering, Deputy McConalogue's party is a dab hand at making announcements prior to elections.  Let us take the cynicism out of it and say that we have tried to ensure we put money into schools through the minor works scheme and the summer works scheme where it is necessary.  Some schools missed out because of the prioritisation process, but they are not being cut out of the pot.  Hopefully, these schools will go in the pot for next year, and it is the intention, if we are &euro;500 million ahead of profile in terms of overall taxation receipts, that it will reflect positively on the education budget.  This will allow us to fund projects such as those outlined in the question.</p></speech>

Because the Government made the choice not to pay these moneys in the past two years, we can triple the number of schools that need summer works scheme money this year and we can triple the amount primary schools need because of the money they lost out on for two years in regard to the minor works grant.  Evidence from the Catholic Primary Schools Managers Association, CPSMA, shows that in the past year half of schools were spending more than they were taking in and that some of them are in severe debt.</p><p>  I pointed out earlier that at an Oireachtas committee this week, the Archdiocese of Dublin indicated that its calculations and assessments of the schools under its remit show that up to 10% of them are in a situation where they will not be able to continue as a school two years from now.  This is a serious situation, largely brought about by the policies the Government has introduced.  I know there are difficulties, but the Government has made the choice to put the burden on schools, which are putting it back on parents who cannot afford it.  The Government needs to change that direction.  With a new Minister for Education and Skills, we need to see prioritisation given to ensuring these grants are paid next year.  Will the Minister of State confirm that will be a top priority for the Government in the upcoming budget?</p></speech>

However, we have been able to maintain the capital budget and we have a five-year programme where we are replacing prefabs and building new schools.  Therefore, in spite of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, we have been able to build out and replace the prefabs that have been in existence since the height of the boom.  Therefore, there is no doubting the Government's commitment to trying to ensure funding is put in place for necessary work.</p><p>  We have not yet started the proper discussions around budget 2015.  Therefore, it would be premature to give an absolute commitment at this stage.  However, if we had committed funding for this year, 2014, and if the economic profile is getting better, one would be hopeful.  That is all one can say.  If the Deputy was standing where I am standing, this is what he would be saying.  We would hope to be in a position to try to ensure that schools funding for the necessary repairs and minor works will be provided, but we cannot say that for certain until we have got through the negotiations on budget 2015.</p></speech>

This consisted of a personalised package of guidance, training,  educational and enterprise supports which were delivered to the eligible workers concerned during an implementation period from March 2009 to October  2011.  Measures included tuition costs of the ALBA degree in All Hallows which, normally being a part-time programme, was delivered on a tailored full-time basis to accommodate the specific  requirements of these workers  given the finite timeframe for EGF co-funded support.  When this funding ceased, the Department provided a grant as a once-off measure to this cohort of students to complete their studies.</p><p> The Department allocates funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to approved higher education institutes and the internal disbursement is a matter for the governing bodies.

All but one of the students who took part in the programme has gone on to employment or further education.  He is also aware that All Hallows is involved in a consultation period currently, mostly concerned with restructuring of the college and possibly its closure.  I understand the college has guaranteed at least one more academic year and hopes to wind down by 2017.</p><p> In view of the success of the ALBA programme, which is now being wound up, is any dialogue involving the Department, All Hallows and DCU going to take place in order to save it?  As the Minister of State outlined, the programme is geared towards people who have in some cases been out of formal education for up to 30 years.  The success of the programme is evident.  I wonder if it is planned to enter dialogue in the interests of replicating the programme or allowing it to continue, either in DCU or in some other institution.</p></speech>

However, the Department provides grants in lieu of tuition fee funding to the college in respect of three approved undergraduate courses.  This funding  amounted to over &euro;430,000 for the 2013-2014 academic year in respect of the 119 eligible students who attended courses for the full year.  The ALBA programme referred to by the Deputy is a part-time course and is, therefore, not an approved course for free fees funding.  A decision was made to provide specific funding - initially under the EGF and subsequently by means of the grant scheme - to certain students, namely, former employees of SR Technics who undertook the course on a full-time basis.  When the EGF funding was withdrawn, the Department agreed to support the full-time qualifying students to complete their studies.  These were ex-SR Technics employees who were undertaking the ALBA degree on a full-time basis.  As already stated, the institutions are autonomous bodies in their own right.  I hope this answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

However, in light of the success of the ALBA programme, I wonder if dialogue is going to take place with DCU, which is the accrediting college in this instance.  Have discussions taken place with All Hallows in the context of the course being provided under, for example, a social enterprise model?  We are talking about people who were out of formal education for up to 30 years and who, with the help of the Government, returned to it.  In that context, when the EGF funding ceased, the Department stepped in and provided moneys for the final two years.  The merits of the programme are there to be seen.  All but one of the students involved have returned to employment or have gone on to further education.  In some cases, these people had been out of education for decades.  It would be a mistake to bring this successful programme to an end, particularly as I am of the view that it could be facilitated in some other form or even expanded.  Is the Department going to investigate the possibility of opening up dialogue with somebody in the context of the course continuing elsewhere, or will it consider the possibility of facilitating it under a social enterprise model?</p></speech>

I contend that it is not necessarily for the Department to intervene.  In circumstances in which a course of this nature could be provided by another institution, I would make the argument that it would be a matter for that institution to subsume it into its own programme of courses.</p></speech>

It must be remembered that it was a part-time course and that funding would not normally be provided in such circumstances.  The Deputy referred to a particular institution, but there are any number of institutions throughout the State which could, subject to their internal criteria, subsume the course on a full-time basis.  I do not know how the Department could intervene in that matter.  In fact, I do not believe there is a mechanism to allow it to do so.  It was a result of the EGF and the specific circumstances relating to SR Technics that an intervention was made in this instance, and there is no doubting the positive impact of that intervention.  If that were the case, one could set a precedent in respect of any number of other courses which could be brought through the Department to be delivered out into specific institutions.</p><p>However, we must recognise the autonomy of individual institutions.</p></speech>

Pupils from six schools or seven rang a s&eacute; will have no gaelscoil to go to in 2015.  It simply will not be an option for them.

To date, the Department has not received any formal submission from parents in north Kildare on the provision of a gaelchol&aacute;iste in the north-eastern Kildare region.  There is a five year construction plan which is well established.  The establishment of any new school is, therefore, considered in the context of the overall need for additional school places to meet future demographic demands.  The Deputy has probably heard this before.  I acknowledge that there is one post-primary school in Maynooth, Maynooth post-primary school.  A new post-primary school, Maynooth community college, will be added to the provision this September.  It will have an all-Irish Aonad, which is the nub of the issue.  I will sit down with the Deputy who may wish to address that point.</p></speech>

The survey was provided for the Department.  I am not sure who is doing the counting in it, but essentially the parents maintain that an Aonad will not cut it.  They have sent their children to all-Irish primary schools and the numbers in all-Irish primary schools can be counted.  We do not expect every child who attends an Irish primary school to go to an all-Irish secondary school, but our experience suggests approximately 60% do.  An Aonad is not acceptable to them.  There is now a well established community in place and the first all-Irish school was established in 1979.  Essentially, what is being provided in Maynooth amounts to two second level schools side by side, with the education and training board as patron.  Many of us are wondering where the Department obtained the numbers for the provision of secondary education.  There is no capacity available in Lucan or Clondalkin.  Put simply, the students will have no gaelchol&aacute;iste option.  The parents know the difference between immersion in the language in a gaelchol&aacute;iste as opposed to an Aonad which covers the core subjects core.  In any case, the core subjects are often not provided through Irish.  Has the Minister State read the report?  Did someone read the findings of the survey and, if not, why not?  If the report has not been read, will the Minister of State ensure someone will read it and come back to us with a though-out position?</p></speech>

If the Deputy is suggesting the demand from the community for a gaelchol&aacute;iste is such that the Aonad is not a sufficient response, we will have to find a way of facilitating a further conversation based on an interrogation of the survey.  The reply furnished to me suggests that included in the first year enrolment at the new school will be an allocation of 31 students for the all-Irish Aonad.  While there is no waiting list for the Aonad, an additional 85 first year places can be filled in Maynooth community college.  These places can be filled either in the Aonad, on the English language side of the school or between the two facilities, depending on demand.</p><p>Obviously, there is a gap between what the Department and the community are saying and, somehow, we are going to have to work to bridge it.

In a survey parents replied that, if they were given an Aonad, 62% would opt for English.  They have already made a commitment through the medium of Irish in primary school.  This is a good news story for the revival of the language, but it is not lost on many that in the 2015-16 school year, 2016 being a significant anniversary, that we will go backwards in an area in which parents have demonstrated a commitment by sending children to certain schools.

This makes it clear that the Department is unlikely to to allocate special needs assistant, SNA, posts to meet individual children's needs.  It appears that the Department's considerations are more about what resources are available than what children need.</p></reply>

The circular states professional reports and assessments play an important role in the SNA allocation process.  There is no question in that regard.</p><p>  Under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act, it is a statutory function of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to assess and review the resources required for special educational provision.  In doing so the NCSE takes into account professional assessments of care needs but also considers the whole school environment, observations on a child's interaction in the classroom and the views of the child's parents, teachers and national educational psychologists, as necessary.</p><p>  Circular 0030/2014 indicates that the HSE has directed staff not to include in their reports references to the specific quantum of educational resources but rather to set out the care needs of a child, while outlining that it is ultimately a matter for the NCSE to review the resources required in a school to support these needs.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of disquiet among parents of vulnerable children about the qualifications of special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  For example, they may not hold relevant qualifications in psychology or disability services.  Reports from fully qualified and accredited educational psychologists and psychiatrists are not being accepted by the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE.  Parents find it difficult to understand why a SENO who may be less qualified can ignore the recommendations of an independent educational psychologist who is an expert in that field.  The Minister of State will admit that SENOs are not as well qualified as these experts, yet the Department seems to be less inclined to take the experts' opinions on board.</p></speech>

Nobody is suggesting for a moment that the professional opinion of health staff is not a valuable source of expertise to have in determining the needs of a child throughout his or her life, but in this unique setting within the school we must draw upon and ultimately trust the expertise of our network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, under the guidance and expertise of the NCSE, in determining what exactly are the child's needs and the supports required for that child to successfully attend mainstream school.  That is ultimately the judgment call that we must trust, and we do trust it.</p></speech>

Is this not an admission that the child's individual needs are secondary to the resources that are available?  The Minister of State might say it is about time I started living in the real world and that is the way it is, but at least he should admit it and stop pretending that the child's needs come first.</p><p>  The State is forcing some parents to go to court.  Recently, in a case involving two families with children with Down's syndrome, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns directed the Department of Education and Skills to give the children the maximum resource teaching hours so they could stay in mainstream schooling.  It is disappointing if the State is going to drive parents into the courts to get a fair deal.  We know that only those parents who can afford to go to court will get a fair deal for their children and that children from less privileged backgrounds or from marginalised communities whose parents do not have the resources to go to court will not have the opportunity of using the courts because they cannot afford it.</p></speech>

I want to point out to the Deputy once again that health professionals have an expertise in the care needs of children with special needs - nobody is denying that.  That expertise is valuable in determining ultimately what types of support are available within the school setting.  It is the NCSE or the network of SENOs across the country who have that unique expertise in determining the supports required.  In doing so, they need to look at the layout of the school, what other special needs supports are already in place and whether they need to be augmented to prepare for a particular child.  They must have an opportunity to observe the child's performance and behaviour in a classroom setting and his or her interaction with the teachers.  It is only they who have the expertise to determine that.</p><p>  In response to an earlier question, I pointed out that at the end of this year there will be no question of diminishing resources for children with special needs.  We will have the highest number of SNAs in the history of State.  We will have 480 extra resource teachers in place at the end of this year and we will have another 480 extra resource teachers in place at the end of next year.  We are working hard within the resources available to us to support children with special needs.</p></speech>

His officials have engaged with all education stakeholders, including the second level teachers' unions.  There have been 13 meetings since January last.  The Minister published a report on the work of those meetings and that group in May.  The report indicated that some progress had been achieved and many constructive proposals have been made, particularly by the management and patron bodies, which will inform the discussions going forward, but the Minister continues to await similar written submissions from the teacher unions.</p><p>  Nobody is denying that there is clearly further work to be done to achieve all necessary elements of the reform.  The reform must be achieved.  The Minister and his officials are very open to continuing discussion of issues relating to the implementation of the junior cycle, including aspects of disagreement raised by the teacher unions.  The door has remained open and will remain open for such discussions.</p></reply>

We would like to see this happen with everybody involved and on board.  Unfortunately, because of the manner in which the Minister has handled the issue, the position, as he leaves office, is far from ideal.  In May he committed to the establishment of a working group which was to be chaired by him.  I gather from the Minister of State's response that the Minister has not chaired any meeting of the group because it has not yet met.  I remind the Minister of State that we are less than two months from the start of the new academic year and implementation of the reform of the junior certificate.  This is entirely unacceptable.  Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify if it is the case that, as of now, there have been no meetings of the working group which was to be chaired by the Minister.</p></speech>

There is a working group in place which consists of officials from the Department and representatives of the TUI, the ASTI, the school management bodies, the NAPD, Educate Together, parents, the NCCA and the SEC.  This working group met on 17 January, 7 February, 7 March and 29 May.  It was established to address the obstacles that had arisen in the implementation of this significant and long awaited reform and its work in that regard is ongoing.  I am confident that with the ingenuity and innovation available to us from within the teaching profession and that if the two principal unions, the ASTI and the TUI, make their written submissions and take up the Minister's offer to meet him, which offer I am sure will remain open through his successor - I encourage the teacher unions to become involved in the process of negotiation - we can enter the new school year in September with a degree of certainty as to how this long awaited reform is to be implemented.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated that direct talks would commence following completion of this year's junior and leaving certificate examinations, but this has not yet happened.  The only matter on which the Minister of State can report today is the progress of the working group, the work of which has been ongoing since the start of the year.  Unfortunately, the current position is entirely unacceptable.  There has been a real lack of political leadership and a willingness to pull everybody together to ensure everybody will be on board on this matter.  Implementation of reform at a time when teachers are involved in an industrial dispute and have been directed by their unions not to engage in preparations and training for it is unacceptable.  That direct talks have not commenced is worrying.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that when the new Minister for Education and Skills is appointed, there will be a new approach to securing agreement on implementation of this reform in September.</p></speech>

I recall that the leader of one of the unions concerned said in a statement a few months ago, "We have waited 25 years, what's another year?"  I do not believe children, in particular those entering post primary education this year, can wait any longer for this reform.</p><p>  The precursor to any serious engagement on any issue of this nature is that both parties make their views known, preferably in writing.  While the Minister's views on the issue have been known for some months, we are still awaiting written submissions from the two unions at the heart of this challenge and opportunity.  They have yet to make submissions on how they would like this reform to be implemented and have not as yet taken up the Minister's invitation to meet him.  He has continually stated his door is open, but the unions have yet to walk through that door.  Until they do, we cannot move on.</p></speech>

How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities presents as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where the number enrolling in the school is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby.  The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.  Nevertheless, resources have to be distributed to schools in a transparent and equitable manner.  In this regard, pupil numbers are the fairest basis on which to allocate resources to a school, irrespective of its type.  Eight small schools of a Protestant ethos were successful in their staffing appeals for September 2014.</p></reply>

I acknowledge the current position as he set it out.  However, I ask him to keep in mind the need to recognise the position of some of the minority-religion schools, which have been, from the foundation of the State, accorded a particular provision by virtue of their minority status.  In order to ensure that this continues to be recognised, could the Minister of State indicate the extent to which dialogue is ongoing with a view to attempting to ensure the schools' fears are assuaged in so far as this can be done, notwithstanding the economic situation?</p></speech>

Let me refer to a specific example.  With the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, Dr. Paul Colton, and Mr. Owens of Cork Education and Training Board, we have in Mallow, where a small Church of Ireland school closed, fashioned a new model that will create a precedent for an education and training board to join a Church of Ireland school in creating a brand new school.  What we are talking about is ensuring the recognition of the faith and the right of those with that faith to educate their community accordingly.  We must try to ensure there is a model, or models, to allow this to continue.</p><p>  It is worth noting that there are 194 primary schools with a Protestant or Presbyterian ethos out of a total of 3,146.  Based on the enrolment figures for September 2013, nine of those have one teacher, 73 have two teachers and 36 have three or more.  Therefore, there is recognition of the community.  There is no question about that.  It is a matter of how we apply lateral thinking in coming up with solutions when numbers are decreasing in individual schools to such an extent that we need to consider new models.</p></speech>

The report recommends that a new allocation model should be developed based on a school's educational profile, while also providing a baseline allocation to every mainstream school in order to support inclusion.  It was recommended that the school profile should take into account details of the number of students with complex needs attending, the percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised tests and the social context of a school.</p><p>  To assist with the process of considering the report's recommendations, my Department will begin to gather information required to develop the proposed new model.

It will be crucial that there is proper consultation and that everybody's views are taken on board before deciding how to move forward.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, in his press statement coinciding with the release of the report, struck a cautious note, saying he would carefully review the recommendations in the report and in examining how to implement a new model it would be important that he both protect the gains that have been made in special educational provision in recent years while also seeking to improve provision.  However, media reports at the time indicated that the Minister was far more positive.  <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who had accepted the recommendations and had put the plan out for consultation before it comes before the Government for approval in the autumn, had said that the current system was clearly unfair and that he believed it should stop.  Does the Minister expect the report to be implemented as recommended, and is there a difference between the Department's approach to it and the political leadership's approach, as in the approach of the Minister, Deputy Quinn?</p></speech>

It is important that it should happen.  The report from the working group recommends that a new special education teacher allocation model, which would target resources where the need is greatest, should be introduced.  At a time of finite resources it is important that teaching supports to children with special educational needs should be targeted at those with the greatest need.  The Minister asked his officials to consult fully with the stakeholders.  To assist in that process, the Department will gather the information required to develop the proposed new model.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has been very proactive in ensuring that this report was published in a timely fashion and I do not anticipate any long delay in carrying out the consultative process and coming to a conclusion at the end of that as to how the recommendations of the report will be implemented.</p></speech>

The IPPN chief executive officer, Se&aacute;n Cottrell, said, "The proposed profiling of schools will enable those with the greatest level of need to secure the greater resource.  However, some schools may lose practically all of their current supports while others may run the risk of becoming "ghetto schools".  It is essential that schools which lose resources should only do so over a period of time.  Many of the schools losing resources will rightly point out that the support they received was used to move pupils more quickly between bands which will be more difficult to do in the future."  These are genuine concerns of the IPPN about the how the report's recommendations will be implemented.  Will the Minister respond to those concerns?</p></speech>

I do not understand that terminology.  The Deputy is aware that as children with special needs move quite fluidly through the school system, the challenges each school faces in supporting and caring for children with special needs change and evolve over time.  It is not reasonable to expect that the resources available to each school will somehow remain static.</p><p>They must change and evolve alongside the changing needs of children within the school.  Concerns the IPPN might have should be addressed within the consultation model proposed by the Minister and I am very confident that they will be.</p></speech>

However, given the oft-repeated phrase "finite resources", problems can emerge.  One particular question raised by the INTO concerns the moratorium on posts of responsibility and posts involving special duties, given that schools may have a difficulty in getting what they need and making the case for what they need because of the moratorium.  In fact, the INTO claims the recommendations will be unworkable without lifting the moratorium.  I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about this.</p></speech>

It occurs when the mix in a school is lost.  If all disadvantaged and disruptive students, as well as students with special needs, are in one school and the natural mix is lost, that is not good for the pupils and education.  We hear a lot of talk about the allocation of resource teaching hours.  What is going to happen in the case of children with Down's syndrome in September?  A couple of months ago the Government accepted my Bill, the Down's Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill, but I do not know what is going to happen in the provision of resource teaching hours.  I have heard a lot of talk about the allocation of such hours and it was said the Minister had done a great job, but I do not think so.  This morning I received a letter from the parent of a student in St. Michael's House, Baldoyle, which was losing a teacher and a special needs assistant.  It provides an excellent service in Baldoyle for severely disabled children.  I would like the Minister of State to respond on the allocation of resource teaching hours.</p></speech>

By the end of this year there will be the highest number of SNAs ever employed in the school system in the history of the State and that number is set to increase next year.  Within the finite resources available to us, we have, as best we can, protected special needs education within the overall education budget, which has been a central tenet of the work of the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in the past three years.</p><p>  To reply to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's question, if the INTO has a concern that, without lifting the moratorium, schools will not have the required resources available to them, I again suggest it take up that question in the upcoming consultation process.</p></speech>

My officials have held a number of meetings with management bodies and parent representative groups to address concerns which have arisen since the circular issued.  The purpose of the circular is not and was not to reduce the level of SNA support being allocated to schools.  For the coming school year, over 10,900 SNAs are being allocated to schools, which is more than at any time previously.</p><p>  In order to address concerns parents may have about the circular, the National Council for Special Education has been asked to prepare an information booklet for parents to explain the provisions of the circular and allay fears they may have.  To be frank, there were fears as a result of the circular.  On reflection, when one considers that we are preparing an information booklet for parents to explain the provisions of the circular, it might have been better phrased.</p></reply>

However, the problem is that on the ground, when one goes to any school, the reality is very different.  Teachers, principals and parents will tell the Minister of State what they are telling the rest of us, namely, how difficult it is to ensure SNA support is provided for a student whom they feel very much needs it.</p><p>More and more, they are being asked to share SNA resources among students.  The burden and task of deciding how an SNA resource is allocated among students with a need is left with the teacher.  This is a totally unfair position to leave teachers, principals and school management in because resources are stretched.  Although numbers may be high, the difficulty involved in ensuring that adequate care and support is given to students who need it is very different.  </p><p>This particular circular only added to the difficulty.  The circular said in respect of SNA support that:<blockquote>The care needs outlined must be of such significance that they are beyond that which would normally be expected to be provided to a child by the child&rsquo;s class teacher, support teacher, or other school teachers, or beyond the level of assistance which could be offered to the student by his or her fellow pupils in school.</blockquote>In respect of post-primary level, the circular stated that only students with chronic and serious care needs should require SNA support and that continued and ongoing access to SNA support is generally not desirable for post-primary students.  The phraseology led to many of the concerns.  I know the Department is putting together an information booklet but alongside this, would it not be better to withdraw that circular and put out a fresh one, which would hopefully allay many of the concerns it has caused?  </p></speech>

The intent contained within it is perfectly legitimate.  Recent Department and National Council for Special Education reports concluded that while the SNA scheme has been very successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, the intended purpose of that scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and the scope and purpose of the scheme needed to be clarified within that circular, which is what happened.  The purpose of the circular was not to scare or somehow lead parents to conclude that there was going to a reduction in SNA supports.  It was simply to clarify the role of the SNA within the school setting and I am confident that it did that.  An explanatory booklet will be available for parents in the very near future.  Since 2011, we have protected resources within special education in very difficult economic circumstances.</p></speech>

Could he clarify his previous response to Deputy Finian McGrath about the supports children with Down's syndrome can expect this September?  As has been rightly pointed out, there was a High Court case in the past couple of weeks involving two families who challenged the Government because their children with Down's syndrome were not entitled to resource teaching hours.  The High Court judge ruled that those children should get the full allocation of resource teaching hours.</p><p>  The only way those children got those hours was because their families went to the High Court.  As things stand, the only way other children with Down's syndrome will get the same supports is through their families having the financial wherewithal to go to the High Court.  This is completely unacceptable.  I believe we should see a situation whereby the Government allocates resource teaching hours in September 2014 to all those children diagnosed with Down's syndrome, not just to those whose families can afford to go to court to get the hours.  Can the Minister give us absolute clarity about the situation facing children with Down's syndrome who are starting school and going back to school this September?</p></speech>

In particular since the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement, there has been a genuine cross-party desire to maintain momentum towards peace and in particular, advancing political stability in Northern Ireland.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that recent events have caused much concern.  There is a genuine sense of drift in terms of both respect for institutions in Northern Ireland and for the ongoing momentum of the peace process itself and the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>  The withdrawal of the leaders of Unionism from the talks process relating to the past, flags and parading is in many ways a sign of profound political failure. The fact that the decision of an independent statutory parades commission has caused the First Minister and others to leave the talks and begin a graduated response of protest raises a number of fundamental questions.  The first is the manner in which parading is adjudicated within Northern Ireland.  Are both governments now looking afresh at that even in the context of the Haass talks where the emerging momentum had been to move parading into the offices of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to decide and arbitrate upon and away from an independent parades commission?  The second question is the political recognition of the primacy of the rule of law, in other words, that leading politicians in Northern Ireland, irrespective of whether an adjudication comes from an independent institution or not, feel free on any whim to protest at that and remove themselves from a talks process or indeed from the North-South Ministerial Council last week.  It does not just involve Unionist leaders.  We saw this in terms of the PSNI and policing.  When Deputy Adams was arrested, Sinn F&eacute;in said that its support for policing was now questionable or could be threatened if he was not released.  That also happened on a previous occasion when somebody was arrested.  This idea of the political recognition of the primacy of law is central to political stability in Northern Ireland and I ask the Taoiseach to comment on that.  </p><p>  I know the Taoiseach has had meetings with various parties.  He has had talks with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron.  Is it the view of the Government that the Taoiseach will become re-engaged in a hands-on way with the process in Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of the talks on the past, parading, flags and such like in order to inject fresh momentum into a process which has illustrated a dangerous sense of drift in recent years? </p></speech>

I am very concerned about the escalation of events in Northern Ireland in the recent past.  In the course of one day last week, we saw Unionist withdrawal from the Parades Commission, the all-party talks and the North-South Ministerial Council.  This has very serious implications.  I note that the Unionist parties announced a graduated response, whatever is meant by that.  The first indication was in respect of non-attendance at the North-South Ministerial Council.  It is true to say that the entire House should be concerned about the potential for an escalation to conflict and unwanted violence on 12 July with particular reference to the flash point that could occur at the shops on the Ardoyne Road.</p><p>I spoke to Mr. Cameron on Sunday and discussed this matter with him by telephone for a number of minutes in regard to the need for both governments to be very vigilant as to what contingency plans might be put in place.  I advised the Prime Minister that we will send over senior personnel from Departments here to London this week to engage with their counterparts.  Yesterday evening, I spoke to David Ford of the Alliance Party in respect of justice matters in Northern Ireland.  He is obviously quite concerned about this.  Last evening I also met the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in to get their views on the need for rational thinking and clear heads in respect of the next period and the implications of what lies ahead in September and October.</p><p> The Prime Minister, for his part, has made it clear that while he and his government are supportive of the Good Friday Agreement and the process that the Executive and the parties in Northern Ireland had negotiated and worked on before eventually being given devolved authority for a range of activities, the challenge is to make that system work.</p><p> I regret very much that the Unionist parties, both the DUP and the UUP, appear to have moved from a position of centrality on the Agreement to a point somewhere right of that.  I also note that some of the Unionist groupings have called for peaceful measures this weekend and I hope that will be the outcome of this weekend's parades and marches. </p><p> I agree with the Deputy that when a Parades Commission, with its independent and statutory authority, makes a decision, it should be complied with.  The parties I spoke to yesterday - the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in - both indicated that they would have been supportive of the commission irrespective of the decision it made.  This weekend has the potential for serious conflict.  I hope that calmer minds will see to it that that does not happen.  The PSNI, for its part, has said it will implement the law in so far as the Parades Commission decision is concerned.</p><p> In so far as the involvement of the British Government is concerned, I have had requests to make contact with the US as well in regard to maintaining a focus on having the Agreement implemented in full and pushed forward.  I thank the Deputy for his question.  For now, we are conscious of the potential implications of this.  We are in contact with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties and I hope those involved will see to it that there is no escalation of violence or outrageous behaviour, as has happened on a number of occasions.  It is potentially very serious.</p></speech>

There is a need for him and the British Prime Minister to meet urgently and then, in consultation with the parties in Northern Ireland, to draw up a framework to create fresh momentum in the political situation in the North and create a new agenda to move the process onwards.</p><p>  A community relations council report to the Assembly this week was disturbing in respect of the revelations - if one could call them that - concerning the significant underachievement in education, health and social areas among a significant proportion of the population of west and north Belfast, particularly among specific groupings.  The statistic are damning and it is worrying with regard to the future for young people - young males, in particular - in those areas in the context of their having a sense of engagement with society and a sense of future and ownership in that society in respect of education participation, employment and so on.</p><p>  Looking at the medium term, if we get over this difficult phase, there is an urgent need on behalf of both governments to up their game in the level of their engagement and to create a new agenda to drive forward stability within Northern Ireland that involves a socioeconomic dimension as well.  I put that to the Taoiseach in good faith.</p><p>  Have the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach made it clear to all the political leaders in Northern Ireland that they cannot pick and choose in the context of political recognition of the primacy of the rule of law, whether it is the decisions of the PSNI in prosecuting particular cases or the Parades Commission in the independent adjudication it may make on particular parades, and that it is not on for the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister to decide when they show confidence in those institutions and when they do not?  Their performance in recent times has undermined public confidence in shared institutions.

For that reason, I asked the Prime Minister to consider speaking to the First Minister.  He was to speak to the Secretary of State but I cannot confirm whether he spoke to the DUP leader.</p><p>  I note the report the Deputy mentioned about the implications for young people regarding education and so on.  There is also a decision to be made in respect of welfare reform which could lead to a substantial cutback in finance for facilities of up to &euro;650 million, which clearly has implications for the Executive and the way it goes about its business.  That was partly the reason additional moneys were put in under the PEACE IV agreement arising from the Presidency last year - to deal with the sensitive communities mentioned by the Deputy.</p><p>  I do not have any difficulty arranging a meeting with the British Prime Minister if that is necessary.  I agreed with him on Sunday that we would both continue to monitor this closely from Dublin and London and to engage with the parties, and I committed myself to that in the meetings and discussions I had yesterday.  I have not spoken directly to the First Minister.  Obviously, I recommended that the Prime Minister engage with him in the first instance, but it is a case of hoping to get through this weekend without any escalation of violence and making contingency arrangements for what is best for the future.  This is a sensitive period and, clearly, the period ahead between September and Christmas is crucial to putting the peace process and the move to fully implement the Good Friday Agreement back on track.</p></speech>

I will not ask him to comment on that today, but there a number of unanswered questions about the Minister's suitability.  Recently, in what is a feature of the Government, he appointed seven former Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors to State boards, and he is also mired in controversy when it comes to the planning process.  He appointed as deputy chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la an individual who was the former technical director of RPS consulting engineers, a private company that framed a series of controversial projects which have come before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Minister also extended this person's term of office.  This individual voted to approve contentious projects on which RPS Group was a consultant, which had been rejected by An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspectors.  These include an apartment development in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and a sewage treatment scheme in County Donegal.  He also approved a controversial wind farm at Cullenagh, County Laois.  These clearly raise questions of a conflict of interest.  RPS Group consultants also advised EirGrid to install overhead pylons, and they were also among the consultants employed at a cost of &euro;85 million by Uisce &Eacute;ireann, in which two former senior RPS Group executives now hold senior positions.  Is it not the case that unless these matters are clarified, it would be inappropriate for the Taoiseach to nominate the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the position of Commissioner?</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan appointed the former technical director of a private company to a pivotal and important position.  When he took office, one of the first things he did was to close the inquiry the former Minister, Mr. John Gormley, had initiated into planning irregularities and alleged planning corruption in seven local council areas.  In County Donegal a senior planner has made serious allegations and the Minister has been made aware of extremely serious planning irregularities in County Wicklow, including the highly controversial M11 rezoning decision.  A range of planning debacles and controversies surround Uisce &Eacute;ireann and the Poolbeg incinerator.  When a European Commissioner is nominated, there is serious scrutiny of his or her suitability at EU level.  Should there not be the same scrutiny in the D&aacute;il?

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has begun the process of tendering in the private sector for the provision of community development services to be sold in 31 lots for between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million.  There has been a deliberate and complete absence of consultation with the workers and community organisations which will be affected.  The Minister has cited concerns about commercial sensitivities to justify this.  He has also told the House that he was legally required to put the service contracts out to tender under Directive No. 2004/18/EC.  This directive has been repealed and the new EU Directive No. 2014/24/EU makes it clear that member states are free to "organise social services in a way that does not entail the conclusion of public contracts".  Why is Ireland the only EU member state taking this action?  Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister to come to the D&aacute;il with a statement outlining the legal basis for his action?  Will the Government abandon this crazy idea?</p><p>  I raise the particular concerns of organisations working with and within the Traveller community.  The National Traveller Partnership which represents a coalition of 14 local and three national Traveller organisations is asking the Government to take the specific conditions affecting Travellers into account and ring-fence existing Traveller funding.  The partnership wants the Government to pay this funding, either through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or through Pobal for specific community development and social inclusion programmes managed by the National Traveller Partnership and to draw up a service level agreement with the Department or Pobal to deliver such a specific programme.  State agencies and local authorities have a deplorable record in dealing with issues facing the Traveller community and there is discrimination within society.  During the past six years of austerity this most vulnerable section of the community has borne the worst cuts, with an 80% reduction in funding and a 40% cut to the Traveller-specific projects of the LCDP, on top of the general cuts to LCDP funding.  Will the Taoiseach take on board the points made by the National Traveller Partnership?  Will he invite its representatives to talk to them about their concerns?  Will he get the Minister to deal with the issue before he might be moved to the European Union?</p></speech>

I have seen a number of them working.  I am sure the Minister can take into account the five points raised by the Deputy.  This is not the privatisation of such work but the opportunity for existing and other companies to tender for the programmes and work involved.  The tender process is to conclude on 11 July.  The reason for inviting companies to submit tenders for the work is to ensure there will be an effective output and that public money is spent most effectively.  Companies will tender for the work programmes in the different localities around the country; the tenders will be examined and the programmes of work will be awarded to the relevant companies.  The process will be published, ensuring accountability and transparency.  There was a process of consultation; there is now a process of seeking tenders which must be examined and used as the basis for decisions.  It is not privatisation.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, made no attempt to listen to the workers' concerns about their jobs and futures and the future of the local development companies.  The Taoiseach did not answer the question about the new directive, Directive 2014/24/EU, which makes it clear that member states do not have to pursue this process.  If that is the case, like many others here, I would like the Minister to defend his position in railroading this procedure into community projects.  It is privatisation; there is no other word for it.  Any community development worker and any National Traveller Partnership worker will tell the Taoiseach that it is tendering for community projects.  Will the Taoiseach take on board the concerns of the National Traveller Partnership which has voiced its concerns succinctly and eloquently to me and others who attended last week's press conference?  Two Labour Party Deputies were present and I hope they will row in behind the call for the National Traveller Partnership to meet the Taoiseach and the Minister because nothing happens in the D&aacute;il unless the Taoiseach intervenes to mark the cards of his Ministers.</p></speech>

We discussed a number of political and development aid issues.  At the time, the political and security situation in Ukraine and Crimea was evolving rapidly and we took the opportunity to discuss the latest developments in that country.  </p><p>Our meeting focused on development work and issues in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.  We discussed the work of Irish Aid in Africa, with particular reference to its focus on tackling AIDS in Mozambique and Lesotho, where the number of people with AIDS has dropped significantly thanks in part to the highly effective partnership in these countries between Ireland and the Clinton Foundation.  Former President Clinton outlined other work under way in Africa, where his foundation is working with governments to support sustainable farming initiatives which help farming communities to modernise their practices and stay on the land.</p><p>We also discussed the situation in Northern Ireland following the conclusion of the talks process chaired by Dr. Richard Haass.  As ever, the former President was keenly interested in seeing all sides in Northern Ireland continuing to work together to make further progress in building a sustainable future.  I emphasised that the political leaders in Northern Ireland needed to be encouraged to work together to address the challenges they faced and not to let current difficulties become an impasse to further progress.</p><p>We also discussed the humanitarian situation in Syria and the challenge for neighbouring countries, including Jordan, in dealing with refugees seeking to escape the conflict there.</p></reply>

Clinton Leadership Institute".  I am pleased that the Taoiseach met the former President and, in particular, that he raised the issue of the North with him.  Mr. Clinton has played a vital role in the development of the peace process and its early success and continues to take a close interest in what is happening here.  He was a good friend of Ireland while in office and has continued to take a close interest in developments.  Recently, I briefed him on the increasing difficulties in the political process in the North and the cross-Border institutions.  I outlined concerns and, as I have emphasised to the Taoiseach many times, the particular importance of the Irish and British Governments constantly managing the process, being continually and consistently engaged with all of the political players and, in particular, seeking all the time to encourage Unionist leaders.  We are all concerned by the orchestrated walk-out by representatives of all of the Unionist parties supported by the Orange Order, the UDA and the UVF.  That and, equally importantly, the cancellation of the North-South Ministerial Council meeting marks a worrying escalation.  Former President Clinton's experience in the 1990s in dealing with a reluctant British Conservative Party under Mr. John Major could well be of use in seeking to ensure the Cameron Government honours its obligations.  Even though we are much more advanced in the search for peace, the two situations in relation to the Tories then and now are not dissimilar.</p><p>  Former President Clinton is also very conscious of the difficulties in his time created by contentious Orange parades.  At the time, Unionist leaders claimed that their demand to march through Nationalist communities, if denied, would be an attack on Orange culture.  The Taoiseach will be aware, however, that ten years ago there were 2,120 marches in the North, whereas last year this figure had reached 4,637.  Over 3,000 of these events are loyalist parades, while most of the remaining ones are religious or community based.  There are fewer than 200 Nationalist parades, none of which is contentious.  Claims that objections by a handful of Nationalist areas to Orange parades passing through their communities are an attack on Orange culture are clearly not right.  Sinn F&eacute;in upholds that view and will be on the ground.  I welcome the Fianna F&aacute;il leader's interest in the North during Leaders' Questions.  Perhaps, his cumann in Ardoyne will be able to go out and help local people to police matters and keep younger people and other elements who want to undermine the peace process from doing just that.  The Executive in the North is meeting today on the initiative of Mr. Martin McGuinness who is putting forward a statement which will I hope be agreed by all party leaders calling for calm, the upholding of the law and everyone to assist in making sure the next few days will pass without difficulty for anyone, including the PSNI, people in Ardoyne and the Orange marchers themselves.  As I have been saying to the Taoiseach in a series of engagements, the two Governments must be champions of the Good Friday Agreement.  We must see a positive axis for progress emerging clearly, assertively and resolutely because the vast majority of people in the North and across the island want the process to continue and see tolerance and respect.</p><p>  On former President Clinton's watch, the US Government made a significant financial contribution to the International Fund for Ireland.  The fund has contributed over &euro;900 million to projects across the island.  It has been under threat for some time, with senior US congressional figures arguing for it to be retained.  I raised the issue when I was in the USA just one month or two ago and asked that the country continue to support the fund financially.  The Taoiseach had the opportunity to speak to former President Clinton about this.  Has he had discussions with President Obama or the White House on funding, in particular the International Fund for Ireland?</p></speech>

He said in Derry, "I was here 20 years ago.  Go on and finish the job, if you can."  The difficulties have been outlined by representatives of the different parties in Northern Ireland.  As I said in response to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, I hope the weekend will pass without conflict and violence.  Deputy Gerry Adams has outlined the number of parades that take place.  Clearly, with only 200 Nationalist parades across the North, none of which is contentious, the number of marches and parades which have taken place generally is extraordinary.</p><p>The point made by the Deputy, the SDLP and the Minister of Justice in the Northern Ireland Executive, Mr. David Ford, is that this is a process put in place after long and hard negotiations that were difficult for those concerned.  It is the foundation stone for the future and one that is worth working for to see it implemented.  I hope the Unionist parties - the DUP and the UUP - can come back to what the future is for Northern Ireland and its people, particularly its young people.  That requires a belief that the agreement reached is one that can work in the interest of all communities and peoples.</p><p> When I was in the United States in March for the St. Patrick's week connections, I spoke with representatives from Senate and Congress with an interest in Northern Ireland and to the President, the Speaker of the House and a number of different Senators.  They all have a genuine interest in seeing the process continue and that it does not break up.  I thanked President Clinton for his continued interest and it goes without saying that he and his wife continue to maintain their personal interest in Northern Ireland.  I hope it can continue for a long time.</p><p> Deputy Adams also asked another question at the end.</p></speech>

He arrived in March and we are discussing it now.</p><p>The Taoiseach indicated in his reply that the global Clinton initiative, the work in Africa and the Ukraine were among the main items to be discussed.  The international dimension to Northern Ireland, and the interest and commitment of the United States, has always been an important one.  President Clinton and the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, have had a lifelong and abiding interest in the Irish peace process, the relationship between Ireland and Great Britain, and the development of the Good Friday Agreement.  Central to that is political recognition of the primacy of the institutions created under the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not say this in a partisan way but as a statement of fact.  There is a sense of drift and political leaders in Northern Ireland seem to think they can pick and choose whether to support an institution.  If the PSNI takes a decision that Sinn F&eacute;in does not like, it can protest outside the police station and ring the British Prime Minister and say that if this person, who is a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, is not released it may not support policing in the future.  Sinn F&eacute;in also talks about dark forces in the police.  It sends a signal that, although there has been a transformation in policing as per the Patten report and the introduction of policing boards, which everyone bought into it, members of the policing board can turn up outside the police stations protesting decisions, such as in the case of Padraic Wilson, who was arrested a year ago.  I think that is wrong.  Likewise, the First Minister withdrawing from a North-South Ministerial Council meeting, on the basis of a decision by an independent parades commission, is wrong and sends a mixed signal to the public.  Privately the leaders may have disagreements and may not like it but if they are not accepting of the institutions created it sends a worrying signal.  Ultimately, it cumulatively undermines political stability.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach spoke to the First Minister in respect of the decision to cancel it and to pull out of the meeting.  The Taoiseach was leading the Irish Government at that meeting when there was summary withdrawal of Unionist Ministers, which is unacceptable.  It is an agreed institution under the Good Friday Agreement and is provided for in legislation.  It is not on that there should be an almost cavalier approach to a decision that the Irish Government had nothing to do with.  I do not know if the Taoiseach has had a discussion with the First Minister.</p><p>Does the Taoiseach agree that this saps the international dimension and that such behaviour can sap the continued engagement by people outside?  They want to wish the process well but responsibility must be a two-way process.  We can call on President Clinton to use his good offices to help and we have done so time and time again, to help the process but there must be a responsibility here and in the North in terms of that relationship, particularly in respect of those who have consistently supported the process, such as the European Union, the United States  or the other international actors who have been of assistance to the process and to both Governments.</p><p>I am interested in the content of the discussion on Ukraine.  Did President Clinton have any perspective on the Russian approach to Ukraine and the need for the West to look at alternative energy supplies?  Increasingly, energy is being used as a political leveraging tool by Russia to turn on and turn off according to its geopolitical agenda.  Did President Clinton reference the <i>modus operandi</i>of President Putin to get his own way by dismissing all known democratic conventions in terms of the partitioning of Ukraine?</p><p>The Taoiseach mentioned the partnership between Ireland, particularly Irish Aid, and the Clinton initiative and his work in regard to AIDS in Africa.  Significant success occurred in reducing and treating, through use of retroviral and other effective medicines, the incident and impact of AIDS on communities across Africa.  It is a good illustration of the genuine partnerships that can develop between Governments and the Clinton initiative in terms of sustainability in Africa.  I am interested to hear President Clinton's perspective on how that is working now.</p></speech>

I made the point to the Deputy First Minister when I called him, after Deputy Adams had been taken in by the PSNI, that if there was a dark side to the PSNI, the option was open to make a formal complaint to the ombudsman, which has authority and oversight over police and policing regulations.  I do not know whether that suggestion was taken up.</p><p>  I was in Brussels when the DUP First Minister decided not to attend the North-South Ministerial Council.  The T&aacute;naiste at the time, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, dealt with it but it is not good enough to have signals being sent out that if people do not like the situation they can have a process or withdrawal.  It is not good for anyone or the process and it sends out the wrong signal to ordinary people.</p><p>In that sense, I hope the Unionist parties re-engage actively both in the Executive and at the North-South Ministerial Council.  The point the Deputy makes on that is true.</p><p> Former US President, Bill Clinton, had a particular view on Ukraine, in that he felt there is an opportunity to assist the people of Ukraine to become a buffer between Russia and the countries to the west of Ukraine.  He pointed out that after the demise of the President, they did not destroy, burn or loot premises, towns and cities or presidential palaces.  For that reason, he believes they wanted to be a people striving towards democracy, with a strong inclination towards the European Union, and that incentivising them to hold their elections and make their own determination, would, in its own way, give them both responsibility and the authority to act as a go-between between east and west.  He made this particular point, rather than saying we should go in there and decide how this place should react to our presence.  He was quite strong on that and had a genuine interest in the entire geopolitics of the region, in the Crimea and further south.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the Clinton Foundation in Africa, which has a global reputation for spearheading successful initiatives on HIV, AIDS, health access, development, climate change, social enterprise and child health and nutrition.  The former President pointed out some outstanding examples of poor and poverty stricken villages where people were trained and shown how to grow, treat and irrigate crops and the value and benefit these people achieved from the sale of the product of those fields in the local markets.  He gave specific examples of some very poor families who had made great progress and significant strides because of the extra income generated by being able to produce different varieties of crops.</p><p> As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has worked in partnership with the Clinton Foundation since 2003 in joint ventures between Irish Aid and the Clinton health access initiative.  Ireland's collaboration with the Clinton health access initiative will see the provision of &euro;18 million in Mozambique and Lesotho between 2011 and 2015.  In total, over &euro;130 million has been provided to the Clinton Foundation HIV programme since 2003.  I am pleased to say that the Irish Aid partnership with the Clinton Foundation represents a substantial and successful partnership in the global fight against HIV and AIDS and has contributed to significant progress in addressing both in Mozambique and Lesotho.  With support from this partnership, the government in Mozambique is successfully rolling out treatment to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV, with over 70,000 women now accessing drugs annually to prevent this.  More than 300,000 people are on HIV treatment, up from less than 2,000 people at the end of 2002.  The epidemic is finally beginning to show signs of winding down, as HIV prevalence has decreased from over 16.5% in 2006  to 11.5% now.  In Lesotho, HIV counselling and testing services have been expanded to almost two-thirds of the population today, compared to fewer than one in ten in 2007.  These important initiatives have made a huge impact on many people's lives and the Government is happy to be associated with them.</p><p> Former President Clinton and I also spoke about other matters, such as immigration and he commented on the situation in America in the context of the undocumented.  These were the main points raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800022#U00200"><p>I am always amazed at how intensely the Irish political establishment courts former President Clinton, and it will probably continue to do so if Hillary Clinton runs for the American presidency.</p><p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that in regard to Northern Ireland Bill Clinton has no insight to offer that will lead us out of the current difficulties.  Unfortunately what we are seeing is what some of us referred to 16 years ago when the Good Friday Agreement was drawn up, which is being borne out again, namely an institutionalisation of sectarian division.  This is exacerbated by the Executive that was created being the implementers of Tory austerity, causing further alienation and suffering in Catholic and Protestant working class communities.  Only the resolution of these issues and of the economic crisis and only massive investment that will give young people hope for jobs and a future in the North and bring together and unite Protestant and Catholic working class people will bring about a solution.</p><p>  Did the Taoiseach have the opportunity when he spoke with Mr. Clinton about the economy and more generally to discover whether he reflected at all upon the eight years of his presidency?  During those eight years, the bulk of the liberalisation and deregulation of the financial markets, of the speculators and of the big international bankers, happened on his watch, resulting in the disastrous crash of 2007-2008 which created untold suffering.  Did the Taoiseach get the chance to reflect on that with the former President and did he draw any conclusions in regard to the economic policies he was responsible for which have wreaked such havoc?  </p><p>  The Taoiseach mentioned Irish Aid, which does very good work and when I was on the Committee of Public Accounts, I often had cause to look into that work.  The Taoiseach mentioned the Clinton Foundation, which describes itself as working for global health and wellness and convening businesses and governments in regard to that.  Did the Taoiseach have any opportunity to reflect with the former US President that in regard to the many issues of poverty and distress in Africa, to which the Taoiseach referred, a fraction of the obscene spending by global powers, including the United States, on armaments and weapons of mass destruction could be diverted to resolve the problems of poverty and all that goes with it in many of the countries of Africa and elsewhere and would amount to far more than what is raised in huge efforts by generous and ordinary people around the world?   Did the Taoiseach get the opportunity to reflect with him on that or on why he has now realised these issues are there, but did not divert huge resources away from military spending and weapons of mass destruction when he was US President?</p><p>  As the Taoiseach knows, many of the problems, such as water borne diseases, which cause havoc for people in poor countries could be resolved in a matter of a few years with the necessary investment, no-how and technique that could be invested if resources were diverted from the obscene industry of armaments.  I am curious to hear whether the Taoiseach got the chance to reflect on any of those more radical ways of looking at the problems of our society and the responsibility of the current global political and economic establishment for those problems.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800023#V00100"><p>As stated earlier, we discussed the former President's views on Ukraine and how suddenly one part of it, namely Crimea, was annexed.  He was interested in explaining the work of the Clinton Global Initiative in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.  The former President has an enormous grasp of global politics and, as a result of his experience, of the geopolitics of the Middle East and other regions.  We did not discuss his own presidency.  It is clear, however, that during his first term of office there were quite a number of difficulties with the US economy as a result of certain decisions that were made.  By the end of his second term, the economy was in good shape and running a strong surplus.  After the crash, America obviously dealt with its banks in a different way from Europe.  Banks in the US were stuffed with money - regardless of whether they wanted it - and the question of liquidity was dealt with very quickly as a result.  As a result of the fact that it took a different route, it has taken Europe much longer to come close to getting its house in order.</p><p>  The level of expenditure on armaments is absolutely enormous.  However, it is not for me to speak about other countries and the decisions they make in terms of how they spend their military budgets.  I was fascinated by President Clinton's interest in and knowledge of villages in Africa on which the attention of the Clinton Global Initiative has been focused for some time.  He possesses an in-depth knowledge of the various kinds of small farm that exist in these areas and also of the quality of soil available and the need for it to be treated or irrigated.  Clinton Global Initiative operatives return to the villages in question on numerous occasions in order to explain to farmers how to properly husband vegetables and other crops and to outline to them that they have the capability to reach local markets and obtain higher prices for their produce.  The latter results in these people receiving small amounts of income that are very proportionately very beneficial to them.</p><p>  The work of the initiative speaks for itself.  For example, in one of its valuable schemes, more than 300,000 women are receiving treatment in order to block the transmission of HIV from mothers to children.  I recall visiting the facilities of the Merck pharmaceutical company in New Jersey where the drug to combat a parasitic eye disease is produced.  That drug has been distributed free of charge for many years now and its use has helped to practically wipe out that terribly debilitating disease, which causes blindness and which is carried by insects that are found along the course of certain rivers in Africa.  The former President was very anxious to continue dialogue with Ireland in the context of the work done by the Clinton Global Initiative.  He is interested in further developments with the Irish Dairy Board and in opportunities relating to basic products such as milk.  We did not debate global armaments, but the former President was interested in the outcome of the partnership between Ireland and the Clinton Global Initiative and the impact it is having on the lives of so many people on the African continent.</p></speech>

I am a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, although I play a very modest role.  This is proof that one can be opposed to aspects of US foreign policy and other policies - which I am - while at the same time supporting the good work done by organisations such as the Clinton Global Initiative.  In so far as is possible, I try to brief President Clinton, and others who remain in influential positions, about what is happening here.  I also try to learn what is happening in other parts of the world.</p><p>  I agree with an Teachta Martin that discussing in July issues relating to a meeting that occurred in March is not the best way to do business.  I am of the view that it is fortuitous in this instance, however, because we are on the cusp of the Twelfth and we are in a position to visit these matters of grave importance.  What is happening here is not a uniquely Irish experience.  As the former President, his wife, Hillary, and I would say, the primacy of dialogue is central to any process of problem solving.  The reality is that we must be accurate in how we describe the problem.  An Teachta Martin knows that the difficulties in the process at present have been caused by negative leadership from within political Unionism.  I understand why Unionists are behaving as they are at present.  It is because they are trying to prevent, dilute and delay progress.  Citizens also have the right to protest, however, provided it is done peacefully and in a way which is not offensive.  Of course, therefore, I would uphold the right of citizens to go out and protest against decisions taken by the police.  It is entirely proper and appropriate for them to do so.</p></speech>

The fact is that there are difficulties which will continue to present and which will create crises.  The way to handle that is never to allow matters to reach the point of crisis.  In other words, we must nourish and nurture all of the processes involved and work at developing them.  We constantly return to the issue of dialogue.  The Governments must uphold the primacy of dialogue.  The Taoiseach faces a challenge in this regard.  I met the British Prime Minister last week and I am in a position to state that he knows as much about the North of Ireland as I know about Outer Mongolia.  Mr. Cameron just does not understand the position because he is a Tory and a Unionist.  The fact is that he is in breach of serious obligations and responsibilities under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  His Government is a co-equal guarantor with the Irish Government in upholding the various agreements.  If there is an element of slippage in the process of engagement in terms of the institutional infrastructure or the rights of citizens, then action must be taken.</p><p>  As I informed Mr. Cameron last week, this matter relates to the rights of citizens.  We have the right to Act na Gaeilge, to a bill of rights, to a charter of rights across the island, to a specific forum, to non-partisan public service policing, to access to education for our children and to the allocation of funding to underprivileged and disadvantaged areas on the basis of objective need.  Those are our rights as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government faces a challenge in upholding them.  The former US President, Mr. Clinton, and his spouse, the former US Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, know the nature of that challenge inside out.</p><p>  As this discussion has been taking place, I have received a text indicating that the parties in the Northern Executive have agreed a statement - on the initiative of the Deputy First Minister - calling upon everyone to remain calm, uphold the law and so on.  That is a good development, even if it does just reflect common sense.  We met the Taoiseach last night and I know he is seized of the difficulties involved.  The focus in the coming days must be to keep calm on the streets but also to prepare for September - the Unionists will not do any work during July - and ensure that a pro-Agreement axis emerges, provides leadership and progresses matters.  That is how we will encourage positive leadership within Unionism.</p><p>  As stated earlier, the vast majority of people, even those in the Unionist community, do not support what is happening in Ardoyne.</p><p>Even those in the Orange Order in rural areas do not support what is happening in Belfast.  Let us consider the cost.  It has cost &pound;10 million to police an illegal encampment on Twaddell Avenue.  The issues include upholding the law, supporting the Police Service of Northern Ireland in its need to do its duty responsibly and, in particular, preparing for the autumn and a process in which people should hit the ground running.  That is the challenge facing the Government.</p></speech>

The issue is important.  In recent days I was reminded of the importance of the phrase that in this world we all have to "get along".  The phrase was used by Senator Bill Nelson in his words of welcome on 4 July at the US ambassador's residence to the people who had been invited.  He was an astronaut who had travelled around the globe.  He was asked about the most significant experience in that journey around the Earth.  He said the peoples of the Earth were one family, that he could not see the distinctions of borders, political parties, religions or anything else, that the Earth was the home of the human race and, to use the American phrase, that we had to learn to get along.  He is right.  I call on the Taoiseach, in his detailed endeavours and discussions, to keep to that agenda.  Yesterday Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Secretary General of NATO, of which Ireland is not a member, pointed out that last year Russian military expenditure increased by 50% on the figure for the previous year.  Meanwhile, the NATO alliance reduced its expenditure by 20%.  The significant events that have occurred on the globe to which Senator Bill Nelson referred include the invasion of Crimea, the troubles in Ukraine and the Middle East, the platform that is Iran, the collapse of the fragile government of Iraq and Syria's destruction of its own people.  The Iranian ambassador to Ireland will be before an Oireachtas committee tomorrow.  I will remind him that in Paris-----</p></speech>

I was critical of the Northern Ireland First Minister's response to the independent adjudication of the Parades Commission by withdrawing from the North-South Ministerial Council and the talks, a point not acknowledged by the Deputy in any way.  I did not get a clear answer.  Did the Taoiseach speak to the First Minister about his decision to withdraw from an institution created under the Good Friday Agreement?  Does the Taoiseach intend to have discussions with him at some stage to ensure a continued honouring of the agreements former President Clinton and others worked to create together in good faith?</p><p>  I make the point that this applies both ways.  I think the First Minister was wrong, but the Deputy First Minister was also wrong.  Policing is a very sensitive issue in Northern Ireland and trying to suggest it is about the right to protest is stretching it too far.  If a person is a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, he or she cannot simply decide he or she does not like the decision to arrest a certain person.  I am not referring to Deputy Gerry Adams's arrest; there was the arrest of another Sinn F&eacute;in member over a year ago.  It is not on for a member of the policing board to decide that he or she does not like the police arresting one of his or her party members and then decide to join in and lead the protests outside a police station.  That undermines confidence among the community in the policing institution.</p><p>  It is time for political leaders, irrespective of their viewpoint, to have a sense of accepting the independence of the institutions established under the Agreement which must enjoy public confidence.  If they do not have the necessary public confidence, whether it be the policing board or the Parades Commission, they undermine these institutions and do so at their peril, but that is what has been going on.</p><p>  Will the Taoiseach meet the British Prime Minister?  Is there a need for a meeting?  I imagine the Taoiseach must have discussed the matter with former President Clinton at their meeting.  Is there a need for a stronger bilateral governmental response on these issues?  Since the devolution of justice issues, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have stated at Hillsborough Castle that they will sort out the issue of parading.  They suggested taking it from the Parades Commission.  Three years ago Sinn F&eacute;in agreed to take away the role of the Parades Commission.  Then came the Haass talks.  The idea was to put the matter in the hands of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  That amounts to taking it from an independent context and moving it into a political context.  Given what has happened this week, what chance does it have?  Are we seriously suggesting this could sort out the issue of parading?  The parties have not resolved their differences on parading, despite stating to all concerned that they would sort it out.  They made their points and knew about the issue better than anyone else, including the British Prime Minister, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  They stated they would sort it out, despite having spent the previous 12 months asking the two Governments to become involved.  That is the other scenario.  When things go wrong, the Governments are asked to come in quickly.  Then, they are asked to go away again because the parties reckon they will sort it out.  However, it has not been.  That is the problem and we are where we are coming up to 12 July, which is concerning.  I am pleased that the Northern Ireland Executive has come out with its statement, but we could have done without the withdrawal from the institutions this week.  Is there a need for the two Governments to re-examine where they situate the adjudication on parades from a policy perspective?</p></speech>

That is important in the week that is in it.  </p><p>  The reality is that working-class people of my acquaintance in the North on both sides of the community dread the increase in sectarian tensions at this time of year.  Young people dread the menace spread, essentially by a minority of bigots and people who are sectarian who are, of course, on both sides.  Trade unions, shop stewards and community activists are the ones who have the solution to cut across sectarian divisions and bring people together around their common interests.  Of course, there is a balance of rights.  There is a right to march.  There is also the right of communities not to be assaulted by offensive marches.  However, the solution and balance must be found from within the communities.  That is the crucial issue.  The arrangement must come from working class people, rather than sectarian politicians who only exacerbate the situation.</p><p>  Reference was made to former President Clinton.  The next time he meets him, will the Taoiseach put to him the points and contradictions I have put to the Taoiseach initially in respect of what he now professes to stand for and what the economic system he implemented means in reality?</p><p>To add a further contradiction, the businesses with which he is working, from which he is trying to get funding and to do this and that internationally are the very same giant multinationals that robbed the tax system blind around the world and used every possible device to minimise the taxes they pay on incredible profits that, according to the financial press, are unprecedented and just lying in bank accounts in various financial institutions, tax havens and so on around the world.  These resources are desperately needed to resolve the problems of our society.</p><p> The Taoiseach should ask former President Clinton to ask those people about the contradiction in sometimes giving a few bob in the interests of humanity while robbing blind the taxation systems, including of the poorest countries, by routing through other countries, including Ireland, which assists the stealth removal of taxes from some of the poorest countries on Earth.  Is that not shameful?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800025#X00200"><p>Deputy Adams talked about dialogue as central to problem solving, and this is true.  Clearly after so many years, when the Good Friday Agreement came about, it put an end to terrorist activities and 3,000 people being bombed and shot and murdered.  Obviously, people sat down around tables at the end of the day and decided in the best interests of everybody in the communities that these things should end.  Negative leadership is of little value.  It causes disillusionment and despair and a sense of hopelessness.  There is always an answer to conflict issues.  Politics and strong leadership can provide a motivation and an incentive for people to believe in that and to see that it actually happens.</p><p>  Maybe the British Prime Minister knows more about outer Mongolia than most of us.  I am not sure from my conversations with him.  He is engaged about places in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, I take Deputy Adams's comment in the way in which he gave it.  I am quite sure that, if he engaged deeply with the British Prime Minister, he would be able to explain what it is he does know about Northern Ireland.</p><p>  Yes, Acht na Gaeilge is an issue.  I am glad the Executive and the Assembly have accepted the motion from the deputy First Minister.  Speaking at the meeting last night, obviously he was concerned about what might happen.  This is a good thing to have, that there is a unanimous response to a call for calm heads and sanity here at a time of great sensitivity towards the weekend.  I am glad also that the Deputy made the point that the average person of the Unionist persuasion does not support this kind of activity and that those who were responsible before for violence and conflict in these kinds of situations do not have the support of the ordinary people.  I think that is certainly an issue.</p><p>  Deputy Martin raised the point as to whether we should engage again with the British Prime Minister.  I am sending over the senior personnel from the Civil Service here to Downing Street this week.  I mentioned that to the Prime Minister on Sunday.  If it is necessary, I will either talk to him or I do not have a problem in arranging a meeting if it is worthwhile doing it.</p><p>  I think the issue here, of course, is tied up in domestic politics as well to an extent.  The Unionist parties do seem to have moved away from the centrality of the support for the Good Friday Agreement, which is so important to its being concluded successfully.  I hope they get back onto that patch again and that we do not have a drift, as the Deputy pointed out in his question earlier.  We will keep a very close eye on this, Deputy, in respect of the developments as they are in Belfast and in Northern Ireland and keep in contact with the parties and the Government in Downing Street to see how the situation evolves.</p><p>  Deputy Mathews is gone.  He did say we all have to get along - this is true.  He spoke about the astronaut out among the galaxies looking down at the Earth.</p></speech>

When Deputy Mathews referred to NATO and all of that, I recalled when I went to Berlin last week that, actually, Ireland's entry to the EEC at the time was refused by President de Gaulle on the basis that we were not members of NATO.  It was a German economic Minister who came over here in 1962 and who went back and reported that this was a country that it would be good to have join the Common Market and the EEC.  For that reason, I was able to remind them of that.</p><p>  As I said, the opportunity is here, if necessary, to engage further with the British Government.  I think the Prime Minister made the point that, from his point of view, he does not want to see a situation where it would go back to the Tony Blair days of the constant over-and-back to Downing Street.  There was a lot of negotiation, a lot of discussion, a lot of involvement about having devolved responsibility.  The Executive has the authority and the requirement to make that work.</p><p>  Deputy Higgins mentioned the contradictions between what happened then and what happens now.  A point made at a meeting held before the Olympics in London was that there was actually so much assistance available now through many multinationals for impoverished and poverty-stricken communities and villages and people in many countries in Africa.  That assistance is very far flung but needs to be developed.  The impact of that on the ground in the places mentioned by the Clinton initiative and by President Clinton himself, in the plight of the mothers in particular and the families reaping the benefit of knowledge and information and know-how in terms of growing plants and crops and being able to sell them locally in markets, was of such benefit to them.  He is very enthused about the success of that element of the initiative and, of course, in respect of HIV and the transmission of AIDS from mothers to babies.</p></speech>

Was the Secretary General at that meeting?  We are still conscious that the Minister has not articulated confidence in the Secretary General of her own Department.  I would be interested in knowing how that plays out at committee meetings.</p><p>  The Taoiseach mentioned that the health sub-committee met once in February and held a second meeting in May, or were there two in May?  According to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, a significant programme of profound change is under way in the health service.  Surely there would have been more Cabinet sub-committee meetings if that were the case.</p><p>There is a greater crisis in health now than ever before.  There is no sense of any profound change taking place.  If anything, the situation is getting worse in terms of waiting lists and so on.  The Taoiseach said the mortgage committee met once in February, and I am not sure if it met in May.  That is one Cabinet committee that has singularly failed to deal comprehensively with a chronic, ongoing problem, with up to more than 90,000 people in arrears over three months and more than 24,000 people who have not paid their full mortgage in two years.  There are major social issues emanating from that.  It seems that the only result one can detect from the policy of increasing the number of Cabinet committee meetings is that less Government activity is now open to public scrutiny.  As the Taoiseach is aware, all of these meetings are covered by Cabinet confidentiality, therefore, many of the policy workings in the groups that meet to feed into these Cabinet committees are not subject to public discussion.  Will the structure be revisited after the Cabinet reshuffle?  Given the nature of the frequency of the meetings, they do not seem to having any impact other than to take from the role of public scrutiny?</p></speech>

Considering that the new T&aacute;naiste bitterly criticised the workings of that committee and the dictatorial powers that she thought it took to itself, does he foresee a major change in the membership of that Cabinet sub-committee or in how it would work, or will the fact that the T&aacute;naiste is inside the tent now rather than outside it calm her down in regard to that particular issue?</p><p>  Second, when will the Taoiseach announce his revised Cabinet and will there be a discussion-----</p></speech>

It has met, I believe, on two occasions and the officials have met on a number of occasions in between to follow on its work programme.  I expect it will meet again next week.  The intention is that there should be a set of proposals to deal with the setting up of the statutory authority available this month which can be debated in the House.  Another element of that was the competition being put in place and in process by the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of the appointment of the Commissioner of the Garda.</p><p>  In regard to Deputy Higgins's comments, the Economic Management Council met three times in February, twice in March and once in May.  </p><p>  Deputy Martin asked whether the structure of the Cabinet sub-committees will be revisited.  These used to operate irregularly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays - I tend to do them one Monday in the month.  They are substantial meetings and, from my point of view, they are a very good facility to bring a conclusion to processes that are going on in Departments for a very long time, then they go to Cabinet for decision, acceptance or whatever, having been discussed and concluded at the Cabinet sub-committee meetings.  I find they are a method of being able to timeline and force conclusions on issues that have been around for a long time.  I do not propose any change in that structure; I find it works well.  It is quite important to say that the outcome of them goes to Cabinet for final decision and obviously for discussion afterwards.  </p><p>  In regard to Deputy Higgins's comment, any time new people are appointed to Cabinet, there must be a debate and a vote on it in the D&aacute;il and that will take place in the event of new faces in new places in the not too distant future and the Deputy will have an opportunity to make his comments.</p></speech>

I am glad to note that all of the commentators who were very strident in their views in that regard have now focused on the requirement of the Government and Minister for Finance to meet our target of 3% by 2015.  We are in a different space.  Obviously, in recent times things have been very difficult for many people.  It is hoped that during the lifetime of this Government the benefits arising from their sacrifices can be fed back to them.  The T&aacute;naiste, whom I congratulate on her appointment, and I have not yet concluded our deliberations on the economic policy agenda for the remainder of the lifetime of this Government.</p><p>  I am aware of Deputy Dooley's interest in the matter that is quite controversial.  This appears to have been very badly handled all round.</p></speech>

However, there is a planning process in place which is the law.  That planning process allows for only three concerts to be held this year.  I understand that this will not now happen.  Even if Deputy Dooley's Bill were accepted, it is now too late in that the singer involved, Garth Brooks, in terms of his integrity and credibility as a performer and artist, has stated that he will perform five concerts or none.  I am sure this is a great disappointment to his many hundreds of thousands of fans here.  It is a shock to the system in terms of the economy of this city and the reputation of our country.  I hope that on the next occasion these kinds of issues arise they will be more efficiently handled.  That is not to decry Deputy Dooley's Bill, which I have not yet had sight of.  Obviously, consideration will be given to it and how relevant it might be.</p></speech>

I have three questions for the Taoiseach.  On the 1961 Vienna Convention, does the Government intend to upgrade the Palestinian mission to an embassy, which status it deserves under the 1961 Vienna Convention?  Given current difficulties in the Middle East this would send a strong signal to the beleaguered people of Palestine.</p><p>  When does the Government expect to introduce legislation in respect the establishment of the Garda authority, when does the Taoiseach expect advertising in respect of the appointment of the Garda Commissioner to commence and how quickly will the successful candidate be in place?</p><p>  In June 2013, the Minister for State with responsibility for planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, initiated a review of planning issues in respect of six of seven planning authorities that were previously the subject of a review by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  When will the report of this review be published?</p></speech>

On the Garda authority and the process for the appointment of a Garda Commissioner, the advertisement for the post of Garda Commissioner will be placed in July and the legislation regarding the establishment of a committee to deal with the provision of an independent statutory Garda authority will be introduced in the autumn.  It is intended that both processes will overlap.  In other words, the process of the appointment will overlap with the development of the independent statutory authority.</p><p>  On the expert planning group, it is due to report shortly.</p></speech>

They face the prospect of being charged for the water they cannot drink safely.  I had hoped, in the context of the CER's deliberations further to Irish Water's submission to the relevant committee last week, that we might be a little further down the road in knowing how the Government or the CER might respond.  Unfortunately, in the absence of the CER informing the committee of its content and allowing proper scrutiny of it, we are no wiser about what the Government or the CER intends to do to address the continuing predicament of the people in question.  Therefore, I feel obliged to bring forward this Bill.  The water services legislation enacted by the Government earlier in the year does not cater for what is happening.   What I describe is not theoretical but the reality on the ground.  For this reason and to address the issue appropriately, I seek leave to introduce the Bill.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Government did not accept the various amendments proposed to address the issue.  There is a legislative lacuna such that when local authorities are asked to take various public estates in charge, they believe there is a legal impediment to their doing so by virtue of the fact that all water services are to be taken in charge by Irish Water.  The local authorities believe the existing legislation prevents them from taking estates in charge.  I am obliged to bring forward this Bill to address the legal impediment in order that local authorities would be able to take in charge many of the estates that dominate the countryside on foot of the large-scale developments in recent times.  It would allow local authorities to maintain them in a proper fashion in order that people can enjoy them and their localities and communities.  I ask the Government not to oppose the Bill and to seek to address, as soon as possible, the deficiency in the legislation it brought before the House earlier this year.</p></speech>

They cannot see what is happening around them, including the beautiful view and the smile on their grandchild's face.  They lose independence and confidence.  However, most cases of blindness are preventable and some 75% of them need not arise.  That they do is a scandal and a disgrace.  Treatments and therapies, including preventive therapies, are available for the four main conditions, namely, cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.  Preventable blindness is not just a Third World issue; it is also an Irish issue.</p><p>  Approximately four years ago, my brother, Anthony, became one of the 14,000 who suffered from blindness in Ireland.  My family has seen at first hand the difficulties he faces every day.  Not only do he and others like him miss seeing beautiful things, but their day-to-day working lives are also complicated by practical difficulties.   We should reflect on the fact that half of those aged over 80 years suffer from one of the four main eye diseases.  Those with a visual impairment are eight times more likely to break a hip, three times more likely to suffer from depression and are admitted to nursing homes three years sooner than others.</p><p>  It is not only the human cost that I want to consider because there are serious economic costs associated with sight loss.  Blindness in Ireland cost &euro;386 million in 2010 and that figure is expected to rise with current trends to &euro;486 million by 2020.  According to the National Coalition for Vision Health in Ireland, a fully implemented strategy to reduce preventable blindness would save thousands of people from blindness and visual impairment and the Exchequer an estimated &euro;76 million per annum.  There is a need to redeploy and invest in current services to achieve these savings.  We need a national vision strategy in order that professionals can provide good care in community and hospital settings.  Imagine preventing almost 200 people a year from going blind and making a saving for the Exchequer; it is a no-brainer and makes sense.</p><p>  What do we need to do?  The National Coalition for Vision Health in Ireland argues that if we introduce interventions such as screening for cataracts and diabetic retinopathy, in addition to early intervention, we could ensure the eyesight of hundreds of people would be retained.  The human tragedy of blindness could be significantly decreased.  The national coalition believes we should have a national strategy with strategic infrastructure and resources to deliver care.  This includes attending opticians, patients accessing community and hospital-based eye services and service user groups such as the NCBI and the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.  The strength of the national vision strategy is based on a coming together across the spectrum of all the groups involved, including the NCBI, Fighting Blindness, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, ChildVision, the Irish College of Ophthalmologists, the Association of Optometrists Ireland, Diabetes Ireland and health care professionals, including Dr. David Keegan from the Mater Hospital.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position on health services for people who have a visual impairment orare blind.  It is important to emphasise that the core objective of the health service is to maximise people's health status throughout their lives.  The emphasis is on the prevention of disease and the management of health conditions at the lowest level of complexity which is safe, cost-effective and accessible to service users.  These principles inform the approach to people's eye health, in addition to the wide range of other health issues that may affect them.</p><p> There are a number of eye conditions which require specialist health services, including cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration.  There are detection and treatment services available at present in community and acute hospital settings for these conditions.  In addition, the HSE has an established a clinical ophthalmology programme to improve access, quality and cost effectiveness.</p><p> The Health Service Executive, HSE, provides a sight testing service as part of the school health screening programme.  Children who are identified as requiring treatment or intervention are referred to the HSE ophthalmic services.  Urgent cases are given priority.  Children between 12 and 16 years of age also receive services under the medical card scheme or are eligible to be seen by the HSE ophthalmic service when there is a medical reason for the eye condition, rather than refractive error.  HSE community ophthalmology services also provide assessment, information and intervention for adult medical card holders with vision disorders.  In addition, the HSE makes eye testing, treatment and optical appliances available to adult medical card holders through contracted optometrists and dispensing opticians.</p><p> The HSE is establishing an ophthalmology review group to examine issues around primary care ophthalmology services and many of the issues the Deputy has quite correctly raised this evening.  This review group will consider the changes required and will identify any matters which it considers should be addressed on a priority basis.  Screening by the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme is well under way and is on target to invite all eligible participants for screening by the end of 2014.</p></speech>

The national vision strategy is a roadmap to improved eye care in Ireland and points to an integrated care system that is effective, research evidence based and, most important, has visually impaired people at the centre of the decision making.  Professor Keegan, in his presentation to the committee last Thursday, made the very strong point that the national cancer strategy, introduced in 2006, has led to improved patient survival rates and improved patient care, as well as internationally acclaimed, ground-breaking research.  Professor Keegan firmly believes that a similar national strategy could improve the lives of the visually impaired.  As I said earlier, preventable blindness is not just a Third World issue, it is also an Irish issue.</p></speech>

I have outlined the breadth of health service provision for people with visual impairment.  The State's objectives in providing ophthalmic care include the elimination of avoidable sight loss; a focus on prevention and early intervention; equitable access to efficient high quality care, supports and treatment; to improve the quality of care; and improve cost effectiveness.  The Government remains committed to the provision and development of vision services and supports through prevention, screening and intervention, all of which contribute to address the priority goal of Vision 20/20 which is to eliminate avoidable blindness in Ireland.  I commend the Deputy on her emphasis on the importance of a national strategy and the importance of it being addressed in the way she has outlined.  The Minister and I share her objectives in that regard and I thank her for raising the matter.</p></speech>

Before that information was relayed to some of the service users, approximately 15 of those users came to my clinic yesterday morning with their concerns.  If nothing else, it gave me a first-hand insight into who these people are and how the proposed closure of this service would affect them.</p><p>  T&uacute;s Nua is a one-stop-shop for these residents.  They explained to me that essentially it has become their lifeline.  As I witnessed yesterday, these people are in perhaps the most vulnerable category of people in the area I represent in Ballymun.  They rely heavily on this service.  They see it as a place where they can drop in, and some of them drop in four or five times a week.  It is where they have opportunities to chat to a professional and to look at ways to deal with their mental health issues, be it through arts and crafts or cooking.  They also have the opportunity to look at the issue of money management and other basic life-related issues.  Clearly, they were very concerned and I have taken on their concerns, given that they are very vulnerable people.</p><p>  I understand that the proposed closure of T&uacute;s Nua, and the Minister may correct me if I am wrong in that regard, is based on a report from the HSE.  It was initiated in 2013 in the HSE north Dublin city area, which comprises part of my constituency, to review all day centres.  Obviously, given the imminent closure of the Ballymun Shopping Centre and the fact that the service is located in that shopping centre, there was a need to address the day services there, in particular.  However, my concern is the 44 or 45 service users who essentially see this centre as a lifeline.  They consider it a social outlet, a support structure and a learning environment.  I received an e-mail from the daughter of one of the service users in which she told me that the only time her mother goes out during the week is to visit the service.</p><p>  The people who use the service are exceptionally vulnerable.  They are fearful of change.  Fundamentally, they must be cared for and their needs must be taken into account before there are any changes.  I am hearing proposals that some of these people might have to use a service elsewhere, such as in Coolock or further afield.  These are people who will not get on a bus by themselves.  This centre is located within less than a mile from their home.  They can walk to the shopping centre, go into the day centre and have that connection.  Often, that connection makes the difference between seeing the sun or not seeing it in their lives that day.  I am very fearful and the service users are exceptionally fearful of what change might lie ahead.</p><p>  I do not see why it is necessary to have a day service outside Ballymun when there is one in Ballymun already.  Ballymun must continue to have a day centre mental health service provision.  Not only that, it must be a high-quality service provision.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on this.  Incidentally, I have been trying to get my hands on the report that suggests these changes but I have been unable to access it.  It is hard to have a proper debate on this matter when some of the information has not been made available to me.  I understand the information is probably private but it is hard to debate an issue when one does not know everything about why the report is making these proposals.</p></speech>

North Dublin mental health services provide a range of adult mental health services within the specialties of general psychiatric, psychiatry of old age and a rehabilitation psychiatry service.  This encompasses various settings such as service user homes, acute inpatient facilities, day hospitals, day centres and supported community residences.  The service the Deputy refers to, which is community based with a focus on recovery principles, is delivered by consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams incorporating staff from a range of disciplines, including nursing, social work, occupational health and psychology.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct that in 2013 the HSE, as part of the Dublin north city mental health service plan, identified the need to review all day centres within the area in line with A Vision for Change.  A review group was established by the Dublin north city mental health management team with the following remit - to identify all mental health day centres in Dublin north city, general adult psychiatry; to review services provided within each day centre; to make recommendations, if required, to ensure that each day centre was fulfilling its brief; and, examine if clients' needs could be met in a more appropriate environment.</p><p>In the case of T&uacute;s Nua, the review group found that the day centre, which is situated on the upper floor of Ballymun shopping centre, was old and in poor condition, with only one fire exit from the building.  There is no lift access and the shutters on the front window cannot be opened due to security concerns.  Having considered all the issues, the review group recommended to the Dublin north city mental health management team that it would be best in the circumstances to close the T&uacute;s Nua facility.  It should be further added that the lease on these premises has expired and, due to the regeneration plan for Ballymun, it cannot be renewed.  In addition, the need to vacate the Ballymun shopping centre to allow the regeneration plan to proceed has left this service in a vulnerable position, and the HSE management cannot safely recommend the service continue.</p><p> I understand that the HSE is to establish an implementation group under the chairmanship of the clinical director and that an independent assessment of the needs of those attending the centre will be carried out.  This assessment of needs will inform the process going forward and will ensure that the needs of service users, which is the main preoccupation of Deputy Lyons, continue to be met.  The implementation group, as part of its remit, will communicate with all the relevant stakeholders during this period of change.  I can assure the Deputy it is not the intention of the Dublin north city mental health management team to close this facility until the process of consultation with all relevant stakeholders is complete and appropriate alternative placements have been sourced.</p><p> Any changes that arise as part of this process will be communicated to patients and staff in advance of any change taking place.  Accordingly, I would like to assure the Deputy that the HSE will, at all times, put the needs of service users to the fore in the relocation of this service.</p></speech>

However, it sounds like the door is already bolted on this issue.  It is very frustrating to see in the very last line of the response from the Department that the HSE will "put the needs of service users to the fore in the relocation of this service".  The needs are such that they cannot travel beyond where they travel to as it is.  These are people who are so isolated from the general well-being of society that getting on a bus is as traumatic as can be.  If the HSE is putting the needs of service users first, it will take into account that these are the genuine needs of many service users.  It is not that they will not, it is that they cannot.  Because of the situation in which they find themselves in their lives due to their mental health issues, they are just not able to engage in society.  They have found some way to engage with a local service in Ballymun but if they have to move to another venue outside Ballymun, it will see these people put in an even more vulnerable position.</p><p>  I am not playing to the gallery.  I witnessed these people yesterday.  They are so bloody vulnerable that they will not be in a position to travel elsewhere.  If the HSE thinks it is acceptable to assess their needs and to ignore the reality that most of these people cannot get on a bus and engage in the way we do, it is not listening to their needs. </p><p>  We all know of the shopping centre issue.  However, where there is a will, there is a way.  The HSE, with Dublin City Council, has a social inclusion unit.  It needs to look at these people within their community and see what can be done with the new buildings in Ballymun in the hope that the new service can be located within the area, so all 44 or 45 members can continue to access this service.</p></speech>

I understand the points he has articulated in regard to the individuals concerned.  He has obviously met with the people concerned and he has a good appreciation of their needs and, perhaps, the limitations that apply in regard to people's ability to travel or to transfer.  I understand that.  While I would not hazard any further response in regard to the detail of this because I simply do not know all of the individual details, I would reasonably expect, as I know the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, would, that those needs and limitations would be taken fully into account in regard to the planning of alternative facilities to address the very obvious needs that exist.</p><p>  I assure the Deputy I will relay to the Minister of State, the Department, the officials concerned and the HSE the importance of taking completely on board all aspects of the situation which the Deputy has articulated.  I thank him again for raising the issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800030#CC00400"><p>On 28 June, for the second time in a month, the same fishing vessel was arrested and brought in by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  As the Minister knows probably better than I, Kilmore Quay is a small fishing village whose entire vibrancy and economy are built around the small fishing sector.  Whether it is the number of people employed, both onshore and offshore, or the ancillary services, such as oil deliveries, other service deliveries and food deliveries for the fishermen, all of it is intertwined.  The whole community is totally dependent on the success of fishing.</p><p>  A number of years ago the issue of discards and by-catch came to a head when fishermen from Kilmore Quay landed discards and gave them away.  Many people believe that, as a consequence, they have been targeted by the SFPA, which is probably embarrassed.  In any case, the perception is there, true or otherwise.  I do not know of any fishing vessel that has had any serious charges made against it as a consequence of fishing.</p><p>  When they landed the discarded fish and gave it away, this generated a wider debate among the public about how so many tonnes of good fish were being dumped overboard on a daily basis.  It created that conversation and debate both within the country and further afield, and maybe they can claim some credit in regard to the negotiations around the proposals to try to alleviate the discards problem in the coming years, not to take anything away from the Minister, Deputy Coveney.</p><p>  My point is that this is a community totally dependent on the fishing sector for survival.  It is a very vibrant community and the fishing sector provides a lot of employment, onshore in particular.  However, people who are trying their best to make a living are being handicapped by the lack of proper quota.  All of this is contributing to the frustration and anger that is felt by the people involved in the sector, who are finding it hard to make a living.  They have had a terrible time, with the whole fishing sector closed down from mid-December through to well into March, when nothing could happen because of the weather.  As is well documented, there were the consequences of the storms, including their effect on the pier structures in the area.  These people are just trying to make a living, not just for themselves but for the community.</p><p>  The big problem is lack of quota.  While it has been an ongoing problem for decades, something has to be done in order to ensure these people will have adequate quota to make a proper living and to survive in the industry.  If they do not survive, that is another generation gone.  It is this sector, not the big herring and mackerel sectors, that is suffering the consequences of very bad negotiations going back over the decades.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800030#CC00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I know he is genuine in this regard as we have previously discussed his connection with the fishing industry.</p><p>  Everyone wants more quota.  Whether it is a whitefish boat, a mackerel boat or any other part of the quota fleet here in Ireland, everyone wants more quota.  The quota for Ireland this year is more valuable than it has ever been at over &euro;250 million, and it was something similar last year.</p><p>I will always try to maximise the quota opportunities for Irish fishermen.  I will always talk this industry up and work with it to maximise employment and income opportunities for fishermen.  However, I will not accept that because people are frustrated at a lack of quota, they can break the rules.  Breaking the rules means that other people lose out.  To be consistent with European law, the primary responsibility in terms of enforcement lies with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, which is an independent law enforcement agency of the State.  I do not get involved in its day-to-day operations, nor should I.  It has a difficult job to do but its job is to provide a level playing field for everybody.  If one boat, or two or six boats, are overfishing deliberately, that is not a victimless crime.  It has an impact on others who are law-abiding and who are catching according to the quotas allocated to them when less quota is allocated the following month, because catches outside of quota count towards the calculation of the quotas allocated on a monthly basis, in a process in which the industry is involved.  If we are unable to comply with the rules we negotiated last year, this also fundamentally undermines my position in December when I am trying to negotiate better quotas and improved total allowable catch, TAC, for fishing fleets around the coast.  </p><p> The company at the centre of the case raised by the Deputy unfortunately has a history of non-compliance.  Repeated infringements have arisen around quota, log books and sales regulations.  There are some 54 files awaiting hearing before Irish courts.  In 2013, the SFPA took the exceptional step of directing all of this company's vessels to port as a reaction to persistent non-compliance.  Following a solemn undertaking by the company directors after a meeting I had with them to work within the requirements of the law, the company was allowed to resume fishing.  However, less than a week later the infringements recommenced, and there have been six infringements detected on this company's vessels since the beginning of this year.  SFPA officers have endured verbal abuse on an ongoing basis from the company's employees and directors in some cases and also, I am sorry to hear, from some public representatives simply for implementing EU and national law involving quota allocations recommended by the industry itself on a monthly basis.  </p><p> The SFPA has an obligation under EU rules to link historical non-compliance with current levels of inspection.  In other words, a risk assessment of boats is carried out in terms of likelihood of breaking the rules.  The more infringements a boat has had in the past, the more inspections it will get in the future, until it proves that it is compliant over time.  That is not a voluntary policy option for the SFPA.  It is a requirement under EU rules.  </p><p> There is a problem in Kilmore Quay.  It is a great little town that relies on fishing.  The companies involved here employ many people and they are a very valuable contributor to the economy in the south east, but we must apply the rules to everybody equally.  The policing authority that ensures there is a fair playing field for every fisherman out there must apply the rules according to EU regulations.  That means that the more infringements boats have had in the past, the more inspections they will get in the future in the medium term until the number of infringements changes.  There is an onus here on everybody, and particularly on public representatives from all political parties, to be consistent in ensuring that we are implementing the rules fairly, so that everybody complies with the same rules.  We cannot allow some people to do what they want because of frustrations with a lack of quota.  That is what has happened here.  I strongly support the SFPA in its efforts to ensure that everybody gets fair treatment.  I want to encourage anybody who is breaking the rules to stop doing so because they are fundamentally undermining the industry when that happens.</p></speech>

As someone who was involved in the industry, I know the difficulties fishermen endure on a daily basis and the risks they take.  I also know how difficult it is to be heavily in debt and trying to meet payments, by they to BIM or any other financial company.  I am also very much aware of the responsibility that boat owners have to their crew and community.  One would assume from the Minister's answer that these people are criminals.</p></speech>

One would assume they were criminals.  They are people out in the ocean fishing to make a living who have many obligations to live up to.  It is not always possible to do so due to the weather or because they are unable to get their logs in on time.  They could be minor misdemeanours.  What I find impossible to understand is that there is a requirement under EU law for the SFPA to carry out more inspections on a person with a history.  I think that is disgraceful.  We are not talking about people who have done anything terribly wrong.  They may be slightly over quota, may have had some discard on board or may not have logged in properly, but there are no serious charges against any one of these people that I know of.</p></speech>

Perhaps I could do so afterwards, because this is something I feel very strongly about.  The EU regulation in question, which is Article 98 of Regulation (EU) No. 404/2011, requires member states' controlled authorities to adopt a risk-based approach for the selection of inspection targets using all available information.  It can be expected that if records indicate that an operator has a history of serious non-compliance, the operator will face additional inspections at sea and in port for a period of time until the records show that the operator has changed behaviour and is generally compliant.  The records show that in 2013 and 2014, there were 66 infringements in the south eastern area of the country, 41 of which were associated with boats linked to the company whose concerns the Deputy is raising today.</p></speech>

There are 41 of them, so I am not going to start listing them here today.  I would like to think that there is nobody in this House who is more concerned about the future of the fishing industry than me.  I worked tirelessly to ensure that we got the best possible deal in a Common Fisheries Policy.  We have more than doubled our European Maritime and Fisheries Fund from the &euro;70 million negotiated by the last Government to &euro;148 million this year, and we will match or part-match that fund with Exchequer money, which needs to be negotiated over the summer.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that we want to support the fishing industry in Kilmore Quay and elsewhere, but we must ensure that people abide by the rules.  If we do not ensure that and if people consider this a free-for-all, we will simply lose control of the management of stocks, we will have no fishing industry in the future and fishermen themselves will become deeply divided in terms of the way in which quotas are managed and fished.  We need consistency here and we are trying to get it in Kilmore Quay.  There is a problem in the south east from an enforcement and infringement point of view which needs to be resolved.  Public representatives have a responsibility to help in that effort rather than frustrate it.</p></speech>

The affordability and accessibility of child care has been brought to my attention - and, I am sure, the Minister's attention - time and again by parents, professionals working in the area and various early childhood sector stakeholders.  The 2014 report Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care in Europe, published jointly by Eurydice and EUROSTAT, is the latest in a long list of reports that cast a worrying focus on the affordability and accessibility of child care in Ireland.  One of the key findings in the report is that at all income levels, the cost of early childhood care and education services in Ireland is among the highest in the OECD.  In previous reports, it was highlighted as the second highest.  In some cases, the cost outstrips parents' weekly mortgage bills.</p><p>  Earlier, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, in a pre-budget submission to my party, cited the cost of child care as a cause of deep financial strain for suffering families.  It also stated that this acted as a barrier preventing people, particularly women in low-income families, from returning to the workforce.  This needs to be addressed quickly, because access to high-quality and affordable child care has a major positive impact on a child's future educational and life chances.  This is a well accepted argument across the political divide, but we also need to be highly cognisant of connecting factors in the child's life, the critical importance of the family environment, welfare dependency, mental health issues and child poverty.  Unless we look on both the quality of child care and family support as inseparable, success may prove too tall an order for each in isolation.</p><p>  Ireland currently only spends 0.2% of GDP on pre-primary education.  The Nordic countries are often referenced for comparison; Sweden spends 0.7% of GDP in this sector, while Denmark spends 0.8% of GDP.  At a time of financial constraint, we need to gradually increase in our investment in this area.  We must begin by adopting a targeted approach to provide greater supports to middle- and low-income families that are finding it difficult.</p><p>  Prior to the Minister's taking office, my party tabled a Private Members' motion earlier this year on investment in child care and affordability.  It is important that, no matter what policy initiatives are taken to address this key issue, the quality of our services is never undermined.  They must be of paramount consideration.  Earlier this year, a nationwide report commissioned by the Donegal County Childcare Committee brought forward fully costed proposals to address this issue for the future.  At the time, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Fitzgerald, who launched the report and who lauded and complimented it, promised to give attention to its contents.  She promised to review the two schemes in place to support low-income families in respect of child care provision, including the early childhood care and education scheme.  Will the Minister outline what his Department has done over the past six months to address this crucial issue?</p></speech>

I welcome very much the publication of this report, which provides most useful comparisons on the structure and organisation of early childhood education and care in the countries that comprise the European Union.  This most comprehensive report has only recently been published and it will require careful consideration by officials in my Department.</p><p>  The report provides a European-level analysis of progress in the development of early childhood care and education across the region.  It covers a wide range of issues relating to early child care provision, including governance, accessibility and affordability, and is based on information provided by 32 European countries.</p><p>In Ireland, early childhood care relates to children in the age range from zero to six and is provided through private commercial and community services.  We assist parents by ensuring that there is sufficient quality infrastructure and by providing support funding which enables parents to access high-quality child care services.  The Government provides approximately &euro;260 million annually to help parents with the cost of child care.  This funding is provided through a number of targeted programmes which benefit approximately 100,000 children each year.  In many cases these supports are provided based on the income level or social welfare entitlement of the parents and are not universal supports.</p><p> Many European countries provide early years places for children by establishing a legal entitlement to or by making compulsory one pre-primary year.  In Ireland, the introduction of the free universal early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme in 2010 was major milestone in the development of early childhood services in this country.  The programme represents an annual investment of almost &euro;175 million and ensures that approximately 68,000 children have guaranteed access to high-quality preschool services each year.</p><p> The report highlights the diversity of child care services throughout the European countries.  It highlights aspects of child care provision in this country which could be considered to be in the lower half of the European league.  In Ireland, before 2010, the emphasis was on ensuring there was sufficient infrastructure to meet the increased demands of the expanding Irish economy.  The considerable capital investment made in this area between 1998 and 2010 has ensured that there is sufficient child care infrastructure, and the emphasis must switch to addressing quality issues and providing services that are affordable and accessible to this and future generations of Irish children.</p><p> Some of the issues raised in the report have already been identified in the early years quality agenda which is being advanced by my Department and on which considerable progress has been made.  For example, on the issue of qualifications of staff working in the child care sector, the report highlights the fact that Ireland is one of two countries where no minimum formal qualification is required.  The matter has been addressed and the necessary legislative changes are coming into place to ensure that by 2015 all staff will have a minimum level of educational qualification if they are to work directly with children in the child care sector.</p><p> The early years quality agenda is designed to ensure Irish children will be in a position to enjoy standards of care and education in Irish preschool settings that are on par with the best international standards.  The provision of funding to support the new learner fund to assist staff in securing the new qualification requirements and the further funding allocated to support a specialist support service for child care providers are examples of the urgency the Government attaches to improving the quality of child care services.  Considerable progress has been made during the past 15 years in the development of child care services.  Opportunities to further develop the child care sector have been limited because of the prevailing budgetary situation, as Deputy Troy and others will accept.  However, the progress made since 2010 represents a clear commitment to improving access to high-quality child care.  While we have a distance to travel, we must be satisfied that our services match the best in Europe.</p></speech>

Last week, the one-parent family payment cut-off was reduced to seven years of age.  Of the 6,000 places available under the after-school scheme, which was introduced to alleviate this and of which we spoke last week during Question Time, only 40 have been taken up.  The Government has reduced child benefit and announced it would tax maternity benefit one week after launching a report that recommends extending maternity benefit to one year.</p><p>  I asked about affordability in particular.  Will affordability be addressed in the early years strategy?  When will the strategy be published?  Has the Department started the review of the community child care subvention, CCS, and child care education and training support, CETS, schemes?  While the Minister is working under tight financial constraints, the Indecon report commissioned by the Donegal County Childcare Committee puts forward three very realistic proposals that would ensure a targeted approach to ensuring affordability for middle-income and low-income families.  One of these proposals was to extend the CCS scheme, which is capped and restricted to community providers.  The previous Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, agreed to review the proposal.  Will the scheme be extended to private providers and will the cap be lifted?  Will the Minister, with his colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, consider addressing child care through the family income supplement?  We must stop paying lip service to this extremely important societal issue and introduce policies to address this critical problem.</p></speech>

Deputies will be aware of the very stringent financial parameters within which we are operating.  I accept the Deputy's point that the Donegal report is a most valuable piece of evidence and it feeds into the review under way in my Department.  The issue of early childhood education will be a priority not only for my Department but for the whole Government as part of its programme for the remainder of its term.  Deputy Troy has agreed with me that quality is important, that progress has been made over the years on infrastructure and that we need to examine standards and personnel in the provision of education to ensure a minimum standard across the board.  We must provide access to high-quality universal education that is particularly geared towards those on low incomes and is most affordable to those who engage in the process.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; an rud at&aacute; i gceist anseo n&aacute; go mbeimid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an sti&uacute;ir at&aacute; tugtha &oacute;n Aire.</p><p> Much of this has come from Committee Stage proceedings.  The concern is that directions issued by the Minister of the day will not be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and could not be annulled by a resolution of the Houses within 21 days.  A concern raised by the Minister of State on Committee Stage was that this amendment could prejudice the validity of anything arising within the 21 day period.  While there is a mistake in the wording, what we have done conceptually to address that concern is to provide that anything which has taken place in relation to a direction would not be invalidated by a resolution of the Houses where it occurred within the period prior to the resolution being made.  It is very important given the other sections in Act.</p><p> The Minister of State said that a direction by a Minister is not as important as an order.  An order under section 4 must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and could be annulled but it is stated that a direction does not carry the same weight.  I point out to the Minister of State section 19(5) of the Bill, which allows the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to give a direction with the consent of the Minister to the agency as to the performance of its function under the section and requires that the agency shall comply with any such directions.  There are numerous references to directions within the Act.  This one is more severe than others as it also provides that the agency shall comply with any such direction.  It refers to directions under section 19, which are directions whereby the Minister can direct the agency to sell off some of its assets.  Section 19(3) deals, for example, with the acquisition or disposal of any interest or asset of the designated body.  This is where the potential privatisation of a State asset comes into question.  Where that happens, it will not be by way of an order but of a direction of the Minister.</p><p> When we look at the definition and rules governing directions, we see no requirement to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas, nor do we see a provision that the Houses can annul them within the next 21 days of sitting.  That is what our amendment seeks to do.  I do not understand why this provision would not be accepted by Government.  The Minister has said that the Government has a majority in the Houses of the Oireachtas and that this is just run-of-the-mill stuff.  Why do we allow for an order in that case?  If an order must be subject to the safety net of being laid before the Houses and to a power to annul, why is the same safety net not provided for in respect of a direction, particularly given the significance of the directions that can be given under section 19(5) of the Bill?</p></speech>

That section contains a standard provision requiring that orders made by the Minister be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by a resolution of either House within 21 days.  The practice in legislative drafting is that where an Act gives a Minister a power to do something that expands the scope of the Act, such as extending the list of entities to which the legislation will apply, the power shall be exercised by way of a regulation or order made by the Minister.  It will be provided that such regulation or order must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the Bill, orders are required to add to the list of bodies to which NewERA may provide advice, to add to the list of sectors where NewERA may develop investment proposals, to add to the list of bodies within the NDFA's remit and in respect of a number of instances in Part 5 which relate to the State Claims Agency.  The provisions generally expand the scope of the Act and it is appropriate that they should be laid before the Houses and that the Houses should have the opportunity to consider them.  This is normal practice for secondary legislation.</p><p>  Acts may also contain provisions allowing Ministers to issue executive instructions on the administration of a function under such Acts.  There is no set term for such executive instructions but the word usually used is &quot;direction&quot;.  The word &quot;instruction&quot; is also used in the Bill in relation to certain provisions being carried over from the existing National Development Finance Agency Act 2002.  There is no convention that directions and instructions are published.  Directions can be given under a number of sections in the Act.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may issue directions to State authorities on the financing of public investment projects.  The Minister for Finance and the Attorney General may issue directions to the NTMA on the management of legal costs while the Minister for Finance may also issue directions on the final reports of the NPRF Commission and the NDFA.  These are part of the normal executive functions of Ministers.  They enable Ministers to do their jobs relating to the bodies under their aegis.  It would be completely inappropriate that every such direction should have to be laid before both Houses and be subject to annulment for a period of 21 sitting days.</p><p>  There are two notable direction provisions.  Sections 42, 43 and 47 have to do with directions given by the Minister for Finance to the agency to use ISIF funds to invest in financial institutions.  As I said on Committee Stage, this is the provision that was used to recapitalise the banks with NPRF funds during the financial crisis.  We are carrying the provision over as a sensible precautionary measure.  At this juncture, we have no wish, intention or expectation that the power will ever be used.  However, if the circumstances ever arose, it must be possible to take decisive action and inject money rapidly into the sort of crisis or time critical situation that we have seen in so many countries in the last decade.  It will, of course, be open to the Minister for Finance to have such an intention debated in the House as time allows.  I expect that this is what would happen except in the most extreme circumstances.  Governments must have the ability to act quickly and decisively when the need arises.  Such directions may often relate to one-off transactions.  In such circumstances, I do not see how a provision that a direction may be annulled without prejudice to anything previously done under the direction could be applied.  With regard to publication generally, directions on recapitalisation may well include commercially sensitive elements as between the Minister and the NPRF.  On that basis, there should not be a blanket requirement to publish.</p><p>  There is a further power of direction in the Bill in section 19(5) whereby the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may give directions to NewERA as to the performance of its functions.  The Minister must publish such directions as soon as is reasonably practical in such manner as he or she considers appropriate.  The most obvious place is the website of the Department itself.  The proposed amendment would cut across the provision by requiring the direction to be laid before the Houses with the possibility of annulment within 21 sitting days.  Again, these directions are part of the Minister's executive functions.  The power of direction will allow the Minister to ensure that advice prepared by NewERA would take account of issues the Minister considers important.  I cannot see how it is the role of the Oireachtas to police how the Minister seeks advice up to and including annulling a direction he or she issues to ensure that the advice meets his or her needs.</p><p> The issue of directions was debated at some length on Committee Stage and, having reflected on it, we are satisfied that the provisions about directions are measured and appropriate.  As stated on Committee Stage, directions will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act and the provisions built into that legislation to ensure the commercial and other interests of the State are protected.</p></speech>

Let us deal with that.  What are designated bodies?  This is where directions can be given concerning designated bodies.  The previous section tells us that designated bodies are ESB, Ervia, Bord na M&oacute;na plc, Coillte Teoranta, EirGrid, Irish Water or any other State body specified in an order under subsection 3 or a subsidiary of any company.  It involves State agencies.  This direction under section 19(5) is that the agency shall, if a Minister of the Government who is a relevant Minister in relation to a designated body requests it to do so, provide project management services in relation to, or services consisting of overseeing the winding up, reorganisation or restructuring of the designated body.  The Minister can give a winding up direction about ESB, Ervia, Bord na M&oacute;na plc, Coillte Teoranta, EirGrid or Irish Water.  Under subsection 7, he or she would rightly have to publish this in a manner of his or her choosing.  In my view, the direction should be an order, because if it were an order it would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and be subject to the provisions whereby it could be annulled within 21 sitting days, but if it is not going to be an order, the direction carries such a significant weight that the Houses - not at the Minister's choosing, but in Irish statute law - should have the right to vote and debate those issues and annul the direction given by the Minister, not because the Cabinet decides to have a debate on the issue, as will be the practice, but because of the protection in Irish law of the designated bodies or State agencies and the direction that may be given on the reorganisation, restructuring or winding up of those agencies at any future date.</p></speech>

If, as a Minister of State, I wanted to sell off one of the designated bodies, I could only do so under the existing Acts that govern the sale of the body, should the power exist.  There is no question of privatisation or any issue such as that.  If the existing legislation, separate from this Bill, exists, then we can or cannot.  No new powers are conferred on any body.  The last day I gave the example of Irish Water and the potential issue of privatisation.  The Act expressly forbids that.  One cannot sell it and the legislation does not allow it.  The only way to do so is to pass new legislation to change the existing Act.  There is no provision in this Bill to allow anyone to override the legislation.  Whatever protocols exist in respect of other State bodies also apply to this.</p></speech>

It is a major proposal in the realm of finance.  The Bill was taken on Committee Stage in the Select Sub-Committee on Finance.  I would like the Minister of State to tell us why the Minister for Finance is not here to take the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  I mean no harm to the Minister of State, but he is a Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and I want to see the Minister responsible for the NTMA and the key finance issues in the Chamber to answer key questions about how these provisions will work.  I would like the Minister of State to provide a rationale for that.</p><p>  I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Pearse Doherty.  It is absolutely correct that any direction made under this Act, which could have serious consequences and results for the various public agencies of the State, should be brought before the D&aacute;il.  It should be made explicit in this legislation.  Far too much is passed behind the scenes without open accountability to the elected Members.  I strongly support the amendment.</p></speech>

There are many other references in the Bill to directions issued by the Minister.  Is there a complementary requirement to publish all of these directions?  If so, in what manner will this be done?</p><p>  The reference to freedom of information legislation does not inspire me, because none of us should have to be poking around such legislation to get our hands on directions issued by the Minister of the day to the agency in respect of these significant powers.  At a bare minimum, directions should be published in a timely and transparent manner.  The matter of putting them before the D&aacute;il to a vote is one I support in respect of the substantive directions but, at a minimum, they should be published in a transparent fashion.

It is not about whether the Minister of State, or any other Minister, is getting additional powers to sell off State assets.  As the sole shareholder in the company owned by the State, obviously the Minister of State has the power to sell State assets unless he is prevented from doing so by legislation.  The Bill creates a framework whereby advice can be sought from the agency to examine the disposal or reorganisation of State assets.  The legislation allows the Minister to outsource the selling of the State assets to the agency.  That is provided for in section 19.  It allows the Minister of State to sell the ESB and to engage project management in respect of the sale of the ESB.  The Minister of State can, by direction, give the authority to project manage it under section 19(3) of this legislation.  The Minister of State must publish the direction issued in a manner he sees fit, but Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad do not have to be consulted because it is not an order.</p><p>If this had to be done by order, it would have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and would have to allow them the opportunity, if they so wished, within 21 sitting days, to pass a resolution which would annul the order.  However, it is a direction rather than an order, which means the Minister can, through the way we are structuring the agency, use the power he has had up until now to ask it to project manage the sale, disposal or reorganisation of any State agency.  It is not about the Government retaining power, which means this will not make a difference.  What we are saying is that we fear what the Government may do to our State assets.  I do not believe or trust the Government or the Minister in regard to what they might do with State assets, because I know their agenda.  I know the party the Minister of State belongs to is a party that believes in privatisation.  We know the sale of State assets was part of its agreement with the troika.  We know where the Fine Gael Party is coming from and we know its ideology on this and, fair enough, it has a mandate to express that ideology.  Sinn F&eacute;in knows Fine Gael has the larger mandate and can decide what will be done with State assets, but we want to ensure the legislation gives the Houses of the Oireachtas the respect they deserve by allowing them at least to debate the issues.  We may lose the vote because of the numbers and the Whip, but at least the legislation should allow for the Houses of the Oireachtas to have a direction such as this laid before them, with the potential of annulment.  I refer to a direction issued in regard to State assets, the issue I have been speaking about up to now and which I also raised on Committee Stage.</p><p> Under section 42, there is another direction that I consider a scandalous part of this legislation.  The section concerns a direction to invest assets of the fund in specified securities of a credit institution or to underwrite or otherwise support the issue of any kind of securities of a credit institution.  Therefore, section 42 allows for directed investments to be made by the Minister into banks or credit institutions that are in trouble and provides that the agency must comply with a direction issued under this section.  Again, this direction will not be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will not be debated in this House, unless it is &quot;with the consent of the Government&quot;.  We do not trust the Government.</p><p> On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister of State how many times the previous Fianna F&aacute;il government had debated the injection of &euro;31 billion of promissory notes into Anglo Irish Bank.  On three separate occasions a promissory note was issued, but none of them ever came before the House.  The Minister of State has asked his officials whether these were supported in the House, but the issuing of a promissory note never came before the Houses, because the Government of the day was not required to lay such a direction, or whatever it was, before the Houses or to seek their consent or approval.  The Minister of State may be mixing up the promissory notes with the issue of the guarantee.  The promissory notes, with &euro;31 billion going to the most bust banks in the country, were not required in legislation to be debated here.  Perhaps the Minister of State would say that if he was standing here now dealing with that legislation, the issue of a promissory note should at least be debated before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  My point here is that if the Government, or any future government, decides to privatise the ESB, Coillte or Bord na M&oacute;na, and decides to use section 19(3) to allow the agency to project-manage that process, this should come before the Houses.  It should be up to the Members to bring that resolution to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p> Also, if a future government decides to use this money, this should come before the Houses.  This money comes from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and is supposed to be for the security of pensioners into the future.  This is money that is supposed to be there to deal with the pensions time bomb we face.  It is public money.  However, if a Minister decides that because the banks are broken and because we want the ATMs to continue working, we should inject &euro;2 billion into a credit institution, and if he can do that under section 42, the least we deserve is that the direction being given by the Minister be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that the Members be given the power to annul that if they can garner a majority in either House.</p><p> The question is this: what does the Government have to fear from proper oversight and accountability?  If it did not fear oversight and accountability, it would have no problem with laying such directions before the Houses of the Oireachtas or in giving the same provisions that apply to orders to directives.  If it did not fear proper oversight, it would have written this legislation in such a way that a direction to inject our money into banks in the future would be an order and in such a way that the privatisation of a State agency would be an order.  However, at the core of these sections is the attempt by the Government to evade the type of scrutiny, oversight and transparency that has been so badly lacking in the past number of years.  The Government wants to continue down the same road.  That is the crux of this.  The Government asks us to take it in good faith and to agree that it will behave responsibly with the powers it has.  That is fine, and I believe the Minister of State is genuine in what he is saying and that he does not intend to fritter away the State's assets into broken banks in the future.  However, legislation is about putting in protections.  It is not about protecting against the Opposition, but about establishing protections for citizens of the State.  This protection would allow us the ability to have a debate.  The amendment would not give an automatic right to a debate, but it would give the right for Deputies elected on behalf of the people to red-flag an issue.  It would give them the opportunity to say an issue is of such magnitude that they believe the direction should be debated in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il and that if the power of their argument was so strong and convincing that they had a majority, this would annul the provision, but would not affect anything that took place within the previous 21 days.</p><p> I am passionate about this because it is about transparency and real political reform.  We talk about political reform all the time - it is a buzzword here - but unless we allow for more scrutiny and transparency, we should all just go home and let the Government govern the way it wants.  Sometimes it seems that is what is happening.  Some of the Minister of State's responses have been like that, saying the Government is not giving itself any extra power and that it has a majority anyway.  We know that.  What is the point?  We know this legislation is going to pass and that the Government will not accept any amendment.  However, we are here because sometimes the Government comes up with bad legislation and sometimes the debate process is important.</p><p> I strongly commend this amendment.  At the bare minimum, the Minister of State should look at the directions that can be issued under this legislation, which have severe consequences.  There is some validity in his argument that every small direction that can be issued to the agency in regard to the performance of its duties may not need to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, there is no big deal with laying anything before the Houses.  Laying something before the Houses does not mean there will be debate on it.  It is up to Members to look at what is laid before the Houses and consider whether there is an issue that should be examined more closely.  If the Minister of State wanted to bring in an amendment of that sort, that would be some sort of compromise.  Sections 19 and 42, however, are two cases in which the directions that can be issued are of such potential magnitude that respect should be given to debate, to the Government's political opponents and to the Houses of the Oireachtas by allowing these directions to be laid before them and to be annulled if the majority so wishes.</p></speech>

This concerns the agreement the Government made initially in the memorandum of understanding to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte, which had been agreed with the troika.</p><p>For a long time we tried to discover what the hell was going on, what analysis had been carried out of the plan to sell Coillte's harvesting rights and what the NTMA or NewERA, whichever was supposed to be responsible for the proposed sale, was doing.  It was extremely difficult to obtain information and we were screaming for a debate.  The only debate on the matter finally took place when we tabled a Private Members' motion.  There was a huge external campaign to highlight why selling the harvesting rights of Coillte would be a major mistake and why what was proposed did not add up at any level.  Ultimately, under pressure from that big civil society campaign, the Government changed its mind.  Up until that point, however, there was nothing which required it to engage in a discussion on the decision, agreed with the troika, to sell off the harvesting rights.  We had no right to demand that a matter of such huge import be debated in the House.</p><p> To follow on from Deputy Pearse Doherty's point, this is a recent example of how we could not obtain a debate on a major proposal.  As matters stand, if this or any future Government decides to dispose of State assets and gives instructions to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund or the NTMA to facilitate it, we cannot force a debate on the issue.  That should be the minimum requirement on the part of any Government in the disposal of State assets.</p></speech>

I repeat what I said earlier, namely, that NewERA does not have any executive functions in its own right.  In other words, it advises but does not execute; nor does it not take unto itself any power.  It was established in an advisory capacity as a source of dedicated corporate finance expertise to be made available to relevant Ministers.  It is open to Ministers to request NewERA to provide project management services or oversee the acquisition or disposal of an interest in an asset of a designated body or any winding up, reorganisation or restructuring of such a body.  Ministers will continue to be accountable in the normal way for the performance of their executive functions.  Obviously, they can be held accountable in dealing with parliamentary questions, motions tabled in the D&aacute;il in Private Members' time, questions on the Order of Business and Leaders' Questions.  There is no question of the Opposition or any Member on this side of the House not being able to raise issues of concern to him or her in a variety of ways.  There is also the possibility of matters being raised at the relevant committees and of these committees requesting the presence of the relevant Ministers or Ministers of State or interested parties in order to discuss them.  Contrary to what has been stated, there is total accountability to the House, its committees and the Seanad on all of these issues.</p><p>  The issue of the disposal of an interest in a commercial semi-state body was discussed at some length on Committee Stage.  As stated, commercial semi-state bodies are all established under legislation in a variety of ways and have statutory functions and obligations.  There is no one simple answer to the question of whether a Minister could dispose of an interest in a commercial semi-state body.  Legislation relating to State companies generally permits, subject to ministerial consent, the disposal of assets or shares in certain subsidiaries.  For example, the ESB was able to sell individual power generation assets without the need for additional primary legislation.  In the case of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, however, the introduction of primary legislation was required because the business that was sold - the supply of gas - was a statutory function of Bord G&aacute;is.  In the context of Bord na M&oacute;na, section 16(3) of the Turf Development Act 1998 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform shall not, unless authorised by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by resolution to do so, reduce his or her holding of shares to less than a majority of the issued shares.  There is, therefore, a clear obligation to seek the authorisation of the D&aacute;il in that instance.  As stated, the shares in Irish Water - Uisce &Eacute;ireann - cannot be disposed of under the relevant legislation.</p><p>  Given that the commercial semi-state bodies on which NewERA will advise are all established under statute, it is extremely difficult to imagine a situation where any of the designated bodies could be sold without amending the underpinning legislation.  A critical point is that a potential buyer would inevitably and properly seek legal certainty before committing to acquiring a designated entity.  I return to the point that while Ministers may request NewERA to provide project management services or for oversight of the disposal of an interest in a designated body, it cannot do so in its own right.  Allowing Ministers to use NewERA does not give them any more power than they already possess in respect of specific State assets.  Ministers will remain accountable to the Oireachtas and be obliged to bring before it and justify the need for the required legislation.  The effect of amendment No. 6 would be to remove from a Minister the possibility of using NewERA expertise where it is proposed to acquire or dispose of an interest in a commercial semi-state body or to wind up, restructure or reorganise such a body.  To the extent that a Minister has the power to do any of these things, as matters stand and in the absence of legislative change, all the provision does is allow him or her to use public sector expertise.  If legislation has to be changed in order to do any of the things envisaged, that must happen and every Member of the Oireachtas will have his or her say in that regard.</p><p>  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, under which the NPRF was established in order to pre-fund the burden of pensions on the Exchequer from 2025 onwards, was amended in 2009 to allow the Minister for Finance, in certain circumstances, to direct the NPRF commission to invest in financial institutions.  This was the mechanism used to recapitalise the banks following the financial crisis.  As stated, we are carrying over this provision as a precautionary measure, with the obvious difference being that the Minister would be giving a direction to the agency, rather than the commission.  We do not foresee our ever having to use this provision but, to put the matter in colloquial terms, it is nice to know it is there.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether he does not understand the position or whether it is just arrogance.  Nobody is claiming that NewERA can just start to sell off State assets of its own volition.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State is of the view that that is the argument I am putting forward.  I must inform him that it is not.  He continues to repeat certain things and I am not sure if that is a tactic designed to refute something which has never been suggested in the first instance.  We know that what he is saying about NewERA is not the issue because the body does not have the power to sell off State assets of its own volition.  I am concerned about the power that can be conferred on the agency, and what we are seeking in that regard is a safety net.</p><p>  I have already pointed out that Ministers have the power to sell shares, down to a certain level in some cases and in their entirety in others.  The Bill, however, allows the Government to use NewERA to project manage and provide advice on reorganising and restructuring semi-state bodies or the sale or disposal of assets.  If the Government is intent on selling off State assets, this is one of the tools it will employ.  We are seeking to avail of the opportunity to ensure there will be some basic level of protection in the legislation to ensure directions will be given.</p><p>The argument of the Minister of State in respect of section 42 is pitiful, suggesting that since the previous Government did it, the Government is simply leaving it the way it is.  This will probably remind the Minister of State of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, because the Uisce &Eacute;ireann legislation rightly has a section stating that the Minister cannot sell off the shares.  All it means is that when the Government decides to sell off Uisce &Eacute;ireann, if ever it does, it must come before the Houses and seek approval.  It means the initial legislation will have to be amended.  The argument the Minister of State is making in respect of section 42 works in exactly the same way, because up until 2009 that was not possible.</p></speech>

Perhaps the writing was on the wall, but the current Government was in place in March 2011 when the majority of the National Pensions Reserve Fund was taken and invested into the pillar banks.

When the Government committed to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte, NewERA was dealing with that area.  NewERA had been charged with the responsibility for managing something that had been written into the troika agreement.  The Government's policy was to go ahead with it up until the moment it decided, under public pressure, that was not going to do it.</p><p>During that period we got responses to parliamentary questions, which the Government said we could ask.  We asked the questions but we could get little information about what the hell NewERA was doing in terms of preparing for the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte.  If I remember correctly, at the time there were several references to commercial sensitivity put out as the cover for the non-answers about what was going on inside NewERA in terms of preparing for the sell-off of Coillte.  The avenue of parliamentary questions, Leaders' Questions and so on was pursued.  All these approaches were employed by the Opposition to try to get information but they yielded virtually nothing about what the hell NewERA was up to with regard to the detail of preparing the ground.  As Deputy Doherty said, it was not that NewERA or the National Treasury Management Agency <i>per se</i>, with the approval of the Government or the Minister, could undertake the sale.  Rather, NewERA was told to go about putting together the nuts and bolts of the sale, and we could get no information about what was going on.</p><p>I think I understand correctly what Deputy Doherty is saying.  If that sort of work is being undertaken by this body then we have the right to some say in it and it should be debated in the House.  That would add necessary transparency to an important area.</p></speech>

Our amendment is about the qualifications that should be taken into account to be a member of the National Treasury Management Agency board.  The legislation states that six ordinary members shall be appointed by the Minister and the Minister must regard them as having expertise and experience at a senior level in one or more of the following areas: investment, treasury management, business management, finance, economics or economic development, law, accounting and auditing, actuarial practice, risk management, insurance, project management, and corporate finance.  Those are all the areas where so-called experts were central to the events that led to the blowing up of the property bubble in this State, to its crash and to the crazed decision that the Irish people should carry the consequences of that crash.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency is an organisation that manages the most incredible level of public funding in this State.  It has massive responsibility for the entire national debt - 120% of gross domestic product, for Government borrowing, for State claims and for the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and it provides management services to the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which in turn has tens of billions of euro of bad debts for which the people have been criminally made responsible according to the legislation.</p><p>We are providing in this amendment that the Minister should also be able to draw members of that agency's board from those who have expertise in &quot;advocacy for groups who have been detrimentally affected by the crash of the property bubble and bail out of the financial system&quot;.  People who have that expertise would be much more likely to represent the democratic wishes of the taxpayers of this State than many of those who were so-called qualified people according to the legislation as it exists.  There are advocacy groups, including those dealing with people in mortgage distress, with the horrific housing crisis and with the huge lack of social and affordable homes, which is creating such immense distress and suffering in our society.  There are people who have expertise advocating for these groups, who represent the majority in society, the victims of the profiteering that went on in the property bubble, the victims of the crash and the victims of the bailout.  I assume the Government will accept this amendment in view of how absolutely self-evident it is that representatives of ordinary Irish people - of the working class, middle and low income earners, pensioners, the unemployed and the youth - should have representation on this board.  We tabled this amendment to make the point that the way the NTMA board is currently made up is not democratic.  It should be democratically accountable in a much more direct way to ordinary people and to taxpayers who should have a democratic input into how such massive institutions are run.  We are not at all happy with the proposal with regard to the way the power in this respect is to be given to the Minister.  We want to show up how one-sided is the Government's approach to the financial crisis and the management of the finances of this State, in that it proposes to include on the board only those professionals or individuals who are so-called experts - the very ones who were central to the creation of the disastrous bubble and the profiteering by bondholders, bankers, speculators and developers in the Irish property bubble, and were then also responsible for the pressure that was put on, and acceded to by, two Governments - the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government - to make the ordinary Irish people carry the responsibility and the pain and debts that were accrued as a result of that.

As Deputy Higgins outlined, it is fairly extraordinary that the areas of so-called expertise which are to be required for those appointed to the board of the National Treasury Management Agency are the same as those found among the circle of so-called experts in the areas of investment, finance and economics - precisely the cohort of people who failed to grasp what was happening in the economy.  In many, if not most, cases they cheered on the property madness that pumped up the property bubble.  They failed to see the crash coming and right up to the last minute they were talking about soft landings, denouncing people who were critical of what was going on as being insane or off the wall, and in various other ways vilifying the critics of what the so-called experts were doing.  Then they made disastrous decisions about how to deal with the consequences of their own failures.  Yet there does not seem to be any lessons learned about that experience.  The same gang and categories of so-called expert are wheeled in.  It is indicative of our approach, which is still very top-down and elitist, to how we deal with our economy and what is viewed as the purpose of it.  The prevailing view seems to be that the people are there to serve the economy, with the economic experts as the ones who know about it, rather than the economy being there to serve the interests, objectives, aspirations and needs of the ordinary people.</p><p>In all of these matters we start the wrong way around, and no lessons appear to have been learned about the consequences of doing this, even after the most devastating economic crash.  I jest not when I say that the list should read: (a) the dogs in the street; (b) a granny; and (c) any worker in the building industry.  We should also include the whole range of other categories of ordinary citizen who drew attention to the fact that what was happening was mad but who were not listened to because they were not considered to be experts, while the so-called experts thought what we were doing was right and did not foresee the crash right up to the last minute.  There should be some acknowledgement of this in the make-up of the agency.  I am serious when I suggest the inclusion in the list of the dogs in the street and, perhaps, every taxi driver, because it was they, in the context of some of the buildings that were being constructed and the sale prices being achieved for land and property, who knew that what was happening was crazy and was going to go bang.  However, the opinions of ordinary people who could see what was obvious were not taken on board, and instead the so-called experts dictated and dominated the debate.</p><p> Another group of people who should be seriously considered worthy of being on such boards is people who are actually experts in some of the key areas where investments are likely to be made.  The Minister of State will be aware of my interest in the forestry issue.  It took a huge campaign on the part of people much more knowledgeable than I about forestry to raise awareness of what was at stake in terms of the sale of the forests, because they understood how valuable a resource it is.  Eventually, as a result of their knowledge, the Government was forced to change its mind and acknowledge how valuable the forests are and what a big mistake it would be to sell them off.  One could say the same about housing and the people on housing lists, or those who represent them, or distressed mortgage holders.  Given how central the issue of housing was and the marketing of housing as a commodity on which to make money, which was a disastrous approach, it is important that membership of boards is at least balanced and includes people who understand that the basic point of housing is to put a roof over the heads of human beings.  It might be useful to at least balance the property experts with those people.</p></speech>

There is an absolute need to have on boards people with financial expertise and so forth.  However, the Minister should not be precluded from appointing somebody whom he or she believes would make a good overall contribution to the work of the agency.  The remit of the agency has expanded greatly over the past 24 hours.  The scope of its remit is now way beyond what was originally envisaged.  It now deals with debt management, the State Claims Agency, infrastructure projects through the newly established Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, and NewERA, and provides support services to NAMA.  Its role in the Irish economy is much wider than was ever envisaged.  As such, I support the view that the Minister should not be precluded from appointing somebody from civic society, whether from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or an advocacy body dealing with people in mortgage arrears.  I believe this option should be available to the Minister of the day.</p></speech>

We have tried to ensure that members of the agency will be well qualified in relevant areas in light of the wide range of functions entrusted to the agency.  Notwithstanding some of the constructive points made, I am reluctant to define those areas too closely, as things change over time.  I would also note that board members will be appointed on the basis of their expertise and experience and will not serve in a representative capacity.  I expect that the Minister will ensure that the members of the agency will, as stated by Deputy Michael McGrath, bring a wide range of experience to the role of overseeing this agency.</p><p>In relation to the points made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I wonder if, in the context of his statement that the dogs in the street should be considered for board membership, he was reading <i>Animal Farm </i>last night.</p></speech>

For his information, Stalin had nothing to do with socialism.  We call that system Stalinism - the horrific totalitarian perversion of the great revolution of the Russian working class and peasantry when they overthrew a horrific dictatorship.</p><p>  The attitude to this proposal is not at all surprising.  The Minister of State said in his remarks that he does not want to narrow the expertise that would be required, but it has been narrowed down to financiers and corporate interests, including big bankers such as Goldman Sachs.  The Minister of State has no problem putting people with that type of track record on the board of this crucial agency.  In view of the points made on Second and Committee Stages with regard to the need for a major infrastructural drive in the development of social and affordable homes, it is all the more urgent that people who have expertise in dealing with the housing crisis would be involved here.  It is clear that the range of so-called expertise outlined by the Government includes people dealing with the financial markets, corporate financing and speculation and wheeling and dealing.  These are the same people who wrecked an entire economy and internationally created massive suffering for hundreds of millions of people.  The Government stands shamed in narrowing down the potential board to such a class of persons.</p></speech>

As I recently outlined, the extent of what the agency is involved with is very great indeed.  This legislation, despite our objection, envisages the joining up of our publicly owned pension funds with private capital and private capitalists in joint ventures that the Government favours.  Therefore, there is potential for considerable litigation in any one of the many areas included in the Bill, let alone in respect of other responsibilities of the agency.  I question the inclusion of all-encompassing wording allowing the chairperson and chief executive to refuse to appear before a committee of the elected representatives of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann regarding an issue that was or might be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal.  How does one know what may be the subject of a tribunal?  The provision is incredibly all-inclusive and we object to it.</p></speech>

I have refined my amendment so as to seek the deletion of one provision - namely, the one Deputy Joe Higgins has focused on.  I refer to the all-encompassing provision that would allow the chairperson and chief executive to refuse to appear before a committee because the subject under discussion could &ldquo;at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State&rdquo;.  A commission of inquiry is not mentioned, which is interesting in itself.</p><p>The provision is far too broad.  That an issue discussed and settled in court many years ago could be excluded from discussion at a meeting of an Oireachtas committee does not make any sense whatsoever.  It makes no sense that an issue that arose at a tribunal in the past could not be brought up again.  One could consider the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in this regard.  If a committee wanted to investigate or re-examine practices arising from the Moriarty tribunal, for example, and determine whether the Department had learned the appropriate lessons and implemented the recommendations of the tribunal, it might not be able to do so because the provision in the Bill, if applied, could mean the chairperson and chief executive would not be required to give an account of any matter which is or has been or may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal.  They would say they simply could not talk about the matter.</p><p>It was not clear whether the matter of GSOC would be subject to a commission of inquiry or tribunal, and an issue arose as to whether the relevant committee had the right to ask individuals to appear before it.  With regard to a court case or tribunal in the State, it could be many years before an issue could be discussed at a committee meeting.  While there should be provisions to protect <i>sub judice</i>proceedings, etc., the legislation proposed is far too broad.  I hope the provision will be deleted.</p></speech>

Essentially, the legislation stipulates that the chairperson and chief executive can choose the topics in respect of which he or she will engage with Oireachtas committees.  That is simply unacceptable.  The inclusion of issues that may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal virtually covers everything.  Especially with the commercial mandate being given under the investment fund, there will be many vested interests which will threaten legal action over any decision for a prolonged period.  Virtually every decision of a commercial nature could well come before a court at some point.  It is completely unacceptable to have all such decisions beyond the scope of an Oireachtas committee.  It unnecessarily limits the scope of committees in probing various subjects.  Our parliamentary committees comprise one of the few areas in which we have democratic accountability outside this Chamber.  It should be protected in every respect.  The legislation is unnecessarily broad and could significantly impede the work of Oireachtas committees.</p></speech>

This would remove the provision that the chairperson and chief executive cannot be required to give an account before an Oireachtas committee about matters that have been or might be before a court or tribunal, as well as the resolution procedure - this is very important - that allows the High Court to settle whether an issue is indeed such an issue.  Deputy Doherty's proposed amendment, No. 4, would simply remove the provision that the chairperson and chief executive cannot be required to give an account before an Oireachtas committee about matters that are, have been or might be before a court or tribunal, but leave the resolution mechanism via the High Court in place.</p><p>  Section 12 inserts a new section to provide for appearances by the chairperson and chief executive officer before an Oireachtas committee other than the Committee of Public Accounts.  Subsection (3) provides that a chairperson or chief executive does not have to account for any matter that has been, is or may be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal.  Subsections (4) and (7) deal with circumstances in which the chief executive or chairman takes one view and the committee takes another view.  Therefore, the committee has to form this view.  If the issues cannot be resolved, the High Court can be asked to decide on them.  This is a standard legislative procedure in regard to this issue.  I do not believe an exception should be made in respect of the NTMA.</p></speech>

This Government has a record of using reviews of important social services as an alibi for reducing those services.  The medical card fiasco is an obvious example.  The Government has embarked on what is called a review of the viability of the free travel system.  Many people throughout the country suspect, perhaps correctly, that this is a precursor to the entitlement to free travel being restricted or interfered with in some way.  The Government should not underestimate for a moment the fear, anxiety and distress this has caused among the elderly and people who are very ill and vulnerable; nor should it underestimate the vehemence and determination of the resistance it will encounter if it seeks to interfere with this provision, which has been in existence since 1967.</p><p>Let us consider the type of people who would be affected by a change in the scheme.  The first are people over 66 years of age.  It is a statistical fact that 80% of people over 66 years of age who are in receipt of pensions rely solely on their old age pension.  They have no other income or means.  They are on a fixed income, the old age pension, which has not been increased in five or six years.  They are a particularly vulnerable section of society and they have already been harshly treated by the Government, as I will demonstrate shortly.  As I have said, 80% of them have no other means of support.</p><p>The second section of people who would be affected are carers.  We all know what carers are doing for this society.  I believe they are contributing, in net terms, approximately &euro;4 billion per annum to the economy.  In most cases they are shackled to their home or to the home of the person for whom they are caring.  Some of them work around the clock.  Free travel is one of the small perks they have been given, and there is now genuine anxiety that it might be taken away.</p><p>The third category of people who would be affected are people who are registered as blind.  As is said in legal circles, <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.  Another category is people who live on invalidity pension.  Members will be aware that in this country one must be quite ill to qualify for invalidity pension, and one must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that one will never be in a position to work again.  The vast majority of people who are in receipt of invalidity pension have no other means or separate income or resources on which to survive.  They rely solely on their invalidity pension.  Finally, there are the people in receipt of disability allowance.  These are people who receive the means-tested benefit as they do not have sufficient contributions to qualify for illness benefit or invalidity pension.  Given that the payment is means tested, they obviously do not have any resources other than their meagre social welfare income.</p><p>The attempt to interfere with free travel is further evidence of the regressive approach which has consistently been adopted by this Government in all the budgets it has introduced.  &quot;Regressive&quot; means that one takes most from those who can least afford it and least from those who can most afford it.  Let us consider the record of the Minister for Social Protection in respect of the elderly.  She has slashed the fuel allowance by reducing the period from 32 to 26 weeks and emasculated the free electricity allowance, which is now worth approximately one-fifth of what it was when the Minister, Deputy Burton, took office.  She has abolished the free telephone rental allowance, thereby removing a lifeline from the elderly.  The elderly were disproportionately and overwhelmingly affected by this, although it also applies to people on invalidity pensions.</p><p>The bereavement grant has been abolished and pension changes have been introduced, many of which people still do not understand until they encounter them.  When they encounter them they find that many people who worked for many years are now receiving a great deal less than they otherwise would have due to pension changes introduced by the Minister.  There is also the 20% reduction in the respite care grant, which gives the lie to the Government's claims that it has not cut core social welfare benefits.  Carer's allowance is a core benefit and everybody in receipt of carer's allowance receives the respite care grant.  If one cuts the respite care grant, one has obviously cut the entitlement of every person in receipt of carer's allowance, in this case to the tune of &euro;6 per week.</p><p>All of the measures introduced by the Government have reduced the disposable income of people who are largely on a fixed income, which has not changed for the past five to six years.  It should be mentioned that their disposable income has also been affected by the medical card fiasco.  I well recall the occasion a number of years ago when the previous Government proposed that a single person on a net income of more than &euro;1,500 per week would not get a medical card.  The current Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael described that as - I noted his words - a Judas betrayal.  If a limit of &euro;1,500 net per week is a Judas betrayal, what is the current situation, when it is &euro;900 gross per week?</p><p>I do not have time to dwell on prescription charges, which we were promised would be abolished and instead have been increased fivefold.  That disproportionately affects the elderly and the ill.  There is also the slashing of home help hours, higher carbon taxes and property tax, which pensioners on fixed incomes must pay.  They feel obliged to pay it even though they could claim a temporary exemption and postpone it, as it were.  They are anxious to pay it, however, because they do not want it to build up as a debt at a rate of 4% per annum compound interest.  Water charges are on the way, along with a host of other stealth taxes by which the disposable incomes of the most vulnerable people in this country are being steadily reduced.</p><p>The justification for this further attempted assault on the elderly is twofold.  The Minister said money had to be found somewhere because there was pressure on finances elsewhere.  Where is that?  Is it pressure to reduce tax for the better off, pressure to give the children of wealthy parents medical cards up to the age of six, regardless of whether they need or want them, or pressure to pay consultants to give advice to the likes of Irish Water?  The fact is that the cost of the free travel scheme is &euro;77 million, which is a drop in the ocean in the context of overall Government expenditure.  Public expenditure in this country amounts to billions of euro.  Some of that is well spent and other parts of it are not so well spent, but I doubt there is any part of it for which the Government gets better value than the expenditure on free travel.  Never has so little expenditure helped so many people.</p><p>If one adds up all the changes the Minister has made to social welfare, in so far as the elderly are concerned, the net effect is &euro;290.4 million per annum out of the pockets of the elderly and people who benefit from free travel.  There are 90 private operators in the scheme, and they are threatening to withdraw because they are not being paid enough.  According to my calculations and the conversations I have had with some of the operators, a sum of &euro;7 million would satisfy their demands.</p><p>This is pretty paltry in view of the fact the Government has already taken &euro;290.4 million per annum away from the people who are going to be affected.</p><p> I notice that the Government's amendment to the motion refers to the previous Government's decision to freeze the provision for free travel.  Three and a half years down the road, we are still talking about the previous Government.  It is true that the previous Government did not increase the budget for free travel in the two budgets in its last year in office.  However, if the Government is critical of that decision, why did it not reverse it in the last three and a half years?  It has had three and a half years to unfreeze it, and in each year in which it has failed to do so more and more people have qualified for free travel.</p><p> We are accused of whipping up fear among the elderly.  I am reacting to reputable organisations such as Age Action Ireland, the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament and various organisations throughout the country which have come to us reflecting the fears and anxieties that are being expressed to them.  We are here in Parliament, as is our duty and our right, to seek answers on behalf of those people.  If the Government wants to make the accusation that fear is being deliberately whipped up among the elderly and vulnerable, let it then point the finger at organisations such as Age Action Ireland.</p><p> The other justification, of course, is that it is all designed to combat fraud and that fraud is widespread.  Irish Rail and Bus &Eacute;ireann have been encouraged to put out statements recently suggesting that bus passes were removed from so many people last year, there was a dawn raid somewhere and so many people were found on a train trying to defraud the free travel system.  They are putting out those headlines as if the elderly people of this country and those on invalidity pensions - the poor and the vulnerable - are engaged in systematic and widespread fraud.  That is a calculated insult to this vulnerable section of the electorate.  The Government, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should cease putting out statements of that type.</p><p> The main reason such fraud is pursued is that the older versions of the free travel pass are easily photocopied and do not contain a photograph.  That is being corrected as we debate this in the House, because we are in the process of replacing the free travel pass with a public services card, which will eliminate the fraud.  There is no need to have a review of the viability of the whole system to deal with that situation, as it is being dealt with by the Department itself.</p><p> In any case, I want to ask the Minister of State a simple question.  How will introducing a charge, whether nominal or otherwise, restricting the hours during which people can use the free travel pass or restricting the use of the free travel pass to one mode of transport act to combat fraud?  Let us take an example of a person who wants to travel to and from Limerick on the train for a fee of, say, &euro;60.  If he is able to defraud the State, he is going to be &euro;60 better off in that he will gain &euro;60 by not paying for his ticket - for example, by showing a forged travel pass.  Are we suggesting that if we add a &euro;5 travel charge and he gains only &euro;55, he will not defraud the system at all?  Is that what we are being told?</p><p> Research has shown that almost 80% of people who are entitled to a free travel pass use it on a weekly basis and 30% use it on a daily basis.  A survey carried out by Age Action Ireland showed that the people who use the free travel pass use it on average six times per week, and that it is used to visit friends and family and for social interaction.  Is it not ironic that we have spent so much money communicating with people through the media about their social obligation to visit and regularly check on the elderly, particularly those who live in isolated rural areas, in order to reduce social isolation, while at the same time contemplating a policy that will inevitably increase social isolation?  The Government has already taken one lifeline from the elderly - namely, the free telephone rental allowance.  Now, it seems to be on the path of taking another, and I am asking it to stop.</p><p> As I said, Age Action Ireland, a reputable organisation, did some research on this matter and came up with some very interesting findings.  It found, for example, that when the elderly were asked what activities would be affected and what they would not be able to do if they did not have the free travel pass, 65% said they would not be able to visit their friends and 50% said it would interfere with their regular visits for medical appointments.  In other words, what they were essentially saying was that it would increase social isolation, something which we, as a society, are supposed to be combating.</p><p> What I found especially ludicrous were the main proposals of the review group, which were leaked to the media.  It is proposed, for example, that the Government would introduce a nominal charge.  To talk about a nominal charge would be fine if we had not had all of those attacks on the disposable income of the elderly.  What happens to a person on a fixed income of &euro;230 per week who is using the free travel pass six times per week if a &euro;5 charge is introduced?  Another alternative proposal would be to restrict the hours during which free travel is available.  What about people who have to attend medical appointments, many of which are scheduled for early in the morning?  Moreover, if people are coming from outside Dublin, they would have to start early in the morning to get there.  The possibility of restricting usage to one mode of transport was suggested.  Do the members of this review group live in the real world?  Do they not know that journeys often involve several modes of transport?  For example, I know people who come up to Dublin for medical appointments by train and they then have to get the Luas or a Dublin Bus.  Is it suggested that the entitlement to free travel finishes at the Luas stop?</p><p> The fact is that people are worried about this and they want reassurance.  I ask the Government to give a commitment, at best, that it will cancel this review and put it on ice or, at a minimum, assure the elderly and vulnerable people of this country, who have already suffered enough and who have been sacrificed on the altar of austerity, that it will not put any of those changes into effect.  By that I mean, first, that it will not introduce a nominal charge which, if one considers what happened with the free telephone rental, prescription charges and so on, would certainly be seen as the thin end of a very thick wedge; second, that it will not restrict the hours during which people can avail of free travel; and, third, that it will not restrict the modes of transport that can be used.  I ask the Government to give that reassurance not to me but to the elderly and the vulnerable who are traumatised and anxious from one end of this country to the other.</p><p> There was recently an election contest for the leadership of the Labour Party.  The person who emerged victorious, the Minister, Deputy Burton - good luck to her - said in her first statement after her victory that she wanted to rule with both the head and the heart.  While we are used to pronouncements and statements from the Labour Party that have about as much value as a Zimbabwean dollar, I am prepared to take the Minister at her word.  I am prepared to believe that she is sincere and that those words which she uttered on her election mean something.  If she wants to rule with the heart as well as the head, I cannot think of a better place to start than by cancelling this review or at least giving us an assurance that she will not implement any of those three proposals which have been leaked to the media.</p><p> There are 800,000 people - more than 1 million if we count those with companion passes - who avail of free travel, whose lives have been bettered by it and to whom it is a lifeline.  They are allowed to socially interact, to meet their friends and to have something to get up for in the morning.</p><p>It does not matter about me but they are waiting for a firm assurance in this regard.  I would like to get it from the Government at the conclusion of this debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="20:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800045#SS00200"><p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo anocht.  The first thing I must refer to is the statement made by the Government that we froze the amount of money we gave to the service providers for the scheme, which was quite correct.  However, we did not in any way impact on the scheme for those who used it, which was the important thing.  In other words, we did what the Government says we should have done, namely, get better value for money for an investment in this scheme.  We did the same thing with RTE and rightly so in my view.  It is amazing how this Government always gives out about how the previous Government threw money around like snuff at a wake and then when it suits it, it turns around and says that the previous Government was very parsimonious with the money, demanded performance for the money it gave and demanded a little bit more for a little bit less so that we got performance.  We should remember that public transport services are heavily subsidised by the Department of Transport and, therefore, it was our view that the funding of &euro;77 million was sufficient to provide the service.</p><p>The second issue I wish to address is fraud.  When we were in government, we planned to introduce the public services card.  The idea was to integrate that with the ticketing service so there would be an actual record of all the people who used the free travel service so that we would have some idea of what the correct amount of money was.  If the new card was properly backed up with technology on the ground, there would be a very high level of security and a very low level of fraud.  I must say that I was surprised when I became Minister to find that the cards in Dublin had a picture while the cards down the country did not have one.  We set about immediately driving forward the project in respect of the universal card that had the picture and also had other security measures on it.  </p><p>I always watch the small print with this Government - how it says that it has not cut headline rates, whatever a headline rate is.  At the end of the day, headline rates mean nothing to anybody if the Government is taking the money out of the other pocket.  What has the Government done to old people?  What is extraordinary is that when we look at its record on older people, we can see that the first thing it did was to cut the fuel allowance from 32 weeks to 26 weeks, which took &euro;120 per annum out of older people's pockets.  The Government then reduced the free electricity from 2,400 units to 1,800 units.  That is 600 units out of 2,400 units, which is a 25% cut.  The Government then got really clever.  It changed it into cash.  The reason why changing it into cash was a very clever but sneaky cut is that when one gets the payment in cash, when the price of a unit of electricity goes up, which it inevitably will over a period time, the Government will not increase the cash and, therefore, people will be getting fewer and fewer units all the time but it will not be so apparent that the Government has cut them another step.  In the old days when we gave the units, when the price of electricity went up, the number of units stayed the same and, therefore, the amount of the benefit actually increased in cash value all the time.  The Government then took another &euro;20 per month by abolishing the free telephone rental and 12 times 20 is &euro;240.  The Government cut the respite care grant and not happy with taking money off pensioners, literally followed them to the grave by taking away the bereavement grant of &euro;350 yet it did not touch headline rates.  This is what the record of the Government is like.  It takes it and then boasts that it has not taken it.  It would be more honest if it just took it and said that it has taken it and that it has made every pensioner worse off in the past few years.</p><p>The Government has produced three budgets and every year inflation eats into pensioners' pensions.  I looked at the amendment to the motion.  In it, I thought I would see a straight statement that the Government intends maintaining the free travel scheme as it is, that is, available to pensioners and other people with medical conditions, invalidity pension, disability allowance and so on.  What do I find in the wording?  I am always interested in the wording with this Government.  One must read the wording very carefully and ask oneself what it really means.  The amendment states that the Government has protected the free travel scheme despite increasing numbers becoming eligible and a freeze in the funding imposed by the previous Government and is fully committed to fully supporting and retaining the free travel scheme as a universal benefit for elderly people but it does not say what my colleague was alluding to.  It does not state that the Government has set up a review group that will try to curtail this benefit in some way or other.  </p><p>Deputy O'Dea mentioned some of the ways in which the Government could take the good out of the scheme, for example, if people have to watch the clock when they go to take the train or the bus at a time when we have introduced the Leap card system whereby people can jump from the Luas on to the train, from the train on to the bus and from the bus on to suburban rail.  The idea was that it was meant to be an integrated public transport service.  Some genius came up with the idea that one can jump on the train but must pull out one's purse when one gets on to the bus or <i>vice versa</i>.  Another idea that was dreamed up in the system and which I know about because I was approached by the rail company is that one would have to pre-book tickets so that if one wanted to go to Westport, which many older people do, one could not just walk down to Heuston Station, get on the train and go to Westport.  One would have to pre-book the ticket.  One of the beauties of free travel is that many people's lives are lived on a whim.  A person decides to visit a family member at the far end of the country on the day and does not need to go in and book because they have their free ticket.  Let us be honest about it.  More and more people are being required to book online, which poses huge challenges for all of us but even bigger challenges for many older people who do not have access to computers and do not feel comfortable booking online even though they might look at personal stuff on the computer.  </p><p>The T&aacute;naiste is not here tonight.  I congratulate her and hope she brings a bit of humanity to the hall of Government.  I will be watching with interest.  In her absence, I hope the Minister of State will be able to say here tonight that there will be no change to the free travel scheme and that it will continue to be a universal free travel scheme available to all of the people who have been eligible up to now.  I hope he will say there will be no restrictions on it, that it will not be confined to one mode of transport and that people will not have to pay a nominal charge to get on the train or bus, time their clock to it or pre-book.  If he says that, he will put many people's minds at rest.  If that is the way it is, he should say so but if that is not the way it is, he should tell us that this is not the way it is going to be.  In most cases, when people start carrying out reviews in the public service, the talk is that change is on the way.  The talk then is that we were advised to do it.  To put everybody's mind at rest, the Minister of State should tell them go bhfanfaidh s&eacute; seo mar at&aacute; s&eacute;, nach dtiocfaidh aon athr&uacute; air agus go mbeidh an saorthaisteal ar f&aacute;il mar a bh&iacute; riamh do phobal na t&iacute;re seo.  Mura mbeidh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il, seo an rud is m&oacute; a chuirfidh seandaoine in aghaidh an Rialtais agus inseoidh siad in am tr&aacute;th d&oacute; c&eacute;ard &eacute; a meas ar Rialtas a dh&eacute;anfadh gearradh ar bith ar an li&uacute;ntas seo.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1096" speakername="John Browne" time="20:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800045#SS00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this motion and compliment Deputy O'Dea for bringing it forward.  The free travel pass scheme has changed much since it was first introduced in 1967 for the over-70s.  It was means-tested.  Since then, it has been extended to pensioners and people on invalidity pension and disability allowance and there have been other changes to help older people move around freely.</p><p>We fully support the protection of the free travel scheme.  It was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in 1967 and it has helped to ensure generations of elderly people could remain connected to their communities.  The pass has empowered otherwise isolated individuals to play an active role in their areas and helped them to attend medical and other personal appointments.  The scheme also serves as a stimulus package by facilitating elderly people to travel across the country, injecting much needed money into the tourism and the hospitality sectors.</p><p> One always worries when a Department says it will undertake a review because that usually means changes, which are usually not in the best interest of the customer or the consumer.  How often have reviews been carried out that resulted in significant change and people suffering greatly?  Only recently there was a review of medical cards and many people lost their cards, particularly those who had discretionary cards or who had cards on medical grounds and so on.  As a result, thousands of people throughout the country lost their medical cards.  The Minister for Health in his wisdom decided to row back on the change and to go back to the future in the sense that he said former card holders who had lost them in the review would have them restored, although it is a slow process.  Many people have not had their cards returned, as promised by him more than a month ago.</p><p> Research by Age Action Ireland demonstrates that 78% of travel pass holders use it on a weekly basis with 30% using it daily.  More than 70% of respondents to the organisation's survey use the pass to attend medical appointments and more than 60% said they would find it difficult to attend such appointments or social events without it.  Removing them would create a serious problem.  People must wait a long time to get medical appointments, in some cases up to three or four years, and they could find they have no way to travelling to a hospital, particularly given the changes to hospital groupings.  Hospitals in my own country, for example, are tied to Dublin and, therefore, people must travel to St. Vincent's, St. Luke's or Tallaght hospitals when they receive an appointment.  It is important to retain the scheme to ensure travel passes are available to these people.</p><p> The survey also illustrates the critical role the pass plays in elderly people's lives.  The pass serves as a major stimulus for the tourism sector, as it enables those aged over 66 to access easily various parts of the country for trips and excursions.  Many active retirement groups and organisations from my home town of Enniscorthy, particularly on Sundays during the winter, travel to Dublin to visit museums and Croke Park for matches while some people visit relatives and go shopping.  The elderly engage in many activities by availing of the free travel pass, which they would not have a hope of doing if it was not available to them.</p><p> The Government review cannot be allowed to serve as a smokescreen for hidden cuts to this critical support.  The Government parties have introduced a range of harsh measures affecting the elderly such as prescription charges, abolition of the telephone allowance, reduction in the fuel allowance and a huge reduction in housing aid supports through county councils.  This is causing serious problems for people who want to upgrade or refurbish their house to suit their needs but the moneys are not available.  Wexford County Council says that it will run out of funding for housing schemes for the elderly at the end of July or early August for the remainder of the year.</p><p> I am worried, based on the way reviews have been carried out in the past, that a review of the free travel scheme will lead to a withdrawal of passes in certain circumstances.  Some people say the scheme should be means tested while others say the pass should only be valid during off peak hours and more say there should be significant changes.  I do not agree with major change.  People must be allowed to continue to use their passes as they do currently. </p><p> The scheme costs &euro;77 million annually, which is a small amount in the overall scheme of things when one considers that 787,000 people benefit from it.  Perhaps elements of the scheme could be tightened but it should continue to operate as is.  A number of private operators have threatened to withdraw from the scheme if the subsidy they receive is not increased to cover their increasing costs.  We are getting good value for money.  Diesel prices and other costs have increased but the free travel scheme operators are providing more or less the same service to the State and their funding has been similar on an annual basis.  It is important that the Government does not use the fact that these operators or CIE are saying they need more money as an excuse to make changes in the review.</p><p> The national travel pass is important for ordinary people.  Many people come in from the country and they take the bus or the train to Dublin or another destination without any hindrance or threat from the Government to change the system.  The scheme enables people to access all parts of their communities, to travel to meet their families and friends or to visit places they wish to visit.  To implement any change that would curtail this would represent a further attack on the elderly in our society.  They have become an easy target for this Government.  When they get protesting, they turn out in huge numbers - we saw that when the late Deputy Brian Lenihan introduced changes to the medical card scheme.  They mobilised themselves, travelled to Dublin in their thousands, ironically courtesy of the free travel pass, to protest at the gates of Leinster House.  The then Government rowed back on those measures and ensured people retained their medical cards over 70.  </p><p> We now have a situation where people on discretionary medical cards have had those cards withdrawn but people mobilised themselves in the local elections by voting against the Government parties.  People may not march on the streets any more but, as the Government will be aware following the local elections, elderly people who turn out to vote in great numbers now use those votes to decide on what type of services they wish to see.  It is important that the free travel pass continues to be available to the elderly, the disabled, people on invalidity pensions and any others who are eligible for this service.  The Minister should set the record straight and clarify that the proposed review will not result in the withdrawal of the pass from certain groups.  It must be spelled out that this pass will continue to be available into the future to the people who are currently eligible for it.</p></speech>

People are free to campaign on whatever they wish to campaign on.  The free travel pass is safe.</p><p>  The population of Ireland is aging rapidly.  It is estimated that the over-65 population will rise by nearly 220,000 over the next decade to just over 800,000 in 2024.  These demographic changes will pose significant social and economic challenges for individuals, families and society in general.  However, such changes will also bring with them many opportunities as older people continue to make a significant contribution to all aspects of Irish life.  The Government believes that the challenges can be met and the positive opportunities that arise exploited by planning now to ensure that Irish society is age-friendly in the years ahead.</p><p>  Last year, the OECD published an independent and objective review of the Irish pensions system in which it was reported that the economic situation of pensioners in Ireland is comparatively good, both with respect to other age groups in the population and in international comparisons.  While we would all like it to be better, one need only look North of the Border to make a comparison.  The Government has sought to maintain the basic rate of State pension at 34% of the average weekly earnings.  There have been significant improvements in the level of pensioner poverty in Ireland in recent years.  I acknowledge the work the previous Government did on this and its commitment to the issue.  While the previous Government, at the height of the difficulties to which it brought the country, froze the allocation of funds to free travel, it maintained the scheme.  The scaremongering is out of place.  The significant improvements in pensioner poverty are attributed mainly to substantial increases in the rates of State pensions over the period, and I acknowledge the work of the previous Government.</p><p>  Last week the Department of Social Protection hosted its annual pre-budget forum.  As it took place on Friday morning from approximately 8.30 a.m. until 1.30 p.m., it gave me very gainful employment while other events were unfolding elsewhere.  Many of the submissions received in the Department in advance of the forum and many of the contributions at the workshops on the day referred to the free travel scheme.  I went to all the workshops, as did all the senior departmental staff, in a very positive atmosphere of discussion with all the groups represented.  All of the representative groups were clear in their support for the continuation of the free travel scheme, which is held in the highest regard and valued even by those who rarely use it.</p><p>It is regarded as a passport to leisure activities, time with families and, most importantly, to get to critical things like hospital and other care appointments.  For some, it is a way to get to work for others to help them to attend hospital appointments.  For many, it is a life-enhancing support which goes beyond the term "social inclusion".</p><p> The free travel scheme was introduced in 1967 to provide transport services to those aged over 70 who were living alone and in receipt of a social welfare pension.  Owing to the range of policy changes implemented since 1967, the scheme is now universally available to all persons living in the State aged 66 and over as well as carers in receipt of carer's allowance and certain others such as those in receipt of disability allowance and invalidity pension.  The effect of this broadening is that in excess of 20% of the total national population benefits from the scheme at present.  The free travel scheme permits customers to travel for free on most CIE public transport services, including Irish Rail, DART, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, and it can also be used on the Luas and a range of services offered by up to 90 private operators.  It is available for cross-Border journeys to and from Northern Ireland and customers aged 66 and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland as part of the all-Ireland travel scheme.  Customers of the scheme who are married, co-habiting or in a civil partnership receive a pass that allows their spouses, civil partners or co-habitants to travel with them for free.  Certain customers with disabilities or incapacities can receive a companion pass.</p><p> The cost of the scheme has risen significantly in recent years as have the numbers of people availing of the scheme.  In regard to review and reform, successive governments over many years have spoken of the need for greater policy analysis, evaluation and review of expenditure not to mention the experts from the international bodies who camped in Ireland for a while but, thankfully, visit now only occasionally as we are in recovery.  There has been significant investment in training for civil servants and additional recruitment of qualified analysts and evaluators.  There is no apology for the carrying out of a review in relation to any area of public expenditure.  Deputy O'Dea will know well that the terms of the troika agreement he signed up to required practically everything that moved in any Department to be evaluated.</p><p> The Department is spending a very significant amount of money on a new PPS card which includes a biometric photo.  It is being rolled out to older people across the country and is receiving very strong support from them.  If one has had occasion to see the card, one will know that the letters &quot;FT&quot; are marked on its face.  I ask the Deputy, would we make this very significant investment in technology if we were going to do away with the scheme?</p></speech>

The fact that Fianna F&aacute;il chose to place a motion of this nature before the House smacks of a party desperately in search of an issue.  Deputy O'Dea and his colleagues are doing their utmost as the T&aacute;naiste suggested to sow doubt and confusion in the public mind on the future of a scheme the Minister recorded publicly this evening is not under threat.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="20:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800048#VV01000"><p>This is a scheme we have managed to protect and secure over three consecutive budgets in the teeth of the most dramatic and catastrophic collapse in its public finances that the State has ever seen.  That collapse was precipitated by Deputy O'Dea's own party.  Given Fianna F&aacute;il's track record in beggaring the country, the people who depend on the free travel scheme will not accept Deputy O'Dea's groundless charge that this critical scheme is somehow under threat.  The Minister put it plainly and clearly that there is no threat to the scheme.</p><p>  Ireland is one of the best countries in the world in which to grow old.  They are not my words, but those of the authors of a United Nations supported analysis last year, the Global AgeWatch Index.  This independent analysis found that Ireland ranked 12th in the world in terms of the quality of life of older people.  The review also pointed out the fact that Ireland is ranked third in the world for providing what is termed &quot;an enabling environment&quot;.  In that context, the review refers to access to public transport for older people as a critical aspect of our policy framework to secure social cohesion.  It is the strength of our social support system and the way the country and its Government have utilised the social protection system to redistribute income to alleviate poverty and support those sectors of society at risk of poverty that separate us from many analogous states across the developed world.  Maintaining our social welfare rates, including State pension payments and other important supports for pensioners, as we have done for the last three years in the midst of national bankruptcy, is evidence of the Government's and the Labour Party's commitment to social cohesion and the concept of a basic floor of economic and social decency.</p><p>  The free travel scheme works.  It does exactly what it says on the tin and represents a very important tool in combatting social disadvantage among older people, carers and those who are entitled to have companion passes.  The Members opposite will know that administrative reviews of schemes take place on a regular basis but that does not amount to a threat to a scheme's existence.  However, far be it from those opposite to recognise and acknowledge that they are seeking to gain a short-term political advantage by coming here and accusing the Government of placing a scheme under threat which is not under threat at all.</p></speech>

I am sure Sinn F&eacute;in Members will be here later to support Deputy O'Dea's motion without any expression of shame or guilt from them at the niggardly social welfare rates and supports they preside over in the North by comparison with the system we have built up in the State over the years.  In fairness, Deputy O'Dea's party has supported that system.  The day that Sinn F&eacute;in starts to reform welfare in the North and doubles the core pension payments there to bring them into line with payments in this republic is the day I start to take seriously its empty rhetoric of concern for those who depend on social protection for their incomes.  They cannot run away from this forever.  I am sure we will hear plenty of rhetoric from Sinn F&eacute;in Members who attend to address the motion later.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has designed the motion to deliberately mislead and upset pensioners in the most spectacular way.  It is an objectionable initiative.</p></speech>

The free travel scheme is equally important to rural and urban pensioners for carrying out everyday tasks.  Last week, we spoke about the effects a sense of isolation can have on individuals, especially in rural areas.  This applies especially to older people who have given so much to the country.  Transport serves older people who, for one reason or another, can no longer drive or can only drive short distances.  Most users say that, without the travel pass, they would be unable to attend medical or health appointments.</p><p>  It is found that those over 60 years who take advantage of their right to free bus and train travel are also likely to walk and take exercise.  The scheme allows older people to live with dignity and independence while being able to remain in close contact with family and friends.  The recent downturn in the economy means many families have scattered throughout the country in order to obtain employment, with many moving from rural communities to cities.  The pressure on most households to have two people working means they may not be able to spend as much time as they would like, or as they did in the past, with their parents.  Free travel for pensioners enables them to remain in constant contact and allows them to travel to see their children and grandchildren.</p><p>  Every Member agrees the free travel pass plays a significant role for elderly people.  It is ironic that Fianna F&aacute;il is raising the issue, as well as many others, to scare people.  Cutbacks that society has had to bear over the past number of years would not have arisen only for the total mismanagement of the economy by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Fianna F&aacute;il keeps saying that we must move on from the past and we are doing so.  The economy is slowly recovering and we will gradually be able to restore and improve services but we will continue to remind Fianna F&aacute;il and the electorate that the party brought the country to the edge of bankruptcy three times since the foundation of the State.</p></speech>

When will Fianna F&aacute;il disclose that, in its successful efforts to buy its way into power in three successive general elections, it destroyed the lives of thousands of people, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to emigrate and nearly reducing our economy to the status of a banana republic?  As we move forward, having repaired the economy once again, we must do so cautiously.  The Government wants to make real social changes that are sustainable for the future and to maintain the free travel pass, to which we are committed, and to provide other benefits to improve the quality of life for all the population, including the ageing population.</p></speech>

Age Action Ireland is there to protect the elderly and to lobby the Government on issues that may affect it.  It is entitled to do so but the elderly people in our society should not be taken advantage of for some game of political football that the Opposition wants to play.  As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection pointed out, the free travel scheme has been protected by this Government in the past three budgets even though there was a need for a reduction in overall welfare expenditure.  Some 780,000 people are availing of free travel and it is hugely important.  There is untold value to the hundreds of thousands of people who avail of it and it is insincere of the Opposition to create fear unnecessarily.</p><p>  Two weeks ago, I had a telephone call from a gentleman who had been reading the newspapers and wanted reassurance that nothing would happen to his free travel card.  I reassured him and I spoke to him again two days ago, after he had gone from one end of the town to the other on a bus because he could not walk up the hill.  The bus driver told him his card would not be any use to him in a month's time.  That message is not coming from the Government but from the Opposition and it needs to stop.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has been clear when she has said there is no agenda to take away the travel pass from pensioners.</p><p>  I welcome the review, which is needed.  We must address the fact that there is a cap of &euro;77 million while the number of people using the scheme is increasing, as well as other issues concerning fraud.  That does not mean we will take away the passes and the scaremongering needs to stop.</p></speech>

I have a number of senior citizens fora and Age Action Ireland attends regularly.  It tells local people about its care and repair programmes, which are of great benefit, and it does a lot of sound work.</p><p>However, it got it wrong with this campaign.  The campaign has unnecessarily worried people and got them frightened.</p><p>They know how important their travel pass and independence are to them.  They value that independence and the very suggestion that it would be interfered with scared them.  I believe Age Action Ireland was mistaken in embarking on this campaign, because there was never a threat to this scheme.  At this juncture, considering that the Ministers for Social Protection and Transport, Tourism and Sport have said there is no threat to this scheme, this debate should stop now, the motion should be withdrawn and we should debate something genuinely important.</p><p> It is important to discuss the concept of universality.  Often we can be quite complacent about some of our social infrastructure and the reason for it.  We will have a debate soon on free GP care for children under six and some people will say it is unnecessary for people of a certain income bracket to have or avail of social infrastructure or supports like this.  However, if we live in and believe in the essence of a republic, services such as free travel passes, free GP care or free education for everybody are constants we cannot lose sight of, even in straitened times.  I had a meeting with Dublin Bus recently and was told that the &euro;75 million it gets from the social protection budget is vital to the survival of Dublin Bus as a public transport entity in the city.  Therefore, it would be nonsense to suggest this investment from the Department of Social Protection would be interfered with.</p><p> I must touch on the issue of Fianna F&aacute;il hypocrisy, because this issue is being used by Fianna F&aacute;il as a political football to scare people who are terrified their travel pass may be interfered with.  I remind the House that if the Government had followed the four-year plan as laid out by Fianna F&aacute;il when it signed up with the IMF, we would have seen &euro;1.7 billion more in cuts to the social protection budget.  In that scenario, it would have been practically impossible to maintain essential services such as the travel pass.  Fianna F&aacute;il should be grateful the Government did not follow its four-year plan and that &euro;1.7 billion extra was not taken from the social protection budget.  As a result, schemes like the travel pass can be maintained.</p><p> I thank the Ministers for their clarity on this issue.  There has been no ambiguity.  Their language has been straightforward and there has been no obfuscation or clever use of language.  Ministers from across the spectrum, involved in transport and social protection, have been categorical that there is no need for this motion and there is no threat to the travel pass.  It stayed for the past three years and stayed under the previous Administration.  Therefore, there is no point in discussing the issue further.  </p><p> The best thing for Fianna F&aacute;il to do is to apologise for raising the fears of senior citizens and apologise for the tone of its motion and withdraw it on foot of the categorical statements given by the Minister.</p></speech>

It was a great success and garnered much political support for both Charlie Haughey, the then Minister for Finance, and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  To their credit, it provided retired people who were often isolated and financially unable to access private transport, with a route to access their local area and further afield to visit doctors, attend to religious practices, socialise, purchase essentials and take part in other activities which comprised the lives of the people of the State at the time.</p><p>  In the 1966 census, the population was just 2.9 million people.  In 2011, we had 535,000 people in the State over the age of 65.  We have a greater network of public transport operating now, with greater regularity.  This costs more to keep running, due to decent wages and conditions for workers, high safety standards and the increasing cost of fuel.  One sixth of the population in 1966 is today entitled to the free travel pass.  This no longer just provides access to local shops, but access to a modern network which, despite its faults, opens up much of the country to the general public.  This modern reality requires us not to look at the free travel pass as a problem.  However, we must regularly ensure it is working in the best way possible for the greatest number of people and that the principle at its heart remains.  This is particularly important at a time of austerity, when right wing elements are all too quick to call for socially important initiatives to go to the chopping block.</p><p>  When we look at the free travel scheme, there can be no other conclusion drawn but that it is a positive measure which to this day provides a great lifeline for isolated and financially deprived older people.  In a survey carried out by Age Action, some 57% of respondents said that without their travel pass, they would not be able to attend medical or health appointments, while 61% said loss of the pass would prevent them from being able to visit family and friends.  </p><p>  Despite the power of the so called &quot;grey vote&quot;, retired older people are being hit by the Government and were hit by the previous Government.  Most recently, we saw the removal of the bereavement grant and the telephone allowance, which caused large protests.  If the Government intends to weaken the free travel scheme, perhaps it hopes such protests will be more difficult for older people in the future.  Before the recent protests, we saw older people successfully campaign against the removal of their medical cards.  They were addressed by the then Labour Party leader, an unrepentant opponent of austerity, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  He told the crowd that assembled to fight for its rights and that the actions of the Fianna F&aacute;il Government in attacking the rights and entitlements of older people was shameful.  It is not lost on me that this motion has been brought forward by the party that caused that large protest.</p><p>  Older people have also suffered disproportionately from austerity overall.  They have been hurt by the cuts to fuel allowance, home benefit packages and increases in utility costs and refuse collection.  They have been further isolated by the damage done to communities.  The social centres and community projects which have lost funding over the past six years were important connections for older people to their area and their peers.  For many, these centres gave them a purpose when their life of work and family were over.  When families around the country are struggling to make ends meet, it is beyond question that older people are also struggling to survive.  They are struggling to keep their homes warm, to feed themselves and to afford prescription charges for medicine which keeps them in relative comfort.  The free travel pass provides comfort by making it possible for them to connect with others.  As the Age Action survey shows, this is a matter of allowing older people to maintain a life, see friends and family and keep alive.  For older people worst hit by austerity, the free travel pass is key to the only warmth and comfort they can get in the day.  We have all heard of older people forced to wander through shops during the day for warmth.  They also sit on buses, trains and trams.</p><p>  I recognise the Government has denied it plans to make any cuts or changes and do not believe reviews should not take place.  I welcome the opportunity for it to state plainly and clearly tonight that older people can rest easy, that their free travel entitlements are secure and that the essential services the pass provides are here to stay.  It is important to maintain these facilities for older people.</p></speech>

The importance of the free travel scheme to older people across the State cannot be overstated.</p><p>They are not alone in depending on the travel pass to overcome isolation and live a meaningful life of dignity and inclusion.  It is unfortunate that the Fianna F&aacute;il motion makes no mention of the thousands of people with disabilities and their carers, for whom the travel pass scheme must also be defended and protected in full.  I am of the view that this matter warrants express mention, particularly when we consider the fate of other schemes designed to meet the varying travel needs of people with disabilities.</p><p>The mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant are two schemes that were intended to contribute to the transport costs of people with disabilities which impede them or leave them unable to use public transport.  In a stunning move, the Government closed these schemes to new applicants early last year.  It promised at the time that they would be replaced with something new but, more than a year later, no such replacements have materialised.  The Government also announced that the excise duty relief element of the disabled drivers and passengers scheme would be discontinued from the end of the year.  The Minister for Finance has promised that it will be replaced by a new fuel grant scheme of equivalent value.  However, the clock is ticking and no concrete details have as yet emerged in respect of a replacement scheme.  It must be remembered that there is no cost-of-disability payment in this State and, therefore, not just cash transfers but all the other various elements of the package of supports available to people with disabilities, including the free travel scheme, are all core to the overall income of people with disabilities and their households.</p><p>In its pre-budget submission to the Department of Social Protection, the Disability Federation of Ireland stated:<blockquote>We can no longer accept the argument that the protection of basic payments equates with the protection of basic income.  Supplementary income supports are part of people&rsquo;s basic income, and must be protected and bolstered to reflect growing need to pay for extra medical, transport and living costs that must be met, just as these very services are being stripped back ... Supplementary benefits such as Household Benefits Package, domiciliary Care Allowance and Free Travel Scheme, must be protected.</blockquote>I am of the view that the Department should consider how it might extend travel supports to other people with disabilities who do not satisfy the narrow means test criteria relating to the disability allowance.  I was recently approached by a woman who suffers from multiple sclerosis whose disability allowance had been terminated and, as a consequence, whose travel pass had been withdrawn.  This was all because her husband's income is &euro;36 above the threshold.  The withdrawal of her travel pass is what really bites for her.  It has caused her great mental and financial anguish because she is unable to drive and has limited ability to walk as a result of her illness.  She had come to rely on her travel pass in order to gain some access to the outside world.</p><p>In its response to the motion, I urge the Government to make a clear and categorical commitment that there will be no further erosion of the transport supports for people with disabilities and that, at a minimum, the free travel scheme will be protected in full for older people, those with disabilities and their carers.  In its amendment, the Government states its commitment &quot;to fully supporting and retaining the free travel scheme as a universal benefit for elderly people&quot;.  I request that it extend this commitment to those with disabilities.  It is possible that the only reason the Government is not considering restricting the free travel scheme is that older people have spoken at recent elections.  When the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government launched an attack on their benefits, they came out in massive numbers and forced that Administration to reverse its decision.</p><p>Deputy Nash saw fit to have a go at Sinn F&eacute;in, but as soon as the other members of his party who were present in the Chamber had concluded their contributions, he legged it because he did not want to listen to the truth.  The Deputy's party were recently rejected by the people North and South.  My apologies; that party does not even bother to run candidates in the North, so it cannot even put its policies to the electorate there.  However, its sister party was rejected by the nationalist people in the North.  On the issue of social welfare reform there, the Labour Party's sister party takes exactly the same stance we take in rejecting Tory cuts.  Rather than the Assembly, it is the Tories who have set the agenda.  This matter has never been properly put to the Assembly as a result of who controls the purse strings and the fact that the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have never demanded the transfer of the relevant fiscal powers to the Assembly.</p></speech>

It showed a certain vision and a recognition that people's quality of life is greatly diminished when they are immobilised and improved when they are mobile.  The decision in question showed some empathy and understanding of the reality of life for those who have no transport and recognised that mobility is a right that should be protected for the old and those with mobility difficulties.</p><p>  Although public transport in rural areas is under-resourced and could be much better, it remains a lifeline to the outside world for many people who for economic, social or health reasons cannot drive.  Utilising free travel is how these people get to see their grandchildren and other family members and, above all, maintain their independence.  It also allows them to make hospital appointments, collect their pensions, do their shopping and, above all, meet people in order that they might enjoy some form of social outlet.  The effect of rural isolation on elderly people is devastating.  Maintaining their right to free travel is the least we can do for a generation whose members built this country and, in the main, worked all their lives, paid tax and insurance and contributed in all sorts of way to this State.  This concession is not a one-way process.  Rural isolation and the consequences relating to it are known to every Deputy who represents a rural constituency.  We see evidence of its impact on a daily basis.  The only connection many individuals in rural areas have with the wider community is by means of their access to free travel.</p><p>  Active retirement is a benefit to the hospitality industry, and there are many hotels and restaurants doing a great trade in catering to the needs of those who have retired.  The existence of this market depends on free travel.  There are some in the industry whose businesses would not have survived the decrease in the number of tourists from abroad visiting Ireland were it not for the domestic market created by active retirement groups vacationing at home.</p><p>  I sometimes reflect on the way discussions at the Cabinet table go when those in government sit down to make cuts.  Is there anyone in the Cabinet who brings a bit of empathy, sympathy or compassion to that table, or is it all about the bottom line, prioritising the financial implications above the social implications and a devil-take-the-hindmost approach?  I wonder who proposed to take free travel away from old age pensioners - we were informed earlier that it will not be taken from them - and what was the rationale behind that suggestion.  Was there no recognition that, in terms of the common good, free travel for people over 66 years of age is a good thing which must continue?  That is the least we can do for our people.  There seems to be a mood around the Cabinet table which dictates that anything which might make life a bit easier for vulnerable people is fair game for a cut.  The policies of austerity and the consequences thereof are felt in every single part of our country.  The idea that someone might perhaps have the audacity to enjoy free travel means that the Government must move to take it from them.  When the problems its removal will create become more acute, this decision will be looked at in hindsight and regretted.  I urge that the free travel scheme be fully supported and retained - I take some comfort from what those on the Government side said earlier in that regard - in its current form as a universal benefit to all people aged 66 and over.  It is clearly the right thing to do.  Long may the free travel scheme continue.</p></speech>

If the 780,000 people on the scheme were all to start using cars, quite an amount of damage would be done to the environment.  If we really want to count costs, then we must take all of them into account.</p><p>Like others, I have been contacted by people who have asked me questions.  People understand this scheme is under review.  Their reading is that if it is under review then the Government will change something about it.  It is essential that the Government comes out and says what is being reviewed.  I heard the Minister saying earlier that there is no threat to the travel pass.  However, I was in the House when the same categoric assurances were given in respect of the Scandinavian model of child care and one-parent family payments.  Only last week 5,000 families lost that payment and a further 4,000 will lose the payment incrementally in the coming years.  Sometimes categoric assurances are not really worth a great deal and certainly they have not been worth much in that case.</p><p> There is a major issue of trust with this Government.  The Government must use a language that is not a code for something else.  There have been accusations that people are flying kites when we talk about the language of government and the primary or core rates of social welfare being maintained and that is understandable.  Most people take the view that this means the social welfare system is being maintained but really it is a code for introducing something else.  This has been discrediting for politics in that people had no expectation that some of these things that were to be changed were actually changed.  Indeed not even this was true because the core rates, for example, for people under the age of 25 years, changed as did those for people who had payments limited to nine months as opposed to a 12 month payment.  A major rebuilding project is required by this Government and the language of Government must change.  The language of Government should be overt rather than covert in terms of political survival.  I do not believe the Government will be able to build trust unless it deals with that.</p></speech>

The majority of them are living on greatly reduced incomes.  Many are helping out their children who are unemployed or in negative equity as well as adult children who have had to move home.  They have seen increases in private health insurance and medication costs.  They have lost the telephone allowance and the death benefit.  They have seen medical card issues, the property tax and now there are impending water charges.  The one service they have for free, a facility that has been in place since 1967, may be under threat.</p><p>  I note that the Government amendment recognises the vital role of the free travel pass in supporting elderly people and reducing isolation.  The amendment also states that the Government is fully committed to supporting and retaining the free travel pass.  I am pleased the debate has at least brought clarity to that aspect of the matter.  However, this is not simply about free travel.  It is also about the opportunities that the pass gave people who availed of it.  It is also about the money that they spend at the various destinations to which they travel.  The pass enables them to avail of essential services.  It is also of particular benefit to those with disabilities who are included in the scheme.  Last week we saw funding for two particular services cut, namely, the Irish Deaf Society and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  Both services benefit elderly citizens.</p><p>  A working group was set up by the Government to consider solutions to the so-called problems associated with the scheme.  There were representatives from the Departments of Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Transport Authority and the transport operators.  Where were the representatives for senior citizens?  Where were the representatives from disability groups?  Many groups could have been represented but were not.  There are many groups representing senior citizens, including the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament or the Irish Association of Older People.  We have a vibrant docklands senior citizen community on both sides of the Liffey.  It is important that the working group presents its recommendations.</p><p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has been at promoting positive ageing.  This possibility, whether this is scaremongering or whatever, coupled with the cuts to date do not support positive ageing.  They go against what is in the programme for Government which says that elderly persons will be recognised, supported and enabled to live independently.  The free travel pass enables them to do this.  We should of course get the facts and sort out the fraud but there should be no threat to the travel pass.  It is not a problem.  In fact, it is actually a solution to many of the problems that affect elderly people and those with a disability.</p></speech>

The Minister has seen what is going on between the Committee of Public Accounts and individuals who were at one stage in the leadership of the Rehab organisation as well as the associated issues relating to people who were part of organisations in receipt of significant State funding.  I realise it is not the same thing but nevertheless these people should be accountable.  Instead, up to now they have found ways to avoid being asked the necessary questions on behalf of the taxpayer.</p><p>  Does the Minister of State believe for one minute that such a situation could not arise given the great width of the brief of the National Treasury Management Agency?  The agency touches vast areas of economic life as well as the numerous commercial private interests that it could be involved with.  This is a recipe for escaping accountability or potentially escaping accountability on crucial issues.  The Government should withdraw it now.</p></speech>

If there is a court case or if there are issues and a dispute, we resolve them, if necessary by going to the High Court.  No High Court judge would look favourably on anyone who was obfuscating and refusing to answer proper and germane questions in respect of their role.  At the same time they would also have to recognise and acknowledge the fact that if there were significant legal and other issues involved, it may not be appropriate for someone to say something, in particular when the matter was before the courts.  We are not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

This is absolutely ridiculous.  The Minister of State has just provided a menu in a potential situation that could arise.  People in charge of public agencies who should be responsible to the D&aacute;il could bring about a situation amounting to ducks and drakes up to and back from the High Court and so on.  We have seen this with the tribunals and how it can absolutely frustrate an attempt to get the truth and the facts in respect of serious issues.  It is perfectly simple.  If a matter is <i>sub judice</i>and if discussing it in a committee could prejudice proceedings, then that is fine and no one disagrees with it.</p><p>However, does the Minister of State acknowledge that what the Government is providing for in this measure - "any matter which is or has been or may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State" - is very wide in its application?  It is incredible that the Government is including a measure that could be used to frustrate a quest for truth and fact on critical issues that affect taxpayers.</p></speech>

I have refined the amendment which referred to members of the agency only, not all staff.  There should be a register of declared interests.  It is terrible governance that the only place in which to find a register of declared interests is the minutes of a meeting.  One would have to trawl through the minutes of various meetings.  The agency should, at a minimum, maintain a secret register of declared interests.  For the purposes of transparency though, that register should be public.  Each Deputy must declare interests.  Someone who is a member of the agency should also declare his or her interests.  This relates to the core issue in some of my amendments - transparency and accountability.  The public and investigative journalists uncover failures to declare interests.  This has happened time and again throughout Irish history, not just in the 1940s or 1950s but regularly.  If one does not have a register, one will not be able to engage in this type of investigative journalism to determine whether, when an agency makes a decision on X, Y or Z, one of its members has an undeclared interest.  Legitimate questions could be asked about whether that person had absented himself or herself from the meeting or tried to influence its outcome.</p></speech>

The members of the NTMA will be designated directors under the Ethics in Public Office Act and required to make annual disclosures of interest statements under same.  These statements are made to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and copies are retained in the NTMA.  The statements are kept for 15 years.  NTMA staff members designated under the Act also make annual statements but to the NTMA only.</p><p>  The code of practice for the governance of State bodies requires that, on appointment, board members should disclose any interest that may cause a conflict.  Details of interests disclosed should, as the Deputy mentioned, be kept in a special confidential register and updated annually.  Changes in the interim must be notified to the secretary as soon as possible by members.  Only the chairperson, the secretary and chief executive should have access to the register.  The NTMA already keeps a register in respect of members of the advisory committee and will do so in respect of the board.  The treatment of members as regards the disclosure of interests is the same as that of members of the boards of other public bodies.  These arrangements are more than adequate.  Having set out the process, I hope I have helped to allay the Deputy's concerns.  Given what is in place, we cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The question of a register of declared interests should not just be addressed in this legislation but also become the subject of a wider debate, including on our roles.  Deputies declare assets but not debts.  In the past two years the media have been able to uncover that a number of Ministers have debts with financial institutions.  Questions were raised about the appropriateness of lobbying institutions using headed State paper and so on.  One Minister reportedly had soft loans from an institution, an individual in which, Mr. Michael Fingleton, had provided a very soft loan for another Member of the House who had been the subject of the Moriarty tribunal.  The problem is that our register of interests only deals with assets, not liabilities.  One is probably more in the pocket of the banks in the decisions one makes if one owes them &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000, depends on them to restructure one's business portfolio or debts or is in fear of losing one's home or farm.</p><p>  There needs to be greater transparency in the registering of declared interests, albeit within limits that could be addressed through regulations.  All of the agency's members are appointed by the Government.  A register of their declared interests should be publicly available.  Every Deputy can make a mistake, but it is because of public scrutiny that complaints have been made to the SIPO, for example, about Deputies not declaring interests about which the public knows because people live next to them, know that they have rental properties that were not included in the register or know that one of their properties may have been the subject of a lengthy tribunal of inquiry process because it was not declared.  These are important issues, but if there is no register, there is nothing for the public to go by.  This leads to the greater risk of members of the agency not declaring interests and it never being uncovered.</p></speech>

It is not good enough to confine this measure to people making declarations if they believe there are conflicts of interest.  The Government voted down the idea that representatives of ordinary people should be considered for membership of the board.  This has left all of these other categories of investment, treasury management, risk management and corporate finance.  It is inevitable that we will end up with people who have fingers in many pies in private capitalist institutions and enterprises.  The least taxpayers should expect with the agency in charge of considerable tranches of public funding, supposedly on their behalf, is that its members' interests would be made public.  What is wrong with this in the eyes of a Government that is supposedly in favour of transparency and accountability?</p></speech>

It is a private register of declared interests - a private, secret document that is being maintained by the agency.  It is clearly written in the legislation that where there is a declaration in relation to a disclosure of certain interests by members of staff - there is process in terms of who adjudicates on that, for example, the chairman - and if the chairman believes they may have a conflict of interest, a nominated person would do that for them.  In the event of a person failing to declare an interest, which would mean he or she would be in breach of the legislation and the law, he or she would not be removed from the agency.  That drives a coach and four through the Minister of State's suggestion that the Ethics in Public Office Act provides for the holding of a private register and everything will be fine.  It is set out in black and white in the legislation that the Minister has the power to remove a person from the agency, but a person who breaks the law and fails to disclose a conflict of interest - which means he or she would continue to participate and influence decisions - would not be automatically removed from the agency.  We should get real about this.  This sends out the wrong signal.  It should be black or white.  If one fails to disclose a conflict of interest, one should be off the board and that should be grounds for automatic dismissal.  The Minister of State might enlighten us on the circumstances where it would be deemed to be appropriate for a member of the agency, who conceals from the rest of the staff a conflict of interest and is subsequently found out, to stay in his or her position.  We are not talking about an agency that is pushing around a few &euro;100 here and there; we are talking about billions of euro of the Irish State's money and major investments and decisions.  I ask the Minister of State to inform the House of where he would see that situation arising.</p></speech>

This amendment provides that if the Government decided it wanted to enlist the project management services of the agency in terms of the winding up, reorganisation or restructuring of a designated body, any request from a Minister under this subsection would require the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is another formula in regard to the directions we discussed earlier.  There were suggestions that the directions would be too wide.  This proposal in respect of section 19(3) is clear.  If the Minister believed under these limited circumstances a proposal involved the acquisition or disposal of any of our designated bodies - the winding up, reorganisation or restructuring of a designated body - he or she should have to come to the Houses for approval in relation those matters.  If they are not contentious, the Minister would get approval without delay and if they are, there rightly would be a heated debate in this and the Upper House on these matters.  It is about accountability, holding the Government to account and making sure that matters have been fully teased out by Members of these Houses before a decision is taken.  It does not in any way preclude the Minister from using the powers available to him or her in this section, rather it provides for debating them before the Minister gives effect to them.  </p><p>Amendment No. 6, proposing the deletion of those lines, is one that I would preferably like to have accepted.  I do not want the provision in those lines in the Act, which facilitates the potential sale of State assets.  It is one of the major flaws in the legislation.  It deals with a number of areas and the investment in terms of the Irish economy is to be welcomed.  It probably makes up a third of the Bill.  The others parts of it are deeply flawed.  Given that the Government is refusing to accept any amendment, it is difficult to accept this Bill in the round at the end of the day.  This provision is one that would need to be amended before approval could be given to the Bill in its entirety.</p></speech>

Subsection (3) states that the agency shall provide project management services in relation to any acquisition or disposal of any interest or any asset of the designated body if the Minister who is the relevant Minister requires it to do so.  Let us consider the designated bodies.  The Electricity Supply Board,  Bord na M&oacute;na, Coillte Teoranta, Irish Water and Ervia, which used to be Bord G&aacute;is - all very crucial State and semi-State assets in the ownership of the people but on which the troika cast its eyes and was making demands concerning the privatisation of some of these designated bodies or aspects of them and two Governments capitulated to those demands for privatisation.  Therefore, I oppose the facilitation of the privatisation of crucial, publicly owned assets.  That is what is provided for here.</p><p>The Ministers concerned are those who essentially have the control and responsibility for those semi-State organisations.  The Bill is providing a blueprint by which crucial public assets can be privatised.  The Minister will give an instruction to the agency to provide a project management service for the disposal of crucial assets.  We are opposed to any further privatisation of assets that instead should be developed, used and invested in to create better infrastructure and tens of thousands of jobs which is the potential within some of these organisations.  We are in favour of new ones being created, such as a new housing agency or something related to the local authorities.  Is it not instructive that the Government is talking about bringing back from abroad &euro;6.9 billion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest at the same time it is making provision for the privatisation of crucial public assets in terms of State and semi-State bodies?<b></b></p><p>We are right to be suspicious of this Government in terms of its motivation in this regard.  The right wing basis of this Government leads us to object to any facilitation of further privatisation, which is the purpose of my amendment.</p></speech>

I wish it did not.  The Minister of State might argue that provision has been made for Irish Water to remain a public company.  Some of us are dubious about that.  We believe the Government has done that under public pressure.  We are also dubious as to what extent this will remain the case or for that matter whether privatisation by stealth is already happening in that Irish Water can engage in outsourcing and so on.  Setting aside all of those points, the point being made is that if the Minister who has the power to do so asks the NTMA to prepare the nuts and bolts of the sale of a State asset then he or she in making that call - which I wish he or she could not do - should at least be required to come before this House to debate the matter, during which time serious questions about the details of preparations for the project could be raised.</p><p>  I refer to the proposed sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte.  During the year and a half between when the Government was committed to that sell-off and its reversal of that decision, which I welcomed, one of the issues of concern was the value for money that might or might not be achieved in that regard.  The figure bandied around in respect of the amount for which the harvesting rights would be sold was &euro;600 million.  That is the figure that was referred to by some Ministers.  People who are more knowledgeable than I in the area of forestry pointed out that in the context of the cost of timber per acre and so on this amounted to a give-away of the harvesting rights.  On foot of being informed of this by people who are more knowledgeable than I in this area I repeatedly tabled parliamentary questions on the matter, including at various stages to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, but I came up against a blank wall.  I was told that the information was commercially sensitive and to release it would jeopardise the negotiations, all of which was nonsense as far as I am concerned.  Despite that what we were speaking of was the sale of a valuable State asset I could not get information about it.  </p><p>  This provision would ensure that if a Minister makes this call he or she, prior to the NTMA commencing development of the project, would have to engage in a discussion on that decision in this House.  That is a reasonable and fairly minimal requirement to ensure transparency, oversight and so on of a decision regarding the disposal of the people's assets.  These are vital assets owned by the people.</p></speech>

First, under this subsection the Minister can request the agency to do something.  As such, he or she would not be issuing a direction or an order in terms of the legal standing of the request.  Would we be made aware of such a request being made or would this form part of the normal communication between a Minister and the agency and will it be placed on the public record in any way?</p><p>Second, I do not have any difficulty with a Minister requesting the agency to provide project management services <i>per se</i>.  However, when it comes to the sale of an asset, be that the designated body or part of it, what role will this House have on the substantive issue of the question of disposal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-07-08a.563" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="21:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800055#CCC00800"><p>Deputies have posed many good questions.  As I have addressed this issue earlier, I do not propose to respond to all of the different issues raised.  Taking the last point first, whatever powers exist in the legislation establishing the designated body, which powers differ in respect of each agency, are the only powers that currently exist.  The Minister cannot do anything which supersedes or negates that legislation, unless new legislation is introduced.  For example, if the Minister decided to sell body A and has the power under existing legislation to do so - I must stress this power does not exist in all cases - then he or she would ask the Department officials to set the project in motion.  Effectively, this provision enables NewERA to be asked to do that job and to provide its specialist services, knowledge and expertise in relation to the particular area.  I could not conceive of any case when such decision would not be debated in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  In terms of the sale of the property of Bord G&aacute;is legislation was brought before the D&aacute;il.  In other cases, legislation was not required, for example, the sale of a power station at the ESB.  In each case every Member of the Opposition and Government has the opportunity and right to question the line Minister in this House by way of priority question, oral and written questions, questions to the Taoiseach on the Order of Business and the Minister before the appropriate committee.  There has to be total accountability in such matters.  I cannot imagine any significant sale, if allowed - as I said earlier, all sales are not permitted - not being debated by the Oireachtas in some capacity or other.  </p><p>  While I accept that Deputies' fears are real nothing new is being provided for.  All that is being provided is that the Minister following a decision made under existing legislation can, rather than requesting his or her Department to do something, request NewERA to do it.  There is nothing sinister or unusual in what is being provided for.  The result will be greater availability of specialist knowledge.  Also, this gives due recognition to NewERA being able to provide advice.</p></speech>

I accept that is what the Minister of State genuinely believes.  I would never have imagined any circumstances in which we would issue &euro;31 billion of promissory notes without debate in this House but that happened.  That is the point I am making.  These things do happen.  Events overtake.  There will be different people holding the position which the Minister of State currently holds who will have different priorities and so on and so forth.  Legislation is about putting in place protections.  My amendment proposes deletion of this section.  If, as the Minister of State says, there could be no circumstance in which there would not be a debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the proposed sale of a State asset, then I suggest that provision be made in the Bill during its passage through the Seanad to the effect that the proposed disposal of any interest in a State asset would require debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>If the Minister of State genuinely believes in what he is saying, why does he believe my point, if only in respect of disposal, is so wrong?  For me, it is a compromise to a compromise but I would rather something than nothing.  However, I am very much of the view that the measure should be deleted.  At a bare minimum, there needs to be a debate on any disposals that occur.</p></speech>

The regulations and laws in regard to the body would apply.  That is the issue and not this legislation.  This legislation only enables the Minister to ask NewERA to advise.  If one examined each body to get the facts on all the relevant issues from the line Department, one could then make one's legal proposal and put it before the D&aacute;il or whatever.</p></speech>

I am trying to be helpful.  Legislation on the sale was debated in the House because the law required that there would have to be a full debate when that body was set up.  Other bodies were able to sell portions of property without such legislation going through the Oireachtas.  In no case was there not a debate.</p></speech>

The Minister of State rightly pointed out that if Uisce &Eacute;ireann were under discussion, there would be a debate anyway by default because of the way it has been established in the legislation.</p></speech>

There may or may not be a debate.  The Minister of State is suggesting that we return to each Act and do what applies in respect of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, that is, include a provision stipulating that if the relevant State asset or part thereof is to be sold, there will need to be a debate.  I am saying that does not make any sense.  First, it would clog up the whole legislative programme if we had to amend eight separate Acts.  What we have in front of us is legislation that could, when passed, be the vehicle used to dispose of an interest in any State asset.  We should state in this legislation that where a Government intends to sell off a State asset or part thereof, there should be a debate in this House.  With regard to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, there would be a debate anyway but, regarding those bodies that are not subject to an automatic debate at present, there would be a requirement for one if my proposal on disposals were accepted.</p></speech>

It is amazing that we should have to propose something that is so obvious to anybody outside the House.  The most strategic need in the country is the provision of social and affordable housing.</p></speech>
