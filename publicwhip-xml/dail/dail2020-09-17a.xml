I know this is not news but with the new funding stream coming from 2021 to 2027, we need to make sure the northern and western region takes full advantage of that funding that will be in place in co-operation with the EU, and our downgraded status needs to be reversed.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700003#A00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The designation of the northern and western region by the EU as a region in transition underscores the importance of achieving balanced regional development as our economy and population continue to grow.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government places a strong emphasis on balanced regional development as our economy and population continue to grow and does this through a range of measures.  My Department supports this commitment through targeted investment that supports rural regeneration, facilitates new working opportunities and fosters regional enterprise growth.  A significant level of support and investment has been provided to the northern and western region by my Department.  Since January 2018, 40% of rural regeneration and development funding and 34% of town and village renewal funding have been invested in that region.  This investment amounts to more than &euro;80 million on these schemes alone.</p>  <p>  In addition to this direct investment, my Department also funds and supports the Western Development Commission, WDC, in its role as an enabler of the development of the western region.  Last year, the commission published a new five-year strategy for the western region and continues to provide targeted investment to establish emerging firms through the western investment fund.  Since 2019, the WDC has also taken a co-ordinating role in the development of the Atlantic economic corridor initiative, which has significant potential to deliver for the north west.  The WDC is also developing a network of digital enterprise and remote working hubs within the northern and western region.  The increased shift to remote working in the past six months has given us the opportunity to reimagine the possibilities for a greater regional distribution of jobs and to capitalise on the quality of life which the regions offer.</p></speech>

It did not happen by accident and we all know this is the result of decades of underinvestment by previous Governments and this Government in infrastructure west of the Shannon.  We are the only region in Ireland that has been downgraded by the EU Commission and that is because we are lagging behind.  When one looks at the west and the north west, we are bottom of the table when it comes to Government investment, whether that is in roads, health, jobs or higher education.  The proof of that is there to be seen.</p>  <p>  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly has done excellent work in the report and plan it has brought forward and I encourage the Minister to engage with it as we go forward, particularly as the new round of regional funding for 2021 to 2027 approaches.  According to the EU Commission, we have one of the highest levels of regional inequality in the entire EU and this has to be addressed urgently.  We know the impact of Brexit on this region will be major and we also know that the EU Commission has said that the impact of Covid-19 will be especially difficult for the west and the north west.  Will the Minister engage with the Northern and Western Regional Assembly on its plan for what needs to happen with regional funding going forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700003#A00700"><p>I am aware of these matters, being from the northern and western region, as is the Deputy.  I have met with the Northern and Western Regional Assembly on two occasions in recent months, most recently at the end of July in Ballaghaderreen.  I heard first-hand of its concerns about the new European regional development fund, ERDF, funding and how important it is that it should get the opportunity to administer it, as it did in the past.  I have passed those concerns on to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.</p>  <p>  I want to point out that there has been considerable investment in the region.  The national broadband plan represents an investment of &euro;656 million in the northern and western region, and the scale of the Government's commitment to balanced regional development is exemplified by the national development plan and the national planning framework, which will deliver an estimated &euro;116 billion in public investment through several targeted funds over the lifespan of those funds.  The rural regeneration and development fund supports renewal for suitable towns, and &euro;22.3 million has been invested in the north west through that fund.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700003#A00800"><p>I am glad the Minister has referred to the plans that are being considered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that would essentially see these regional funds being centralised in Dublin.  That is an outrageous proposition that should have never come to the desk of any Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As I said, we are looking at the impacts of Brexit and at the fact that we are no longer designated as a developed region, which is so serious for our region going forward.  The level of investment and infrastructure that is required has not been there and that needs to change.  We need a multibillion infrastructural plan specifically for this region.  The Northern and Western Regional Assembly has done the work and we need to make sure that regional funding is given to and remains in the regions so that it is spent on what is best.  We also need to make sure the regions have the ability to look at how they spend those funds and we need a plan on specific projects to make sure we change the wave on this.  We cannot remain a region in transition.  People want to live in the west and the north west.  At the moment, there is no fair play when it comes to investment and that needs to change urgently.</p></speech>

Some &euro;5.6 million was invested under the regional enterprise development fund, &euro;22.3 million was invested under the rural regeneration fund and &euro;9.1 million was invested under the urban regeneration and development fund.  In my last Department, I established a &euro;28 million Border economic stimulus package and that provided a support of &euro;15 million for projects across the Border counties, which are also in this region.</p> <p>The counties are Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan and Monaghan.  This was the first time ever there was a dedicated fund of that nature for a region.  Those projects will make a significant difference to the north-west region, which will be particularly impacted by Brexit.  Other elements of the Border economic stimulus package include an extra &euro;3 million for the six local enterprise offices, an &euro;8.5 million Brexit transformation fund to enable firms to transform their business and diversify their markets, and &euro;1.5 million for industry fellowships.  We need the targeted support, and the Border stimulus package is certainly doing that in the region.</p></speech>

Covid-19 has highlighted the weaknesses in school transport policy in particular.  We know that currently there is a review of the school transport scheme but to our mind there is no point in having a review of the school transport scheme unless the Minister's Department is mapped across the review.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700004#B00500"><p>I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising this issue.  As he will be aware, the provision of transport services, including for rural areas, is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Continued operation of the public transport system is among the designated essential services that have carried on throughout the Covid-19 crisis and transport operators and their staff must be thanked for their dedication to providing what is a vital service for rural areas in such challenging times.  While I have not met with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding these challenges, I am aware that his Department has been working closely with the NTA in line with the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business and the recently published Government plan for living with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the next phase of rural policy for Ireland to succeed the Action Plan for Rural Development which concluded at the end of 2019.  The need for further integration of rural, regional and national public transport services to provide a comprehensive and reliable service to people who live, work and study in rural towns, villages and outlying areas was highlighted as part of the consultation process to inform the development of the new policy.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes commitments to the development of integrated public transport and connectivity in rural areas and works continue to be funded through Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan to ensure that people living in rural Ireland remain connected with their local communities and beyond through investment in public transport and the road network.  My Department will continue to engage across the Government, including with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to identify tangible policy measures to further enhance access to transport services in rural areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700004#B00600"><p>I thank the Minister for her response.  If her Department is developing a rural policy for Ireland I do not think it is possible to do so without talking about the totality of public transport.  Increasingly, rural Ireland is a cosmopolitan place.  The people who live there now traverse the entire demographic of Irish society.  Without being too verbose about it, this September there was a crisis regarding the supply of school transport.  Hopefully, that will be worked through.  There is an opportunity here for policy coherence to radicalise how rural transport is developed.  We have Local Link which, arguably, is a very successful service.  That is certainly the case in my neck of the woods.  In developing a rural policy there is no reason we could not look at the totality of transport.  I prevail upon the Minister to take into account the fact that 120,000 children use school transport.  I realise it is not across the Minister's Department, but there is the potential to use the 5,000 buses involved in school transport to transport other people as well who live in rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700004#B00700"><p>I agree with Deputy Sherlock.  There needs to be cross-Government thinking, and there has been.  As part of the rural development policy I have engaged right across all of the Departments because everybody has an input into this policy.  Local Link, which the Deputy mentioned, is one of the best rural transport initiatives that we have.  Some of the local companies are really good at the joined-up thinking that we need.  For example, in Cavan and Monaghan, with which I am familiar, there is an integration of the services, which includes providing transport for health services for people who need to go to hospital appointments and those going to college.  There is a really good service in Cavan and Monaghan that links the two institutes which runs over and back five times a day.  Students going to the local colleges can get transport, which did not happen before.  The service has enhanced the local institutes of education.  Deputy Sherlock is absolutely right about joined-up thinking.  We need to do that.  I assure him that I will be engaging with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on that issue.</p></speech>

Many people who ordinarily would not have been connected to Internet technologies are now in possession of smartphones and can use that technology in a seamless way across the age range.  It is about developing a coherent supply of transport services to allow people to use the technology to map on, so that no matter where they are living they can get access to services and they do not have to go to a place to buy a ticket, for example, as they can use their phones now.  There is an opportunity to radicalise in a positive sense how we deliver rural transport in a more cosmopolitan society, as it were.</p></speech>

That is something I will certainly work closely on with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There is &euro;2 million in the July stimulus package for new and expanded local bus services.  There is also &euro;250,000 to support the transition of Local Link services to zero-emission vehicles in areas of rural Ireland.  A total of &euro;21 million is being provided to improve rail journeys and that will primarily support works along the Dublin to Cork line.  There is a commitment to rural transport in the programme for Government and I will certainly support it.</p></speech>

Community centres, as Deputy Paul Donnelly knows, are often the focal point for vital activities that can foster community resilience.  The most relevant programme in my Department is the community services programme to community centres.  Overall, the community services programme funds approximately 400 community organisations and earlier this year a support fund of &euro;1.2 million was put in place, providing additional funding to many of these organisations, many of which suffered loss of income due to Covid-19, as they are partially dependent on revenue-raising through renting out spaces, caf&eacute;s and so on.</p>  <p>  My Department also introduced a package of supports for community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises in the context of Covid-19, which included a stability fund of up to &euro;35 million.  Some community centres met eligibility criteria for this and are receiving funding from the fund.</p>  <p>  The 2020 community enhancement programme, which was launched in June and has funding of &euro;2 million provides small capital grants to community organisations.  Separately, under the July stimulus, a &euro;5 million fund was launched for repairs and upgrades to community centres and community buildings.  Details can be found on the website.</p>  <p>  The overarching rural development investment programme has been tailored to address the emerging challenges associated with Covid-19.  This includes the town and village renewal scheme, which is currently open for applications.  Improvements to community centres have been funded through this scheme in the past.</p> <p>My Department will continue to work with relevant stakeholders, including the community and voluntary sector, local authorities and local development companies, to support community organisations across the country as they deal with the ongoing and emerging challenges presented by Covid-19.</p></speech>

Many of those to whom I have spoken are concerned.  They appreciate the funding that has been provided, but they say it is not enough, given that the impact on their centres has been enormous.  Most closed and then reopened with significantly reduced capacities.  Many of the centres had to retain reserve funds because they were companies limited by guarantee, but they are now approaching the end of that pot.  Their reserve funding is running out.  This issue has not just arisen in the current context - centres have always asked for multi-annual funding, which would allow them to plan and prepare.  Now, they have no reserve funding and little income.  The money they have received to date has been welcome, but it is not enough.  The managers are concerned about 2021 and 2022.</p></speech>

My Department developed a &euro;1.2 million fund to ensure that such organisations could pay their full-time CSP-supported employees a maximum of &euro;350 per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP-supported employees.</p>  <p>  Pobal has issued a financial survey to all CSP-supported organisations to identify their remaining financial issues.  We are in an organised and forensic way looking to see what the real issues are for each of the relevant organisations.  Pobal will report to the Department this month, following which the Department will consider any additional funding need that may arise as detailed in that report.</p></speech>

I sent out a survey to a number of community centres.  One response struck me, that of Huntstown in Castleknock in my constituency.  The centre stated that its reserve funds had been depleted and its traded income was down by more than 80%.  Along with that traded income, the CSP grant received was used to bring people up to the minimum wage.  This centre is concerned because, if it does not have a reserve fund and income coming in, the CSP funding will not be able to meet the minimum wage.  The centre would like to pay the living wage, but it cannot.  It is fearful that if there is no guarantee that CSP funding will at least help to match the minimum wage, it will have to let people go in 2021.  This concern is shared across the board because funding from the CSP is &euro;9.38 per individual yet the funding for the minimum wage is nowhere near that.</p>  <p>  People are asking me questions about this issue.  Will the Minister of State give community centres some clarity about 2021?  I am sorry, but I am not seeing much clarity right now.</p></speech>

Under the stability fund, &euro;45,000 was approved for the Huntstown family resource centre.  I am just putting these figures into the mix.</p>  <p>  To address the Deputy's question, the Estimates process is ongoing.  I am fighting hard for the community service programme across the country.  Some organisations are in trouble.  Outside of Covid, and while I might hope it was not the case, there is a natural rate of attrition every year where some services cannot survive.  Some services exit the programme and new ones enter it.</p>  <p>  I met an organisational body of CSP managers several weeks ago.  The managers laid out a stark picture as well as some proposals, which we are considering.  I asked them to organise further meetings for me with different types of community services from around the country.  I am eager to stay in touch with the stories on the ground such as the one the Deputy outlined.</p></speech>

It has supported 106 towns and villages across every county to adapt to living with Covid.  For example, it has facilitated the purchase of stage and amplification equipment for community events and concerts in west Cork and the revamp of Macroom town centre.  Given the success of the scheme, will the Minister please extend it to enable more communities to avail of this funding?</p></speech>

This year's town and village renewal scheme has been tailored to assist our rural towns and villages to respond to the challenges presented by Covid-19.  The scheme includes an accelerated measure to enable towns and villages to introduce initiatives immediately in order to support increased footfall and enable people to shop and socialise safely in accordance with public health guidelines.  The scheme also includes a standard measure that places a focus this year on the recovery of towns and villages from the impact of Covid in the medium term.</p>  <p>  When the 2020 town and village renewal scheme was launched in May, it had a budget of &euro;15 million, including an indicative allocation of &euro;5 million for the accelerated measure.  The Government's July stimulus package provided an additional &euro;10 million to the scheme, allowing the allocation for the accelerated measure to be doubled.  This extra funding for the measure has allowed my Department to increase the number of funding rounds from two to three, increase the number of applications that can be submitted by local authorities and, as an exceptional measure, provide funding under the accelerated measure for larger towns with populations of more than 10,000 people.  This is in recognition of the importance of larger towns in supporting the economic and social fabric of surrounding rural communities.</p>  <p>  Successful projects under rounds 1 and 2 of the accelerated measure were announced recently, with a total of &euro;6.1 million approved for 226 projects, including those Deputy Cairns mentioned.  Applications under round 3 for large towns are being assessed by my officials.  Further announcements will be made when the process is complete.</p>  <p>  Applications under the standard measure for towns and villages will place a focus on the next stage of recovery.  That process will be announced at a later stage.</p></speech>

The town and village renewal scheme's funding is the type of practical and tangible support that communities need.  At a time when rural areas have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, the scheme is not only helping us to adjust, but is offering a lifeline for main street shops and other family businesses.  The two schemes have cost just over &euro;6.1 million so far this year, which is an investment that will pay back manifold for the communities concerned.</p>  <p>  However, the town and village renewal scheme required communities to almost compete against one another due to the limited funding available to each local authority.  Many areas that put together excellent proposals did not get funding, which is disheartening, especially this year.  To help boost towns and villages, will the Minister provide additional funding to each local authority to invest in the communities that have already applied but were unsuccessful in previous rounds?</p></speech>

I am glad to see that it has gone from strength to strength.  It has seen millions of euro invested in rural towns and villages across the country.  It has a bottom-up approach where communities are able to engage with one another, identify what they want to do in their towns and submit applications for funding.</p>  <p>  We originally had a budget of &euro;15 million for the scheme.  I have since got an extra &euro;10 million, bringing the total package up to &euro;25 million this year.  The &euro;10 million has been allocated to the accelerated measures.  There are good things being done, for example, providing outdoor seating, enhancing community centres to allow remote working and adapting community spaces.  As the Deputy mentioned, outdoor cinemas are becoming popular.  Some towns are organising them.  Others are widening their footpaths to make them safe for social distancing.</p>  <p>  There are 226 projects involved, with approximately &euro;6 million spent to date.  There is still &euro;4 million in the budget.</p></speech>

However, villages have tended to lose out.  These communities, which often live in the shadow of regional towns, could do with a crucial boost this year.  For example, Ballydehob in west Cork put together a fantastic application reimagining the whole village as an inclusive social space where locals and visitors could avail of refreshed spaces, outdoor seating and new facilities for community events.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>That is one example.  Other villages such as Eyeries, Drimoleague and Belgooly would all benefit immeasurably from this type of targeted intervention.</p> <p> The Minister mentioned an additional scheme for towns with populations of more than 10,000 from August.  I ask for a similar scheme at the other end of the scale, from the bottom up, for towns of under 1,000.  Places in my constituency such as Schull, Drinagh and Innishannon could apply.  They desperately need it.  As a fellow rural Deputy, the Minister will understand the difference this will make to those communities.</p></speech>

There is still money left in the pot.  It is targeted at the larger towns but there is nothing to stop the villages applying under the standard town and village scheme which is still open for applications until 30 September.  I will leave it to places that have not been successful to continue to engage with the Department and put in amended or adjusted applications that may qualify for funding.</p></speech>

My question relates to that.  There are three Bs and three Cs: Ballinrobe, Banagher, and Boyle followed by Callan, Cappaquin and Castleblayney.  The Department was to learn from the pilot and roll it out as a matter of urgency to all other towns.  Where does this stand?

The pilot town centre living initiative was launched in October 2018 to explore in a holistic way how to encourage increased residential occupancy in rural towns and villages.  The pilot focused on six towns with different characteristics in different parts of the country.  Funding of up to &euro;100,000 was made available to each of the participating local authorities to support their work.  An independent report on the pilot town centre living initiative was published on 22 June.  The report outlines the approach taken by each town under the pilot and sets out the key issues identified to encourage the increased living in town centres and the repurposing of vacant properties for residential purposes.  The report, which is available on <i>gov.ie</i>, highlights the multiplicity of factors that need to be addressed that cuts across a number of Departments and agencies.  Based on the common issues identified across the six towns in the pilot and the suggested follow up actions presented in the independent report, I do not think it is necessary to extend the pilot initiative.  However, all local authorities can benefit from taking on board the findings of the report, including the importance of consultation with local communities, property owners on town centre development, the value of developing a shared vision or master plan for the town and programmes, such as the rural regeneration and development fund, and the town and village renewal scheme can provide funding for projects which emerge from this process, subject to meeting the required criteria and the quality of the proposal.</p></speech>

The initiative was launched in January 2017 as a pilot.  It took up to October 2018 to roll it out.  The report, which I have read in detail, was published in May and was available to the Department in February.  What did the report cost?  The complexity was already noted when this was launched by the then Minister, Deputy Ring.  He said the reasons more people do not live in town centres are many and complex.  We knew that there were many reasons, we knew about consultation and we knew about working with chambers of commerce and community groups in towns.  This initiative was to learn and to see how we could roll it out.  Incidentally, not a single town in the Gaeltacht was chosen.  The Minister's predecessor noted and acknowledged that it was a gap that needed to be remedied.  Why, when the pilot project was run and the report was commissioned and lessons were learned, has it not been rolled out?  There are towns in Galway that would benefit, but I do not wish to be parochial.  It could be rolled out to any town in any county.</p></speech>

If it was easy it would have been solved years ago.  I want to see more people living in the centre of towns.  It is about more than buying a house and moving in, many more issues need to be considered so that it is attractive for people.  There are significant costs associated with repairing older buildings which are in poor structural condition and often have protected status.  Adapting older buildings to modern building standards and requirements can be difficult.  Return on investment is a factor as the value of the vacant properties after intervention and repair will often be less than the cost of refurbishment and investors get a greater return on investment on new sites on the edges of towns.  Sometimes owners have inherited the property and have limited resources for investing.  There are also inexperienced property owners.  A range of different issues need to be addressed but the report's findings will inform local authorities across the country.  The same issues exist in all the towns.</p></speech>

We have had the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report and many Government initiatives.  Earlier this year, the Department established a steering group to do exactly what the Minister spoke of.  It examined it and concluded the most effective way to do this was to set up a small number of well-planned pilot initiatives that could be delivered and scaled up quickly.  Are we disregarding this report?  Will we just shred it - I used this language about another report recently - or will we follow it up and publish the criteria by which we will choose the next round of towns and get on with the job?  How much did the report cost?  Did each town receive the &euro;100,000?  If so, that represents a significant investment of &euro;600,000 for six towns.  Let us learn from that and, if it was effective, let us roll it out.</p></speech>

There are really good findings that can be applied to other towns across the country.  This is not just about my Department alone but it is cross-Government.  For example, in my own town of Clones, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has done really wonderful work in centre of town regeneration.  It spent close to &euro;5 million in refurbishing derelict buildings.  It has taken some time but it is nearly complete.  It is a fantastic initiative.  My Department is responsible for the rural regeneration development fund.  In rural Limerick, &euro;2.5 million in funding was awarded to the towns of Rathkeale, Abbeyfeale, Askeaton, Ardagh, and Bruff under category 2 of the rural regeneration and development fund to help them to assist in delivering town and village regeneration and contribute to economic development and recovery.  There is a further &euro;3.3 million for other towns and villages.  It is about working with local authorities, local towns and all the different stakeholders and trying to make the towns more attractive.  Some really good plans have come out of the pilot project.  I do not have the cost of the report but I will have it sent to the Deputy.  As she said, it was &euro;100,000 for each town.</p></speech>

The fund was intended to provide a targeted, once-off, cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical front-line services to those most in need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fundraised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions.  The criteria of the scheme stated that any grants awarded would be dependent on the need identified and organisations approved for funding were prioritised on that basis.</p> <p>My Department received 1,060 applications during the application period.  To date, three tranches of successful applications have been announced, allocating funding of over &euro;25 million to 489 organisations.  This funding is now supporting the delivery of many critical front-line services in every part of the country.  A full list of successful applicants is now available on the website.</p> <p> To give Deputies a taste of some projects they might be interested in, the Clondalkin Blue Skies Initiative received &euro;105,000, the Lucan Disability Action Group received &euro;75,000, Inner City Helping Homeless received &euro;98,000, while in other areas of the country, Recovery Haven Kerry received &euro;50,000 and Longford Women's Link received &euro;104,000.  Though the fund is closed to new applications at the moment, additional checks are continuing on a number of applications and a further announcement in respect of successful applicants will be made shortly.</p> <p> At the moment, there are no plans for a second round of the stability scheme.  The scheme is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department and is innovative in its cross-departmental nature, as it is a collaboration with the new Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration and the Department of Health, with input from other relevant Departments.</p></speech>

Talking to people in the Lucan and Clondalkin area who applied, it was my understanding that a limited timeframe was set for the first tranche that was rolled out in June.  The application process was difficult and cumbersome.  Community organisations could not access the relevant details that they were required to submit because they could not access the community buildings because of the restrictions introduced in June.  Community organisations went to great lengths during the pandemic to make their buildings as safe as possible by providing screens, PPE, hand sanitiser and anything that was required.  This comes at great expense and it is not sustainable.  I know the Minister of State mentioned that there are no plans for another round of this scheme.  In the absence of more plans, does the Government have plans to roll out a more applicant-friendly continuous structured fund for our community organisations?</p></speech>

Some people were not around and available to make the applications.  To clarify some of the details, grant levels ranging from &euro;200,000 were approved.  They were based on a variety of factors, including the level of loss experienced by the organisation, the level of non-pay costs and the level of public funding received in 2019.  Funding can be used to defray non-pay costs such as rent, rates, insurance, etc.  Pay-related costs or capital expenditure are not eligible under the fund as many charities in particular were able to avail of the Government's wage subsidy scheme and other funding supports.  The fund came under the dormant accounts scheme, which limited its remit to some extent.  I can talk more about those limitations if the Deputy likes.  Not every organisation was eligible.  They should have been informed and would have had an opportunity to appeal.</p></speech>

They are crying out for financial support that is continuous, structured and applicant-friendly.  Community organisations are at the heart of our communities.  They put the community in our communities.  The reality is that many of our community organisations are historically self-sufficient.  The traditional avenues of funding such as renting rooms, holding meetings or having caf&eacute;s, as mentioned by my colleague, Teachta Paul Donnelly, have completely dried up because of Covid.  This constant changing of restrictions does not allow them to plan for the future.  We are constantly being told that we have to live with Covid but, at present, our community organisations are in danger of having the lifeblood choked out of them.  What our community organisations need are financial supports that are constant, instant and easy to access for the foreseeable future, not this <i>ad hoc</i>, unplanned and piecemeal funding offered by the Government.</p></speech>

I would like to talk about Muirhevna Mor Community Centre.  The fact is that it would have failed the criteria.  It is now appealing.  It technically administers money for other services, so it would seem initially that it has failed the 80:20 rule, but it is obviously afraid that it will not get these moneys and if that is the case, it will face serious difficulties.  The other one which I have been in correspondence with the Minister of State's office about is Dundalk Youth Centre.  It has also appealed but the difficulty is that it would fail on the basis of having 80% State funding but it is a small organisation and, as it would say, it needs the extra 20% to keep the doors open, so I would like to consider a solution to that problem.</p></speech>

To clarify the criteria for eligibility, as the Deputy mentioned, organisations need to receive less than 80% State funding, as the Government had committed to maintaining existing contracts and grants throughout the crisis and offered other additional supports.  Organisations had to project a reduction of 25% or more in their fundraising or traded income for 2020 compared with 2019 figures.  Delivering certain eligible critical services to the most vulnerable in our communities was important too.  In addition to those schemes, the Government's resilience and recovery plan from this week contains a number of important initiatives about promoting community well-being and resilience, and it stresses the importance of communities working together, planning with local authorities, and how local community development committees can and will provide a focal point for individual and community resilience, engaging the amenities, services and community supports available.  We will be working more closely with community development committees to address some of the gaps the Deputies have raised.</p></speech>

LEADER is a multi-annual programme with a budget of &euro;250 million over the period from 2014 to 2020.  Some &euro;225 million of this budget has been allocated to the local actions groups, LAGs, which deliver the programme at a local level.  The balance of &euro;25 million is provided for specific, thematic projects and is allocated at national level once projects have been approved by the LAG.</p>  <p>  The total funding allocated to the local action group in County Clare is in excess of &euro;8.9 million.  This includes &euro;6.6 million for core project activity and &euro;2.3 million in funding for the LAG's administration costs and for animating projects in the county.  To date, the Clare LAG has allocated over 80%, or &euro;5.3 million, of its project budget to 190 applications.  This leaves a balance of &euro;1.3 million available for allocation before the end of 2020.  No additional funding is available for reallocation to the LAGs for core project activity under the current LEADER programme.  However, the national thematic LEADER food initiative may be an appropriate funding source for some of the applications being considered by the LAG.  The food initiative supports the development of food and drink businesses throughout rural Ireland.  It covers the renovation and extension of production facilities and the purchasing of processing equipment, as well as supporting participants in the artisan food and beverage sector in areas such as market development, competitiveness and innovation.  Further details of the food initiative are included in the LEADER operating guidelines which are available to all LAGs.</p></speech>

It has existed for 28 years and has managed LEADER funding in County Clare in an outstanding fashion.  I pay tribute to the CEO, Doirin Graham, and her staff.  As the Minister will be aware, last year, the then Minister, Deputy Ring, awarded the top ten performing local action groups an additional &euro;5 million.  Clare Local Development Company came 11th on that list.  It lost out by 0.2%.  We are living in a Covid world.  There are many shovel-ready projects that could proceed if additional moneys were given to Clare Local Development Company.  I am conscious that we are near the end of the programme but if we used common sense, we could allocate more money and get these projects going.</p></speech>

The Deputy raised the issue of additional funding with me on a number of occasions.  Deputy Carey is right that the former Minister, Deputy Ring, allocated additional funding to the top ten performing LEADER companies countrywide.  That additional money was a positive move to reward the LEADER companies that were delivering the projects most efficiently.  Like everything else, unfortunately, there has to be a cut-off point.  This means that number 11 on the list was Clare and it just missed out.  I would love to be able to tell the Deputy today that we will have extra funding for Clare, but unfortunately I am not in a position to that.  I will, however, keep the situation under review in the event additional funding becomes available.  My advice to Clare is to keep up the good work, get its projects delivered and get its money spent, that is, for those companies doing that.</p></speech>

That approach has allowed the Ennis scout hall to be developed, a project that was in jeopardy.  The Minister's decision enabled Clare local development companies and others to do that and enabled that project to move ahead.  We will have a 21st century building in the heart of Ennis to serve young people from the age of six up to 18.  I thank the Minister for that.  I ask the Minister to use her initiative again.  There is a fund of &euro;25 million in the food initiative.  Is this going to be spent by the end of the year?  I very much doubt it.  The local development companies in Clare and throughout the State could avail of that, especially for shovel-ready projects.</p></speech>

I will certainly check that out.  If any of the projects are involved with food or food processing through the LEADER companies, they should apply for that specific food initiative.  There is money available there for those types of projects.  If other groups in County Clare want to look at other funding sources, there is the town and village scheme, the rural regeneration development fund and a number of possible other funding avenues they may decide to use to support good projects.</p>  <p>  I compliment the LEADER companies across the country because they have done a really good job in helping communities to develop projects and in helping businesses to set up.  When one looks at the list, it is well-spent money.</p></speech>

The provision of safe and regular access by sea is crucial for the maintenance of those island communities.  The development of the pier on Inis O&iacute;rr, which includes the provision of a breakwater, is listed among the strategic objectives set out in Project Ireland 2040.  Additionally, a special allocation of &euro;0.5 million was allocated under the Government's July stimulus package to upgrade harbour facilities at Inis O&iacute;rr.  This additional funding will be reflected in my Department's Vote for 2020.  Initial expenditure items will include engineering and surveying works on the development of a design and build tender.  Department officials have been working closely with Galway County Council to advance the project and are in the process of agreeing the business case for the project as required under the public spending code.  Once this has been completed and the necessary approvals are received at departmental level and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and subject to the financial resources being available through the annual Estimates process, the project will then proceed to tender stage.</p></speech>

We all know that the pier at Inis O&iacute;rr is just not fit for purpose.  It is a danger and a hazard.  It is a critical piece of infrastructure for Inis O&iacute;rr and is essential for public safety as well as being fundamental to the survival and sustainability of the island's economy.  Muintir Inis O&iacute;rr cannot afford any further delays nor do I want to be raising this issue in the time ahead.  I welcome that &euro;0.5 million has been set aside to begin the development of Inis O&iacute;rr pier.  Will the Minister clarify in even greater detail exactly how this money will be spent.

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised this matter on many occasions, he has worked hard on it and is very familiar with it, as are other Deputies.  We are making progress.  As I said, &euro;0.5 million in funding was secured for upgrade works to the harbour facilities as part of the July stimulus.  My officials are working very closely with Galway County Council to advance the project.  I assure Deputy Farrell that I will make the case to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for funding to deliver this project.  In fairness, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has a very difficult job and there are many competing priorities across Government.  I will do everything I can.  I look forward to the support of the Deputies in this Chamber in supporting my efforts to do that.  As I said, it has been awaited for a long time.</p></speech>

If there is a situation of competing priorities, I will detail exactly how important this piece of infrastructure is for the people of Inis O&iacute;rr and I will detail some of the issues that have arisen over the past months.  The hazards relating to the pier are endless and include extremely damaged hand rails, uneven surfaces, broken lights, and trip hazards in the form of broken wires and pipes.  During a recent bad storm and in the midst of our lockdown, a skip was blown over the pier.  That details exactly how difficult it is.  At the start of March there was an incident when the ferry came in and could not allow passengers to disembark at the pier due to the dangers of the sea coming over the wall and with no lights at the pier.  I invite the Minister to come out to visit the pier so she can make up her mind as to whether she feels it is safe and if she would be happy to rely on it if she lived on Inis O&iacute;rr.</p></speech>

In 2015 the then Minister for Finance provided &euro;6 million for the construction of the pier.  That money was later withdrawn because there was no way of spending it.  This has been going on and on.  I believe that the funding cannot be asked for until one has the price.  I understood that the next step in the process was to get the business plan approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will give warning here to the Minister, and I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will indulge me.  I made the case about this pier many years ago and got the classic answer that there was a pier on Inis M&oacute;r.  They are two different islands, so if they come back with that answer do not be fooled.</p> <p>There is a great pier on Inis M&oacute;r but it is no good to anybody on Inis O&iacute;rr.</p> <p> We need to know if that step has been taken because there is no point worrying about the money until the business plan has been approved.  Has the Department submitted the business plan?  I also support the call for the Minister to visit the island but she should not visit it on a calm day.  She should go out there on a rough day when the sea is breaking over the back of the pier and then she will see that it is an absolute threat to life and limb.  It is not a question of money; it simply has to be done.</p></speech>

Departmental officials have been in contact with their colleagues in Galway County Council with a view to ensuring the pier is safe for users.

I assure him that I am from rural Ireland and I understand the situation.  I am also familiar with the Deputy's constituency as I have some relatives living there.  We are doing more than I can tell the Deputy about in the time available to me.  Many of the Department's policies and funding programmes aim to address isolation in rural and urban communities and to deliver benefits to communities by responding to the challenges faced by vulnerable individuals, especially during Covid-19.  Key interventions include funding for the senior alert scheme, which enables older people to live securely with peace of mind in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms maintaining contact, if required, with those who are vulnerable.  As part of the Department's Covid-19 action plan, increased support was provided for older people through the Department's partnership with Alone for a crisis telephone support line and follow-on practical support for those who need it.  The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP, is Ireland's primary social inclusion and funding intervention.  It is delivered locally by local development companies to help those in the greatest need to access supports to enable participation in communities.  I can elaborate further on what it is doing if I have time.</p>  <p>  There are also infrastructural measures that will facilitate better contact with people.  Broadband connection points in remote areas in particular will provide access to high-speed broadband for communities awaiting the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  The 2020 town and village renewal scheme is tailored to include projects which adapt outdoor spaces for hosting social gatherings and events to support economic and social recovery in our rural towns and villages.  The 2020 CL&Aacute;R programme funds school and community safety measures including the provision of safety-related improvements to the environs of schools and community spaces for Covid-19 and other reasons.  This facilitates people in vulnerable positions who are going to school and bringing children to school.  The Government will continue to monitor the adequacy of these supports to address isolation in the coming months.  If I have time, I will elaborate on some other measures.</p></speech>

The supports to which he has referred will help a little, but rural isolation has been a major problem for many years.  There are so many problems in rural Ireland but I do not have time to list them all today.  Poverty and lack of transport in rural areas and the reluctance of some people to cry out for help are serious issues, as is the closure of rural post offices.  On the latter, plenty of excuses have been given but we all know that when people go missing this is noticed at the local post office and alarm bells ring straight away.  In larger urban areas, Martin Browne could be missing for six months and nobody would even care.  These are the types of issues that are worrying people in rural areas.  They are being cut off from their own communities because of the post office closures.  Mental health is going to be a massive issue after this crisis has passed.  Money must be pumped in quickly for the measures to which the Minister of State has referred to address the issues we are raising here today.</p></speech>

I wish to provide additional information on the senior alert scheme that could be useful.  A new befriending phone call initiative will support participants in the senior alert scheme, which is operated in conjunction with Pobal and Alone.  The Department has utilised the senior alert scheme, which provides monitored alarms for older people in their homes, to enable the roll-out of the befriending initiative, which requires users to test their alarms to ensure they are still active.  Monitoring providers or local community groups operating the senior alert scheme service then contact the users.  When users have tested their alarms, they will be called back and asked if they would like to avail of the befriending call service through Alone.  The number for Alone is given to the participants or their consent is sought for Alone to be provided with their contact details to be included in the befriending service.  The aim of this initiative is to provide peace of mind and local assistance to older people who use the scheme.  I urge Deputies to pass on the information that the senior alert scheme has an additional function whereby people who use it can be contacted and put in touch with a service that can help them in a more elaborate way.</p></speech>

Another issue that arises in this regard is rural crime, particularly for people in more isolated areas.  What will the Government do to help rural communities in that context, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I am also concerned about those caring for people in isolated rural areas.  They will need additional support to look after people with special and complex needs.  This caring work will be done when people are more confined than ever before.  Is there any plan in place to tackle rural crime and to provide assistance to carers in isolated rural areas?</p></speech>

This initiative sought to link local and national Government with the community and voluntary sectors.  Its purpose was to co-ordinate community activity, direct community assistance and organise and deploy volunteers.  It is hoped that people will not feel so alone as volunteers call to their homes more often because of the Community Call initiative.  Each local authority set up a helpline and supporting database management system and created new Community Call forums, which co-ordinated the work of the local voluntary and community organisations delivering services to cocooners in particular.  The immediate focus was on the elderly and most vulnerable, and on mobilising a rapid response in every county to make sure everyone was looked after.  The focus then expanded to the well-being of our society and how communities could work together to help the country through the Covid-19 crisis.  This will continue over the coming months.  Since March, the 31 Community Call forums have answered approximately 54,000 calls, made approximately 21,000 follow-up calls to citizens and held over 460 meetings.  Calls to dedicated helplines have related to the delivery of essential items, health services and social isolation.</p></speech>

That section will ensure such signage is in keeping with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport traffic signals manual.  This manual provides details on the traffic signs which may be used on roads in Ireland, including their layout and symbols, the circumstances in which each sign may be used and the rules for positioning them.  Responsibility for the manual rests within the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  Separately, and this is closer to our Department, Sport Ireland has developed a criteria document for walking trails in Ireland which, among other things, gives guidance on the standard of waymarking signage along walking trails.  My Department administers the walks scheme, which facilitates the development and maintenance of many of Ireland's key walking trails, by contracting landowners to undertake maintenance work on those trails in line with agreed work plans. </p>  <p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to expand the walks scheme to achieve a target of 80 trails, compared with 39 at the beginning of 2019.  This is in recognition of the value of outdoor recreation amenities to support individual and community well-being.  Amenities such as walking trails and other outdoor recreation infrastructure have seen a huge increase in usage during Covid-19 and are highly valued by communities in both rural and urban areas.</p>  <p>  To go back to the nub of the question, it is ultimately a question for the local authority.  In terms of the guidance they are being given and are provided with in regard to the issue raised, it is a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There is not a huge amount I can say on that.  I have plenty of information here on the walks scheme, if the Deputy wants to hear more about that.</p></speech>

The tenor of the question was wider than that remit.  What I was driving at was more about re-imagining rural Ireland and trying to look at more homogenous signage that would describe the character and the charm of our rural places.  In terms of community development, particularly in terms of the town renewal schemes and so on, where the Department is giving out money, it would be great if the Department was advocating that more traditional signage would be used.  We could drive through parts of England and parts of rural Ireland at the moment and we would not see much difference, which is a shame.  We are losing part of our tourism charm and potential but I think we can arrest that with clever initiatives.  That is really where I was going.  I am thinking in terms of my own constituency, in particular areas such as the Blackwater Valley and the Waterford greenway, and we have a new Celtic corridor being imagined there.  I would like to see the signage and waypoints standardised so that when people are in the area, they can see that as being reflective of the journey, the charm and the culture of where they are.</p></speech>

I will pass this back to the other Department but only because that is where it is best put.  There is a point to be made in regard to eyesores, over-signage, unnecessary signage and old signage that does not really tell us anything anymore.  There is also the issue that if people are driving through rural Ireland, they will pass so many places that are of value and interest, and we just do not know it.  I will contact my colleague who looks after the heritage side and I would encourage the Deputy to contact the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>

The idea was to provide an air service based at Na Minne in Indreabh&aacute;n, from where the Aran Islands service already departs, to Cleggan and then on to Inishbofin.  This was built in the noughties but was never opened or commissioned subsequently.  Will the Minister examine the possibility of providing badly-needed air services to Inishbofin?</p></reply>

In April 2017, a public consultation process was undertaken, seeking submissions from interested parties in regard to the future use of airstrips and surrounding sites in the ownership of the State on Inishbofin Island and at Cleggan in County Galway.  The majority of the submissions received suggested that the sites should remain in State ownership.  There are no plans to provide an air service to Inishbofin at this time.</p>  <p>  With regard to the site at Cleggan, I understand discussions have been taking place with the Irish Coast Guard, with a view to utilising part of the site for the provision of a Coast Guard station.  In the case of the sites on Inishbofin, officials have had discussions with the HSE, with a view to the use of part of the site to locate a healthcare centre for the island.  This is a facility for which the island development company has been campaigning for some time.  It is also important to point out that any development which might be undertaken at these sites will not prejudice the potential future use of the airstrips for the provision of air services to Inishbofin.</p></speech>

If the air service was operating, a person could do it in approximately an hour, which is a saving of 2.5 hours each way.  If a person tried to do it in a day, one way would take seven hours and the other two hours, which is a saving of five hours.</p>  <p>  Everybody agrees that the services to the three Aran islands are lifeline services and are absolutely important.  The State does not have public consultations about this; it decides that this is a lifeline service, like a bus service or a train service.  However, uniquely in the case of Inishbofin, perhaps because it is a non-Gaeltacht island, although I do not know why, everybody thinks that for a few hundred thousand euro a year, it is not worth providing what would be an even more beneficial service to the people there because they are so far from Galway. </p>  <p>  I have one question for the Minister.  Will she come out to Inishbofin?  I would be happy to go out with her.  Will she note how long it takes her to get there?  However, do not take the State car, just take the bus. </p></speech>

Last year, I had the pleasure of attending a wedding on Clare Island and I got an opportunity to see first-hand the difficulties people face.  When I was on staycation in Donegal this year, I took the opportunity to go to Arranmore.  I took a tour of the island and I saw first-hand the difficulties they face there.  I have a certain understanding of what it is like to live in rural Ireland but to live on an island certainly presents many more challenges.  I was chatting to the people on Arranmore and I thought that if I had a teenager who wanted to go to the cinema, they would have to get a boat and go to the mainland, and then drive over an hour to get to Letterkenny.  The example the Deputy gives about Inishbofin is similar.  I am obviously reading into this brief on the islands again.</p></speech>

There are the two airstrips, which are the big cost.  There are the aeroplanes based in Na Minne.  They are already there and are not fully utilised, so it is a marginal cost to use the pilots and the planes, which are not flying all day because of the constraints on the Aran service, to provide a number of services to Inishbofin.  There is no major cost to this.  Nobody has costed it in recent times but I had it costed as Minister, and it would not be significant, because most of the overhead costs are already incurred, particularly the base.</p>  <p>  The Minister should forget about the public consultation and the standard answer she has given me.  Will she sit down and examine how much it would cost to put in this service, given the small residual capital cost of some buildings and fire engines, and then the cost of running it on an annual basis as a lifeline service to the people of Inishbofin?</p></speech>

We deliver this funding and supports to local communities and groups through implementing policies designed to enhance economic and social opportunities for individuals which improve the quality of life in all our communities.</p><p>Overall responsibility for adult education rests with my colleague, the Minister for further and higher education, research, innovation and science, and information on heritage matters may be best sought from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  However, my Department has been proactive in ensuring that individuals and community groups can access accessible information and advice on all supports available to them.  In addition to the information and videos on supports which are currently available on <i>gov.ie</i>, in 2019, my Department hosted a series of nationwide events in rural locations to highlight to communities the opportunities available to them in terms of funding and supports from Government and State agencies.  This was complemented by my Department's &quot;Helping Hands&quot; country-wide workshops for organisations and community groups which provided hands-on guidance on how to make and submit applications to access funding supports from my Department.</p><p>In the present Covid-19 environment, continuing to share information with communities on the supports available to assist them is more important than ever.  In this regard, my Department will continue to host online engagements with stakeholders on the short-term and longer-term impacts of Covid-19 on rural areas and any consequential actions which need to be taken to assist the economic and social recovery of these areas.  These engagements will input into the development of a new rural policy for Ireland for 2020-25, to be published shortly.</p><p>With respect to job seeking, training opportunities and facilitating adult learning, my Department also directly provides a range of supports.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, stands out as one of the key ones.  Some 23,261 people completed a lifelong learning course under SICAP in the period 2018-19.  My Department funds local development companies to work with disadvantaged individuals and groups through SICAP, offering a range of integrated supports. </p></speech>

We are not looking for funding for that but realistically, I am talking about community centres being able to provide onward learning initiatives, particularly to the rural adult population who find it difficult to access services in the urban centres.  They may not want to go on extensive courses but they need short-term opportunities wherever they might arise.  Anything the Department can do to facilitate and promote that would be most welcome.</p></speech>

It provides: lifelong learning and training; CV and interview preparation; personal development courses; self-employment training; business planning and budgeting supports; and helps people get onto a work placement programme such as community employment or the T&uacute;s programme.  Public libraries are also under our remit.  They provide access to extensive online services and have been hosting extensive online workshops and seminars which the public can view via their local library&rsquo;s social media sites.</p>  <p>  Men's sheds and women's sheds are key hubs in many communities that share information and experiences.  My Department has supported these groups through various funding programmes.</p>  <p>  My Department and the agencies under my remit have been proactive in communicating with stakeholders and community groups to provide information on the many programmes and supports being delivered, such as LEADER, for example.  Its programmes include opportunities for sustainable development under its rural environment theme.  Information on this and other programmes is available from the local action groups which deliver LEADER in the community.</p></speech>

They are excellent projects which bring people out of their comfort zones who would never have thought of doing something in their communities.  They are brilliant.</p>  <p>  I will give a little more information on libraries because while they are used well, more people could use them.  In response to the crisis, systems were put in place to allow people to join libraries online without having to physically visit one.  This resulted in an upsurge in membership, with over 30,000 new members joining the library in March 2020, compared with 17,000 the year before.  The Department subsequently provided &euro;400,000 in funding to purchase an additional 10,000 ebooks and audio books to meet the rising demand for online services.  Members now have access to an online catalogue containing 35,000 ebooks as well as a range of other resources.  Libraries also moved other resources online, including book clubs and workshops for an array of areas including first aid, parenting, coding, and autism awareness.  They also held story times via Facebook Live and Twitter and ran writing and drawing competitions.  Libraries Ireland and various library authorities are using social media to encourage people to use the online services.</p></speech>

This year's town and village renewal scheme has been tailored to assist our rural towns and villages to respond to the challenges presented by Covid-19.  The scheme includes an accelerated measure which focuses on supporting initiatives that can immediately help towns and villages to adapt to social distancing requirements and provide safe environments for people to shop and socialise.  With support from the Government's July stimulus package, funding of &euro;10 million has been provided for this measure in 2020, which will be allocated under three funding rounds.  I have already announced the successful projects under rounds 1 and 2 of the accelerated measure, with a total of &euro;6.1 million being approved for 226 projects across the country.  This includes funding of &euro;227,163 for nine projects in County Clare.  Funding applications under round 3 of the accelerated measure are currently being assessed by my officials and further funding announcements will be made when that process is complete.  Details of all projects approved under rounds 1 and 2 can be found on my Department's pages on <i>gov.ie</i>.</p></speech>

Her Department has managed to deliver two rounds already and I look forward to the third one.  The town and village renewal scheme is excellent.  It is a ground-up approach.  I work with community organisations throughout County Clare and this has given them a welcome lift in these times.  God knows we need it.  I compliment the Minister on that.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister have plans beyond the next round to introduce a similar scheme for next year?  What are her ideas on that?  Has she looked for feedback from the local authorities?  We have a very progressive local authority.  There is a rural directorate in Clare County Council where Leonard Cleary is the director of services.  The Minister should reach out to the local authorities throughout the country to get feedback from them with a view to developing a new scheme into the future.</p></speech>

It has worked extremely well, due to its co-ordinated bottom-up approach whereby local people work with local authorities and different groups to identify the projects and put in applications to get funding to make them a reality.  The Deputy was very supportive of this scheme when he was chairing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development.  He is also a big advocate for remote working.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I was delighted that Cross in Clare got &euro;40,000 to repurpose an old school to create a remote working hub and community social space.  This is the kind of project that makes a difference.</p> <p> Regarding the town and village renewal scheme, I will engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the budgetary ask but I assure the Deputy that it will remain a priority scheme for me and it will remain next year because it has proved to be very successful.</p></speech>

It is fantastic.  Ballynacally community development group has developed a community caf&eacute; and it got funding in the latest round to provide two self-catering cottages.  Bunratty also received funding, as did Killadysart for the fit-out of a toilet and shower facility in the harbour.

It is about working with local authorities and local communities in getting these projects developed and supporting them in doing that, which is what we want to do.

The provision of telecommunications services is primarily a matter for commercial providers operating in a liberalised market.  Nonetheless, under the national broadband plan, the Government will fund the provision of a high-speed broadband network in areas where it is not commercially viable for service providers to do so.  The national broadband plan network, which in under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, will be rolled out to almost 540,000 premises across the country.  In parallel, my Department has been working closely with local authorities to identify broadband connection points, BCPs, which will make free, on-site connectivity available to communities in remote areas, including in County Wexford.  The BCPs will be situated in publicly accessible buildings such as sports clubs and community centres and will be amongst the first premises to be connected under the national broadband plan.  Over the coming months, approximately 300 BCPs will be provided, with a high-speed connection.  The locations of the BCPs are available on the website of National Broadband Ireland at <i>www.nbi.ie</i>.  Many of the BCPs will facilitate remote working and I firmly believe that remote working and collective working have the potential to transform rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The situation in Dublin is profound and, no doubt, we will have the opportunity to discuss this further throughout the course of the day.  Underpinning our response to dealing with the virus must be a proper testing and tracing system.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have been raising this issue consistently because it is central to how we handle the situation.</p><p>Another issue we have been raising is meat plants and I raise it again today.  Meat plants have been the site of at least 44 clusters throughout the State and at least 1,600 cases of Covid-19.  They were the principal reason for the localised lockdowns in Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  From a freedom of information response to Hannah Quinn-Mulligan of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, we know there were 226 cases associated with one plant in July.  We understand that plant is in Cork and that it was never closed down.  Yet last week, testing in meat plants was suspended.  Yesterday, we learned of another outbreak in a meat plant in Waterford and this is causing huge concern.  At least 28 cases are associated with this cluster, more tests are pending and hopefully the HSE's infection control team are on the ground.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will let me know if that is the case.  Local media in Waterford reported that earlier this week, workers from the plant were being bused to work on a packed 50-seater bus.  Every seat was full, it was standing room only and people were standing in the aisles.  At that time, there were already cases confirmed in that plant.  That is shocking.  The meat barons are playing with people's lives in the interests of profit, plain and simple, and they are getting away with it.  Why?  What hold do the meat barons have over Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il?</p><p>This should be contrasted with how they are treating pubs.  There were 6,800 inspections of pubs over one weekend, yet there have only ever been five clusters associated with pubs, according to the figures released last night.  Outbreaks in meat plants have accounted for one third of all workplace clusters.  The situation in Waterford has been going on for a number of weeks but it was only confirmed that this was happening yesterday.  That is not good enough.  This situation is replicated throughout the State.  Before he assumed office, the current Taoiseach called for greater transparency regarding where clusters were happening.  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that the HSE should now publish the details of clusters in businesses in public settings?  Having to rely on the rumour mill is not good enough.  Communities deserve clarity and transparency.  They deserve better.</p><p>Why are the meat plants getting away with this?  Why are workers being crammed into buses?  Why was a plant with 226 associated cases not shut down?  How many meat plants have had serial testing carried out this week?  Will the T&aacute;naiste publish the information of where clusters are in relation to public settings?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700012#K00900"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Meat plants, as we all know, are at high risk of becoming clusters.  There are many reasons for that but we know that is the case in Ireland and around the world.  We have known that for a long time and that is precisely why there are specific protocols in place in relation to meat plants.  That is why there is a joint committee on it and why surveillance testing happens in meat plants.  Even though the positivity rate is very low, it is still down as a precaution, as it is in nursing homes and some other places.  While it was suspended last week when there was a huge increase in demand for testing, it resumed last Monday.</p>  <p>  The decision to close any meat plant or any business is made by public health officials or by the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, as appropriate.  If a plant needs to close, it should close and there is no message, directive, policy or anything from Government saying to our public officials or to the HSA that plants should not be closed if they need to be.  I want to make that clear.  If public health doctors and officials dealing with the cluster believe a place has an outbreak and should be closed, the Government supports any decision to close a business, meat plant, school or anything else if that is the right thing to do in public health terms.</p> <p>I hope that is abundantly clear.  Regarding details on clusters, the public health authorities, NPHET and the HSE, should be as transparent as possible in putting out details of where clusters are located.  It is also important, however, that we are careful about what we mean by that. A cluster can be two cases or it can be two cases connected, and most clusters are in fact households.  We must also bear in mind that a cluster stays open until 28 days after there has been no case.  When issuing public information about clusters, therefore, we need to do so in a way that does not end up stigmatising people or with a situation where individuals or individual households can be identified.  It has always been the case in Ireland, and this is a good thing, that our healthcare information is private, and that if people have particular illnesses, infections or a particular type of cancer, for example, only those people concerned should be telling other people about the situation.  It should not be put on a Government website, so we need to be careful when it comes to such information and how it is disclosed.<br/><br/>This week we passed an important milestone, with 1 million tests for Covid-19 having been carried out in this country.  I express my thanks to all our health service and laboratory staff for making that possible.  Contrary to what we might hear elsewhere, the amount of testing that we are doing is reasonably high on a <i>per capita</i>basis.  It is higher than in countries such as Germany and New Zealand, which are often held up as examples to follow, and higher than in Sweden, which is also put forward by others from a different perspective as an example to follow.  This amount of testing being carried out should be recognised for what it is, and I again express my thanks to our health service and laboratory staff for making this possible.</p></speech>

Last week, we carried out 72,000 tests.  Yet, testing in meat plants was being suspended.  Our concern is that what we do has to be based on evidence.  The evidence tells us that nearly four out of ten workplace clusters are occurring in meat plants.  It is having devastating consequences on local economies and communities, and the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly can tell us exactly what the impacts can be.</p>  <p>  We are told that the Government is alert to this issue and, as the T&aacute;naiste mentioned, all the proper surveillance is being carried out.  However, we have a situation where a meat plant with a positive case is bussing workers in a 52-seater bus, with every seat filled and people standing in the aisles.  How is that happening?  How is that being allowed to happen?  How is it that the area where the most serious clusters were developing in workplaces was the area where testing was suspended?  What steps will the Government take to ensure that these workers are protected and that there is a robust process in meat plants?  Time and again, I and the people believe that the meat barons have some grip on Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il regarding their response on this issue.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty can spin out as many conspiracy theories as he likes. The message is very clear: if public health officials or the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, recommend or order a business to close, then it should close.  The Deputy can create any kind of paranoid conspiracy theory that he likes, but I guarantee that there is no message, nudge, direction or policy from Government to say to any public health official that he or she should treat meat factories with kid gloves.  That is just a paranoid fantasy from the Deputy's party.</p></speech>

I want to focus my questions today on the situation in the three counties of Laois, Offaly and Kildare, which had been disproportionately affected as a result of the virus.  Most reasonable people would accept that the outbreaks in those three counties were caused by some failings by State agencies in the monitoring of meat plants and direct provision centres.  Most reasonable people would also accept, however, that the suppression and containment strategy used to keep a lid on this virus in those three counties was also very successful, despite all its imperfections.</p>  <p>  I accept that a bespoke financial package was provided to those three counties and it did assist for the duration of the lockdown.  While the acute phase of the public health emergency has now passed in the three counties, unfortunately, however, the financial fallout remains.  Does the Government have plans to provide additional financial supports to those three counties in light of what they have been through?  If there are no plans, is that something that the Government might consider between now and the budget?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700013#L01300"><p>As the House will know, the counties of Laois, Offaly and Kildare were the first in Ireland to experience local restrictions.  We all realised and appreciated at the time that they would not be the last.  We all expect that other counties will have local restrictions imposed on them in the coming months, for various reasons, and it is important that those counties receive the same additional supports as were provided to Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  We also need to consider additional initiatives.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will probably respond by stating that if in future other counties get things that Laois, Offaly and Kildare did not, then that should be applied retrospectively to those three counties as well.  I believe that is a fair argument.  As we all know, the situation with the virus is worrying in Ireland and particularly in Dublin, with the incidence rate increasing significantly in recent days.  That is reflected in a relatively small but real increase in hospitalisations and ICU admissions.  Regarding Dublin, however, it is important to compare it with other cities around Europe.  Brussels has an incidence rate double that of Dublin, Amsterdam has a positivity rate much higher than Dublin's, and it is also much higher in Madrid, Prague, Paris and many other places.  If we choose to act regarding the situation in Dublin in the coming days, far from being slow to act, as some would argue, we will be one of the first movers in Europe in taking action early, ahead of cities and city regions in Europe that have not yet imposed the kind of restrictions that we may need to impose in Dublin.  We will be first movers and quick actors, rather than what others would suggest.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I was in Kildare recently and took the opportunity to meet with the local enterprise office, LEO, and visit some of the businesses that were most affected.  In terms of what has been provided in supports to Kildare, there is the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which is linked to turnover in a firm.  By definition, therefore, those counties with local restrictions will see more companies qualify because their turnover will be more affected.  In addition, we increased the restart grant plus by 40% for Kildare.  Some &euro;10 million has been paid out to date for the original restart grant, and there are 1,566 applications for the restart grant plus, so that will be &euro;11.4 million in all.</p>  <p>  There have also been training and mentoring programmes for business, 724 applications for the business continuity voucher and 373 applications for the trading online voucher.  The microfinance loan programme in Kildare has had an especially good take-up, with nearly &euro;1 million drawn down from that fund already.  As also I announced in Kildare the other day, we have set up a new scheme for those businesses that, for one reason or another, do not qualify for the restart grant or for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's enterprise support grant.  That will be starting in Kildare in recognition of the additional burden on businesses in that county.</p></speech>

My final question has specifically to do with Kildare.  It is unique among counties in that it is the only county to have experienced three lockdowns, two of them back-to-back.  I accept that a financial package was provided and commend the Minister with responsibility for media, tourism, arts, culture, sport and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Catherine Martin, for providing an extra &euro;500,000 for marketing the county as a staycation of choice.</p>  <p>  That &euro;500,000 is lodged in a Bord F&aacute;ilte bank account in Dublin.  That is all well and good and Bord F&aacute;ilte does an excellent job at promoting Ireland nationally, but that money needs to go to the local tourism agency in Kildare.  Those are the people who know the county and people best and can make the best efficient use of that money.  Into Kildare is probably the best, most suitable front-line agency to which that money should be provided.  I would be grateful to hear the T&aacute;naiste's views as to whether it is possible for that money to be put directly into Kildare so that local agencies can be put in the driving seat.</p></speech>

As he mentioned, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, provided an extra &euro;500,000 to promote Kildare and encourage people to take a break there and visit the county because, as we all know, it is very much open for business.  The money is being routed through F&aacute;ilte Ireland because it is a State agency and, for obvious reasons of corporate governance and accounting practices, Government money tends to be routed through public bodies.  I met some people in Kildare who felt that money was being spent on advertising and the real beneficiaries were perhaps the advertising companies and media organisations, rather than Kildare businesses.  Those people told me that the money could have been better used on co-operative marketing with hotels and attractions in the county.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, met Into Kildare along with Kildare Oireachtas Members in late August.  The plan is to ensure that Into Kildare is consulted on the design of the creative messages and how the money will be spent so that is guided by local knowledge.</p></speech>

I have come into the House today because a view is being expressed outside this Chamber that needs to be said publicly.  The public sees the Government running at less than 50%.  At the start of this pandemic, I praised the T&aacute;naiste and the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for all the work they were doing.  I will compliment anyone who works hard for this country and I praised the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for that.</p>  <p>  After the election, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party came together to lead this country, at a time when Sinn F&eacute;in ran for the hills.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald was sick with Covid-19 but the rest of the party disappeared and there were rewards out for them.</p>  <p>  All we are seeing on television at the moment is negativity.  Fine Gael went into government with Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party to lead this country.  That Government got the bus just off the top of the hill and stopped it on an incline.  The Government formed and went to the top of the hill but it is now going down that hill at 100 mph and is coming to a 90-degree bend.  The job of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party is to talk with one voice and not to take the Government apart by having potshots at each other on the television to be popular.</p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group canvassed for the rural pubs to open because they are the only places in which people can meet and connect.  The T&aacute;naiste's party did not even know when he said that he thought that the pubs should open, and that was tweeted.  The T&aacute;naiste should stop being populist and do the job that he signed up to do.  Fine Gael must work with Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party to lead this country.  Sinn F&eacute;in will highlight all the negative things because that is what it does.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not the only party in opposition.</p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group sought to form a government with Fine Gael.  Fine Gael did not want that and I respect that.  I respect Fine Gael when it does good.  This country needs leadership.  It does not need populism or a Government whose members take each other apart on television.  We need the Government to lead and give people hope that we can straighten things out.</p>  <p>  What we hear from Sinn F&eacute;in is only spin.  We know that.  I am from an Opposition party and I am saying it myself.  It is spin.  Sinn F&eacute;in has the money to do it.  It is destroying the name of Ireland with all the spin it is coming up with.  I am asking Fine Gael and the other Government parties to come together and lead this country with one voice.</p></speech>

The Government is working as one and has been since it formed.  I appreciate that there are people who are opposed to this Government and do not want it to last.  That does not include the Deputy, but it does include others.  Those people will do their best to stoke up, invent and exaggerate any differences that may occur between different politicians and parties.  I remember well, during the height of the Brexit struggle, that people would go out of their way to ask me a question, ask Deputy Coveney a slightly different question, and, when we gave slightly different answers, suggest that he and I were at war over Brexit.  That was always rubbish.  I see a certain element of that narrative now being promoted by our opponents and other people.</p>  <p>  I have no idea what the Deputy means when he says that members of the Government parties have been taking each other apart on television.  I have not witnessed that and I would be interested to hear the Deputy give an example.</p>  <p>  The rural pubs are going to be allowed to open on Monday, which is a welcome development.  It is something for which the Deputy campaigned and fought.  We are putting a lot of trust in our publicans to make sure that they conduct the reopening safely and ensure that people are socially distanced.  I have confidence in them to do that and believe that they will be able to lead the way and show what can be done.  That will, hopefully, allow pubs in Dublin to follow suit in a couple of weeks' time.</p>  <p>  What I said at my Parliamentary Party meeting, which I am sorry was not webcast, was that I believed that rural pubs should be allowed to open and that the Government was working on a plan to do exactly that.  The Taoiseach felt the same.  I have never suggested that there was a difference between us on that matter because there was not.  Others made that suggestion, what is their agenda?</p></speech>

The public sees the T&aacute;naiste as trying to make the bus skid and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, asleep in the back.  That is what the public is looking at.</p>  <p>  I spoke already about spin and the rewards that were put out for Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies.  Sinn F&eacute;in is only here to dissolve this Government.  People are suffering and we need one voice to help the people in this country.  Sinn F&eacute;in can spin all it likes but all it is doing is damaging this country and stopping it from getting back to where it needs to be to help the people.  They go out with their food parcels and take pictures; that is what they do and they have the money to put that out in the media and spin.  Deputy McDonald was in RT&Eacute; the other day when this House came to a stop.  She was in RT&Eacute; before the House stopped sitting in order to be on the television.  Sinn F&eacute;in is negative but we want to be positive.  We want to work, go forward and represent the people of this country.  We want to slow this bus down so that we can get around the bend and keep everyone safe.  The Government is on the bus and leading the country.</p></speech>

What the Deputy will hear, and is hearing, from the Government is one message that we have agreed collectively.  He will hear lots of different voices explaining that message and that is what has been seen over the past couple of days.  On Tuesday, we agreed and published a Government plan to deal with Covid for the next six to nine months.  The Deputy would have seen Ministers and Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael out there explaining and defending that plan.  That is exactly what we have done.</p>  <p>  The Opposition did something different.  It decided to try to pick holes in and undermine the plan, thereby undermining the public health message more generally.  The parties in government showed absolute unity, went out there and defended the plan.  We said that the plan is ours and we did not disown it in any way.  The Deputy will see more of that in the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

Those contractors have payments of approximately &euro;150,000 per year and were guaranteed five years' continual work if they bought new machinery.</p>  <p>The T&aacute;naiste is probably also aware that in recent days, pallet manufacturers have said they are running out of timber.  To give an example of what is going on, I know of a business in County Roscommon which has made 30 forestry applications.  It has been waiting 823 days, 681 days and 713 days for replies to applications but has not got one.  The average time it has been waiting for a response for each of these 30 applications is 368 days.  </p> <p> I was in Sligo when Project Ireland 2040 was announced.  At that time, it was announced that 440 million trees would be planted.  The Government said that it would plant 37,410 ha between 2016 and 2020.  A little more than half of that has been planted.  We have reached 50% of the target for forest roads.  Between 2019 and 2020, felling has fallen by 80% while planting has fallen 50%.  </p> <p> The forestry appeals office received 238 appeals last year but, to date, just 136 have been dealt with.  It has received 394 appeals in 2020 but, to date, just two have been sorted.  An appeals office has been set up to decide whether a case will go for appeal but the people in this office get &euro;380 for an oral hearing, &euro;240 for a desktop review and &euro;240 if those making the appeal do not turn up.  Why then would they throw out an appeal?  I know of an application to spread fertiliser made in County Mayo three years ago.  Those in the Department have still not answered.  The system as it stands is flawed.  When one sends in a forestry application, it is a forest service inspector who gets it.  These people have no ecological degrees so instead of screening out applications, they are all allowed in.  The application must then go through appropriate assessment, an environmental impact assessment and all of the other palaver required under the habitats directive if the area in question is within 15 km of a designated area.</p> <p> There in an emergency in this regard.  Some 12,000 jobs are at risk and contractors who make 150,000 payments a year are about to go bust.  I see Deputy Cahill is here.  Is the Government willing to give priority to establishing the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine so that an emergency meeting can be held?  Is it willing to put a group together with an independent chairperson who knows about or deals in environmental planning?  Is it willing to let the parties on each side meet?  The T&aacute;naiste will speak about new legislation being introduced.  Such legislation will solve nothing in the next three or four months.  Will the Government take the steps I have outlined to help the situation, which is dire?</p></speech>

The Government is committed to the last Government's plan to increase dramatically the amount of forestry in our country.  This will be beneficial for both climate action and rural and regional development.  I have taken note of the Deputy's suggestions and I will let the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, know about them.  I am sure she will respond to the Deputy directly.</p>  <p>  As we all know, there is a backlog of forest licence applications awaiting assessment.  This arose following a surge in appeals connected to Article 6(3) of the habitats directive of 1992.  This led to the establishment of the Natura 2000 network of designated sites.  Article 6(3) requires that where a plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura site, whether individually or in combination with other plans or projects, it must undergo an appropriate assessment.  As a result of these appeals and the subsequent application of the Natura report, a complex restructuring of the appropriate assessment procedure has been introduced by the Department.  These procedures are now in place and a project plan is being established to deal with the backlog.</p>  <p>  Resources to service this new approach have been, and are being, put in place.  New forestry inspectors and additional administration staff have been assigned to licensing.  More forestry inspectors will be recruited this year.  Two new ecologists have joined the Department's ecology team and four more are to be appointed shortly.  The Department has also engaged external ecological experience to help with the backlog of files and four local ecologists have been contracted to provide extra support.  A further ecology contract, with five new ecologists, has also been signed.  Additional administration staff have been assigned to the appeals office to assist with the increased workload of the appeals committee.  Three planning officers have been contracted to work with the forestry appeals committee and a specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry issues.</p>  <p>  The introduction of this new process has led to delays in issuing licences and has had a major impact on the sector, which we acknowledge.  Notwithstanding the delays in the latter months of 2019, it is important to put on the record of the House that 2019 was, in fact, a record year for the issue of felling licences.  Some 4,100 felling licences were issued in 2019, which was a 16% increase on the previous year.  This year, 783 licences have issued.  With regard to licences processed for afforestation, 276 licences have been issued for more than 2,000 ha and 184 road works licences for 65.2 km of forest roads were issued up to 19 June of this year.  Furthermore, from January 2018 to the end of May 2020, 3,650 ha of fully licensed afforestation was not progressed to planting stage.</p></speech>

I have figures from the Department.  When one gets a licence, it is for four years so if a person planted 20 acres in 2018, it may be recorded as 80 as he or she has the licence for four years.  We will move on from that point.</p>  <p>  At the moment, timber is being imported from Germany.  There is a beetle in Germany and we must be careful not to go down the road we went down in respect of ash dieback.  Companies are looking to other places.  This started four years ago.  We all know about the habitats directive.  The problem is that if one keeps sending applications to the same person in the Department, and if that person does not have the qualifications to decide on them, one will keep getting the same answer.  Who is going to call stop?  Who is going to decide that instead of being sent to forestry officers, applications will now be sent to a person who can screen some out while allowing others in?  I know more about Articles 6(2), 6(3) and 6(4) of the habitats directive than most because of their connection to the bogs.  If cases are not screened out - and most can be screened out - there will be a logjam of problems.  Will the T&aacute;naiste stand over a Department which has sat on its backside looking at this for four years and which is now putting 12,000 jobs in jeopardy?</p></speech>

As I understand it, the Department needs two things: new legislation and additional staff to deal with appeals and applications.  The legislation is being developed and we expect to have it within this session.  This work is being led by the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  With regard to the additional staff resources the Department needs, as I mentioned earlier, 14 new ecologists have joined it as either permanent or contract staff.  It also has employed four extra forestry inspectors on a temporary basis in addition to nine permanent forestry inspectors and a new project manager.  Based on what I have been told, I hope we will see improvements and change in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Perhaps he will be more considered in his response today given that since that time, the Central Bank's investigation, which was prompted by my dossier, found that what I said was true and that dual pricing is being used by the majority of insurance companies.  This is a practice that rips off consumers.  The Central Bank is so concerned at what it has seen that it has called for immediate action.  The courts have found that business interruption cover, which is an issue I have raised with the T&aacute;naiste time and time again, should support the consumer against the insurance industry.</p> <p>As late as today, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has, in its preliminary findings, found against the insurance industry for what I would describe as cartel-like activity.  The commission says there are reasonable grounds now to believe that the industry or a number of companies have broken the law for price signalling.  With that in mind I ask the question.  The T&aacute;naiste has talked about conspiracy theories.  The Minister for Finance put on the record of the D&aacute;il that he has delayed significant parts of the implementation of my legislation for a further year because the insurance industry sat down with him and said they wanted it delayed.  Given everything that I have said, given that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has found against the industry, given that the Central Bank is so alarmed that it has called for immediate action and given that the FCA is finding in favour of consumers, will the Government for once stand up for the ordinary people against the industry and implement in full the legislation that was endorsed by Fine Gael and every party in the House?  My legislation balances the scales in favour of consumers against an industry.</p></speech>

It is a Government agency under my Department that carried out the investigation and released a statement only in the past hour.  Rather than criticising us, Deputy Doherty should at least welcome the fact that an agency under my Department took this action.  The way Deputy Doherty is speaking one would swear it was some sort of NGO or something.</p>  <p>  I am told that at least 22 of the 27 sections of Deputy Doherty's Consumer Insurance Contracts Act are now in operation.  That will result in positive changes for consumers.  Certain sections of the Act will have a transformational impact on insurers' systems and operations.  A further year is provided so that insurers can prepare to implement these sections, taking account of the impact that it will have on systems.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, believes it is a balanced measure and an appropriate way forward for industry and consumers.</p>  <p>  I would say to those in the insurance sector that the findings of the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission should be a wake-up call for them.  They should get on with making these changes, whether legislatively required to or not.</p></speech>

The replies we are receiving are not reflected in their experiences in Intreo offices.  They are not reflected in their experiences with their employer either.  The net result is that workers are taking home pay of &euro;40.  There are workers taking home net pay of &euro;200 who are trying to raise families and meet mortgage commitments.  They consider themselves the lucky ones.  There is major distress and upset.</p>  <p>  I hope the Government is talking to the company in terms of connectivity.  That needs to be discussed.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to engage with the company with a view to ensuring that these workers receive their entitlements and that there are open doors rather than closed doors, continued cloudiness and lack of clarity.</p></speech>

I have seen some individual queries of constituents of mine who are finding it difficult to access their welfare entitlements.  As is often the case, everyone's situation is different and that can complicate matters, but we will try to help as best we can.</p>  <p>  The Government really appreciates and understands the extent to which the aviation sector, airports and airlines have been severely hit by the pandemic and the strict travel rules the Government has put in place to protect the health of the country.  Aer Lingus has been a major beneficiary of the wage subsidy scheme.  It has enabled the company to hang on to many of its staff.  It will be a major beneficiary of the employment wage subsidy scheme, which will allow it to keep a lot of its staff on the payroll.  We are in engagements with the company to see if we can support the airline in a similar way to other Governments to ensure its survival through the pandemic, because we need the airline and we will need the connectivity next summer.</p></speech>

The programme for Government commits to a referendum on housing.  As we know, since 2014 the Constitutional Convention also recommended such a referendum.  When will a referendum be brought forward?  Will this referendum be on the right to housing?</p></speech>

That will happen during the term of this D&aacute;il.  There is no date set for it.  Obviously, we have to agree the wording, because any time we amend the Constitution the wording that we put in is then interpreted by the courts in a way that is superior to any law that we pass here.  We need to ensure that we get the wording right when we change our Constitution.</p>  <p>  I would issue a word of caution, though.  A total of 83 countries in the world have either a legal or constitutional right to housing.  They all have homelessness and they all have problems in their housing markets.  People find it difficult to pay the rent and get homes.  We should not make the mistake of thinking that a legal or constitutional right in itself solves the problem.  What will solve the problem is an increase in housing supply of all forms, including social housing, places to rent and places for people to buy.  That will not be achieved through a constitutional amendment, but it can be achieved through further Government action.</p></speech>

It is the lack of progress around the medical cannabis access programme.  I see the former Minister for Health in the Chamber.  To say parents and patients are extremely frustrated is an understatement.  The law was changed last year and many people had hope.  Since then, there have been numerous issues with lack of reimbursement and lack of access.  When will the medical cannabis access programme commence?</p></speech>

There was a commitment by the Government to bring forward certain legislation within the first 100 days of its formation.

However, the legislative programme was agreed and published by Government on Tuesday.  It includes 30 discrete items of legislation that will be published before Christmas and, with the Deputy's co-operation, perhaps even enacted by Christmas.  It includes some major legislation.  Examples include the climate action Bill, which is a big part of what we are going to prioritise as a Government, an affordable housing Bill, which I know will be important to many people in the House, and legislation around Brexit, which will be necessary given the fact that the UK will leave the Single Market and Customs Union at the end of the year.</p></speech>

We do not have a single long-stay bed in the county of Tipperary.  People in south Tipperary have to go to Kilkenny, where the beds are full, they are not wanted or there is no room.  People from north Tipperary have to travel to Ennis.  The former Minister of State, Mr. Daly, promised and committed to this, not only at meetings with other Oireachtas Members and myself but in the House as well.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, for coming to visit south Tipperary.  However, officials have the Minister of State now saying that this was never a commitment and that it was for the south-east region.</p>  <p>  Mental health has increased tenfold with the onset of Covid-19.  People are being turned away from our general hospital day in, day out and night in, night out.  People are desperately suffering with many ending up as suicides  Why has the Government stopped collating the self-harm and suicide figures since March of this year?  Will the Government honour the commitment to provide long-stay mental health beds in south Tipperary?  It is not an add-on extra.  It is desperately needed.  We need to have those beds and have those patients treated and returned to their families in good health.  We had those outcomes for decades.  However, since the closure of St. Michael's unit we have no place to go.</p> <p>They are sent home and many of them end up in their graves.</p></speech>

Everyone in this House appreciates the terrible impact that Covid-19 has had on many people's mental health ranging from worrying about the virus to social isolation to people's loss of their jobs.  That is something we specifically mention and put in the Covid plan released on Tuesday.  This year, for the first time ever, the budget for mental health will exceed &euro;1 billion, which is a considerable sum of money.  From the most recent figures I have seen, although they may be old, as the Deputy said, we have seen a decrease in suicide in Ireland and a decrease in people self-harming.  That is very welcome but we have a long way to go.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's specific question about the beds in Tipperary, I will have to ask the Minister to get back to the Deputy directly on that.</p></speech>

Those penalty points have the potential to do major harm to the Irish fishing industry.  I remind the D&aacute;il that Fianna F&aacute;il opposed a penalty points system when the former Minister, Deputy Creed, tried to introduce one some time back.  What is the standing in law of these new penalty points following the signing of the statutory instrument?  Can the statutory instrument be withdrawn by this Government?  I call on the Minister, as a member of the Government, to do a U-turn on this and withdraw the statutory instrument so it can come before the D&aacute;il for proper debate.  Can he do that for the fishermen of Ireland?</p></speech>

I understand it was a requirement under European law that we bring in a penalty points-type system for the enforcement of fishery protection law, so it had to come in sooner or later.  I understand that the Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a brief period of time, signed those regulations into law.  The procedure, as the Deputy knows, is that any statutory instrument can be revoked by this House but it would be up to the Opposition, if it wishes, to insist on a debate and a vote on it.  I think it would have about 21 days to do that.  My understanding, however, is that this is a long-standing European obligation to bring in this system as an alternative to court prosecution.  It is all about protecting our environment and our fisheries to ensure that we have fisheries and fishermen into the future.</p></speech>

Tens of thousands of those will be criss-crossing the country.  The Minister's instructions were that higher and third level institutions should consider enhanced protective measures.  What does that mean and what is the Government's plan?  For instance, should these students go home at the weekend and is the Minister fearful of them spreading the virus?  For students who are being asked to pay for accommodation months in advance, will they get their money back if the levels increase to 3 and 4?</p></speech>

She went to the school, which is an excellent school, and they told her that they do not have any resources and that they did not get any guidance from the Department of Education and Skills on the supports they can give to anyone repeating their leaving certificate on 16 November.  That is unacceptable.  I contacted the Department this morning and I was told that the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, supports a website for students who want to repeat their leaving certificate.  That is not good enough.  The school the student has been dealing with is excellent, and by no means would I condemn it, but every school needs supports for their students who intend to repeat the leaving certificate.</p></speech>

They have been downgraded by one and two points, from H1 to H2 and from H2 to H3, and have lost out on positions.  The teachers' information that is available throughout all the quarterly examinations does not reflect the reason they got downgraded.

A huge amount of work has been undertaken by the sector, including by the Union of Students of Ireland, which sits on a group that meets every Friday that I attend also.  It will meet again in the morning.  We are now examining the further measures that need to be taken in respect of the latest NPHET advice regarding Dublin and without getting ahead of any NPHET recommendations that may or may not go to Government in the coming days, I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that it is the balance between what one does on site and what one does online.</p>  <p>  In respect of accommodation, we have already brought in a number of flexible options for students to be able to rent a room for a number of nights rather than taking out a long-term lease.  I would encourage more colleges to do that.</p>  <p>  In respect of the other two issues, they are matters for the Minister for Education and Skills.  I know the Minister has been doing an excellent job on prioritising the calculated grades system.  I am sure guidance will be produced on the repeat leaving certificate opportunity and I will ask the Minister, Deputy Foley, to follow up on that.  The calculated grades system, while imperfect, because every system was imperfect in the pandemic, was genuinely the best, honest and most robust system we could put in place.</p></speech>

As we know, preventing antisocial behaviour and the issue of community safety is very important for us all.  Many of our areas are suffering, and issues such as fireworks, scramblers and continued antisocial behaviour, including drug dealing etc., have been raised in the House.  We need community support and involvement of youth services to support public bodies.  Where does the community fit into this Bill?  Where do the community safety forums that are established and are working fit into it?  We have one in Blanchardstown, the community safety forum, which is part of the Blanchardstown local drugs task force.  Are they included in the strategic framework because it is essential that we get community support to support the public services and the Garda?</p></speech>

I will read out a couple of testimonies.  One states:</p> <blockquote> 	Nothing works for my pup.  She is petrified and we have people setting off bangers randomly so you can&rsquo;t prepare for them.<br /><br />My dog has been hearing them since August in the distance.  [I] can't [get him to] walk in the park [because] he's too fearful.  </blockquote>  <p>Safety in our communities is starting to go.  What resources are in place to deal with this nightly combat?

I will be honest with them and say that I am not an expert on the Bill but I understand that there will be a provision in it for community structures in particular.  It is very welcome that the Bill is the policing and community safety Bill.  For the first time, we are seeing the words "policing" and "community safety" in the title of legislation and that speaks to the new philosophy around policing into the future.</p>  <p>  On the issue of fireworks, I very much agree with Deputy Ward.  This is an issue that is coming up a lot in my constituency.  It seems that the pre-Hallowe'en fireworks activity has kicked off much earlier this year.  I do not know why, and many people are worried about it, not just people using our parks but particularly people who have pets.  We need to make sure that the fireworks Act is enforced and that we do not see animals being terrorised or, worse, children or young people having their hands damaged or losing their eyesight.  That is the kind of thing that happens around this time of year.  It is important that the Garda is supported in enforcing that legislation.</p></speech>

Louth has had the third highest case numbers of Covid-19 and, four times in the past week, Louth has had the second highest number of cases recorded.  The acting Chief Medical Officer, CMO, said earlier this week that Louth is showing a particularly concerning trend.  This morning, first, second and third year students from a school in Drogheda were told to stay home.  One positive case involving a teacher has resulted in up to 30 other teachers getting close contact notifications from the HSE app, meaning that they have to self-isolate for the next two weeks.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>In the meantime, Drogheda is still without a Covid testing centre, yet members of the Government come in here day after day and say they are ramping up testing.  We need a commitment from the Government that Drogheda, the largest town in Ireland, will get its Covid testing centre.  I expect the T&aacute;naiste to pick up the phone today and contact the HSE given that the number of cases is rising in Louth, including Drogheda.  He should please not say it is a matter for the HSE.  He is supposed to be a member of a Government in charge.  I would like a commitment over the next few days on when Drogheda, which is the largest town and whose number of cases is rising, will get its Covid testing centre, and where it will be.  Please, no more bullshit.  I do not want to have to come in next week and raise this issue again.  The T&aacute;naiste says testing is being ramped up.

Therefore, having a test centre there would be a good idea.  I undertake to raise that with the CEO of the HSE tomorrow.</p></speech>

It was pretty frightening to hear a report on "Six One News" yesterday about a reagent that is necessary for rapid testing.  There is a limited supply.  I want to know what the Government is doing to deal with this.  We need all Government resources to be put into community testing, as said by Deputy Munster.  We need to consider the possibility of mobile testing units that can be introduced where they are absolutely necessary.  We need to make sure we do not have staffing problems as people are redeployed to the positions they were in prior to their being deployed to carry out contact tracing and prior to their having been involved in the trace-and-isolate infrastructure.  We need to make sure we have the capacity to do the business we need to do or we will shut this entire State down.</p></speech>

One million Covid PCR tests have been carried out in Ireland.  That is a considerable achievement.  Once again, I express my gratitude to and appreciation for the HSE staff and laboratory staff given the work they have done.</p>  <p>  We do have mobile testing centres.  They can be set up quite quickly.  One was set up in Castleknock, in my area, not that long ago.  We need to be frank with people in that capacity is not unlimited.  There are only so many medical scientists in Ireland and the world.  Let us not pretend that capacity can somehow be ramped up infinitely.  There may be periods, as we go on, during which the criteria on testing will have to be changed so that we can focus on testing those most likely to test positive.  Some 98% of test results are still negative.  We need to be frank with people about that.</p>  <p>  I had stopped watching the BBC news but started watching it again last night at 10 p.m. to see what was happening with Brexit from the British perspective.  I was interested to see that the main item on the news in Britain concerned lines of 300 people, or more, queueing to get a Covid test.  Their system, whereby one can bypass one's general practitioner and apply for a test online, is breaking down.  That is why we need to be careful about how we proceed from here.  Things are not perfect.  We are coming up against capacity constraints but we need to make the right decisions.  Allowing people to bypass the general practitioner seems to have been a big mistake in Britain, even though some academics here are advocating it.  Things that work academically do not always work in practice.  We need to make sure the demand is met when it comes to the criteria regarding who qualifies for testing and who does not.  We will continue to increase the capacity as much as we can but we need to be frank with people that it is not unlimited and cannot be unlimited.</p></speech>

Many developments that even nine months ago were regarded as politically impossible have since come to pass.  Some time ago, before Covid, when I said the State should nationalise some of the private hospital system, I was told in this very Chamber that it was not realistic and that it was never going to happen.  Then the pandemic happened.  Overnight, the private hospital system was temporarily nationalised.  Is it not interesting how, in the midst of a crisis, ideologies change and the Government realises different things?  The Government realised it needed a nationalised health system.  Before that, it never considered the option.  I believe we will end up considering it again in some way.</p><p>Sick pay is a similar issue.  The time has come to deal with it.  Doing so is long overdue.  It has actually taken this pandemic to demonstrate <i>en masse</i>the major gaps in legal protections for workers in this country.  Ireland is one of only five European countries where workers do not have a legal right to sick pay.  Many people in this country are not aware of that.  It is an enormous hole.  I would appreciate it if the T&aacute;naiste listened to me because this is a rather important issue.  There is an enormous hole in the protections workers need to prevent them from being forced to go to work while sick.  This pandemic has shown beyond doubt that what is happening is simply not good enough.</p><p>Workers throughout our country are looking for help in this area and for the Government to do the right thing.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is calling for sick pay to be an employment right for all workers, bringing Ireland into line with European norms.  The Labour Party is introducing this Bill to make sick pay a legal right for workers in Ireland for the very first time.  We are proposing six weeks of pay for a worker who is sick, to be paid at the same rate as annual leave, with the employer entitled to any illness benefit due to the worker during this time.  The Chief Medical Officer, the chief clinical officer and, indeed, the CEO of the HSE have all come out in support of our legislation.  The Government often says it is following public health advice.  Will it follow public health advice here?  It is going to be an important weapon in our fight against Covid.</p><p>The situation regarding meat factory workers over the summer, which played a big part in the lockdowns in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, was a clear example of how the lack of sick pay in workplaces can hammer everyone in the community.  Incredibly, meat factories have still explicitly ruled out even discussing sick pay with workers and their trade union representatives.  This is not acceptable.</p><p>In ABP in Cahir in my county, an employee has to be in full-time employment for two years before being entitled to sick pay.  Imagine being a worker from Brazil or some other country and not having sick pay for two years while being expected to go without pay if he or she has any Covid symptom?  I acknowledge that Dawn Meats has said very recently it will pay the wages of anyone who has to isolate.  This is welcome but it does not go far enough.</p><p>As part of this Bill, we have included an emergency measure for paid parental leave in circumstances where a school is shut down due to Covid-19 and where a parent or guardian must take leave to care for a child at home.  This is a very simple measure that will greatly ease the stress and anxiety that many parents are feeling right now as they worry about what they will do if their child's school is closed.  This will give them reassurance until their son or daughter can go back to school.</p> <p>This is pertinent legislation that the Labour Party is putting it forward.  We are disappointed it was not part of the T&aacute;naiste's legislative programme despite my request for same.  I ask him genuinely to look at it in some way.  If he if wants to alter our Bill, I have no issue or problem with that but will he please consider it?  I have written to every Member of the House to ask them to do the same.</p></speech>

I was referring to the Government's honouring of the commitment made to public servants under the existing public sector pay agreement.  I suggested that if we did not have an agreement in place, public servants and civil servants could well be targeted for pay cuts given the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  Public sector pay agreements are important for industrial stability, for fairness in our public service, for future planning and in recognising the key role our public servants have played.  Covid-19 should never be used as an excuse not to honour any agreements.</p>  <p>  I mention in passing community employment supervisors who were crucial in the upskilling and reskilling of those who were out of work during the last crisis.  They will play an equally if not even more important role in reshaping our economy and community response in the post-Covid-19 recovery.  They make an invaluable contribution to our society but still do not have access to occupational pension schemes, which is a running sore in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should have taken the opportunity in recent months to re-establish engagement with the unions representing community employment supervisors to ensure the recommendation that came from the Labour Court in 2007 is finally honoured.</p>  <p>  The Revised Estimates presented earlier this year lacked clarity.  We have seen big bailouts to big business without any conditions and expensive tax reliefs to higher earners despite strong evidence from the departmental officials that many of those schemes will be a deadweight loss.  In the coming months with the budget and the proposed national economic plan it will be crucial in charting the Covid-19 recovery that we develop a new social contract for our citizens to give them hope for the future.  We cannot go back to the broken model I mentioned in my remarks yesterday.  We will need clarity on a public investment strategy that will build the required capacity in our public services - in housing, health and childcare - and put us on track to meet our climate emissions targets, and ultimately get people back to work to build a better and more sustainable post-Covid Ireland.</p></speech>

In recent weeks society, large businesses and the Government have started to come to terms with how long we will be living with the Covid-19 virus and have started to put a plan in place for how we will continue to do our business.  A factor that needs to be addressed ahead of the upcoming budget is how we will continue to foot the bill for the enormous financial cost that Covid-19 has caused for our country.  Many different suggestions and ideas have been proposed.  The programme for Government proposes a review of the national development plan as one of the first major actions of the Government.  I look forward to having an opportunity to engage with that.</p>  <p>  Yesterday we heard some discussion on creating employment and generating an economic stimulus on a balanced regional basis through shovel-ready projects.  There are many such projects in my constituency of Cork East which will need to go before the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for decision.  A few minutes ago I had a phone call with the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss some of these projects within my constituency.  Planning permissions, which have been controversial in many ways, for secondary schools in the Mallow area and in the Carrigtwohill area have finally been granted and are ready for tender.  Having discussed this with the Minister, I am happy to report to the House that these projects should go out to tender as early as January or February of next year, which is very significant and will be a major boost to the local economy if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will recognise that these capital projects need to be undertaken.  They will be very important in creating employment in the area while also tackling some of the major social issues.</p>  <p>  In the constituency of Cork East, which I have the honour to represent, many issues repeatedly come up.  We have a major infrastructure deficit.  I saw many wonderful plans as a child growing up, including Transport 21.  On a regional basis, billions of euro have been allocated to the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy to address transport issues in Cork county and the metropolitan area of Cork city.  The review of the national development plan, NDP, represents a great opportunity to bring many of these projects forward while borrowing is cheap.  The opportunity cost of not doing anything on that would be deeply concerning.  We need to look at areas that missed out when the last national development plan was put in place.  I know the Minister will be putting a significant amount of effort into ensuring Deputies from all sides of the House have some degree of engagement with that.</p>  <p>  In recent months I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on the requirement to upgrade the road infrastructure for the town of Youghal.  I know the Ceann Comhairle is very familiar with my part of the world which suffered enormous economic hardship with over 4,000 jobs lost at the turn of the millennium because of the textile industry and low-skill labour relocating to eastern Europe.  There is good news out there; it is not all negative.  The largest capital investment ever in the town will take place in the very near future with the EirGrid interconnector between Ireland and France.  I know we will be discussing our focus on renewable energy and tackling climate change later today in the House.  We need to delve into ongoing projects and figure out how places such as Youghal, Midleton and Killeagh, in my part of the world and for which I was first elected as a councillor a number of months ago, would benefit from such projects.</p>  <p>  There has been considerable negativity by some local representatives in the constituency of Cork East over what is going on.  In reality, given what is on the table and up for discussion in the coming months, it is a very exciting time for the community I represent.  School projects are ongoing.  We have a serious school capacity crisis in east Cork, which has been well documented.  I compliment the Minister for Education and Skills on her work to date on that problem.  On doorsteps during the election campaign that issue was repeatedly raised.  In many cases the consequences were devastating with families needing to travel great distances to find access to secondary schools, particularly for children with special needs.  Youghal, for example, has no specific autism spectrum disorder, ASD, adult education centres or day facilities.  When reviewing the NDP we should look at that issue to see if funding can be found to be allocated to that area.</p>  <p>  Unemployment is a major problem for young people.  They need opportunities and we need to find work for them.  Thousands of people have been returning to Ireland as we are dealing with an international economic crisis.  Their livelihoods have been put into turmoil as a result.</p>  <p>  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to utilise the NDP review and this year's budget to see if we can bring home more of the people we lost in the previous recession and try to integrate them back into our society and economy.  For that to happen we need to build houses, schools, hospitals and the public services that are so desperately needed.  I will put my shoulder to the wheel with members of the Cabinet on that.  I do not plan on wasting a single day while Fianna F&aacute;il is in government to ensure we take every opportunity available to us.  It is a great honour to be here.  I am aware that there is considerable expectation on the Government to pick up from, perhaps, a rocky start.  I look forward to working with the Ministers in the weeks ahead as we prepare for the budget.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> I thank the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, for his engagement on issues concerning Cork Airport.  We had a very strong discussion on the report of the task force for aviation recovery that was undertaken by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There is a need for a multi-departmental approach to deal with that report.  It cannot be dealt with only by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It deserves a conversation at the Cabinet table.  I have been in contact with many of the workers at Cork Airport, as I mentioned in the House yesterday, and they are in a very serious situation.  We need to recognise how much the airports are worth annually to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of the tax revenues coming in from the airline industry and the aviation sector generally.  The sector helps to fund a serious number of projects that go on at a grassroots level in our economy.  It is very important, where there is scope to bring in tax revenues rather than raising taxes on ordinary citizens, that concentrate to some degree on figuring out how we can recover those sectors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700021#W00200"><p>I wish to express my dissatisfaction and the dissatisfaction of the people I represent with the Government's spending in response to Covid-19.  For example, almost &euro;9 million has been spent on advertising since the start of the pandemic.  That figure does not include the recent hiring of a public relations firm following criticisms of the mixed messaging around Covid restrictions.  A communications and advisory firm was engaged to help with the launch of the medium-term Covid plan on Tuesday.  I hope the company has not yet been paid because the number of messages and calls I have received about the launch shows it would not be money well spent.  There has been huge confusion over what is meant by level 2, level 2 and a bit minus the wet pubs and everything else in between.  Where is the clarity that is needed?  The Government and the Department of Health already employ a large number of staff to deal with media and communications.  Does the Government feel it has a problem in communicating its message?  The solution to that should not to be hire public relations firms but to communicate the message better.  It might also be wise to stop Ministers from constantly contradicting each other.</p>  <p>  In my capacity as party spokesperson for older people, I have met many of the groups representing older people, all of which feel that the people they represent were forgotten about by the Government in its response to Covid-19.  It was no accident that this pandemic had a disproportionate effect on older citizens.  We saw from the oversubscription of the Age Action and Irish Red Cross hardship fund that older people feel they are being left behind.  There were 42,000 inquiries to that fund and 21,000 applications, of which just 453 were granted.  This shortfall is no fault of Age Action and the Irish Red Cross, which managed to secure corporate sponsorship of more than &euro;100,000 for the fund.  We need a Government-backed hardship fund for older people to be established and properly resourced.  We must prioritise older people and the services that provide care for them and we must ensure day care services can be reopened.  We must consider the mental health of older people as well as their physical health.  We need to focus our efforts on reopening health services.  It is absolutely unacceptable that routine screening and appointments for other services have not recommenced.  Before the Covid crisis, waiting lists were already at an unacceptable level.  I hate to think how they will look by the end of the year if things continue as they have been.</p>  <p>  We also need to give proper resources to suicide prevention.  We all know the effect Covid has had on the mental health of our population.  We have seen the effect that proper investment and a credible plan have had on the number of road deaths.  We need a body like the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to tackle the epidemic of suicide.  We need proper investment and a credible plan, and that plan must include the provision of 24-7 mental health services.  Anything else is simply not acceptable.  Suicide does not just affect those who take their own lives.  It affects their families, friends and communities.  That effect can be felt for generations, such is the impact on those who are left behind.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to raise the situation of HOPE(D), a local mental health charity in Newbridge, County Kildare.  The service is in danger of closing because Covid-19 has decimated its fundraising programmes.  The HSE refers people to HOPE(D) but refuses to provide adequate funding for the service.  Let us think about that for a moment.  I am asking that the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach intervene directly to ensure this service gets the help it deserves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700021#W00300"><p>Given the unprecedented circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is no surprise that we are talking about an unprecedented level of public expenditure.  So far this year, expenditure has grossly exceeded projections and that is all down to the Covid pandemic.  We are in the most extraordinary of circumstances and we all accept the underlying reasons for the substantial additional expenditure.  My party very much supports the approach that has been taken by the Government in prioritising public health and the health measures that needed to be put in place urgently and on a continuing basis in the fight against Covid.  We also very much support what the Government has done to protect jobs and provide income supports for the many thousands of people who suffered and continue to suffer a major shock to their economic circumstances and their ability to earn a living.</p>  <p>  However, the experience over the past six or seven months has exposed very graphically the weaknesses in how we provide public services.  Some of us have been beating that drum for a long time but some of those in government have denied this was the case and have instead preferred to talk about tax cuts and to make promises to people which did not have any basis in economic or social policy.  There was a playing to the gallery in regard to tax cuts while ignoring the fundamental problems we have in this country in respect of how we provide public services.  Most other modern European countries regard public services as being for all of the public.  Public services should be universal services that are available to everybody, not what some people in this Government think they are, namely, services for low-income groups or the poor.  The progressive way of running a society and economy is to provide universal public services.  Doing so benefits everybody.  It helps to avoid exclusion and inequality and it also drives down the cost of living.  If people can access healthcare or any other public service on a universal basis, it gives them more disposable income and also ensures the heat is taken out of wage demands.  Fundamentally, it is a more efficient way of providing services and also a fairer way of doing so.</p>  <p>  Huge issues have been exposed in terms of how our public services are provided.  This is especially true of healthcare and social care.  It is also the case with childcare and the privatised model that has been followed.  We can see the problems with how we fund education services, including the high dependency on income from foreign students, which is not a sustainable way of funding the education system.  In the case of housing, there are few or no protections for renters and we have completely failed in making housing affordable for people.  For that reason, special measures had to be put in place.  It was the right thing to do but lessons should be learned from it.  As we move to a more sustainable longer-term situation, the funding we apply now should be based around there being no going back to the old way of doing things.  Investment should be based on achieving reform at the same time as spending.  It must be focused on bringing about effective changes in how we provide public services.</p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, recently launched a very good document, entitled No Going Back.  That should be the message from the Government, that there is no going back to the old way of doing things.  There must be no going back to the two-tier health service, for instance, and the lack of adequacy of our public services generally.  All public services should be provided on a universal basis.</p> <p>We can actually do that now because we have the potential to borrow at very significant levels.  Money is available at 0% interest rates and sometimes at negative ones.  That capacity is there at the moment and it makes absolute sense to avail of that borrowing capacity in order to provide investment in services which will make our society and our economy much more sustainable.  This is, therefore, an opportunity as well as a crisis.  The other important point we must keep to the fore is that any recovery plan must ensure it is a job-centred recovery.  For the moment, that means continuing with the labour market supports but in the longer term it means looking at how we create high-quality, high-worth jobs.  Too often in the past we have been happy to accept precarious, low-paid jobs.  This is an opportunity to right that wrong.  The other side of that is providing adequate supports on an ongoing basis to businesses and there must be undertakings in that respect.</p> <p> I refer to spending overall and the excess spending we have seen so far.  I wish to address the issue of testing and tracing, the strategy for it and the fact that we have never been able to ramp up and gear up the testing and tracing system to the point that is required.  From the beginning, we have been promised that this would be the case and that our main strategy was testing, tracing and isolating.  We have never done that to the extent and at the speed required.  Every time I have spoken on Covid in this House, going back to the very first debates, I have said that unless we get testing and tracing right, none of the rest can be properly dealt with.  It is fundamental to everything we are doing in this country and six or seven months down the road we still have not got up to that capacity of 100,000 tests per week and we still do not have the staff to provide that service.  I do not know why those staff were not recruited during the summer months.  We are continuing to redeploy people from critical areas of the health service into testing and tracing, leaving important areas like speech and language therapy, audiology and other key parts of our health service understaffed and exposed.  We should have the additional staff in place by now.  It is really unforgivable that the lull during the summer months was not availed of in order to do that.</p> <p> There are also questions about the precise expenditure on testing and tracing.  The Government sanctioned funding of &euro;206 million in 2020 for this purpose, although the HSE has estimated that the potential cost will be as high as &euro;414 million.  That is if full capacity is used and we should be up to full capacity at this stage.  In the first half of the year, however, less than &euro;50 million was spent.  I have a suspicion that that is why we did not gear up the testing and tracing system, namely, that a brake was put on the resources available to do what was necessary.  This raises a lot of questions about why so little was spent in the first half of the year and why we have not done that if our primary strategy is to flatten the curve and suppress the virus.  In the past seven days Minsters have been speaking about 77,000 tests.  It is supposed to be 100,000 so it is falling well short of that.</p> <p> On nursing homes and the additional expenditure there, this is again exposing a system which does not work.  Substantial additional funding had to be used as a bailout for nursing homes.  It is absolutely critical that we continue to provide that funding.  There are questions about why we are doing that in a situation where 80% of nursing homes are privatised and tax-incentivised.  They are supposed to be profit-making and indeed they are, so why is the State bailing out the sector?  We have to do what we have to do now but a reckoning will have to come very shortly about that, along with an acceptance that the model is absolutely wrong.</p> <p> I have a brief point to make about aviation.  Our aviation sector is on its knees.  There have been huge problems with the failure to deal with the whole question of international travel which I will not repeat.  Some 140,000 jobs depend on the sector.  There are 4,000 people working in Aer Lingus, which is the only national carrier that has not got state aid from its national government.  This is an issue that must be addressed urgently.  These people have been left swinging in the wind because the Government has not been prepared to step up and put in place the kind of funding required to support that sector.  Unless that is done there is a very serious risk Aer Lingus will collapse.  It needs urgent attention by Government, the company needs State aid urgently and we need to see the implementation of the recommendations of the aviation recovery task force.</p></speech>

I was Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in the last D&aacute;il for four years.  As the Members opposite will know the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, visited the committee on many occasions and we were very grateful for its presence.  I was very taken by the message IFAC's representatives delivered this morning.  It may have surprised some people as it did not necessarily conform with the messages that IFAC would be associated with.  As a previous chair of IFAC has said, one of the purposes for which the council was established in first place was "[...] to institutionalise the memory of the crash" so that we would not make the same mistakes.  Part of the memory which has certainly been institutionalised within the memory and consciousness of Irish people was the pain and suffering that was endured during the crash.  People suffered economic loss and mental and psychological pain as a result of it.  The opportunity that has existed in previous times for people to leave our shores is obviously not there now.  As such IFAC's message this morning was in essence that this is not the time to be penny-pinching. In fact its central message was that this is the time to carry the workforce and those who need it most through this tortuous, tedious time.</p>  <p>  I am mindful of the fact that there is a considerable section of the country and society which has escaped pretty much unscathed in financial and economic terms, albeit that they may in some cases have contracted the virus and would have suffered equally to everybody else.  There are those, however, who are in the employ of companies which have escaped virtually unscathed, in different sectors of the economy.  When we see those who have remained reasonably comfortable during this phase and we consider the five or six wealthiest companies in the world, it is time to have a conversation about what role those companies can play in the economic welfare and the welfare of the community in general.</p>  <p>  I was formerly spokesperson on Dublin for my party and Dublin is very nervous today.  The Ceann Comhairle will appreciate this as his constituency went through three lockdowns in total, one of which was a repeated lockdown.  It would help if the heaving of sighs from the Opposition side of the House could be a bit quieter.  I remind Deputies that at the time of the crash-----</p></speech>

This is something Members on the other side of the House would be best to remember from time to time.  Sometimes one must take tough decisions.  We now have the benefit of credibility and a record of paying our debts.  I accept that some of those burdens were unfair but it has enabled us now to be in a position to borrow billions of euro and to enable this State to fulfil the contract between the State and the citizen.</p> <p>I do not think at any other time in its history has the State fulfilled the unwritten social contract and expectation that exists to be delivered by it to its citizens as it has since the onset of the virus.</p> <p> There are those who say they represent those who get up for work early in the morning.  The key message for me today is that our focus must now be on those who cannot get a night's sleep because of the worries and anxieties they carry, and who wake up wondering what today will bring.  While they have not lost their jobs, some of them have been told they can reopen and get back to business but then have been thwarted.  This has happened four times to publicans in Dublin.  Others have mentioned Aer Lingus workers.  There are also the taxi drivers and, along with my colleagues, I will meet some of their representatives today.  Their asks are not huge or significant.</p> <p> To interpret what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said, it is that now is not the time to be penny pinching.  The previous Government was incredibly generous, and rightly so, about the needs of the ordinary working people in the country.  Now is not the time to start tightening the belt or to consider tightening it, particularly for those front-line workers, who now include teachers.  All Deputies will have had texts and messages from teachers in schools where a child who had come in with some symptoms was taken home and is isolating.  Those teachers are now wondering and living anxiously to see whether they have contracted the virus.  Garda&iacute; have successfully policed during the pandemic in the consensual way that only the Irish police force can.  It is admired abroad for the way in which it polices its communities and it continues to do so.  In a very short period, public servants processed hundreds of thousands of payments that provided necessary assistance.  There are also the self-employed people, whether in the entertainment industry, music industry, crafts, social and cultural industries and others, who just have not been able to get back to work.  They are the people among the 200,000 who have not gone back to work and who should be our primary focus as we move into the budgetary cycle.  Essentially, this is what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said today.</p> <p> I was a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight - Deputy Boyd Barrett will also appreciate this - and I always took on board what IFAC said and took its advice very seriously.  I thought it was always very measured.  It was very critical of the previous Government.  That criticism was never really taken on board or treated seriously by the media.  It was heavily critical for a period of four years until, finally, the previous Minister for Finance took on board the message of being over-reliant on corporation tax.</p> <p> I have mentioned the sectors I want to highlight.  Consider the &euro;13 billion deficit for this year and what the previous Government spent.  One or two of my colleagues were criticised because they said there were people who receive the Covid payment who did not need it.  This was communicated rather poorly.  The message was clearly that there were people who received the Covid payment for whom it represented three or four times the income they were receiving for short-term part-time work.  This continues to happen and I would like to see it invigilated.  The taxpayers deserve to know the money they pay in taxes is redirected correctly, fairly and justly in terms of social protection measures.  This is not to say people are scamming but everybody knows there were students who might have had part-time work that earned them &euro;30 or &euro;40 a week and they got the &euro;350 Covid payment for months.  Some of their friends who had a part-time job in SuperValu or Dunnes Stores and continued to work to stack shelves for &euro;240 or &euro;300 a week saw their friends getting &euro;350 for doing nothing.  This should not persist.</p> <p> Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, made a point about looking at the huge budget that has been expended and looking at what might be needed.  For example, taxi drivers want small things, such as the return of the wage subsidy they were on because essentially they are paying mortgages on their cars.  They want no new licences issued until this is over, which is perfectly reasonable.  The smallest ask of all is that those with cars coming up to ten years old at the end of the year be given an extension because they are repaying.  Chauffeurs, limousine drivers and coach driving companies have been mentioned, as has everybody involved in tourism.</p> <p> Last night, the point was made very strongly, and I urge the Minister to consider it, that those involved in the travel agency business do not get paid until people actually travel.  They did their end of the booking of holidays last year for consumers' holidays that were to take place this year.  They do not get paid by the company at the other end of the travel route until the holiday actually begins.  These holidays were cancelled and the travel agents have to pay back the money.  They have no earned income for this year and they have lost some income they had to pay back from last year.</p> <p> If Covid has shown one thing, especially in Dublin, it is that the city has become utterly reliant on tourism.  The city is dying.  There is grass growing in parts of Molesworth Street.  I come into Dublin every Sunday and street furniture was introduced on a number of streets and it was very successful.  People could sit outside and feel safer in the fresh air having a coffee or a glass of wine.  Dublin City Council was very enthusiastic about this.  That street furniture has not been there for the past three weeks.  There is very little reason for people to come in.  The city is dying.  We have been down at the convention centre.  The headquarters of PwC is beside the convention centre.  Recently, I spoke to somebody and I hope I have the figures roughly correct.  There are 1,500 work stations in that building but only 100 of them are active at present.  This explains why on all of the plazas running parallel to the convention centre on the tram tracks, and on the streets off the tram tracks behind it, the coffee shops and restaurants are closed.  No one is going into the newsagents to buy newspapers.  The workers are not there.  No one is using the sandwich bars or buying their lunches.  We are hanging these businesses out to dry.</p> <p> We stepped up to the mark in February and March.  IFAC is saying very clearly in its advice to the Government that this is not the time to step back from this mark in the interests of fiscal prudence.  The citizens of this country need the Government to support them, whether they are publicans, taxi drivers, those involved in travel agencies, tourism and hospitality businesses, public servants and teachers and children who need personal protective equipment, PPE, whether in a fee-paying school or not.  I do not have a fee-paying school in my constituency.  Every child in the State is equal and deserving and has a right to the best health and safety provision the State can provide.</p> <p> The key message I want to impress on the Minister is that our focus needs to be on those who have not been getting a night's sleep for the past three or four months worrying about their businesses, their rising debts and their inability to pay back loans and mortgages.  The State stepped in for a period and it must sustain that assistance during the most trying period in the history of the Republic.</p></speech>

We need to be brave.  Whatever the rights and wrongs people claim from a left or right background on fiscal prudence versus austerity, and whatever rules pertained previously, we are now in a completely different situation.  We are talking in economic terms of something that is akin to how Europe was at the end of the Second World War, and what we need is a Marshall plan type solution.</p> <p>That involves huge amounts of money to buoy up and sustain what we have, as well as ensuring we can stimulate when necessary.</p> <p> At this point, we are obviously worried as Covid-19 numbers get worse, along with the negative outworkings for people's health.  We are also concerned about the economic impact that this will have.  First and foremost, we need to stabilise and then ensure that we keep as much business, as many jobs and as much of our society in operation until we get to the far end of this.  I accept we do not quite know.  While we have not had the clarity we would have liked with the Government's roadmap for the next six to nine months, we must accept that we could be looking at a situation closer to two years.  We have to prepare for all of this and be incredibly brave.</p> <p> As several Members have said, we all know sectors which cannot foresee any major changes to their businesses, their jobs or how they can open up.  We had taxi drivers this week outside this House in large numbers putting clear asks to the Government.  I have even heard Members from the Government parties espouse some of these asks.  Some of these asks are monetary but there are straightforward ones such as extending the ten-year rule on taxi vehicles which would allow people get through this gap at this point in time.  We need to look at those sorts of solutions.</p> <p> Beyond that, we need to build and maintain a capacity for testing, tracing and isolating.  We will absolutely destroy whatever good economic work has been done if we cannot keep the show on the road.  The reality is that we do not have the capacity required.  I mentioned in the House earlier and last night that there was a piece on "Six One News" on the difficulty getting particular reagents for use in rapid testing.  Rapid testing got this House through a particular fiasco recently.  As I said yesterday, I was thankful that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was Covid negative.  It was absolutely vital, however, that he was able to get access to a rapid test.  We need to ensure as many people as possible can get access to such tests.</p> <p> The high Covid rate is a significant issue coming up in every constituency.  My constituency, Louth, has worrying figures.  We also have instances in schools.  School and public health authorities are doing all they can.  It is concerning, however.  The only part of this that we have complete control over and which can improve matters is testing.</p> <p> Beyond that, we must realise the moneys we can draw down from Europe.  We need to ensure we have a conversation with our European neighbours on introducing imaginative responses.  As much as we accept in certain cases people will require loans, there is a significant difficulty with the 4:1 loan to grant ratio on what has been offered to date.  This must be rectified.</p> <p> While we must deal with taxi drivers, we must also deal with travel agents who find themselves in situations in which they will no longer able to operate.  While some businesses are down 30% to 50%, travel agents are down nearly 100%.  We need to ensure moneys are made available to stabilise and stimulate, to keep the businesses we will need after this point and to continue with the society we have.  If we do not do this, we will be facing into an abyss which none of us can contemplate.</p></speech>

It is telling about the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>the new Government implemented to silence the smaller parties that having asked for the debate, we had to wait for three or four Government speakers who spoke during three different slots before some of us got to respond to the Government's position.  It is an insult that the senior Minister is nowhere to be seen.  The fact that the senior Minister has disappeared long before most of the political groups in the House have responded to the Government's position is not just an insult to us - that is less important - because it is also an insult to democracy and to the people outside.  It is shameful.</p><p>The reason I particularly requested this debate was because I knew we would hear all the narrative from the Government about stimulus, how we have to protect people in the face of Covid and how we have to invest in the new normal.  We would have to listen to all this narrative, belied by the fact that today the Government is going to cut the incomes of tens of thousands of working people who have lost their jobs and livelihoods as a result of the Government's public health measures.  These are measures which the majority of the public support and without whose support we would be in a worse situation with Covid-19.  Rather than thanking them, however, with solidarity and upholding the principle that we are all in it together, it seems that some people are more in it together than others.  It is a tale of two pandemics.</p><p>If any member of the Cabinet turned out to be Covid positive and had to quarantine for two weeks, would they be put on a reduced pandemic unemployment payment?  No.  They would continue to enjoy their extraordinary salaries - the full 100% payout - while taxi drivers, who were on the streets the other day, are having their payments cut today.  It is kicking them while they are down when they have lost large amounts of income and livelihoods with debts accumulating.  The Government today has stuck the knife into the events and music workers whose livelihoods and ability to earn income have been slaughtered by the pandemic.  With rising infection rates, they have no prospect or roadmap back to possible viability.  They have their rents, mortgages and bills accumulating but they are being knifed in the back.  One can include in the list tour operators, bar workers in the wet pubs and cleaners and caterers in many of the office complexes which are not functioning.  These are the people whose sacrifices we need and who the Government is calling on to deal with the threat of Covid-19.  They have been knifed in the back today with pandemic unemployment payment cuts, however.  There is no other way to characterise it.  It is a betrayal of the principle that we are all in it together.  That lie is exposed with this sickening cut.</p><p>The Government even now should pull back on that cut.  Only a few million euro would be required for the 35,000 people in the live entertainment industry and the 25,000 taxi drivers.  It would be buttons.  For other people, however, the Government just signs the cheques.  The cheques get signed for the large profitable companies.</p><p>As our speaking time is so limited now, there are many issues we cannot bring up.  However, I want to raise one issue which was brought to my attention the other day.  While all the musicians, live events people and actual performers have had their payments cut, others, like film producers, get handed massive money.  The EU requires each government to print out the details of the state aid that goes to film producers.  The Committee of Public Accounts should look at this.  The crowd making &quot;The Last Duel&quot; in Ardmore Studios also made &quot;Vikings&quot; before.  Over the last five or six years, they received tax credits for &quot;Vikings&quot; that were listed as being between &euro;10 million and &euro;30 million.  Is it &euro;10 million, &euro;15 million, &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million?  We do not know.  There is no accountability when one hands the cheques over to wealthy film producers.  However, the taxi drivers, the tour operators, the arts workers and the people on the ground are knifed in the back.  It seems we are not all in this together.</p></speech>

It is also the day the Government is cutting the pandemic unemployment payment by &euro;50 per week for many people and &euro;100 for many other people.  It is not a small adjustment, not a few bob here or a few bob there, but a cut of &euro;100 or &euro;50 per week for tens of thousands of people who do not have the option of going back to work.  It is not possible for them to do so in the vast majority of cases because of the pandemic.  It might be one thing if the virus were settling down, if the situation were improving and if they had the prospect of going back to work in a week, two weeks or three weeks, but it is the opposite scenario.  The virus is on the rise and they have little chance of going back to work in the next week or two or three - perhaps not for a matter of months - yet they are forced to survive on &euro;100 or &euro;50 less per week.</p>  <p>  I listened carefully to Deputy Lahart's contribution - incredible stuff.  He said the Government's priority should be the people who are not able to sleep tonight because of the worry they are living with in their lives.  It was an incredible statement from a member of a Fianna F&aacute;il Party that is standing together with the Green Party and Fine Gael today and proposing to cut people's weekly incomes by &euro;50 or &euro;100.  How many people does Deputy Lahart think were able to sleep last month or last week who will not be able to sleep tonight because of the action of the Government Deputies on the benches on which he sits?  Yet he comes in here with crocodile tears for people who are not able to sleep tonight when it is his actions that are contributing to people's sleeplessness.  This raises the issue of the mental health impacts of this.  Younger people will probably be disproportionately hit by this.  I think people in precarious employment will be disproportionately hit by it.  What has this money been used for?  Has it been used for mad socialising over recent months?  It has not.  It has been used by people first and foremost to pay their rent and to put food on the table, and the Government is taking that money away from them today.  Shame on it.</p>  <p>  Some people will ask whether the country can continue to afford to pay out sums on this scale in payments of this type.  It is not an unfair question because a debt of &euro;30 billion will be built up from this year alone.  What that points towards, however, is that it is not possible to keep making these payments without taking action on the issue of wealth taxes.  Ten people in this country have a combined personal wealth of &euro;50 billion, and the Government will not even entertain a debate on the question of a wealth tax.  It turns its back on the opportunity to go after Apple for more than &euro;14 billion but says we cannot afford to continue with these payments.  We have to continue with them.  The cutbacks should be reversed.  People need this money to survive, and the country will be able to afford the payments if we go after the wealth with serious wealth taxes.</p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party, according to information we got at the weekend, now enjoys the support of one voter in ten in this country.  In 2011 it had a meltdown election in which it got 17% of the vote.  That is nearly double the support it has at the moment.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is headed towards the rocks, and if it wants to drive its ship right onto the rocks and wreck it, it can continue with policies such as this.  It will pay a price for it.</p></speech>

It is timely and if it was Deputy Boyd Barrett who asked for it, he was perfectly correct in doing so.  I cannot disagree with some of the points he made in his contribution.  I say to the Government, and generally to Members of the House, that we have to look at not just what is happening today but also the forecast for Covid over the next 12 months.  The decisions we take cannot be withdrawn as quickly as they might be in other circumstances.  They are decisions to support people.  The decision being made today is not correct.  I think people have an awful lot of negativity going on in their lives.  They deserve the support that they should get from a Government to ensure that their quality of life remains somewhat stable during a time of great instability.  This offers an opportunity to change and reform.  Telling the truth would be one of the changes or reforms I would suggest, as would abandoning the politics of spin because that is what we have got into.  Instead of talking about the broad spectrum of problems and the figures at macro level, we should look at the lives of people.  Let us look at what is happening out there.</p>  <p>  Kids cannot go to school on buses.  They are being left on the side of the road.  They cannot afford to pay the bus fares, or they have been late paying them, and we are doing nothing for them.  They will be deprived of days of education and we do not respond to it.  I say this knowing that good stuff was done in terms of Government and supports, but other stuff was not done or has not got down to impact the lives of people, as it should, or as quickly as it should.</p>  <p>  One could take nursing homes as an example.  During debate in the Covid-19 committee, we discovered the terrible abuse in nursing homes and the terrible lack of proper governance and care for elderly people, whom we all declare we support and acknowledge for the contribution they have made in this country.  We spoke of the meat plants and the terrible issues that exist there, yet the Government was slow in doing anything about those plants.  Then when it did something it was too little and too late, and now we have further clusters breaking out in various plants, including one in Waterford today.  We learned that the inspections were carried out with notice given.  Who notifies someone that they are going to come and audit them?  They just arrive and audit, if they are serious about their job.</p>  <p>  Children have been damaged in the course of this pandemic.  I refer in particular to children on the autistic spectrum who have gone through their assessments, have turned to the HSE for support and services and have been told it will take years because of the length of the list on which they find themselves.  Even though we are spending huge amounts of money on other parts of the economy, those who are marginalised and less well off and those who are on waiting lists are the ones who are suffering because they are being neglected and overlooked and the appropriate levels of funding are not being sent to the parts of the HSE where professionals are waiting to expand services.</p>  <p>  If we are serious about the bus industry, the coach industry, chauffeurs and the like, surely to God we should be setting out for them a pathway of support according to which they can plan and on which they can rely.  That is not being done in any realistic way.  Those who are over 66 and still working but on a pension have been treated very badly.  We all know this and have raised the issue here ,but again nothing has been done.  Travel agents have appealed to every one of us in this House for understanding and supports and have not got what they require to keep their doors open and keep jobs in many rural towns and villages.  Local authority funding has been dramatically affected by Covid.</p> <p>Incomes have dropped, commercial rates are not being paid and businesses are not performing.  They cannot because they have no customers or they are regulated in such a way that it is not worth their while opening.  These are the basic issues that need to be addressed.  We cannot claim success until we raise the boats of those who are marginalised and in need of State help.</p> <p> The other side is the expenditure side in terms of what we do in this House.  I have put down many parliamentary questions and I am talking about the truth.  They take a lot of money to process, to answer and to deal with.  That system has gotten worse.  The amount of nonsense information included in a reply in order to deflect from the question and not to answer it is truly shocking.  We pay civil servants to write these replies and send them out and the replies are next to useless.  We stand over it and accept it.  I do not accept it because it is a bad reflection on this House and it is a way of avoiding a serious issue that a Member might have when he puts down a parliamentary question which should provide an answer.</p> <p> We set up tribunals and inquiries and I have asked on numerous occasions to raise a question about these and to bring it in as a topical issue.  I have never been successful.  Yet the questions remain about Shane O'Farrell's murder on the road.  Why have the terms of reference not been agreed to allow that tribunal to go forward?  The name of John Barrett was mentioned here by the Minister for Justice and Equality and reference was made to a tribunal to find out what is happening in his case.  Nothing has been said to this House in relation to that tribunal.  Frank Mulcahy is a similar case.  To show the disregard that Government and politics have for those who are so marginalised that they have very poor representation, just look at what they are doing in the Grace case.  It is an utter scandal that people who were non-verbal, marginalised and sexually and physically abused should still be waiting on the result of that tribunal.  Yet the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, or the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte - I am not sure which - signed another extension of that tribunal.</p> <p> If we are going to do things right, we need to look to the first responsibility that a Government has, which is to keep its people safe.  For many years and many Governments, that has not been happening.  This House is used as a sounding board or relief valve for people to get up, including myself, and say whatever they want on a particular topic or an issue in their own constituencies.  One might as well be whistling past the graveyard, because the response from Ministers is generally one that is handed to them by a civil servant.  These Ministers were at one time in opposition and calling for all of this but in government this is their only answer.  I do not blame the civil servants.  I blame the political system for the manner in which it ignores the true value of this House and of the democracy that caused this House to be put in place and the Members elected to it.  Regardless of how many speeches are made about reform, controlling expenditure, a sensible spend and supporting people, it all falls on deaf ears.  I have yet to meet a Minister or Government that will proactively pursue an agenda of reform and control of expenditure that is worthwhile and that brings about resolution, reform and understanding of what the people we represent are going through.</p> <p> I have raised specific issues around businesses and the core of the problem is that, for the foreseeable future, the businesses that work, are profitable and pay taxes will be few and far between, except for the bigger ones.  We will have less of a tax take and, therefore, less to slice up to support those in society who need supports most.  We have to keep those businesses going.  We have to understand each sector and make sure they get paid and supported accordingly.  We have to make sure workers and their rights are acknowledged and supported.  We have to ensure that we invest now when that money is accessible in terms of rates and our credibility for raising money and so on, because we will not have the taxes.</p> <p> There are two Green Ministers here.  Whatever happens in this budget, they cannot say, for the sake of climate change and doing something about it, that they will put a tax on somebody and make their life worse.  I want to see change and reform.  I want to support a green agenda, renewal, green jobs and so on but, above all, I want to see politics change to the extent that those who cannot put the dinner on the table, those who have difficulty with their children and the elderly who find it hard to make ends meet no longer have to suffer.  Whatever cake is there to be divided up in the context of this budget, we must start with the less well-off and make sure they are okay so that by the time the Government has allocated its money, the only ones left are the ones that are okay or can be okay.  We need to deal with the waiting lists and provide the quality of life the people we represent deserve.  We need to deal with those issues.  If it deals with the minor issues, the ones that are causing the difficulty, then the Government will bring the people with it.  At the moment it      seems to be a Government for the few, while the rest suffer and are misunderstood in terms of their lives.</p> <p> We have to remember that not everybody marches to the same mad drumbeat.  There are those in society who like to take it easier and those who cannot or will not work.  We have to reflect all of what is in society in the decisions we make in the budget.  No more bluff or spin.  Tell the truth.</p></speech>

Increased spending of this nature was inevitable and justified by the need to invest in the public good.  The phrases I have used, "the need to invest" and "the public good", are two matters I will return to later.  Social protection and health were given particular attention and that is to be recognised and welcomed.  When faced with a pandemic such as this, it is obviously not possible to get everything right immediately.  I acknowledge that some of the shortcomings we in the Opposition have pointed out have been addressed to an extent, although not necessarily to the extent or level that we called for.</p>  <p>  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is one of the huge investments that the Government committed itself to.  It acted as a financial lifeline to many families who suddenly found their income virtually wiped out.  However, it had its issues. People over the age of 66 were ineligible, leaving many workers and business owners to fall through the cracks.  There were issues with the lack of appeals and there was confusion about means testing for families when a family member is in receipt of a Covid payment.  There were also questions about the decision to reduce the rate of the PUP and transition from the temporary wage subsidy scheme to the employee wage subsidy scheme, which saw already reduced incomes falling further.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>While I am on this topic, I will mention a problem faced by some workers in Aer Lingus.  They are having difficulty getting social welfare payments for the days they are not working because the company has been refusing to sign the social welfare dockets of many workers.  This became even more concerning when I learned that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was negotiating with the company on this matter.  I cannot understand why the Department is negotiating regarding a matter in which it is supposed to have primacy.  I hope this situation will be investigated, because I have met a brick wall in trying to get answers from the Department.  While this matter is ongoing, these workers continue to suffer and go without.</p> <p> Coming back to the matter at hand, the cuts in Covid-19 supports have caused people to be concerned at what lies ahead.  Some are fearful that the Government is going to claw back the additional spending through austerity measures.  My appeal to and my advice for the Government is to not go in this direction, but to invest in our people and their ideas instead.  The programme for Government commits to setting out a medium-term roadmap detailing how Ireland will reduce the deficit and return to a broadly-balanced budget.  Given the state of the country, the public needs to know how feasible an option this is and if it goes hand-in-hand with austerity.  I also remind the Government that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, stated that the deficit will fall over the next five years without the need for austerity.</p> <p> The economic and business landscape has changed since the onset of the pandemic.  Business models are now being adapted to the requirements and challenges being faced, and this will continue.  The business landscape with which we were familiar at the end of last year has changed for good.  Government policy must change with it, and this change needs investment to get it grounded.  At present, it is the business owners and their employees who are adapting to the current working climate.  They are the ones who will ultimately shape the future of our landscape of production and, therefore, it is crucial that they are front and centre in any sectoral task force created, such as those mentioned in the programme for Government.</p> <p> Investment must not be seen as a cost.  It does need resources and finances, but good investment is something that can work for us, increase the productive capacity of this country, improve people's lives and boost further growth.  With interest rates at a historic low, is there not an opportunity to borrow and invest in large capital infrastructure projects?  Could large infrastructural upgrades be undertaken, such as an upgraded transport corridor from the east to the west of the country, running through my county of Tipperary?  Projects such as these would enhance the infrastructural network outside of our main cities and increase connectivity between, for example, ports in the east and airports in the west.</p> <p> Proper investment could also revolutionise our farming sector and improve its resilience to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, Brexit and other unforeseen obstacles.  If interest rates should rise in the future, will the Government consider borrowing in excess of what is needed and warehousing the additional funds to address such an eventuality?  The Government also needs to learn from the chaotic response to supporting the hospitality sector, our taxi services and the arts and entertainment industry.  There needs to be sustained investment in the businesses that have suffered the most, and when I say "sustained", I mean investment that is tailored to specific situations, timelines and demands and not a single, one size-fits-all measure.</p> <p> One more matter needs attention.  The impact of the Covid-19 crisis on people is going to lead to a mental health crisis and a major demand in this area is coming down the line.  The Department of Health, therefore, will need to stop biding its time or there will be nothing left to invest in our mental health services.  The Department will need to step up and spend on mental health services and it should also think of investing in the many voluntary organisations, such as Connection and Recovery in Mental Health and Addiction, CARMHA, in Nenagh, which are addressing the current gaps in services.</p></speech>

I tabled a parliamentary question earlier in the week regarding an issue I raised in the House last week.  I refer to the anomaly in respect of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will know that when this was first mooted I argued strongly that we need to maintain the link between employees and employers.  The TWSS has been very successful in doing that.  I understand the reasoning in moving to the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, but the difficulty is that we have a cohort of businesses that are not trading, that are not open and if there was justification for the TWSS up to now, then that justification remains today.  It is okay for businesses that are trading and have some cash flow.  In that case, the argument can be made for the EWSS.  The TWSS, however, should remain in place for businesses that are forced to remain closed because of public health conditions.  Unless that scheme is available to those businesses, that link between employers and employees will now be broken.</p>  <p>  We have all received correspondence this week from people within the domestic live entertainment industry, a sector with approximately 35,000 employees.  They fall into this category, as have employees of public houses up to now.  I suspect that will remain the case for the foreseeable future regarding employees of public houses in the Dublin area.  They have not had any income coming in since, but have availed of the TWSS.  That is now gone, however, and the EWSS does not, in any way, help to support that link between the employer and the employee.  It is imperative, therefore, that the TWSS is reintroduced for businesses that the Government has stated must remain closed.</p>  <p>  When I am on the issue of the entertainment sector, the reality is that that sector is the lifeblood of the creative sector of our economy.  It is a vital part of our economy and a vital part of the tourism package throughout the country, including in my own part of it, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  If we are going to try to maintain support for the tourism sector, which is a vital part of our economy, it is imperative that we also support the entertainment sector.  It was the first sector to be shut down on 12 March.  </p>  <p>  What has been frustrating for many people in that sector is that they have been totally ignored until very recently.  The issues and challenges in that sector have not even been acknowledged.  Along with the TWSS, those who are, sadly, unemployed should be able to avail of the higher rate of PUP, that is the higher rate that has been available until this week, because they do not have the choice or the opportunity to go back working.  I know pressure has been applied by employers regarding rates of payment for the PUP, and there is a certain amount of justification for that.  Within this sector, however, there is no justification for the reduction in the rates of payment and this needs to be looked at again.</p>  <p>  Supports have been provided by the Arts Council to part of the creative sector, which is welcome.  That does not deal with the entertainment sector, however, because very few of the grants paid out by the Arts Council are paid to that sector.  A fund needs to be put in place specifically for those working in the entertainment sector.  Until recently, I would have argued in the same terms regarding the coach industry, which is another sector which has been ignored.  I was told some time ago that &euro;10 million was being provided to that sector, through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  However, no money has come down to that sector and the fear in the entertainment sector is that it is now going to be treated in the same way.</p>  <p>  We have major challenges to face in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and what is coming down the tracks with Brexit, but this also a great opportunity to do things differently.  When the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Ryan, was on this side of the House he was also articulating this point, while I was trying to implement that approach in Government.  Now that he has had a chance to look at some of the files in his Department, he will be able to see exactly what I had been trying to do.</p> <p>I will put to the Minister something on which I worked diligently when I was in his Department, namely, to have all Government services available online.  It is important that people have access to Government services in the context of Covid-19, the lockdown we saw earlier in the year and the further lockdowns that have occurred on a county basis and may affect Dublin later this week.  People should not have to rely on an office-based service which can be shut down.</p> <p> One problem with the so-called mechanism that is being used for online services at the moment is that there is a failure to acknowledge that a cohort of the population will never use technology and are thereby being excluded.  For example, all the motor tax offices were closed around the country as a result of the lockdown and the likelihood is that will happen again in Dublin from next week.  If one does not have an email address, one cannot get motor tax in this country at present.  A person who does not have the requisite IT literacy or does not want to use the online service should be able to go into their local post office where the postmaster or postmistress will do the transaction for them.</p> <p> A governmental decision was made and a commitment given to put offline Government business through the post office network but, sadly, that has not been implemented since I left office.  That is now on the desk of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  We need to go down that road because the mandatory introduction of the EU payments services directive 2 is coming down the track.  It will require strong customer authentication to be used in all electronic transactions.  Customer identification is going to become far more difficult.  We are dealing with those issues in many transactions, whether in Leinster House or with our banks, but those requirements add complexity for older people.  Authentication could surely be done through the local post office, providing people with access to a whole range of services to which they do not have access at the moment and must travel to queue in an office to access.  Many older people do not want to do that now because of Covid-19 but we are still one decision away from progressing the matter and having front-line service available through local post offices.  It has been talked about by every Member in this House when they have sat on the Opposition benches.  I know well the vested interests and arguments that are being made in Merrion Street against this.  I know those arguments and it will take a determined effort by the Minister to ensure that this happens.  If we are serious about having transactions online, encouraging people not to queue in offices and ensuring that people do not have to travel long distances to avail of services, we need to lead by example and put these services in place through the local post office network for people who cannot avail of them online because they do not happen to have an email address or use a smart phone in tandem with their email address as may be a necessity in the not-too-distant future.  Those people should not be excluded from online services and the additional discounts that are available to people who apply through an online portal for electricity, broadband and phone contracts.  The mechanism is there and I know that the management of An Post is willing to meet the Minister more than halfway in that regard.</p> <p> The other side of it is that because more people are now moving to electronic payments, the income for postmasters and postmistresses has dramatically fallen.  Any postal worker who has been unfortunate enough to have had his or her income reviewed since Covid-19 is assessed on the basis of current transactions which have fallen off a cliff.  Many of the smaller rural post offices to which the previous Government committed to support in 2018 and 2017 are no longer viable.  We have not put in the additional services that we promised.  That was a key part of the agreement between the Government, An Post and the postmasters.  The Government has reneged on that aspect of the agreement.</p> <p> I finally raise with the Minister the retrofitting of homes.  I compliment An Post on the action it has taken on the green hub to establish a one-stop shop for people who want to avail of grants and supports for retrofitting their homes.  An Post can put people in contact with a contractor, look at what needs to be done with a house and put the finance in place for them.  The interest rate is approximately 4.9% but we should be looking to put a 0% interest rate in place.  Money is available through the European Investment Bank and other European avenues can provide funding.  None of the other financial institutions has bothered going down this road and An Post should be supported to do so.  People who want to carry out the retrofitting of their homes should not be penalised and ought to have direct access to zero-interest loans and grants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700028#DD00200"><p>Seo an ch&eacute;ad uair go bhfuil m&eacute; sa Seomra agus an Leas-Cheann Comhairle sa Chathaoir.  Gu&iacute;m comhghairdeas agus gach rath di ar a post nua.  This is a timely debate and I have been listening to many of the contributions from my office.  It is now six months since the first phase of the first lockdown.  We are coming up to the preparation of the budget.  This morning's report from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is useful in considering the direction of public expenditure around Covid and what we need to do in budget 2021, particularly the provision of income supports for people and businesses to allow business owners to maintain businesses, employment levels and a connection between employers and employees as we move on.</p>  <p>  The various schemes that were introduced are a tribute to our public service because they were introduced very quickly and many people got assistance overnight through hard work, often done remotely at home and without the back-up of facilities.  That happened in many Departments, but particularly in the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protections, Health, and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  People in those Departments worked incredibly hard to give that assistance and are deserving of thanks and praise.</p>  <p>  We must now take stock, look at those supports and make sure that they are relevant and flexible, particularly for business.  As market and employment conditions are changing - in some cases on a weekly basis as we move into different lockdown rules - it is important that businesses can respond using the employment subsidy scheme and that Revenue will respond to them.  Revenue has been helpful in the information it has provided but we need to make sure that helpfulness and the adaptability of the scheme continue as we move into different phases of the management of Covid.</p>  <p>  There are similar requirements for income supports.  Different areas are under different pressures and some people do not have a chance to go back to work.  There should be some element of flexibility around their payments.  Many Deputies have spoken about this and we have all received emails and had interactions with members of the artistic, cultural and entertainment community who will, more than likely, not be able to make any money until well into next year.  They have responded to the difficulties they face with innovation and creativity through online performances but those will not realistically provide the kind of income those people need.</p> <p>Flexibility is needed for members of that community as they struggle on because we will need them.  In fact, we need them now.  Their performances have supported and lifted us in many and various ways and we will need that as we proceed forward.</p> <p> Various other businesses are also subject to similar restrictions.  We must ensure that the decisions we make and the supports we put in place will maintain economies and businesses until we have a vaccine for Covid.  We all love our tourism industry when it is going well, but we need to ensure that the decisions taken now will keep its infrastructure in place.  I refer to accommodation, coaches and buses, and visitor attractions throughout the country.  If we do not support those in the industry now, they will not be there when tourism returns to normality in 2021 or 2022 and we will be scrambling to put the infrastructure back in place.</p> <p> Equally, however, it is time to look differently at such infrastructure and to make capital investments.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to establishing gateways, walkways, cycleways and so on not just as facilities for tourism but as facilities for day-to-day living in our towns and cities, which we now have to reimagine.  Our towns and cities have grown shabby because resources have not been available to expend on them.  Many community groups have stepped into the breach to try to keep them going, but let us use this time to reimagine them.  Let us make them accessible, let us develop greenways and cycleways and let us make them disability-friendly and sensory-friendly.  Let us make the kind of capital investments now that will sustain local employment in companies that carry out that kind of work while also giving us town centres, city centres and communities that are attractive to be part of, to do business in, to visit and to spend time in.  This is the time to reimagine how we do that kind of thing.</p> <p> We need to look at our airports in a similar way.  As an island nation, our airports are incredibly important to us but the decimation of international aviation has left them on a precipice.  In addition to the State airports are the regional airports, such as Ireland West Airport Knock and others, which are essential to the economy and to social interaction.  These airports need support to ensure their infrastructure will still be there as we rebuild our country and society.  In his role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I ask Deputy Ryan to engage with airports and not to forget the non-DAA airports.  These are also an essential part of our infrastructure and deserve the same support.</p> <p> The programme for Government includes an opportunity to review the national development plan.  This should be looked at in a post-Covid environment but also, as was intended during programme for Government negotiations, through the prism of a new, climate-friendly environment.  We should look at projects that will allow society to adapt not only to the context of Covid but also to new ways of living to reduce our own emissions and those of our society and communities.  That will involve building up the regional economy to take pressure off our societies and looking at the mindset that has evolved over the past six months as regards regional, home-based working or remote working.  I hate to use the phrase "remote working" because, while it is a technical phrase, it seems to downgrade the work done.  This work is still as important as it was even if it can be done from home.  Many people and employers now see that it is a productive way to do work.</p> <p> We need to facilitate communities in this regard.  We need to facilitate rural communities by getting broadband connection points up and running quickly and by providing workspaces in rural areas so that people will have the option to leave their homes and go to a centre to benefit from the collegiality of work without leaving their communities.  Many people would take the opportunity to relocate to areas to which they may not have been able to relocate before now that has arisen because of the change of attitudes regarding remote working and the increased appreciation of its productivity.  We need, however, to put infrastructure in place to support it.  We need to make that investment.</p> <p> Throughout the crisis, we have seen substantial extra investment in areas such as health and education.  The fact that this year's winter plan is worth &euro;600 million compared with &euro;27 million last year gives an indication of the pressure under which our health service is now and will be over the coming weeks.  We must ensure this money is invested in community-based services in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Our community GPs must be empowered to make bigger decisions and given the resources they need.  They must also be given out-of-hours support because many rural GPs do not have appropriate out-of-hours support and are considerably overworked.  This makes it more difficult to fill GP posts.</p> <p> We also have a fantastic network of district hospitals which are completely underused.  They should be used more and extra beds should be opened to reduce the pressure on our acute hospitals.  There are beds in Ballina, Belmullet and Swinford that could be opened and staffed to take the pressure off Mayo University Hospital.  Basic services such as X-rays, physiotherapy and mental health consultations could be provided at district level so that people would not be required to travel in to Mayo University Hospital or University Hospital Galway.  It would take the pressure off these hospitals.  They should be focused.</p> <p> Our disability day services and mental health services are still not properly up and running again.  I was concerned to see that, when people had to be put into contact tracing urgently, people working in the therapies were used to fill those roles, which again adds to the waiting lists which have built up because of the shutdown.  It seemed incredibly strange to use therapists to fill those roles when there is no shortage of administrative staff in the area.  This has added to the misery of patients who are on waiting lists and we cannot allow it to happen again.  We have to invest in those services, in dealing with those waiting lists, and in putting extra people in place.  Let us take the opportunity provided by this increased investment to do so.</p> <p> In education, it is a great tribute to school communities, to the Minister, Deputy Foley, and to her officials that our schools are back up and running.  One thing that struck me about the entire response, not just in education but across the system, is that things we were told could not be done at this time last year could be done.  With regard to education, we were told assistants could not be provided to help schools reopen, but we now have them.  There has been considerable investment in cleaning and sanitation right across this space.  Let us never again accept that something cannot be done because of rules.  When we apply imagination and urgency in the public interest, those rules get changed.  We have learned a lot about that from Covid.  We need to take time to take stock of where that can be done.</p> <p> We have to guarantee that our education communities will maintain the same access to PPE resources and cleaning and sanitation equipment as they have at the moment.  We need to make sure they retain the teaching and administration supports they were given to get them open in order to keep them open.  We also still have an issue with regard to school transport.  Even though substantial investments have been made, these have not resolved the challenge presented by the 50% capacity guidelines at secondary school level.  Many families are greatly inconvenienced as a consequence and are unable to get back to work and to participating in their communities.  Until we resolve that, we will not be able to get our education system fully back up and running.</p> <p> The forthcoming budget will give us a chance to look at the next 12 months and their consequences, but we also need to be ambitious with regard to the national economic plan and the national development plan.  We need to look at capital programmes that will create a basis for our economic and societal recovery and at bringing forward investments in important road projects.  In my region, such projects include the N26, the N5 and the R312.  These are not luxury projects but they connect communities, make our lives easier and allow industry to flourish.</p> <p> There are also non-road projects to be looked at.  We need to move and to give people opportunities through initiatives such as the western rail corridor.  The Minister has been very generous with his time in discussing this project with us and he knows its value.  It will be transformative for the west as regards rail access for passengers and freight and linking us with our regional capital of Galway for medical and educational appointments.  It will also allow us to reimagine how freight is transported in and out of the west.  This key project will send a signal as to the ambition of this country and show that we are rebalancing and using the Atlantic economic corridor to do so.</p> <p> Many issues have arisen in the past six months which have changed the way we do things for the better.  There are still things on which we are dragging along and which we are not doing properly, but more of this kind of debate will give us the chance to look at this while we get our committee system up and running.  I wish both Ministers well as we proceed towards the budget and the review of the national development plan.</p></speech>

It is on the events industry and the arts in general.  It is not good enough to have a deep appreciation for the arts and culture sectors, artists, dancers, actors, musicians and the like as well as the live events industry.  All were shut down overnight in March and they still have no date to recommence.  It is our job as legislators to protect them and help them chart a way out of the chaos they are in now and that they will face for several months to come.  It is not foreseen that most of the venues in this part of Ireland will open in the coming six months.  It will be a major job to address the plight of the 35,000 who work in the live events industry as well as the many artists and those who are dependent on live events.  Musicians up and down the country are now in such dire straits that they are contemplating selling their musical instruments.  They are scraping by and living in sheds or cars.  These are the people we need to have a shout-out for.  We need the pandemic unemployment payment retained at the maximum for every one of these people.  We also need the temporary work support scheme to be reintroduced.  The Government changed it to the employment wage subsidy scheme.  This needs to be fixed now to ensure this industry or sector of our society is fully protected.  It will enable us to rely on them in the future to lighten up our hearts.  Many of them have been doing that during the pandemic but we want to see live events in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1476" speakername="Paul Donnelly" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700030#FF00200"><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on our country, North and South.  In fact, I believe it has changed all our lives in some way and I do not believe it will ever be the same again.  We must never act in the same way.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 virus does not distinguish between rich and poor but the health outcomes for rich and poor can be seen in the statistics throughout the world.  Our society must never act in a way that leaves one citizen behind.  We must do what we must and be bold at this time.</p>  <p>  I wish to recognise the positive and constructive response from the Government around issues and anomalies that we have highlighted relating to various income and business supports.  The Government has addressed some of them.  However, as has been mentioned by previous Deputies, it is disappointing that only yesterday some of the pandemic unemployment payments were cut.  This is regrettable and should be reversed.</p>  <p>  I am keen to focus on one main point.  It is acknowledged that Governments throughout the EU, including Ireland, have abandoned the fiscal rules.  Is it feasible or desirable to commit to a balanced budget in 2021?  Would it not be better to run a deficit of 2% in the medium term to allow for an increase in purchasing power within the economy?  Investment in infrastructure now is not costly.  Surely we have learned from the disgraceful austerity years following 2008 that the approach in that period is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  I will offer some examples of schemes that we could borrow for now to boost the economy, get people back to work and build decent community infrastructure.  Dublin West is experiencing another population boom but we do not have enough schools to keep up with the growing school population.  For years, parents have had to wait for schools and fight for them.  My daughter is a teacher in St. Patrick's national school in Diswellstown.  The school has a major issue with pyrite.  For years, those involved have been campaigning to get it remedied.  We can do that now.  We can borrow to get that job done now.  We have land ready to go for more than 800 houses in Churchfields in Fingal.  We could build there tomorrow.  That is ready to go.  A scheme has already started there that will provide genuinely affordable housing.  We do not have a single public swimming pool in Fingal.  It is an absolute disgrace that in 2020 we do not have a single public swimming pool.</p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that we are borrowing at extraordinarily low interest rates.  In fact, they are paying us to borrow money.  Surely, this is the time to invest in our community infrastructure, schools, hospitals, roads and public transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700030#FF00300"><p>I am sharing time with my two colleagues, who have two minutes each.  The entertainment industry, which has a wide embrace, is extraordinarily important to our health and well-being.  It is important not only to the entertainers and their families, who are dependent on them, but to us, the recipients, including many people who are bedbound, housebound, invalided or disabled.  They love to be entertained by these people.  These men and women give of their talents generously.  They do all manner of fundraising gigs for many communities.  They have to be supported.</p>  <p>  The pandemic unemployment payment must be kept.  It was cut yesterday but it must be retained for these people.  A total of &euro;6 million has been granted, including &euro;1 million for the arts sector.  The people I am talking about include those in showbands, one man bands, one woman bands and those working in the pub scene.  They have an industry around them.  They need vans, equipment, back-up sound and light and everything else.  From the talks I have had with them, I understand they have been in talks with Government.  The Government and the Department simply do not understand the system or what these people need.  They need cash flow to try to stay alive and keep food on the table.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned, entertainment and community groups do excellent work.  Muintir na T&iacute;re was first founded in Tipperary.  It has an excellent secretary there in Marian O'Dwyer.  It has done great work.  It got an old school building after the technical school closed in the 1970s.  It has transformed it into a fabulous community centre and hub.  It has now received approval for a grant of &euro;139,000 for upgrades and special rooms to cater for different events.  Technological events have been set up as well.  The problem is that 20% was to be repaid by the community group, Newcastle Muintir na T&iacute;re.  It had no bother doing that.  It was delighted to get the 80% grant but it cannot now fundraise in any shape, make or form.  The grant is lying there and cannot be drawn down.  We must do something for cases like this.  There are many communities like this throughout the country.  They are ready, willing and able.  They are the enablers.  They give our community the dynamic to keep going.  They look after the community alert system, all the funeral parties and concerts.  The McGrath school does dancing there.  There is all manner of keep-fit classes and everything.  It is largely booked up.  I salute the caretaker, Catherine Moran, who does a wonderful job there.</p>  <p>  The problem is the organisation cannot raise &euro;20,000 in these circumstances.  Maybe we should give it to it and ask it to pay it back when things recover and it is able to fundraise.  We need to think outside the box and allow it to carry on developing.  It will stimulate the local economy.  There will be a contractor and the plasterers, block-layers, electricians and everyone else will have work.  The local hardware shops will do business.  We must think outside the box and allow it to do the works on this building.  It can fundraise when it is allowed and when we are back singing, dancing and having fun - when there is hope again in our country.  We do not have that anymore.</p>  <p>  I mentioned mental health earlier.  The amount of damage that has been done to mental health is shocking because of the gloom and doom on RT&Eacute; morning, noon and night.  Can we not cut off these figures?  I know from a journalist already about expected happenings in Dublin.  It is annoying and terrorising people.  There is fear.  Instead of giving hope and support we must have the spirit of the Meitheal.  It is like the spirit of the late great Canon Hayes, who founded Muintir na T&iacute;re.  We never needed it more.</p>  <p>  We have this dysfunctional Government.  Thankfully, the Green Party has been left out of it today but the other two are Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  I do not know who is "dum" and who is "dee" but the public know what is going on and they are not happy.  They are willing and ready to do battle and to do what they are asked to do, but there is confusion.  What does the Government do?  It hires a big public relations company, Teneo.  If the Government brought that company in for the disaster this week, it should close the door again fast, whatever kind of contract there is.  The people do not want spin.  They want those in the Government to be seen to roll up their sleeves and do the work like people in the meitheal did.  They worked with the people and stood with the people and supported them.  That is badly needed.</p> <p> The banks are not working.  Banks are sending letters to the publicans already, in anticipation of the opening next Monday, to look for the waivers that were given in terms of the delay.  Other EU countries have brought in legislation to deal with the banks.  We do not have a scintilla of legislation to deal with these banks.  I said it here previously; the bank robbers now are within the banks.  They are not coming in with the guns.  They are inside banks and robbing the people from the inside.  I backed legislation to support the banks on that long, terrible night we spent in this House.  It was the biggest mistake politically I ever made in my life, but what did the banks do?  Pardon the expression but they are screwing every one of us.  They are sending out letters now to struggling publicans and those in other businesses who are trying to get up off the ground, dust themselves down and get going ahead.  That is wrong because they want to come in straight away with the first demand, and I am sure the Revenue will not be far behind them.  We have to have legislation to deal with the banks because that practice is not acceptable.  We must deal with them.</p> <p> The self-employed are the backbone of the country and they must be supported because they are the people, whether it be the small bus owner who got nothing from Bus &Eacute;ireann because he or she was not contracted to it, the van driver, the ready-mix driver or the one-man cattle operation.  They are all parked up because they did not pay rates and could not get anything because they did not operate from a yard.  They must be looked after.  We must think outside the box.  The system is unable to adjust to all of this.</p> <p> Mo focal scoir.  I ask the Minister of State, please, to try to change the system.  I salute the civil servants who work so hard here and officials in my county council also, but we need to be able to adapt.  It should not be all about form filling, regulations, accounts from last year and the year before and whatever.  This is a different time.  All people want is to put bread on the table, clothe their children and be able to get back out into the spirit of work again, particularly the people in the entertainment industry because they give us all a lift and raise our spirits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700031#GG00200"><p>I will concentrate on the tourism, entertainment and community and voluntary sectors in my contribution.  The tourism sector is hugely important for my constituency of Cork South-West.  The increase in VAT rates from 9% to 13.5%, which happened pre-Covid, had devastating consequences for the tourism industry.  It was a serious error made by the Government which it could have rectified, as the UK Government did, and in terms of other models used in Europe where the rates went down to 5%.  The Government had an opportunity to do that.  Areas like Kinsale, Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry, Mizen Head, Bere, Rosscarbery and Sheep's Head depend totally on tourism.  If the Government had lowered the tourism VAT rate to at least 5%, it would have given those in the industry an opportunity for survival.  Instead, they will have nothing to live on from now until next March or April when they might have some chance of a little bit of tourism.  However, in the situation we are in now, it was a terrible mistake made by our Government not to do that.</p>  <p>  We should look at the model in Northern Ireland.  We tend to look across Europe as being the place to give us advice.  We saw that the Taoiseach took advice from Europe recently and signed a statutory instrument for a penalty points system for our fishermen.  In terms of the model in Northern Ireland, on the last two occasions I had a bus going to Belfast I could not book a bed in the Europa Hotel, which has 800 or 900 beds, because they are flat out busy.  They are working because if a person buys a meal or stays in the hotel, he or she gets back &pound;50 on every &pound;100 spent.  We have nothing like that here.  I think the standard VAT rate went from 23% to 20%, which is nine cent off a pint.  That is what we did in Ireland.  Well done.  That will not keep our economy going or save our tourism sector in west Cork.</p>  <p>  The people in the entertainment industry are on their knees.  They cannot even insure or tax their cars.  These musicians who served our people and gave us comfort and joy through the years have been treated miserably.  I would like the Minister of State to intervene in that situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700031#GG00300"><p>What is Irish culture?  Irish culture was music, dance, entertainment and drama.  Five million euro will be handed out for musicians, but will that look after the entire segment of the industry?  The Government is more interested in giving out a big lump of money to one agency than giving smaller payments to help people.  People in the music industry contacted the Rural Independent Group today.  I had a person on to me who could not afford to tax their vehicle.</p>  <p>  Why not bring out something that will allow those people, even with the local pubs, which are opening up, to work?  Music makes the people happy.  It puts them into a good frame of mind and it is positive thinking.  That industry has been closed since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and they see no outlet for them.  It is about Irish culture and people providing entertainment, whether it is online or whatever.  They should be given funding to allow them play their music online.  Give them subsidies to allow them provide entertainment for people.  That is what we want.  We do not want one sector getting all the money and the one-person band, male and female, getting nothing.  I do not want this money going to all the big people in the industry.  I want it spread across the industry equally to ensure all of them get their fair share.  In that way, Irish culture will be giving and they will be giving back.  They need the Government's help and for that to be done in a positive way, but everyone needs to get a piece of the pie.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has to be continued to allow them keep food on their tables.</p></speech>

The Exchequer returns demonstrated very clearly the huge public expenditure that has been necessarily incurred due to the pandemic.  There were much-needed and very welcome additional supports for the health sector, social protection and for business, and like previous speakers, I want to see those supports continue.  They are necessary to support public health, people who have lost their income and business through a very uncertain time.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks in particular, nervousness has increased among the business community and in sectors that had closed down or partially closed down.  I refer to people who had hoped to reopen to scale up their businesses again.  Our statutory agencies and the Department with responsibility for business must be very conscious of the concerns among the business community, and those supports need to continue.</p>  <p>  The substantial additional expenditure for education was very welcome also in ensuring that the 1 million children and young adults got back to education at preschool, primary, post-primary, further education and third levels.  We hope to see that continue.</p>  <p>  The July jobs stimulus package was necessary and impactive in a number of areas.  To take the area of housing, there was additional activity and substantial funding for the voids programme, which is necessary to ensure that houses lying vacant in the council housing stock are brought back to habitable use.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has stated that budget 2021 will be set in the context of Covid-19 and Brexit.  He outlined the necessity, which all of us in this House want to see, to protect and improve services, where possible.</p>  <p>  I should have 13 minutes remaining on the clock but it did not start at-----</p></speech>

The Minister also spoke about the national recovery fund and the national recovery plan.  The Government must ensure that there is a clear emphasis in those plans on the need for regional balance.  The pandemic has demonstrated, and my colleague, Deputy Calleary, referred to it earlier, that services do not have to be provided from our capital city or from major urban conurbation centres.  Some of the key services for the public were delivered by people living in very remote areas.  An issue I have discussed with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is the urgent need to ensure that our broadband infrastructure is rolled out as rapidly as possible.  We know that inadequate broadband provision in many communities has made it extremely difficult for people to work from home or students to learn at home.  The phrase "blended learning" will be difficult for some students who are living in areas where the broadband infrastructure is not up to the required standard.</p>  <p>  I mentioned that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, spoke about budget 2021 in the context of the pandemic and Brexit.  Since 2015, a year before the British referendum, I spoke in numerous committees of this House about the disastrous impact Brexit would have on our country.  Since 1992, I have had the privilege of representing two Border counties, namely, Cavan and Monaghan.  It is an area that stretches practically from the west coast, from Blacklion in Cavan, near Bundoran on the Atlantic, to Inniskeen near Dundalk on the east coast.  We have a huge land border with Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The result of the Brexit referendum knocked the stuffing out of communities along the Border.  I had the privilege of representing those communities in the bad days prior to the peace process and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and I saw the huge improvement brought about as a result of the signing of that agreement.  We have to ensure there will be no diminution in the workings of the agreement.  It is so disheartening to see once again the nonsense in British politics, led by Mr. Johnson and his Tory Party.  It is heartening to hear the likes of Mr. Hilary Benn, MP, and some other UK Members of Parliament who understand Ireland.  Deputy Sherlock and I would have met them at various committee meetings over the past few years.  I pay tribute to those who have championed Irish interests and who understand the difficulties Ireland will face if there is a no-deal Brexit.  We sincerely hope Britain steps back from the brink.</p> <p> I understand the position very well. I represent communities that very much depend on their neighbours north of the Border.  Thankfully, since 1998 businesses that had no base in Northern Ireland now have bases on both sides of the Border.  Our economies have become so interdependent that it is extremely important that there be no interruption to the way we go about our business.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade must ensure this message is hammered home to the British day in, day out.</p> <p> I welcome again the commitments of senior political figures in the United States regarding the attitude they will take to a possible trade deal with Britain if there is damage done to the Good Friday Agreement.  We have to ensure that message is given to the British every hour of the day because what is happening is not acceptable.</p> <p> I referred to the need for greater regional balance.  It is disheartening that it has taken so long to roll out proper broadband and telecommunications infrastructure throughout the country.  People dealing with Eir find it absolutely frustrating.  I would love the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to talk to the company and ask it to give a proper service to its customers.  They are paying dearly for its services.</p> <p> Deputy Calleary spoke about the need to upgrade our regional and local roads.  In the area I represent, Cavan&ndash;Monaghan, most of the many small indigenous businesses, particularly in the food, engineering and construction areas, are sited along local and regional roads.  A minute amount of our road network is of a national primary or national secondary character.  I sincerely hope that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, in his negotiations at Government level for resources for transport in 2021, will ensure the needs of the non-national network are prioritised in addition to the needs of the national network.  If we are to have regional balance and balanced regional economic development, we must ensure the infrastructure of rural counties is subject to investment at this time.  The pandemic has demonstrated very clearly that everybody does not have to go to Dublin, Galway, Limerick or Cork to work.  So much can be done from home and from digital hubs in our towns, including county towns and smaller towns.  If, however, we are to keep people working in our smaller towns and villages, an upgrade to infrastructure is necessary.  A small investment will go so far towards ensuring towns have the infrastructure to ensure people can work from home.</p> <p> Just as I did here in April and May, I compliment the officials of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in particular, and all the staff in the HSE and the front-line workers, be they in the public sector or private sector, who have done such a good job since early March working in very challenging and difficult circumstances.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was exceptional in getting payments out to people who needed them.  When I contacted officials in local offices late in the evening and over weekends, just as my constituency staff did Saturday after Saturday and late evening after late evening, I noted there was always a person to take a call, return an email or contact constituents who needed a payment or individuals who needed to be reassured there would be a payment on the way to their post office or bank without delay.  So many of us came across a constituent who rang us asking about the location of the social welfare office in their county town.  They said they never had a reason to go to it but now had one.  Many hundreds of thousands of people were accessing social welfare services who did not do so in the past.  They experienced the utmost in courtesy, co-operation and help from officials in the Department.  It is important to record again our appreciation for the work of public servants in our Civil Service and the public service in general, including, of course, all front-line workers, who continue to give a great service to our public.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to speak in this debate.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  He will not be a stranger to the benefits that the music, culture and arts communities bring to society.  This point is self-evident; it is a truth.  It would be very useful if the Government were to consider restoring the pandemic unemployment payment to the thousands of people whom we have heard from in the past 24 to 48 hours.  We would be doing them a great service if we were to recognise their talents and the fact that they are going to be last back into the fray.  I join in the calls from other Members to ask for the restoration of the pandemic unemployment payment.  It would have a tremendous impact in terms of keeping people above the threshold.  Many of them have fallen through the floor. We know of households that had two incomes arising from involvement in the music or arts sectors, or from production, lighting or theatre companies.  There are those whose mortgages are now put in abeyance, and they have experienced a serious loss of income.  If this could be re-examined, we would all welcome it.</p>  <p>  It is important when we examine the issue of stimulus in general that we do not take our eye off the ball in respect of capital projects, particularly schools projects.  In my constituency, Cork East, there are two projects of note, one concerning the Patrician Academy in Mallow and another concerning the Carrigtwohill schools campus, under the auspices of the education and training board.  We learned today that the tender process for the Carrigtwohill project is not expected to start until the first quarter of 2021.  We recognise that there were delays but there has been a significant delay in this project in very general terms.  It was announced in 2012 so this has been going on for quite some time now.  The Government is accountable, no more than we were when we were in government.  In light of the delay with the planning application, and given that we now hear there are to be further deliberations on the local road infrastructure, could the Government, as the key stakeholder and the body that will ultimately be issuing the cheques, take the lead in engaging with the third-party developer, the local authority, the education and training board and the local community, which has demonstrated some forbearance regarding this issue, with a view to pressing ahead with the vital project?  The knock-on effect of missing a quarter regarding progress is that more prefabs will be needed on the school campus come September 2021.</p>  <p>  I raise this issue in the context of this debate because it concerns a stimulus project.  It has the potential to create hundreds of construction jobs.  It is pertinent to the debate we are having today about not taking the foot off the pedal regarding capital expenditure when there is a deficit of the kind in question.  There is a borrowing requirement.  We can more than adequately proceed with these projects given our borrowing potential.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>With regard to roads like the N72, N73 and the Fota Road, I speak unashamedly about my own constituency in the context of this debate because it has the potential to create jobs.</p></speech>

He is at a meeting but is on his way.  I welcome the opportunity to take part of this debate.  I am aware Ministers are under pressure.  I wish, however, the other Minister was here because I particularly want to come back to public transport and housing in Galway.</p>  <p>  The Government did well, initially.  It responded well and did the right thing with payments and the various grants and supports that were given.  I am on record on that.  I am worried, however, that what has happened since is that solidarity is gone and the message going out is slightly different.  Excellent language has been used like saying we can never go back to where we were, we must go forward and we must take a new approach.  I wish I could believe that and see the actions based on that.  The Minister of State would then have my full support because we need transformative action.  We cannot go back to the way we were.  We need to have a completely different vision.  I do not need to give anybody lecture.  The Minister of State knows as well as I do that we are facing climate change, a biodiversity catastrophe and a public housing crisis.  </p>  <p>  I have the privileged life of staying in a hotel and I walk by the Gaiety Theatre, which is closed.  However, the real-life drama is outside where, on any given day, eight to ten people are outside asleep in sleeping bags, if they are lucky.  That shows the type of economy we have allowed to develop up to now.  I agree with Social Justice Ireland which said we must look beyond growth and take a new approach to economic policy that recognises the equal importance of social and environmental issues.  We certainly did not do that to date as a society.  Governments elected by the majority of people did not do that.  Each of us has a responsibility for what has happened in this country but it is time to seize the opportunity and have transformative action.  I say that in a week where the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, told us that we should borrow and spend.  We begged it to tell us that for the past five years.  Suddenly, it is telling us now to borrow and spend on public services and housing, and I welcome that.  I wish the message would come across, without any manipulation or spin, that this Government is intent on building public housing on public land.  I see the spin with regard to Galway.  We have a housing task force, although I am not sure what it is doing.  I have tried to pursue it and get the minutes.  It is, however, tolerating a situation where people have been on a waiting list since 2002 without a hope of getting public housing.  That is just one aspect.  Parallel to that, we have public land where there are plans to develop housing that is not public housing.  I have a serious concern about that.</p>  <p>  I also come from a city, and Deputy Farrell is in the Chamber.  We learned this week that there are plans to close the one municipal swimming pool.  I heard another Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy talk about the absence of a pool; we have one.  The headline today is that it is in dire danger of closing because of a lack of funding.  Can anyone imagine that?  We are talking about Monopoly money in this Chamber.  We are talking about billions of euro but the city council in Galway, through its management, sees fit to say it has no choice - it looks like it, although it has not been confirmed - to close a public swimming pool at a time where obesity is at an all-time record high.  What kind of lack of vision is that?  What kind of absence of a process is there that a local authority does not have an open door?  Perhaps it does.  I do not know where the fault lies with Government.  How could we tolerate such a headline?  The one public swimming we have and that was closed because of Covid-19 has been reopened for the past number of weeks.  I use it on a regular basis.  The staff are wonderful, the facility is wonderful and here is the headline.  Will the Minister of State even take that much from what I say today?  I do not want to give out.  I want to be part of the solution.  We have a vision for the solution, that is, a sustainable development which will be just and fair and not based on cities.  Cities need sustainable development but our towns and villages also need to be developed.  Earlier today, I raised the pilot project and the six towns that were picked.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is familiar with that.  It seemed to be a wonderful idea whereby six towns were picked by the then Minister with responsibility for rural and community development, Deputy Ring.  It took an extraordinarily long time to do it from 17 towns when it was conceived.  The birth came much later and six towns got up to &euro;100,000 each.  I raised it this morning with the Minister.  I do not know the cost of it but it looks like a report that analysed the difficulties is simply going to be ignored.  That scheme was brought in as an example with the view to escalating it to all other towns in the country that needed it and, of course, the glaring absences were towns from the Gaeltacht.  No town from the Gaeltacht featured among those six towns.  The former Minister was good and said next time he would look at that.  Of course, Deputy Ring is gone and there is a new Minister with responsibility for rural and community development.  I do not know what has happened but it looks like that report is going to be shredded.  I have a big difficulty with that.</p>  <p>  Galway city had a second blow this week in an Tulach, i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta ar&iacute;s.  D&uacute;radh le 20 fostaithe go raibh deireach lena gcuid oibre.  Some 20 employees were let go in Planet Payment which is now known as Fintrax.  That is on top of another loss the previous year.  There is a trend here and a lack of analysis from the Government regarding the impact of Covid-19 on a local, rural and regional basis.  There is a glaring absence here and the regional assembly, for example, which is not an extremely radical organisation, produced a report a few months ago to show that the north west, the west and the north had been disproportionately affected by Covid-19.  </p>  <p>  When we talk about spending Monopoly money, that is, billions of euro, we must do it in a way that is sustainable and that justifies that level of borrowing.  We are building a future that is sustainable and taking seriously the climate emergency we declared following so many initiatives from Kyoto onwards and from the sustainable goals.  If we do not do that, it makes a mockery of all the suffering and the mantra that we were all in it together.  </p>  <p>  I mentioned Galway twice already.  I will mention it a third and fourth time because of travel agents and the effect on people in the live events sector, which has been mentioned many times by colleagues here.  In terms of the travel agents, again, this issue has been raised often and we have had no response.  I understand the aviation sector is in serious trouble but surely a package can be thought up.  For example, if we look at Galway, I will mention a travel agency because it is the last existing travel agency there.  Fahy Travel has given a fantastic service to everyone in Galway like the other travel agencies that did not last.  This one lasted, and when it had no money the staff stayed and worked for very little.  Some staff got the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other staff stayed on to give back money to the people who had booked holidays, and so forth.  They did that in the spirit of "We are all in this together".  All they are asking for is recognition that they are in trouble through no fault of their own and that the Government respond and give targeted responses to the people who are in trouble.</p>  <p>  I will finish on a personal note in order to bring this home.  We talk about the need for transformative action.  On Monday, I sat in my office, as many Deputies do.  I will not go into too many details but a woman sat in my office and I did not know what to say.  After my fifth year as a Deputy, I am still listening to stories about the absence of proper hours for carers.  I am trying to avoid identifying the people but her husband suffers from Alzheimer's disease and senility at a very young age.  That family is struggling gallantly with the minimum of hours for which they are supposed to be grateful rather than having it as a right.  There is absolutely no respite care.  They have struggled through Covid-19.  That person should not have to be in my office.  We should have a statutory entitlement to home care as a right.</p> <p>That family is saving the State a fortune.  The difficulty is that the family will go under, I imagine, before the person who has the diagnosis of dementia, such is the strain without help.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister of State to work with us.  I would be on his side on climate change and public housing, if he made the language mean something.  However, when I hear the term &quot;public housing&quot; it is never that; it is always a mixture with the developers.  I ask him to work with us and let us have true transformative action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700034#KK00200"><p>I thank all the Deputies who made constructive comments and suggestions about public expenditure during this debate.  It has obviously been a very difficult year.  Deputy Naughten suggested that An Post should be able to deliver public services in the same way that it delivers its traditional services, which is a position that I think everybody supports.  An Post and its workers shone during the pandemic.  It showed itself to be a vital public service.  It continues to deliver not just letters and parcels, but public services to the public.  The postmen and postwomen knocked on the doors of people who were cocooning, which will be remembered.</p>  <p>  Just as they responded to the pandemic, the Government has responded strongly to the pandemic, seeking to protect incomes, employees and businesses from the impact of this virus.  In recent months, an extensive range of measures has been introduced, with a direct expenditure impact of approximately &euro;16 billion, which equates to 9% of GNI*, the polar opposite of austerity.  This represents a significant investment in our economy and our society to support our people in these unprecedented times.</p>  <p>  When we consider all the measures that have been introduced, including tax measures, warehousing and deferral arrangements, as well as the credit guarantee scheme and the ISIF pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, the total value of supports provided in response to Covid-19 is over &euro;24 billion in 2020.  As has been discussed here today, these supports are wide-ranging in nature and cover many sectors of society and the economy.</p>  <p>  The Government's first priority is to protect the health and well-being of the people of Ireland.  In light of this, additional resources of &euro;2 billion have been provided to our health services so far in 2020.  This additional funding has allowed for significant scaling up of capacity in our acute hospitals and community healthcare settings, as well as for purchasing of vital equipment such as ventilators and personal protective equipment.  The Government will continue to support the HSE and our front-line workers as we adjust to living alongside Covid-19.  To that end, an additional &euro;600 million has been agreed this week to fund the 2020-21 winter initiative.  This will ensure our health service has the capacity and the resources required to tackle the challenging period ahead.</p>  <p>  In these uncertain times, income support schemes have provided security for thousands of people whose employment was impacted by the public health measures necessary to contain Covid-19.  To date, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has made payments of approximately &euro;6 billion in respect of the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  These supports, introduced swiftly at the beginning of the crisis, have protected incomes for thousands of households across the country.  The extension of the pandemic unemployment payment and the introduction of the employment wage subsidy scheme under the July stimulus will provide continued security for people in the coming months.</p>  <p>  In support of businesses, the activities of which have been significantly curtailed this year, supports of over &euro;900 million have been provided through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, as well as a commercial rates waiver at a cost of about &euro;600 million.  We have come a long way, and as we reopen our economy, the focus of expenditure measures is on stimulating activity across the economy and maintaining the connection between workers and employers.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, schools have reopened across the country.  To facilitate schools opening in a safe manner, &euro;375 million is being allocated to the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the 2020-21 school year.  Covid-19 has a significant impact on schools, and the Government is aware of the challenges that it creates for schools, teachers and students.  Keeping our schools open in this new school year is a priority for the Government and this is reflected in the level of resources provided in support of the roadmap for the full return to school.  For those in further and higher education too, recent months have been particularly challenging.  The July stimulus provides a significant investment to this sector, providing thousands of additional places in third level, upskilling and reskilling programmes.  Supports have also been provided through the new Department with responsibility for further and higher education for ICT, health and safety, and increased student supports.</p>  <p>  Looking to 2021, it is clear that there are challenging times ahead.  The economic picture has changed drastically in the last six months, from a balanced budget to a substantial projected deficit, and from strong GDP growth to a contraction of 6% in the second quarter of 2020.  Introducing this level of supports was unquestionably the right thing to do, but it also comes at a significant cost.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 is now just weeks away.  Assessing the appropriate Covid-19 measures for next year will form a key part of the Estimates process.  Ensuring that our existing services also continue to be delivered to citizens efficiently and effectively will be a key consideration, particularly as we continue with reopening our society and turn our attention towards economic recovery.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700034#KK00600"><p>I am very happy to make this opening statement.  I apologise that I was away from the D&aacute;il yesterday, but I am very glad to be back.</p>  <p>  We have a major challenge in front of us, but it is one that I think that we as a country will be good at.  Tackling climate change is something we can be good at and I am convinced that it will be good for us as a people.  One would not think that at the moment because in truth we have not been successful in recent decades in addressing the scale of the crisis with the speed of response by any measure.  The assessment of the Climate Change Advisory Council, which the Supreme Court referred to in its assessment of our mitigation plans to date, is that we are off course and heading in the wrong direction rapidly.  That is the most honest assessment anyone could give.  We are talking about turning around full circle and heading in a direction that will see us turning from being laggards to leaders as a country.</p> <p>I am convinced that we can and will do that.</p> <p> I intend today to set out the various factors that give me some confidence in our ability to meet the challenge we face and to reflect on how we might start doing it.  The first cause for optimism is the fact that the key to success in this endeavour is the conviction that we can do it.  That includes political conviction but also personal conviction among the people of this country.  In the past two years, perhaps in response to our previous failing, there have been developments on the political side that give me cause for hope.  The approach we have taken in the Oireachtas in the past two or three years has had an effect.  The establishment of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change was a seminal first step in the direction of answering the question of how we become leaders rather than laggards in addressing the climate challenge.  That was the key and correct question which we put to the assembly.  Ms Justice Laffoy, Ms Sharon Finegan and the team of people who were involved in that work are now engaged within the Department of the Taoiseach in co-ordinating some of our climate change response.  They did a really good job at the Citizens' Assembly asking the right questions, presenting the right evidence and listening to the citizens who participated.  Those citizens came back, in their series of recommendations, with a clear conviction that we can and will be good at meeting this challenge and that we want to do something about it.</p> <p> It was appropriate that the Oireachtas, in response to the report of the Citizens' Assembly, established the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, which included representation from right across the last D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The committee did very significant work in listening to the evidence, considering the various options and answering the question of how we become leaders rather than laggards.  The report it produced contained a consensus on most matters.  There was not agreement across the board on the issue of carbon taxation but on most of the key measures, mechanisms and targets, there was political agreement.  That consensus was an important change and condition which gives me some hope of our success in the challenges we face.</p> <p> I commend my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the work he did in the role.  The approach he took was appropriate in a variety of ways.  I refer in particular to the lessons he took from the Action Plan for Jobs, for which he was responsible earlier in the last decade and which had real success in delivering a systemic approach within the Government to addressing a specific issue.  His applying some of those lessons to the climate issue was appropriate and correct.  The climate action plan he delivered was welcomed by most environmental organisations of which I am aware and by this House.  This Government, under the programme for Government we have agreed, has decided that as welcome and well structured as Deputy Bruton's plan was, it was not ambitious enough.  That is correct and true.  We said at the time that the early-stage reductions, in particular, were not commensurate with the scale of the challenge that climate change presents, including the requirement to meet the goals set out in the Paris Agreement.</p> <p> This Government is setting out, on the back of the good work that was done in establishing that climate action plan, the work the Oireachtas committee did in the last D&aacute;il and the work of the Citizens' Assembly, to take the progress that was delivered by those methods and to aim higher.  Specifically, we are aiming for at least a 7% reduction per annum in emissions over the next decade and to be net zero and carbon neutral by 2050.  That ambition is in tune with what the EU is now proposing and with what the Commission President, Ms von der Leyen, said yesterday in her state of the Union address.  I hope it is achievable, even though the timeframe is very tight and nothing is certain.  It may give us a possibility of meeting the Paris Agreement climate objectives of preventing average global temperature increases from going beyond the 1.5&deg; C level that gives us some statistical chance at this stage - a possibility, not even a probability - of avoiding runaway, systemic climate change.</p> <p> I refer to the EU and President von der Leyen because what is happening in that arena is another factor that gives me a certain hope as we face the challenge of climate change.  I was involved back in 2007 to 2009 in the drafting of the climate directive and the renewable energy directive, along with my then colleague and former Minister, John Gormley.  I believe that the only way we can manage this challenge is as part of an EU system.  Europe took its eye off the ball on climate when the financial crisis hit and ignored the issue for the guts of the last decade.  It was probably concerned about the competitive advantages the United States may have had because of cheap gas.  In any event, it was fixated on the financial crash and the migrant crisis and, as a consequence, it took its eye off the ball on climate.  I believe that has changed in the past two or three years.  The most important European legislation in this area is not that relating to the targets or the raising of ambitions in that regard.  In truth, the target of a reduction of emissions of 40% and a 33% increase in renewables in the next decade was not ambitious enough.  Critical to the response and the change we have seen has been the introduction of new governance directives and rules to help meet the climate change challenge.</p> <p> I believe this new governance initiative is appropriate for a variety of reasons.  First and most important, it gives flexibility and responsibility back to the member state.  It is not a case of one size fits all.  It is not a diktat from Brussels as to exactly how things must be done.  It is an agreed mechanism whereby each country, in sharing the overall objective, had to come up with a national energy and climate action plan which showed how it could best meet the overall target within its own circumstances.  I mention those plans because they are the binding mechanism that will legally demand action of us for fear that in the absence of meeting the requirements, we would have to pay further fines, in addition to the fines we already face for not having met our 2020 targets.</p> <p> The Government, on coming together, agreed a more ambitious programme with more ambitious targets than what had gone before.  In effect, we are doubling our climate ambition, which will be a huge challenge.  We agreed to submit the existing climate action plan to the EU as part of its national emissions ceiling, NEC, process in July this year.  In so doing, we enabled the Commission to sign off on its assessment of all 27 national energy and climate action plans.  Next month, the Commission will present an overall analysis of the plans that have been presented and what effort-sharing arrangements might be needed to enable member states to reach the higher target of a reduction of at least 55%, as set out yesterday by President von der Leyen.  My understanding from the German Presidency is that it is a key priority to get agreement on those targets by the end of the year and to get agreement on the effort-sharing process.  The key timing consideration in this is for the EU to be able go into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, process, to go to Glasgow for the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties next summer and to be able to present a level of ambition that will, it is hoped, encourage other countries in their climate action efforts.  These countries include China and the United States - Lord knows what we can expect of the latter at the moment - but also, critically, the group of developing and other countries with which Europe has allied in recent UN climate negotiations because we have a common interest.</p> <p> The approach I am hoping to take is that we fit in within that EU process.  Our strength is as a member of the EU contributing to a global response and hoping that Europe can use its leverage - it is not insignificant as a bloc of real scale - to negotiate with other countries to live up to the requirements of the Paris Agreement.  In that context, I hope to introduce new climate legislation in the House early in October, as committed to in the programme for Government and in accordance with the proposed approach of the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, on which I want to follow through.  The legislation will strengthen the powers of the Climate Change Advisory Council, as recommended in the report of the joint Oireachtas committee.  The council's first task will be to establish a national climate action objective which reflects our higher ambitions, including a net-zero carbon footprint rather than the 80% reduction set out in the earlier plans and a mechanism of three five-year plans which detail how we set ourselves on that course over the coming five-year, ten-year and 15-year periods.</p> <p>It would also set out, to the greatest degree of specificity possible, what sort of approach we are going to take towards meeting the long-term target.  In doing that we will answer appropriately the valid criticisms contained in Mr. Justice Frank Clarke's judgement in the Supreme Court case taken by Friends of the Irish Environment about the previous national mitigation plan.  More important, however, we will establish the mechanisms internally with which our public service and State system will be able to help our people make the leap we are going to have to make.</p> <p> There is an opportunity in this rather than a problem because there is an opportunity for a change which can deliver a better economic model than the one we currently have.  At the centre of the change we are about to make there must be a just transition.  There must be the development of a new economic model which is socially progressive as well as environmentally progressive.  It must also give us a secure economy, which was the consistent refrain in the discussions of the previous Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment on whatever measures we were looking at.  It is absolutely critical that we do that.</p> <p> We will do this first and foremost by concentrating on energy efficiency.  It is perhaps the least glamorous aspect of this and gets the least attention but it is actually the most important.  We will do that by setting ourselves the goal of taking out all of the oil and gas-powered boilers in our homes over the coming two decades and replacing them with heat pumps and really high-quality insulation so we no longer have to burn fossil fuels to heat our homes.  That is the guiding star in all of this.  It is complicated because there are so many options and so many different areas of life it will affect, but the one simple message to our people is that we are going to stop burning fossil fuels.  Within two decades we must finish using fossil fuels in the energy system as part of this path.  That will bring huge benefits because a person living in a house that is properly insulated to B2 standard or higher will realise that there are huge comfort and health gains.  Critically, it is the best way of tackling fuel poverty.  The worst curse of fuel poverty is having to pay the fuel bill.  If we can retrofit our houses so there does not have to be that spend on fossil fuels, that will provide a huge leap in social justice and improvement for all of the people in this country.</p> <p> Part of the funding for that will be covered by the revenues we get by introducing a carbon tax.  Some parties will try to dispute that as an approach but it is not the be-all and end-all.  Indeed it is not even the key measure, but it is just one of the mechanisms by which we can support the funding of what is a &euro;50 billion project.  This is not small.  This will create 30,000 jobs.  It will, as I said, use largely Irish materials and Irish companies with real skills and expertise in the area, which will create huge gains.  It will use funding from the carbon tax and, I hope, funding from the European Union as part of the Green New Deal that the President of the European Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, set out yesterday.  It will use funding from the climate fund, which we legislated for just before the summer recess, and it will use private financing.  Critically, this work will be done on private homes and offices as well as public buildings and social housing.  We need a whole range of different solutions.  The carbon tax will provide one stream but it will be only one of many we will have to apply.</p> <p> On the energy side, if we can, and we will - manage those efficiency measures, the opportunity on the generation side is immense.  I was very proud last week that we agreed the successful launch of the first auction for renewable energy that sees us moving away from a REFIT support price for renewable electricity toward an auction system where the industry has to bid in to have the ability to sell into the market.  I am glad to say that the bid price, if index-linking is included, was about 20% lower than the outgoing REFIT support price, and I expect that to continue to fall as the cost of wind and in particular solar power continues to fall.  Again, critically, to deliver a new type of economy based on social progress and different types of ownership of capital and production, we are looking to expand further and build on the seven community energy projects which were successful in that auction scheme.  I expect the next scheme to have a much larger number of similar community-based groups involved in tapping into new power supply systems.</p> <p> On a much larger scale but still one on which we must still look at community and national ownership, we should be preparing ourselves in this D&aacute;il, in this term and the following one, for the massive development of offshore renewable energy as one of the huge projects for progress in this country that is available to us.  Our sea area is ten times our land area and it is one of the windiest areas in the world.  We have real skills in project management, engineering and renewables.  We were one of the first countries to go offshore with wind energy.  Those six turbines in the Arklow Bank are now tiny compared with what other countries are doing.  We were there at an early stage, but we did not keep going with it, and now is the time for us to catch up.  The scale of the project is again immense.  We are talking about tens of billions.  It has to work in co-operation with our neighbours the UK as well as the rest of the Continent, whatever else happens on Brexit.  This is an opportunity we will tap into.</p> <p> Key to making it successful is progress on the marine planning and development management Bill which needs to go through this House in the next six months.  That is the sort of timeline within which I hope we will be able to pass it.  That will give an investment certainty, a planning certainty and a grid development certainty which will allow us to progress and to start to deliver at that scale.  The programme for Government mentions 35 GW, and there is nothing to stop us going beyond that if we can build the right interconnection and transmission system to tap into that power supply.  That sounds like it is at a scale beyond compare with anything done to date, and it is, but that is what we intend to do.  That is the sort of project that will allow us to meet these targets and see a huge economic benefit for this country.</p> <p> We also need to develop our grid onshore.  There have been key developments on this in recent weeks.  While I know it is contentious and there are different views, the Northern Irish planning approval for the North-South interconnector brings real urgency to the development of that project.  Last week Deputy McDonald rightly raised concerns about the cost of energy to consumers.  That project is critical to helping bring down the cost of energy and for having an all-island energy system.  There is such uncertainty with Brexit at the moment but whatever happens it is vital we maintain an all-island approach to meeting the climate challenge, because if we try to do it as two separate jurisdictions and systems, it will not work and we will not be able to meet our targets.  We will not be able to get all of the benefit which accrues from an all-island approach if we start separating out and do not have a connected grid.</p> <p> That connected grid has to bring us right down to the street level.  In the new system, as we take out fossil fuels we start putting in heat pumps and electric vehicles, managing that grid at the distribution level is probably the most important single project in this whole system.  If we get that right, retrofitting houses and the electrification of the transport system will work.  It is a huge challenge which the ESB is well up for and well capable of meeting.  We will learn, and indeed we already are, how we do that in a way that allows us to apply some of the lessons to the rest of the world.  It is not all bad in our country.  We tend rightly to be negative about failing to meet targets, but in truth we have learnt a lot about how to integrate renewable power.  We are probably ahead of every other country in that because of the learning by doing which we have had to do.  The ESB can and will apply that now as we move to the next phase of the revolution, namely, bringing it back down to the street and house level.</p> <p> On transport, and I will only touch on some of the big transport projects we are going to have to undertake, it will require political commitment to move away from the sprawled planning model we have allowed to develop in our country over the past 50 years.  It has been a car-based system.  It has already been agreed in the national planning framework, which I think most parties have agreed to, that we need to bring life back to the centre of our rural communities, our villages, our towns and our cities.  We need to make it safe for our children to walk and cycle to school.</p>  <p>We need to build up local high streets so local retailers and enterprises can have a vibrant future as well as a low-carbon future.  It will be the development of a system that is dominated by safe active travel and public transport.  Of course there will be use of cars but it will be done in a way that does not see the cars dominant and gives people freedom of choice, options, and the high-quality local environment we see throughout the country, which is the person-centred development of on-street planning.  The villages, towns and communities that are really successful are the ones that are starting to get this planning right and creating local environments that are low on air pollution and high on vibrant street life.  This is where we need to go.  It is a win-win in tackling climate change when it comes to changing transport policy.</p> <p> We do need to change.  We have to spend 10% of our budget promoting walking and cycling if we are going to make it work.  I would like to hear from others if they disagree with what is in the programme for Government.  We need to switch our transport spending so the remainder of the capital budget is 2:1 in favour of public transport over roads.  The benefit will be that we can start to design our new housing and address the housing crisis by putting housing closer to public transport so people have a high quality of life and save time if they have to commute.  We have to learn the lessons from Covid and take some of the changes that have come with Covid by moving away from the model of commuting every day of the week and opening up to the possibility that, even after Covid is gone, people will not necessarily be commuting four or five days a week.</p> <p> I am only scratching the surface of what the possibilities are and what we need to do.  The D&aacute;il will have to agree in the next year or two at the latest, as part of drafting the new national energy and climate action plan, which is our contribution to meeting the Paris climate agreement, a land use plan that sets out how we critically bring together addressing the biodiversity crisis and the climate crisis.  The two go together.  First and foremost, a land use plan has to start with a plan for rural Ireland and the development of communities.  We cannot separate us from nature.  We are all connected.  We are part of the environment and we have to think of land use planning in this way.</p> <p> As we develop vibrant rural communities, we will do so best by also looking at how we store carbon and how we pay our farming communities for the expertise and skill that will be needed in the storing of carbon, particularly in peat soils.  As part of our just transition we will invest significantly in using the skills of Bord na M&oacute;na to manage bogs and peatlands as a critical element of meeting our 2030 and 2050 targets.  Similarly, we will pay farmers for meeting the second key objective, which is the restoration of biodiversity.  We will look at changing the forestry model completely and make the evolutionary step to the next form of forestry, which will be away from clear-felling, monoculture short rotation crops towards long-term close to nature continuous cover forestry.  It will take time to develop this.  It will take time even to get the saplings and, as we know, it takes time to do the planning.  This is the change we need to make and the land use plan will set out what type of forestry will go where and what type of supports will be involved.</p> <p> The land use plan will also need to set out how we manage and improve our water quality.  The biggest failing environmentally has been the loss of pristine water and the ongoing scandal of pollution of our waterways by wastewater systems, nitrogen, excessive fertilisers and other factors that have led to the loss of our water quality.  In tackling all of these issues together we will help to manage our floods in a much better way, preparing and adapting for the climate change we know will come.</p> <p> The land use plan must also monitor and reduce the level of ammonia and nitrogen pollution.  All of this can be done not by telling the farmer what to do or wagging fingers and talking down to someone.  We are looking for their help.  We are looking to pay them properly for making the change and to guarantee, as I believe there is agreement throughout the House, that we want to see the Irish family farm thrive in this climate changing world we have to address.  It is doable.  It just requires an ability to see and do things differently and to allocate funding, road space and decision making towards this task.  It will be done best when we work collectively.  I look forward to working with the climate committee when it comes to the introduction of the legislation and for it to have a critical role in the ongoing review and approval of the rolling budget approach we are looking to take.</p> <p> This works best when there is political consensus and when there is not a division on the issue.  We work well as a country when we set ourselves a common target.  I hope that what I sense is true will be true, which is that all parties and Independent Deputies agree this is a project we should take on.  It is not something that divides us.  We may disagree on the policy details and the timing, and we may even disagree on the budget, but I hope we can agree on the overall objective that the country wants to be and will be good at this.  In doing so we will meet the international obligations to deliver climate justice to the poorest countries in the world that will be hit hardest.  In doing it we will also restore a new sense of connection between our own selves and our local environment and the nature around us.  We live in a beautiful country.  We are lucky to live in such a temperate and relatively stable environment.  We need to keep it this way.  If we can agree common purpose on understanding the scale of the promise and the vision on how we live in our own homes, local communities and a world we want to protect for younger people and ourselves, we can debate politically the details and we can even argue, but if we do not have as the first principle that we will do this, then nothing will happen.</p></speech>

I shared a similar experience to his in recent weeks.  It is part of living with Covid.  It gives us a clear understanding of the importance of a testing and tracing system that is responsive and rapid.  Personal behaviour and a sound healthcare system are the foundation on which our future will be built.</p>  <p>  I welcome the inclusion of statements on climate action in the schedule.  It is important we keep the topic at the top of the D&aacute;il's agenda although statements on their own will not be enough, and the Minister is aware of this.  We need tangible changes that will alter our current path.  I look forward to the Minister bringing forward the climate action Bill soon and working with the Government to ensure it is ambitious and fair.  The Minister might provide us with an update on its progress.</p>  <p>  The challenge of climate change is undeniable despite what some might say.  The science is clear and the evidence is powerful and alarming, whether it be in California at present, Siberia in recent months, the Arctic Circle or Australia.  I have a brother in Australia with whom I speak weekly.  When he speaks about bad weather it is not like the bad weather here.  What he means is that it is so warm people cannot go outside or the forest fires are so close that the children cannot go to playschool.  We have had our own experience in Ireland in a clearer way in more recent times.  Through Met &Eacute;ireann's detailed and reliable climate data, which has been collected since the mid-1800s, we can see Ireland's average annual temperature has increased by 1&deg;C over the past 100 years.  I commend the work of Met &Eacute;ireann and the work of geographers throughout the country, including at the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Unit.  The Minister's colleague at the Department of Education and Skills is still intent on downgrading geography as a subject at junior certificate level and this is a regressive move for the climate effort.</p>  <p>  Our climate has changed and is continuing to do so.  We are now seeing more damaging storms and more destructive floods as a result.  The evidence is clear to everyone.</p> <p>We have seen examples of this across the island such as the partial collapse of Dunbeg Fort in Dingle in 2018, the impact of coastal and inland erosion on the Spanish Armada wrecks off the Sligo coast and the collapse of Rathcannon Castle during Storm Ophelia.  There are many other examples such as the extreme and concerning coastal erosion at Portrane, County Dublin.</p> <p> It will not be enough to continue simply building flood barriers and hope for the best.  Man-made protections are no match for the power of climate change events.  Without significant change, this will be the new reality for billions of people across the globe for years to come.  It will take a global effort to alter this trajectory.  I believe Ireland can become a world leader in eliminating reliance on fossil fuels and changing our habits to greener alternatives.  If it makes sense for people to do it and if it is done in a fair and equitable way, then there should be no issue.</p> <p> For this to happen, however, the Government's approach must be one of bringing people along on the journey with it.  Taxing people who have no alternatives or carbon shaming people simply will not work.  The Government's proposed increase in carbon tax is exactly the wrong approach.  This October the Government will increase the cost for people to heat their homes and drive to work with far more significant impact on income inequality and deprivation indices than on carbon emissions.  Most people would love an insulated home and solar panels on their roof.  Many would love an electric car or the option of no car at all.  This is a million miles away, however, from most people's current household budgets.  In fact, it is beyond the capabilities of the infrastructure and public services which the State provides, particularly public transport services, due to government underinvestment for years.  Taxing people more this October and for the next ten budgets will not change this.  In fact, it will make the issue worse.</p> <p> Affordable alternatives need to be in place before a behavioural tax can work.  In the meantime, it is not a behavioural tax but a punitive one.  Not only does it hammer those who can least afford it, it leaves a sour taste in people's mouths about climate action.  They feel they are being punished for something totally out of their control.  It is the exact opposite to bringing people along on the journey that we are supposed to be on together.</p> <p> There is the targeting of items such as two-for-one dinners included in the recently launched waste action plan.  The action plan commits to working with retailers to end the sale of multibuy packs.  There was a significant and understandable angry public response to this for two reasons.  First, many people depend on these special offers to feed their families.  When one looks at the cost of rent, insurance and childcare and other living costs, this is a reality for many families.  Second, people thought of the many other actions that could be taken to target the environmental sphere.  Two-for-one dinners are not the highest priority.  There was a particular media presentation but it was dreadful.</p> <p> The same applies for penalising people for buying more affordable clothes.  It is insulting and offensive to people who are struggling to make ends meet.  It reeks of that idea of going for quality over quantity and telling people to stop being poor.  It reminds me of Terry Pratchett's book tax where those wealthy enough can afford good books which last longer and they save money in the long run while those who are poor go through many more books at more expense.</p> <p> We have to understand the position which people find themselves and the way they engage with the environment, the climate and the economy.  We have to meet them where they are.  These proposals infuriated people not because they do not want to tackle waste in the fashion industry but because it is yet another tax on the consumer rather than tackling the root causes behind it.  Solutions to our waste and environmental challenges cannot just always be a levy or a tax on consumers.  This has always been the go-to and simple idea by successive Governments.  It does more harm than good to people's attitudes to green politics.</p> <p> On energy policy, I have spoken privately to the Minister on the North-South interconnector.  My honest and heartfelt opinion is that it will not proceed as currently proposed.  Planning permission, North and South, is not available due to the level of public opposition.  Will the Government engage with communities to find a way forward?  There is a way forward but it will only be found with genuine engagement.  I would like to know the Minister's plans in this regard.</p> <p> Transitioning from a reliance on fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy will play a key role in our national climate action effort.  Recent industry reports have indicated there are significant challenges in that regard which the Minister acknowledged.  What measures will the Government take to address them?</p> <p> The level of community engagement in the RESS, renewable electricity support scheme, is a real positive.  Is enough being done, however, to maximise the potential to look at new economies and new models of delivering energy?  I do not believe there is.  I am happy to work with the Minister as Opposition spokesperson to advance the opportunities for community-generated energy, as well as for communities to be able to plug in and contribute to the grid.</p> <p> I live in County Meath where we want people to use public transport.  For that to happen, public transport needs to work for people.  We need an improved bus network and the Navan rail line to be opened.  We have discussed this on numerous occasions and we will continue to do so.  I hope it can be progressed.  Sinn F&eacute;in has committed to playing a constructive role in opposition.  We understand and accept the need for system change and to work towards a zero-emissions economy.  We are clear in our position, however, that it must be done with, not to, communities.  Fundamental to that is the principle of climate justice and a just transition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700038#OO00200"><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to ensure that the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy is fair.  However, many communities are sceptical about the Government's intention to be fair in the transition process.  Much of the scepticism comes from their experience of the last time that the Green Party was in government.  The living memory is that of a Government which introduced token measures which did little for environmental protection but hammered local communities.  Have any lessons been learned?</p>  <p>  One area where that question will be answered relates to horticultural peat harvesting.  This activity is crucial to the mushroom industry, a particularly vital sector to my home county, Monaghan.  Despite what the Minister's advisers may tell him, people at the coalface of this industry state there is no alternative to horticultural peat.  If the peat is not available in Ireland, then it will be either imported from elsewhere or the mushroom industry will leave Ireland.</p>  <p>  That is what I mean by tokenism.  Such a move will do nothing for the environment.  In fact, the carbon footprint would likely increase.  The economy in my county, however, would be devastated.  On 7 September, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, announced he was establishing a working group to examine the use of peat moss in the horticultural sector.  I would have said this was a good move.  However, crucially, he stated the terms of reference would include the predetermined outcome of graduating the elimination of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  That is not the action of a Minister or a Government that wants to deliver a fair or just transition.  It exposes a lack of understanding of horticulture and the mushroom sector in particular.  The articulated linkages that have been made between peat extraction for horticultural use with that of peat extraction for energy use are spurious and dishonest.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>There is 1.3 million ha of peatland in this State.  Only 5,500 ha are used for horticultural peat, amounting to 0.4% of total boglands.  Some 500 ha would sustain the mushroom industry for the next 100 years.</p> <p> Coupled with these medium- and long-term challenges that the Government appears intent on introducing, there is also the immediate debacle with the planning system, which has been exacerbated by the Supreme Court decision in July in cases involving An Taisce and An Bord Plean&aacute;la which, if urgent action is not taken, could result in several years of delay in the process and bring the mushroom production process in Ireland to a halt much sooner even than would have been envisaged.</p> <p> The questions for the new Green Minister are the following.  Will he resolve in the first instance the backlog in the planning and regulation process or will he pursue tokenism at the expense of rural economies, such as in County Monaghan?  If the latter is his intention, he will face fierce resistance.  The economy in County Monaghan, for example, is dependent on indigenous industries such as the mushroom sector.  Successive governments have done virtually nothing for job creation in our county, so we simply cannot allow Government to remove some of the jobs that are in place in the name of environmentalism but, in truth, just as a facade to cover up for its failures to deliver a real and effective carbon action plan in its programme for Government.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies should not think this will happen under their watch and that they can simply shrug their shoulders and blame the Greens.  They should not try to act like mushrooms because people are wise to that.  The Deputies from those parties have a responsibility to represent and protect our rural economies and communities.  Those rural communities will be watching their actions very closely.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his new post.  I hope the United Nations report on biodiversity did not keep him tossing and turning in the leaba last night.  Between that report and the screening of "Unquiet Graves" on RT&Eacute; 1 yesterday, I certainly did not get my seven hours' sleep, but I digress.</p>  <p>  Few politicians get to debate not just the kind of future we will have but whether there will be a future at all.  We are living through and causing an extinction event but, judging by the bypasses from Government, we seem content to diminish or ignore it.  It sounds grandiose but it is dead simple.  The dead part can be seen in the loss of biodiversity, habitats, species and coastline and the vanishing ice in the Arctic and on the Alps.  The simple part can be seen in the difference between back then and now.  Back then, every winter, when our mams washed our jeans and perhaps left them out on the line all night, when we went out to bring them in in the morning, they were stiff as boards, the grass in the back garden crunching beneath our feet.  Now, though, the washing being like boards in the winter is virtually unknown to our own children.</p>  <p>  In using this example I am not mistaking weather for climate; I am saying our more clement temperatures do not mean a more clement climate.  In fact, the so-called "modest" 1&deg; increase which some time ago people thought would boost food production in the world is already wreaking havoc on our planet.  Rainfall normally associated with the Himalayas and the Philippines is now a regular feature of life along the Mediterranean.  In poorer countries susceptible to flooding, parents teach their children to swim, not to win the medal in the swimming gala but to survive the inevitable flooding.  Here at home we do not have to hear the billions of tonnes of Greenland ice thundering into the North Atlantic or see the record heatwaves or droughts or Australia or California burning to know that our climate is changing and not for the better.  We look out the window and see the tropical storms and hurricanes creeping up into the North Atlantic.  A warmer ocean means moister winds, giving us the A to Z of storms we saw on the weather forecast with Joanna Donnelly every evening this week, the trampolines on tour A to Z, as gales and torrential rains pound us with greater intensity and regularity.</p>  <p>  Mother Earth did not do this on her own, though.  She had a dig-out from politicians, corporations and the millionaires turned billionaires treating Earth as something to exploit for their profit as opposed to something to cherish for our children and our grandchildren.  The truth is that capitalism is not a good bedfellow of sustainability and the environment.  That is the real inconvenient truth for the Green Party, this Government and governments all across the world.  The great and the good of Ireland mourn the loss of an EU Trade Commissioner who paved the way for a Mercosur deal which contributes to the annihilation of the Amazon rain forest.</p>  <p>  In my constituency, in north Kildare, locals tell me they were promised the spent bogs of Bord na M&oacute;na would be rewetted and that they would get a lake, which would have been a great amenity for north Kildare.  Instead they got a dump.  On Kildare County Council Sinn F&eacute;in councillors consistently put forward motions on reforestation of rural council greenfield and brownfield sites with native trees.  We sought the option of microgeneration for community groups and individuals.  In fact, my cumann brought forward a motion on that at our Ard-Fheis.</p>  <p>  We also wanted to incorporate geothermal heating systems in new council estates, whereby the green area would be used for that purpose.  Of course, we were all ignored and pl&aacute;m&aacute;sed because the truth is that this State has not got a notion about really tackling climate change that involves the State doing the heavy lifting.  Instead it prefers to pretend it should all be left to the individual or to carbon-taxing the life out of poor communities with no affordable alternative.  I want to call that out.  I want to put forward citizen-centred solutions, so I am very grateful to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald for appointing me to the climate committee.  I want to play a role and play my part to deliver the change that people see we really need - real change, radical change, urgent change - from consumer politics to economics where, in the end, all we are consuming is our Earth and one another.  We are running out of time to save our planet from all this.</p>  <p>  I remember my nana used to have a lovely "I told you so" phrase if we complained that we did not get something done when we should have foreseen it in time: N&iacute; h&eacute; l&aacute; na gaoithe I&aacute; na scolb.  It is not on the windy day that the thatching should be done.  It is very apt.  It is not like we have not been warned.  We know the predictions are stark.  Capitalist economic growth costs and the price is our children's future.  Like millions all over the world, I am not prepared to pay it.  Today I ask an tAire, as leader of the Green Party and as a member of this Government, is he.</p></speech>

My comrades in Labour Youth produced over the summer a document, entitled Be Radical or Be Redundant, relating to a number of areas, including climate change.  If we are to go from being laggards to leaders, as is the Government's aim, and one which we support, we need to be radical or else we risk being redundant.</p>  <p>  Throughout this pandemic, which has dominated 2020 and dominated an awful lot of our thinking, anecdotal evidence has emerged from people, including I am sure everyone in this room, of the environment responding positively to the sudden pausing of regular industrial and indeed personal behaviours.  If we are to take one positive memory from this year, I think it will be having a time to pause and to be able to see the environment around us, the biodiversity and the opportunities we have in our communities to improve the environment and to link that together with the State to make a real difference on climate change.</p>  <p>  We have seen the disturbing and shocking images from California of the forest fires in recent weeks and the recent Australian bushfires, which ravaged the entire country and continent.  In this country we have seen flooding regularly.  In the week just gone, on the Continent several temperature records were set, some dating back 150 years.  In my constituency we have issues such as coastal erosion, which over the past six or seven years has accelerated at an extraordinary pace.</p> <p>This is not a once-off event.  Coastal erosion has been happening for decades in north County Dublin at very modest levels.  However, now we see the breadth and drama of it and the amount of land it is taking in such a short space of time.  There is little doubt that this is a result of climate change.  It is not just the California fires, the flooding in Europe, and the Australian bush fires.  This is happening in every corner of the planet, including our very own.  </p> <p> Pandemic or not, we see the stark reminders every single day.  Many of the world's Governments have reacted with rapid responses to Covid-19 and that is to be commended.  We are all trying to flatten the curve.  However, those rapid responses have never happened in relation to climate change.  We know climate change is destroying homes, ruining livelihoods and killing people.  It is another fight which we need to face collectively.  It deserves action and a response to the scale of this global challenge.  Climate change actions may bring certain practices and industries to an end or greatly reduce them but the future of our children and grandchildren is the goal we must aim for.  It is the responsibility of world, international and local leaders to ensure climate action is used as a moment to bring a real green revolution.  Workers and ordinary people will be the ones to deliver the green future but they cannot be the ones to carry the burden of delivering it.  We must have radical and rapid action to save our planet and we must also have a just transition for our workers.  We must act to save livelihoods, not only from the physical effects of climate change, but by ensuring a restructuring of our economy and creating well-paid public jobs with a publicly owned system of green energy production.  At the heart of every climate decision should be workers, people and communities.  We cannot allow the market to lead climate action and policy.  It has no interest in it.  It is not in the interest of the market to solve climate change.  It is the exact opposite.  The State has to lead and I hope that is a message the Minister believes and will carry in his term as Minister.  The market and large industry have been the largest contributors to pollution and they must not hold continued influence over policy in Ireland or throughout the world.  We must be radical or we face being redundant.</p> <p> The Labour Party will support proposals to invest in the ESB, Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na to create new sustainable jobs in clean energy, recycling and land management.  This will ensure a positive future for workers and for regions of our country that are at risk of economic and social decline.  We will support proposals for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and for setting up a just transition fund and task force to invest in businesses that are helping workers and communities to make that transition.  We will support proposals to invest in public transport and cycling infrastructure; to encourage people in cities and large towns to make the change to sustainable and healthier forms of transportation; to ease traffic congestion; and to improve our air quality.  That is why we need to see large-scale projects such as MetroLink, and I know the Minister is a supporter and advocate of that project and has been for many years.  We need to see a radical expansion of public bike schemes into not just our major cities, but our big towns, and within our cities out to the suburbs to allow people to get to bus stops and train stations, where they are available, in a healthy and sustainable way.  We need to see investment in infrastructure to make cycling safe.  We also need to see investment in safe pedestrianisation and for people with disabilities.  These measures from the bottom up in terms of our transport infrastructure will have a positive impact on climate change. </p> <p> The Minister will not be short of ideas and solid proposals from the Opposition benches.  Cynical people here will say that, as a Green Party Minister, he will receive more opposition from his own partners in Government in terms of policies and ideas than he will from people on this side of the House.  We want to see action.  We will be suggesting alternatives and we will support alternatives that will work because we need to be in this together.  Climate action affects every one of us and the generations that follow will pay the price for our inaction now.  There have been record-breaking floods, deadly heatwaves and billions of euro worth of crops destroyed by storms.  People in Ireland are worried about what is happening in the world and what it will take to tackle the climate crisis before it is too late.</p> <p> We call on the Minister and the Government in the promised climate action Bill to ensure the biggest polluters pay for the damage caused and that they are regulated to change practices; to ensure that the average worker does not bear the burden and brunt of the cost of climate change; that a real just transition for workers is delivered with a proper green new deal and a real investment in green energy; and that there is a ban on the use of fracked gas and oil.  These are actions we must take.  We have no time to dither on them.  Each party in this House put forward proposals on climate action in its election manifesto.  We need to start seeing them enacted.  Last year we saw record-breaking demonstrations from people in the street in cities across the world.  They were positive demonstrations and they energised people, not through local and general elections but through daily, weekly and ongoing political activity, be it under a party banner or not.  We cannot sleepwalk into further destruction on this planet.  We must be radical or we risk becoming redundant. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700040#QQ00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  Our climate action plan clearly recognises that Ireland significantly steps up to its commitment to tackle climate disruption.  With that in mind, I will raise the issue of forestry.  According to the Uplift campaign, which has communicated with all the Deputies in this House, planting native trees to create rich native woodland such as oak, ash, elder and birch should be a priority to have cleaner air and create healthier communities.  The Minister knows that.  We have suffered decades of deforestation, which has led to the erosion of biodiversity, created barriers to commercial forestry and imposed massive conditions on homebuilders and community and commercial enterprises to offset it by planting hundreds of native species.  We cannot have such a strategy.  We need trees far and wide but we also need timber from these trees.</p>  <p>  This leads to my concern.  In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, several people have come to me with concerns for everyone in the forestry industry in the region.  Creators, builders, landscapers and craftspeople rely heavily on supply from Irish sawmills.  However, due to problems with the felling licences caused by serial objectors, the country's sawmills are finding it incredibly tough and their lack of supply has resulted in shorter working weeks.  These are jobs which on the line.</p>  <p>  Businesses in my home county of Carlow which utilise the products of sawmills have said to me they are afraid there could be more than 500 jobs at stake.  Yesterday, I spoke to Andy Doyle, a constituent of mine from Hacketstown, a fabulous place to live.  He owns Woodside Garden Products, a family-run business, and he does a lot of bark and mulch.  He told me there are 15 jobs there and at the moment they are all under pressure.  It is not only him but it is the lorry drivers and the people he is in contact with every day and that is a huge problem.  This highlights that when an objection to felling is placed, it does not impact on the sawmills.  New housing developments and new school builds could be put on hold if there is no timber in the country to finish them and it must be imported.  It raises questions about how we feel about other countries' deforestation.  It is not good enough to say one's neighbour does not recycle but as long as one does it oneself that is okay.  It is not okay.  We are either all on this planet or we are not.  It is our shared space.  We have to ensure a robust objection system, root out vigorously objections where they may occur and work with industry to solve issues where they arise.</p>  <p>  The sawmills supply the timber to make pallets.  Everything moves on pallets in this country.  If we have a scarcity of pallets, it puts a huge delay on delivery of essential goods.  It is so important to Ireland, not just to the builders but to all of us waiting for shops to be stocked.  It is only in the past few months in speaking to different businesses across my constituency that I have realised the utmost importance of making sure that we have proper legislation, keep these jobs and keep this important industry going.  We need joined-up thinking and we need to plant and offset trees.  We fell, and there is no disputing that.  Science tells us that forests take harmful carbon dioxide from our air and retain it in the biomass.  Planting trees is good for jobs and so is felling them and planting again.  It is a green circle.  It is a sustainable industry.</p> <p>Timber from our trees builds our homes, our schools and our crafts and we cannot stand over anyone importing that timber because that is not the spirit of the climate action plan.  The sector has already seen the loss of two and a half months of turnover.  In addition, new housing builds will only reach an estimated 16,000 units by the end of the year.  We were given that figure by representatives of the construction sector at the Covid-19 committee.</p> <p> Commercial forestry is a renewable resource, a green sector for jobs and we need to future proof our plans for this area.  The forestry sector has a turnover of &euro;2.4 billion, provides a &euro;1 billion worth of exports and employs 12,000 people.  These jobs and the livelihoods of families will be under threat in rural Ireland if we do nothing.  I will be supporting the proposed agricultural appeals (amendment) Bill, which deals with this very issue in another Department.  I am concerned, however, that we do not have a whole-of-Government approach to this issue and that is why I am raising it in the context of climate action.  We must plant the trees but also save the jobs.</p></speech>

The Minister said in his speech that we will all have to make changes.  I agree with that completely.  We have all seen the good weather we have had during this pandemic.  That helps people in a way, but it is also difficult to tell our winters from our summers now.  We seem to be reaching that stage.  We must all work together, therefore, to ensure that we look after our climate and ensure that we play our part.  I will be doing that.  From schools I have worked with in recent years, I know that climate change will be a major part of our children's future.  We must concentrate on that aspect and ensure that we educate our children about climate change and climate action.  I thank the Minister for his contribution and I hope that he will respond to me with a written reply regarding my question on forestry.</p></speech>

In our mind&rsquo;s eye, we still see ourselves in the relatively benign setting of the Holocene, a period of comparative stability in our climate, which cradled the advent of human civilisation.</p><p>When I was born, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere was 333 ppm.  That was above pre-industrial levels, but consistent with a relatively constant global temperature range.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, in the United States, the CO<sub>2</sub>concentration, measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, today stands at 411 ppm.  The composition of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere has significantly altered in less than a human lifetime.  The last time CO<sub>2</sub>concentrations were at this level was some 3 million years ago, when the planet was two to three degrees warmer and sea-levels were 15 to 25 m higher.  We no longer live in the world we think we do.</p><p>Anyone born after February 1985 will never have lived through a month of below average global temperatures.  The five warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2015.  The Minister knows as well as I do, and better, the debate our party had on the issue of entering into Government.  It says much about the Green Party that we could hold that discussion publicly, respectfully air and exchange contrary viewpoints and come to a decision on the future road of our movement.</p><p>On one hand, many of our members felt that the programme for Government, however good, did not go far enough in terms of systems change or climate justice.  I can accept and understand the merits of those arguments and have an undiminished respect for those who made them.  On the other hand, there are parties within Leinster House that thought it more politically opportune to wait in the wings, either to consolidate their electoral gains or to build in opposition.</p><p>There were others, however, and I count myself among them, mindful of those arguments, aware of the possibility of political fallout and the difficulty of the road ahead, who chose to back the brave decision to go into Government in a time of crisis, or perhaps I should say in a time of crises.  For good reason, the health crisis posed by the Covid-19 pandemic is at the forefront of all our minds and I welcome the resilience and recovery plan published this week which lays out this State&rsquo;s roadmap to living alongside Covid-19 in the short to mid term.  Concurrently, we must deal with the resultant economic crisis and plan for an investment-led recovery, one that prioritises decent jobs and a Green New Deal.  Beyond that, however, and I cannot say in the long term given the urgent need for radical action, are the twin spectres of climate breakdown and biodiversity collapse.</p><p>Such is the scale of the climate crisis, that the President of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, made one of the strongest statements on the issue in her State of the Union speech earlier this week.  Bearing in mind all the challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, President Von der Leyen maintained that &ldquo;There is no more urgent need for acceleration than when it comes to the future of our fragile planet.&rdquo;  She, like many of us, recognises that the <i>status quo</i>will not protect the future of our planet. </p><p>In facing up to these challenges, astoundingly complex and difficult in their nature, we must in the first instance be wary of those who offer us simplistic solutions.  We live in an era of a new populism which offers easy and attractive answers or engages in deflection or whataboutery.  We can hear those voices inside and outside the gates of Leinster House.  By the same token, the Covid-19 crisis has exposed the myth at the heart of the neoliberal capitalist model: that the State is bad and the market can cure all ills.  In fact, what we have seen in recent months is the power of the State to do good and to harness and focus collective action for the collective good.</p><p>Similarly, market forces, as currently constituted, are ill-equipped to deal with the climate emergency; a time horizon which does not extend beyond the next quarterly report cannot enable long-term action.  Likewise, a balance sheet which erodes natural capital at the behest of short-term profit will, ultimately, serve to impoverish, not enrich.  We see this nowhere more clearly than in California at present, where unparalleled wealth flows into tech companies while the wildfires rage around them.</p><p>We in the environmental movement have, in the past, also fallen into the trap of individualism.  Now, we have come to a better understanding that we must act on the power of aggregated individual actions, but that must occur within systemic change.  In tackling the climate emergency, we must leverage the full power of the State and its people to affect societal change and we must act in common purpose to the common good.</p><p>President Michael D. Higgins, then a Teachta D&aacute;la, when speaking to the Tom Johnson Summer School in 2009, referred to the rich utopian tradition of the Labour Party.  He rightly noted the failure of a wage income in a traded economy to take account of the caring economy, of voluntary activity or of cultural activity.  I hope this Government&rsquo;s work on well-being indicators will help to address that problem.  Our current system fails in the same way to account for environmental goods: the intrinsic value, for example, of biodiversity falls outside its reckoning unless we modify our language, couching it in forced terms like &quot;ecosystem services&quot;.  The President, in that speech at the Tom Johnson Summer School, then quoted Tom Moylan, who said that: &ldquo;What is needed is a courageous embrace of the utopian project, not self-denying resignation but self-aware engagement.&rdquo;  These words ring truer today than ever before.</p><p>We must set in front of us this utopian vision, not one of some imagined past, but one of a reimagined future, one where we have learned to live within our planetary boundaries, where we have harnessed the twin powers of the State and our ever-developing technology to protect our most vulnerable, both at home and abroad, and where we truly value the rich tapestry of the natural world around us that has so nurtured our evolution as a species.  We must set in front of us this utopian vision, because the contrary is coming into ever-sharper focus.</p><p>Another President, Barack Obama, said: &quot;We are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it.&quot;  Our programme for Government, A Vision for Change, sets out a beginning to that journey.  The hill is steep and the way is long, but I am proud that our party has taken the brave decision to set out on that path.  The urgency of the task to hand demands it.</p></speech>

Instead, we got the blunt instrument of carbon taxes.  Like many others, I have been disappointed by the Green Party and how it has been absorbed into the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael way of thinking.</p>  <p>  The easiest, fastest and fairest way to deliver real change is to do it at a micro level.  We need to fast-track the ability of homeowners to sell electricity back to the grid.  This would make it viable for families to install energy-saving devices and microgeneration equipment.  It is a small and simple change, but it is a change that would have a major effect on the pockets of our constituents in the medium term and a change that would have a major effect on climate change in our country.</p> <p>I have twice asked parliamentary questions seeking new wind energy guidelines to be published.  We need those guidelines now.  A five-turbine wind farm has been proposed at Umeras between Monasterevin and Rathangan in County Kildare.  This area is adjacent to the new Barrow blueway which is under construction.  It is an area of immense natural beauty where flora and fauna are flourishing and is totally unsuitable for wind farms and turbines.  I am not against wind turbines <i>per se</i>but there must be areas designated in county development plans where they are not allowed.  We need to protect our beauty spots and ensure that there is a sufficient setback from existing homes and, in Sinn F&eacute;in's view, the setback should be ten times the height of the turbine.  The turbines proposed in Kildare are a massive 169 m high, almost three times the height of Liberty Hall.<br/><br/>In the same area, a local group has received funding from the just transition fund.  The group will put that money, funds that were raised locally and other amounts allocated by local councillors to fund a feasibility study for Umeras Peatlands Park, a Lough Boora-style visitor centre which will give a boost to the local tourism offering.  It will be close to Ballykelly Mills distillery, which is under construction, and not only will it contribute to the local economy, it will also preserve the raised bog for future generations.  I commend the work those involved have done so far and wish them well in bringing this project to fruition.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister to ensure that there is a just transition.  We cannot rely on the stick of carbon taxes to beat our older people in particular into submission.  We need specific incentives for our older population, many of whom have breathing difficulties and would benefit from the removal of their over-reliance on fossil fuels.  Older people are the backbone of this country and we need to ensure that we show them our appreciation.</p></speech>

Many families are having similar experiences to his and I hope the outcomes are as positive.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I have similar views on many of these issues and I agree with an awful lot of what he has said.  The Minister said earlier that this was going to be a huge challenge but he believes that we can do it, that we will be good at it as a country, and I agree with him about that.  Look at how we have managed the Covid-19 crisis.  We came together and showed solidarity as a community to fight the virus.  Climate change is as big a challenge for us to get through and we will only do so together.</p>  <p>  As has been shown during the Covid crisis, the key to solidarity and seeking to ensure we bring everyone along is communication.  We have seen over recent weeks how a lack of clear and concise communication and bringing people along has the potential to undermine the message.  That potential is also there on the issue of climate change.</p>  <p>  We are pleading for solidarity and people have to feel that they are listened to and that they understand what is being asked of them.  The Minister launched the waste policy last week.  There are a lot of good things and ideas in that policy and the Social Democrats will be supportive of it.  However, there was a sense at the time when he launched the policy that there was a lot of concern among especially vulnerable people in our communities, those on low wages and those who are already struggling.  Those people felt that the policy was going to impact them in a negative way.  Much of that came down to a lack of consultation and communication and a failure to see the problem from the side of those people.  I know that the Minister had an advisory group to help him work on the plan.  It was set up prior to his term in office and has been ongoing for a while.</p>  <p>  I think there are 30-odd groups within the advisory group, including the Retail Action Group, the Rediscovery Centre, the Irish Farmers Association and the Chartered Institute of Waste Management.  They are all important stakeholders that should be consulted in the development of such a policy but, unfortunately, there was no representative body for people at risk of poverty.  That was a big gap.  There was also no on-the-ground representative body for people with disabilities.  The statutory disability group was represented but there were no grassroots representative groups that could speak on behalf of people with disabilities and at risk of poverty.  If those voices had been involved in the consultation over the creation of this document and the development of this policy, the result last week would have been better, people would have understood from where the policy was coming and would not have been as fearful and concerned about the outcomes.</p>  <p>  All of us here are aware that a just transition is incredibly important.  Addressing climate change is not something that we can do while leaving a large section of our community behind.  It has to be a just transition and the key to ensuring that happens is applying principles of fairness and proportionality.  The Social Democrats believe that the best way to handle responsibly the transition to a low-carbon economy is to adopt ways which not only minimise the effect on the environment but which ensure that those least able to adapt are supported and are not negatively impacted by climate change policies.  The transition needs to be fair to everyone, including farmers, fishermen, people with disabilities and those living in poverty.  They are all stakeholders and we must poverty-proof, disability-proof and region-proof our climate action policies to make sure that all those affected are consulted in the drafting of these important policies.  That did not happen with the waste document that was published last week.  I do not think that was intentional but I ask that, in the future, the Minister ensures that those voices are heard and those people are a part of the consultation process for all climate change actions, documents and policies.</p>  <p>  The forestry Bill does not fall under the remit of the Minister but there are overlaps with his responsibilities.  I have serious concerns about the Bill from the perspective of environmental planning.  The Bill seeks to limit people's ability to engage in the forestry planning process.  I have concerns about its legality under the Aarhus Convention and I do not think it is going to solve the problem.  I do not think that stopping people from having their say on these particular applications will solve the problem because the issue is a resourcing one.  If the Department had ensured that there were sufficient resources to deal with the applications as they came in, we would not be in the position we will be when discussing the Bill next week and trying to force through something that will undermine people's rights to engage in environmental planning in this country.  We need to protect and strengthen people's participation in environmental issues, particularly now.  We also need to protect democracy and transparency which are cornerstones of climate action.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to hear the Minister talk about the different stages and elements of addressing climate action and the emphasis he has put on biodiversity.  This is something that I am keen to see incorporated into climate action development.  It is seen as a separate process a lot of the time and there is a lack of understanding that it would be difficult to address climate change without also addressing the issues that affect biodiversity.  There will be benefits for biodiversity when climate change is dealt with and we cannot address them as separate, siloed issues.  My preference would have been for biodiversity to have been incorporated into the Minister's Department when the Government was being formed because that is the best place for it.  It will cause difficulties that biodiversity falls under the remit of a separate Department and I think that responsibility needs to be integrated.  At the moment, we have separate plans, reports and actions for biodiversity and climate change.  We do not want to see that gap widening and we need to integrate all those plans and strategies to ensure a cohesive climate change and biodiversity focus over the next five years.</p> <p>It is not just biodiversity.  As the Minister himself mentioned, water quality, flooding and other issues the OPW deals with all need to be looked at through the lens of biodiversity.  I am hopeful that will happen although I am not 100% certain it will.  I will be raising it continually over the coming years.</p> <p> I do not know if the Minister had an opportunity to watch Sir David Attenborough's nature programme during the week.  It highlighted the incredible crisis we face globally.  When we watch these programmes, we can sometimes think of this as something that is happening elsewhere like on the plains of Africa, Alaska or Antarctica.  However, it is happening here and it is happening incredibly quickly.  It is not something we can ignore.  Experts estimate there has been a 97% decline in curlew numbers since the 1980s.  That is huge.  The curlew is not an isolated example.  Our bee populations are down by a third.  All of these fundamental biological aspects of our environmental system are fading away and we need to put all of our efforts into stopping that.  Addressing climate change will be key in doing so.  The problem is multifaceted and our response will also need to be multifaceted.</p> <p> We need to ensure our ecosystems are incorporated into a cross-sectoral adaptation policy and are not treated as separate processes but as a complement to our technological and economic measures.  When we talk about climate change we sometimes focus on emissions reductions, technology and electric vehicles but to address climate change we will need to look to nature a lot more.  I am hopeful that the Minister is taking this on board and that, as part of his remit, he will ensure we are not only looking at the technological aspects of climate adaptation and mitigation but at the natural aspects as well.</p></speech>

I am glad to see he is doing well.  I take the opportunity today to speak about the link between transport infrastructure, climate action and energy.</p><p>The first item I will raise with the Minister is the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy.  This is a &euro;3.5 billion investment package for Cork which will include commuter rail, bus corridors, light rail, park-and-ride facilities, walking and cycling facilities and the expansion of the existing road network.  The national planning framework to 2040 envisages Cork becoming the fastest growing city region in Ireland with a projected population increase of 50% to 60% by 2040.  The strategy will provide a coherent transport planning policy framework and implementation plan around which other agencies involved in land use planning, environmental protection and the delivery of other infrastructure such as housing and water can align their investment priorities.</p><p>This strategy presents a great opportunity to connect small towns and villages across east Cork with the city, to cut commuter times and, in general, to stop the spread of rural decline we have seen in parts of our county of Cork.  Until now, this has been forgotten under previous national development plans.  Connecting towns in a sustainable way is a great way to tackle the urban sprawl that leads to poor planning of development, which in turn increases traffic congestion and, thereby, pollution.  These are unnecessary consequences of poor planning.</p><p>I also highlight the requirement to address the need for an increase in the level of public bus infrastructure and to make bus travel more affordable.  At present, too few routes go to too few destinations.  Services are infrequent, unreliable and, in many cases, enormously expensive, as I have highlighted to the Minister before.  Since I first got involved in politics, I have campaigned for bus fares to be reduced.</p><p>To be fair to Bus &Eacute;ireann, it recently reduced fees on its Expressway services and expanded its services around County Cork but a significant portion of work remains.  A discussion needs to be had as to how to cut the cost of public service obligation, PSO, bus services if we are serious about getting cars off the road.</p><p>We must also look at the Leap card system around County Cork and the green fare area around Cork city.  This area is highly unfair.  It is does not suit anybody in my constituency who lives beyond Midleton.  Towns like Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Mallow are completely excluded from the benefits when those living in them could easily be availing of affordable and reliable public transport.</p><p>Let us talk about how serious a problem this is.  If one goes down to the Jack Lynch tunnel at 5 p.m. one will see a stack of cars clogging up two lanes of traffic as people go home from their work in Ringaskiddy and areas around that part of the south side of Cork city, where much of the major industry in the county is located.  It is absolutely staggering but what shocks me most of all is that one will not see a single bus.  No bus route that is sustainable or reliable enough connects the very big residential areas in Carrigtwohill, Midleton, Youghal, Fermoy and Mallow with those parts of the city to allow people to get to and from work.  I would like the Minister to consider if it would be possible to utilise the Jack Lynch tunnel for much-needed public transport services.</p><p>I would also like the Minister to look into making rail fares more affordable.  I was involved in the original push to bring Leap card services to Cork, as I mentioned before when addressing the Minister on a Topical Issue matter.  Work needs to be done on rail fares in the Mallow area.</p><p>School bus capacity will also be a critical part of getting cars off the road.  In my own constituency, since Covid-19 hit, there has been major problems with school bus routes including the route from Glenville to Fermoy, which local councillors have highlighted to me repeatedly.  Something needs to be done by the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Education and Skills.  The Departments need to take a more collective approach in the future rather than the Department of Education and Skills taking almost entire ownership of the issue of school bus routes, which is an area which could be improved upon without great effort or great costs to the Exchequer.</p><p>The Minister spoke earlier about the North-South interconnector but the big project in my constituency will be the Celtic interconnector between France and Ireland.  The programme for Government commits to the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector.  One of the main aspects of this commitment will be the completion of the Celtic interconnector which will be based at Claycastle beach in Youghal, County Cork.  </p><p>We recognise in the programme for Government that there is a need to provide for a just transition and to enable balanced regional development across the country.  I would therefore like to take some time to talk about some of the measures needed to ensure successful implementation of the Celtic interconnector in Youghal so that both the country and the community I represent can benefit.  Since 2011, EirGrid has been working with its French equivalent, R&eacute;seau de Transport d'&Eacute;lectricit&eacute;, to find the best way to develop the interconnector to benefit electricity customers and markets in Ireland, France and the EU.  The project is made up of several stages and is currently in stage 4, in which consultation is undertaken regarding what exactly should be built.</p><p>Claycastle beach in Youghal is emerging as the best performing option resulting in a subsea cable potentially connecting to an underground cable which would be buried behind the beach.  In the spirit of community buy-in, it is justified that EirGrid should provide funding for local amenities in the area and community to encourage more pedestrian activity and to take cars off of our roads.  To take a very simple example, the only secondary school in Youghal, my <i>alma mater, </i>Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide, has very poor access for pedestrians.  The school has been trying to address this issue for years but no funding has been available locally.  I am very happy to work with the Minister's councillors on Cork County Council to see if it would be possible to address this.  Our local authority is cash-strapped and has been unable to provide this infrastructure.  This is a very simple way to resolve the issue and the Minister should investigate whether it is possible.  This is just one example of how smart investment can help to reduce the use of cars and to reduce pollution.  There are also decaying coastal defences along Youghal's front strand.  This must be addressed if we are to adapt to our changing climate conditions.  Given the scale of investment going into this infrastructure project, it is achievable for the Government to assist with this matter.  </p><p>The positive externalities that will come from investment in Youghal would be very significant for the area and would ensure the benefits of a just transition are felt by people on the ground.  We must learn from the lessons of the past regarding large-scale energy projects.  Ensuring that local communities are consulted and respected in the implementation of such projects is vitally important.  I fully support the need to move the economy towards a carbon-neutral society, but we know from large structural changes in the past that this will require buy-in from the local community to ensure it is successful.  A consultative rather than a top-down approach from EirGrid is welcomed and very much needed.  Alongside this, the commitment to work with the EU to make community participation an integral part of installing new renewable energy infrastructure is also critical.</p> <p>We must ensure there is always a route for community participation in projects.  This must be upheld to ensure the successful execution of the project.</p> <p> The programme for Government has a commitment to increase the number of sustainable energy communities, which I very much welcome.  There is prioritisation of microgeneration and this will let people sell power back to the grid by June 2021.  This shows community energy can play a role in reaching the goal of at least 70% renewable energy.  I look forward to the Department implementation of the community benefit fund and to the Department ensuring that the community category within this option is successful.  I appreciate the Minister taking the opportunity to listen to my contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700044#UU00200"><p>At this range I hardly need a microphone, but it is great to get this opportunity to give my views on climate action and the Minister's approach to it.</p>  <p>  When we talk about climate action I firmly believe we need to talk about biodiversity at every opportunity because the two are intrinsically linked.  We are in the middle of a mass extinction with an estimated 1 million species threatened with extinction.  Among the many findings of a recent World Wildlife Fund report, the most striking for me was the fact that many species in the past 50 years have experienced an 85% decline.  This means people born in 1970 have experienced or seen an 85% decrease in some of these species right before their eyes or at the click of a finger.  This applies particularly to wetland species and other species associated with wetland habitats.  That is striking because these are the areas where we have seen it happen before our eyes or in the blink of an eye.  Often we are met with evocative and emotive images of polar bears in the Arctic circle and orangutans in south-east Asia.  However, it is really important that we look at what is happening at home as well because this is happening to Irish species in front of our eyes.</p>  <p>  For those of us who enjoy monitoring and recording species it is visible.  One example is a species like the yellowhammer, a small beautiful bunting, yellow, brightly coloured and unique.  We have seen this species in decline over the past ten or 15 years.  I remember seeing them in big numbers as a child around farmland areas.  The numbers have declined rapidly.  That is happening.  It is tangible.  It is there for use to see.  It is similar with the curlew, which Deputy Whitmore mentioned.  They still come to our shores as a wintering species.  However, as a breeding species they are near extinction.  We need to intervene and protect habitat.</p>  <p>  We need to discuss extreme weather events.  We are seeing extreme weather events globally.  One need only look to California or Greece.  They are on fire.  Again, we do not have to look that far to be able to see what is happening.  Right here, this summer while my constituency, Cork South-West, was underwater, the Wicklow Mountains were on fire.  We can see an extraordinary contrast on a small island.  This is evidence of global warming taking place before our eyes.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government is strong.  I know the Minister had a major part to play through his contribution to the programme for Government.  I liked listening to the Minister's contribution.  I liked what he had to say about the commitment to renewable energy and the fact that the climate action Bill is being brought to the House.  The Minister's passion for retrofitting is clear.  We need to accelerate some aspects.  The idea of electric cars is getting considerable backlash.  There are many barriers and there is talk of how it is not affordable, practical or achievable.  We have to combat that.  We can do this by putting infrastructure in place and making it more viable for people to buy electric cars.  In that way we will achieve critical mass and they will become more affordable.  With more electric cars on the road we will see a reduction in emissions.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister's commitment and that of the Green Party to modal transport.  The Minister will have buy-in from the Government partners on that.  It is important at this stage to ensure that it does not become urban-centric.  We need to look to rural and regional areas as well.  Modal transport includes public transport such as buses for rural areas.  It also means greenways and pedestrian ways.  I can give a perfect example relating to Clonakilty.  I know the Minister is familiar with west Cork.  The town is right next to the beautiful beach at Inchydoney.  The only safe way to get to Inchydoney from Clonakilty, which is only a couple of kilometres away, is by car.  That has to change.  Those days have to be in the past.  We need to look at pedestrian access to connect the two.  That example could be replicated throughout west Cork and Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have been speaking about habitat and the need to protect habitat.  That is vital.  This is not directly related to the Minister's role but it is vital that we bring forward the REPS 2 agri-environment scheme as fast as possible.  Every day I am sent images of ditches, trees and habitat destruction.  There is this awful temptation to point at the farmer and say it is the farmer's fault and say the farmer has no regard for wildlife.  That is not the fact of it.  Most farmers I know do not get up every day and decide to destroy habitat.  They are trying to earn a living.  They appreciate wildlife and biodiversity.  What is important is that at the moment we are incentivising them to do that through the single farm payment.  They are being penalised for having habitat on their land.  We need to start paying them to protect habitat and keep and plant trees on their land and protect important areas of wetland.  That needs to happen straight away.  We cannot wait for years for that to happen.  I thank the Minister for listening and I hope he takes my comments on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700044#UU00300"><p>I welcome the Minister.  His presence shows the absolute necessity of having rapid testing facilities.  That is something we need to keep working on from the point of view of ensuring we have the capacity to keep this show on the road.  It is as simple as that.</p>  <p>  I accept what several speakers have said in respect of floods, fires and winds.  We need not look as far away as California.  We have all experienced these in recent times so the reality of climate change is with us.  This pandemic has shown up several weaknesses in this society, whether they relate to housing, health or workers' rights.  Yet, there are opportunities.  I agree with the speakers who have spoken about the absolute necessity of any recovery being a green recovery.  Yet, it will not matter unless we can keep the show on the road.  I wish to point to the fact that this does not operate in a silo on its own as regards climate change.  We need to ensure imaginative thinking at an economic level and Marshall Plan-type imagination in respect of the stabilisation funding, future funding and the stimulus that will be required.  Without the moneys and without keeping society and our economy on the road, we will not be able to operate the particular moves that are needed to ensure we have not only climate justice but climate change as well.</p>  <p>  I wish to add my voice to the comments of some of my colleagues in respect of carbon shaming.  It is a fact.  Carbon taxes and so on are only operable in a situation where people have alternatives.  Otherwise, we are simply impoverishing people who are already poor.  The same goes for some of the initiatives relating to waste management and ending two-for-one, whether in respect of clothing or food.  We need to be careful that we do not carry out actions that possibly have good intent but that will impact on those who can least afford it.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will be in contact with other Ministers, whether in respect of the Office of Public Works or agriculture.  Obviously, we have to deal with the reality that is brought on in some cases by instances where we have failed to manage water systems and where we are dealing with added rains due to climate change.  We need to ensure that the catchment flood risk assessment and management project is put in place.  This will ensure that we can reduce the impact of flooding on the lives of people who are in areas that are exposed.  As time goes on there will be more and more of such people.</p>  <p>  We had forest fires in the Cooley Mountains over the summer.  While some good work was done by local firefighters in combination with the Air Corps and a great many volunteers, we really need afforestation measures in place.  State land needs to be looked at.  We also need to ensure that we have management of forests.  I would like to think that the Minister and his Department are in contact with the relevant people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Coillte to ensure this happens.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> The Minister is also responsible for the national broadband scheme.  When we talk about people working from home being, in some cases, a positive outworking of the current system in which we operate in that it reduces the number of people having to travel very long distances and can relieve some of the difficulties in areas like Dublin, we need to ensure that this is facilitated in as many areas as possible.  We also need to examine bespoke solutions in certain areas because there are technical solutions that will make up for some of the decisions made previously that may be able to circumvent some of those difficulties.  I would like to think the Minister will keep an open mind in that regard.</p> <p> We need to look at the difficulty in respect of one-off housing.  There is a belief that village developments are beneficial and can make more sense than individual one-off housing but those sort of opportunities do not exist in a great many rural areas.  I refer to areas where there is not any village development and so on.  We need to facilitate people living in rural areas.</p> <p> People have spoken about regeneration and retrofitting.  All I would say about retrofitting is that we need to look at council stock.  Some of the council stock in Dundalk in Louth County Council is very old and in need of major works.  The moneys are not available for the regular works so we need to ensure that we have a cover-all, multi-agency approach to all of this area.</p></speech>

I have seen plans on the opening of various projects but then we all listen to the news and the reports of what is happening here in this country and globally, and many Deputies have spoken about it.  The truth, however, is that the economic system of global capitalism we live under is destroying life on this planet as we know it before our very eyes and in this generation.  I do not believe we are on the road, or have a plan to be on the road, to achieving the cuts in CO2 emissions that we need or that we have a plan to achieve the renewable energy that we need, the radical and far-reaching changes, to quote the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and the radical transformation required across our economy and society to meet the challenge of climate change.</p>  <p>  We remain wedded to the logic of capitalism, the free market and an ever-expanding economic system based on gross inequality and abuse of the environment.  The majority of the people in that environment are victims of it because of the pursuit of profits and wealth for a tiny elite.  Nothing shows that better than the Californian fires and the mass extinction of species.  We know that EU funds will be open to gas projects.  A report shows that Ireland's temperature will increase by 1.6oC by the middle of the century and another report reveals that the world has not achieved a single target in the past ten years aimed at saving biodiversity or arresting the sixth great mass extinction.  While we have been preoccupied, rightly, with the Covid-19 crisis, this extinction and the climate crisis have rolled on regardless but they are hitting ever-new records and extremes, new devastation and locking us into greater catastrophe for this and future generations.</p>  <p>  Even the fall in the CO2 emissions that are occasioned by the mass lockdowns across the industrialised world showed us that emissions declined by 5% to 7%.  In reality, that is a blip in terms of what is needed.  The concentrations are rising steadily and we are now at 411 parts per million, which is the highest in 3 million years.  I hope these lockdowns might have shown the ruling elite that there are lessons to be learned in why we should not go after the personal behaviour of individuals because as much as personal behaviour changed during the lockdown, we did not manage to come near the achievement of a reduction in CO2 targets.  In reality, any policy that goes after changing personal behaviour is not working and will not work.  It is only designed to deflect us from the great ocean of truth that this economic system is driving extinction and climate change.</p>  <p>  I will finish by commenting on some of the policies that were promised in the near future.  Regarding the carbon taxes, I said previously when we were on the climate action committee and repeat that there are no safeguards to protect the most vulnerable when carbon taxes are increased.  This Government, and its predecessor, has refused to conduct the needed research into the extent of fuel poverty in our population or indeed the risk that it poses.  Increasing the cost of fuel, heating and electricity while offering no viable alternative to those who are most vulnerable is an attempt to pretend that individual behaviour is the problem.  I remain opposed to this increase because I know its consequences.</p>  <p>  With regard to renewable energy, I welcome moves to embrace and increase renewable energy projects, particularly in the community, but the problem with the scale of the increases is not that we are heading in that direction but that it is all in the hands of private global corporations.  There is a problem with that.  If we were to create a State renewable company and take over our own natural resources, it could result in huge investment and outcomes for the people.  Instead, we are again leaving this important area to the vagaries of the market and I believe our renewable targets will, therefore, remain unfulfilled.</p>  <p>  On the issuing of licences for gas and oil exploration, I welcome the Minister's confirmation that he will not be issuing new exploration licences but he needs to make sure that the large body of our waters that are in the hands of those who have bought up licences do not get the next step-up stage in those licences and acknowledge that the battle around that was won by the climate movement before this Government formed.</p>  <p>  Similarly, on the question of liquified natural gas, LNG, we need to be careful that although we may have banned fracked gas from our shores we need to make sure that no gas is allowed to be brought to our shores in liquified form from abroad.  That will be a battle for the Minister.  I will be behind him, as will the movement, because in fairness to the Shannon LNG activists, it is they who have achieved that.</p></speech>

No longer is it just killing people and destroying people's lives in the very poorest countries in the world but we can see, not for the first time, that it is striking home, like the Australian fires, in terms of what is happening in the west coast of the US, in California, in particular.  In a way, it encapsulates the nature of the problem we face whereby the impact of climate change is creating ideal conditions for those fires to get out of control.  Capitalism and private profit, however, is playing its role in helping that along, with the role of the energy company, a private, for-profit company, which basically did not do the repairs it was required to do because it treated that as an externality, like the way nature is treated as externality by capitalism, preferring to emphasise its dividends for shareholders.</p>  <p>  Another set of fires that are devastating and provide a terrifying glimpse of the negative feedback loops we can see is the fires at the Arctic Circle, which are bigger than ever.  In this season, there have been 35% more carbon emissions because there is a huge amount of peat under the ice, which perhaps has been burning for weeks or months, the ice melts and these explosive wildfires take place resulting in a huge amount of carbon emissions.  The science is very clear.  This is a runaway train and it will get faster and faster as a consequence of the carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  The bottom-line point is clear.  We do not have time for tinkering around the edges of this system.  I will vote and fight for every reform but the only way we will avoid the kind of climate catastrophe that is not far ahead of us is by a complete transformation of the nature of our society and our economy.  That can only be done on the basis of taking on the big polluters and, above all, the big fossil fuel companies and telling them that what are currently trillions of euro and dollars of assets on their balance sheets are now worthless because they will not be burning that oil and gas.  In my opinion, that will only be done on the basis of democratic public ownership and planning for our planet and for people.  I believe that can be done in a way that improves people's lives dramatically.</p>  <p>  In a way, the negative elements of the waste action plan encapsulate for me the problem with the approach of the Green Party and of this Government.</p> <p>If we accept so much in society as given, and if we take the nature of production, distribution, ownership and the economy as given, whereby we deal with the end product, we are left tinkering around the edges.  Moreover, it often involves, or has a tendency to involve, hitting ordinary people.  That is negative in and of itself but has the second negative effect of turning people off the kind of action we need.</p> <p> There are progressive elements in the waste action plan, including the deposit-and-return scheme, the idea of making sure all goods will be recyclable and the banning of single-use plastic items.  These measures are mostly required under EU directives but I welcome them.  Obviously, the negative commentary focused on fast fashion.  It was implied that there would be a tax on fast fashion or cheap clothing and it was reported that there would be a ban on multi-pack items.  For me, this encapsulates the problem.  The Green Party could have a whole range of good policies on the environment but the ones that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il would let it implement would be the ones that hit ordinary people and do not have much genuine impact.  They would say that those are fine.  We have to deal with the issues of fast fashion and major waste in agribusiness, supermarkets and so on but we will not achieve this by dealing with the endpoint.  We need to deal with them by dealing with the system.  We also need to deal with them by dealing with inbuilt obsolescence, which is a real part of capitalism, the objective being to keep unnecessary production and consumption going to generate profit.  We need to deal with the cultural obsolescence that comes from the advertising industry, which tells people they need the latest season's fashion, for example.  We need to take on the advertising industry, which involves an incredible waste of resources and creates artificial demand and, therefore, additional waste.  The only way to address this is to get to the root of the problem, which means tackling capitalism.</p></speech>

Having spoken to people involved in the production of community-based renewable energy, I have learned that the reviews of the process were positive.  This should be acknowledged.  However, I am asking today for certain changes to be made to how RESS 2 should operate to ensure we are supporting 100% community-based renewable energy projects as best we can.  Such projects assist in the production of renewable energy in Ireland that is sold and used in Ireland, with the profits of sales returning to communities in Ireland.  The scheme is a win-win for our economy and climate.</p>  <p>  The RESS is an auction-based scheme that invites renewable energy projects to compete for a guaranteed price for the electricity they generate.  The first of these auctions took place on 21 July last.  A series of such auctions will take place until 2030 with the aim of delivering on Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets.  RESS 1 was open to renewable-generated projects that were in receipt of a grid connection offer or were eligible to receive one under the enduring connection policy process.  Other eligibility criteria involved planning permission and landowner agreements.</p>  <p>  Under RESS 1, only 1% of the pot was reserved for community-based renewable energy providers.  The other 99% was open to renewable energy produced by developers.  The benefits of renewable energy produced by developers are, for the most part, exported and profits arising from its sale do not stay in Ireland.  On top of this, using renewable energy in Ireland that is not produced here does not help us to meet our carbon reduction targets.  Only renewable energy produced in Ireland can do this.  Under RESS 1, the 1% of the pot put aside purely for community providers was further divided so half of the allocation could be applied for by community projects half-owned by developers.  This was a further dilution of the very small allocation for community-based electricity producers.</p>  <p>  I call on the Minister to increase substantially the proportion of the pot currently reserved for community providers in respect of RESS 2 auctions.  I also call for the allocation to be reserved purely for community projects that are 100% owned by the community.  Projects with developers involved should be restricted to the large allocation that is already available to that side of the industry.  In tandem, grid capacity should be ring-fenced exclusively for community providers.  </p>  <p>  When power stations are upgraded, it will be vital that a certain proportion of the newly created capacity in the grid be reserved exclusively for community groups.  Otherwise, we will have community groups producing sustainable renewable electricity supplies with little or no access to the grid.  This has to change.  Policies must support groups such as the ones in question.  I call for these changes to be made in advance of the RESS 2 auctions.  Community-based renewable energy producers need to be supported in this.  They must be given a chance to compete in an auction for a greater percentage reserved exclusively for community groups that are genuinely 100% owned by the community.  It is only right that policy should support the production of renewable energy produced and sold in Ireland, with profits remaining in Ireland.  This is good for our environment and economy.</p>  <p>  As a country, we are 85% dependent on fossil fuels.  We have a small window of opportunity to reverse this trend and secure a better, healthier and more resilient future for the country.  This means changing the ways in which we heat our homes, travel and power our country.  A just transition can be aided by lending support to and promoting community projects because they produce renewable energy locally, protect our environment and provide our rural communities with a sustainable and efficient green income.  Only by bringing rural Ireland along on our just transition can we truly hope to meet our carbon-reduction targets.  Supporting projects such as those in question is not only the right thing to do for our shared environment but it also provides a just transition for communities in rural areas.  Climate action must involve an economic opportunity for rural areas.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider the increase to the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  Considering the Covid environment and the extreme economic pressure on companies this year, I ask that the increase be postponed until after the pandemic.  The cost base of companies has greatly increased.  While I accept the mechanics behind the PSO levy and the reason for it, the increase should be re-examined and postponed considering the economic climate.</p>  <p>   We were talking earlier today about forestry, the need for legislation to clear the logjam in forestry and the perennial objectors in the sector, who are few in number.  The position is the same for wind farms.  People who live a long distance from wind farms in rural areas are objecting to them.  We need to examine this.  Genuine objectors who live locally obviously have, and should have, the right to object but the legislation needs to be strengthened so only genuine objectors can object to wind farms.  Again, they are the way of the future and we need more such projects in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Everybody in the House is relieved to know that all is well for him in the family home.</p>  <p>  I welcome the confirmation last week that a number of Longford-based projects have been approved for funding from the just transition fund.  It was particularly good to see the inclusion of an ambitious technology energy cluster project for the site of the ESB power station in Lanesborough.  The proposal has the potential to put the Shannonside town at the centre of alternative and green energy production, and it would certainly open up a new world in a very specialist area of research and energy development for the region.  I need to point out, however, that recent events concerning the issuing of a tender by the ESB for the demolition of the power station in Lanesborough and the sister plant in Shannonbridge have the potential to put the project and other just transition projects in jeopardy.  It is important for the Minister and his Department to realise that the decision to grant funding for the project while the ESB proceeds with plans for the demolition of the Longford site is truly farcical.  It is further evidence of the ESB's determination to cut and run and abandon the region.</p>  <p>  I am somewhat concerned that a joint application from Longford and Roscommon county councils for funding for a proposed economic plan for the Lanesborough-Ballyleague area was rejected.</p> <p>The decision was disappointing in the extreme as this particular community is very much at the heart of the area affected by decarbonisation with a local power station and the Bord na M&oacute;na Mount Dillon works on its doorstep.  Indeed, this entire community where I grew up was founded on Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  I truly believe the proposed study would have been, and will be, the basis for future plans in the area and, as such, one would have thought it would have been ideal for just transition funding.  I appreciate the difficulty for the two local authorities was that an element of the planning for the strategy had already commenced.  On that basis, it was deemed ineligible.  Similarly, I am aware there is no appeals mechanism for any project promoters to appeal the decision.  However, I appeal to the Minister to go back to the Department and the just transition team and ask it to review this particular application again because I believe the strategy that will emanate from this project will be critical to future plans for the area.  Indeed, it would be somewhat ironic, if not comical, that the actual research and subsequent plan was not funded through the just transition fund.</p> <p> To conclude on a personal level, having grown up in Lanesboro and owing an awful lot to Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB community, I know full well how important this strategy and plan will be the future of the community.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to have another look at it.</p></speech>

I want to speak to him about an opportunity that now clearly presents itself in constituencies such as mine of Longford and Westmeath.  It is an opportunity that businesses and workers were hesitant to explore for a long time because of fear of the unknown but had foisted on them because of Covid-19.  I am speaking about remote working, the positive impact it can have on our environment and its role in the fight against climate change.</p><p>The benefits of remote working are numerous and, in many cases, extremely obvious, particularly, in constituencies like mine where public transport can be sparse, non-existent or fragmented.  We need to reduce our emissions from vehicles and reduce our fuel usage.  In April this year, we reduced our auto fuel usage by more than 55% compared to the same period in 2019 and because remote working involves significantly higher use of digital resources and tools, it generates a lot less waste.  Not only has remote working benefitted the environment and resulted in lower utility costs for businesses, employers I have spoken to tell me they have seen a measurable increase in productivity, decreased sick leave days and an increase in their reputation among their customers.  Covid-19 may have forced the hand to instigate remote working but in the vast majority of cases, it has delivered and can continue to deliver.</p><p>Covid-19 has brought, and continues to bring, untold heartbreak and hardship to many people.  It has, however, also brought us, as a society, to the edge of opportunity to do things differently for the benefit of our environment and our communities, particularly rural communities.  However, action is needed before that opportunity passes us by.  We all know we must make changes and we are doing so for the protection and benefit of the environment and to help halt the devastating consequences of climate change.  Here is a real chance to support that change while having a positive impact on improving physical and mental health and well-being with a work-life balance while at the same time positively contributing to the economic regeneration of our rural areas.</p><p>Covid-19 has taught us we must rethink how we work and interact with each other as well as the space around us.  It has opened up the possibility of remote working to a much wider cohort and made us all see the multiple benefits of removing long daily commutes from our lives.  During the most severe restrictions, people discovered areas of their own communities they never knew existed because they were so time-poor.  If people in my constituency were not travelling up to two and a half hours each way daily to work, it would increase the amount of time they have to spend in their homes and communities.  These are homes for which they are paying large mortgages but do not have the time or energy to fully enjoy and which are in communities from which they are virtually absent for most of the week.  They would have time to be physically involved in their local clubs and organisations.  They could enjoy their libraries, parks and their children's extracurricular activities, all while contributing to rural and regional regeneration and reducing their carbon footprints.</p><p>However, none of this will be possible as long as the communications <i>status quo</i>continues.  A young constituent of mine had to go two miles and then literally climb a hill before she could garner enough coverage to submit her schoolwork.  In 2013, we all lauded Commander Hadfield as he tweeted from the international space station.  It is a feat I am glad he was not trying to do in areas of my constituency because he simply would not have been able to.  We have passed into shameful territory in this regard.  High-speed broadband has become a vague promise and has taken on almost mythical properties.  Phone coverage may be classed as &quot;fair&quot; in many areas of my constituency but I think we can all agree it is certainly not fair that in 2020 dependable phone coverage and quality Internet is not available outside of larger rural areas.</p><p>Let us not entirely lose sight of the &quot;just&quot; in just transition.  The Minister's programme for Government talks of assisting rural economies, digital strategies and developing a strategy for remote working through the rapid roll-out of a national broadband plan.  Where are these plans at and when will they become a reality?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700047#XX00300"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go bhfuil s&eacute; go maith.  Obviously, climate change is very real and we have seen ten of the warmest years on record happen since 1998.  We have seen the CO2 of hundreds of millions of years of organic growth stored in the ground literally being put into the environment in the space of approximately 100 years, radically changing the chemistry of the environment.  We are also at a time of mass extinction where hundreds of thousands of acres of our oceans are floating plastic islands.  As a generation, we must probably be the dirtiest in the history of the planet.</p>  <p>  Every time we discuss the issue of climate action in this Chamber, it is riven with contradictions in so many ways.  The previous Governments, the Fianna F&aacute;il Government and the two Fine Gael Governments, literally swam in greenwashed statements, press statements, photo opportunities, brochures and occasions to show off their green credentials.  However, never have I seen Governments do so little as regards an aspect they talked about so much.  One of the biggest threats to this issue is all the talk and no action of a political system that is phenomenally cynical.  People are looking to virtue signal on this issue and yet we see precious little action on the environment.  If anything is to happen, first and foremost, this D&aacute;il must mean what says and do what it means.</p>  <p>  I want to mention the media on this particular issue.  When it is questioning politicians the media obviously needs a bit of fire and a bit of heat.  There is nothing better to achieve that heat and fire than to put a politician in an awkward situation.  However, every time the environment is discussed by the media they always focus on the really difficult issues.  If one focuses on the difficult issues all the time, very quickly one will turn people off the idea of taking action on this really important issue.  Of course, all this is not going to be easy and serious effort will be needed.  There is, however, a phenomenal level of low-hanging fruit when it comes to the environment.  There is a phenomenal number of opportunities to make real, positive change in our society and tackle the environment as well.  This budget definitely offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where the needs of the environment and of the economy intersect in an investment stimulus that can start to focus on radically changing the way this country operates into the future.</p>  <p>  What I mean by low-hanging fruit and the easy and positive things that should have been done years ago are things like the deep retrofit of homes.</p> <p>In 2011, I introduced a detailed document on how we could in five years deep retrofit all the homes in the State that needed it, and it happened at the same time as an enormous crash when we needed to keep people in the construction industry.  Obviously, it was never actioned in any way at all.  The Government at the time, of course, put a few bob into retrofitting so that it could claim that a number of houses were being retrofitted every year.  However, it has only scratched the surface of the housing stock - the public building stock and the commercial building stock - in the country.  Obviously, deep retrofitting has the benefit of saving fuel, making the inhabitants more comfortable and saving significant amounts of money.  One of the first things we need to do is spend radically on that element in coming years.</p> <p> One country in the EU has no microgenerated electricity connected to the national grid.  What country is that?  Pat Rabbitte, if anybody remembers him, spoke about microgeneration to beat the band a number of years ago and still we have none.  Obviously, I welcome the Minister's mentioning that the auction has led to approximately 80 projects.  Despite all the talk we have had so far, not one project is plugged in yet and it may even take two years for that to happen.  Microgeneration represents a real opportunity.</p> <p> Farmers are hammered owing to low incomes, but they are ideally placed to produce electricity as a crop either through small-scale wind, solar or bio-digestion.  We could easily allow for farmers to increase their incomes by &euro;3,000, &euro;4,000, &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 a year through microgeneration.  That would allow us to substitute out fossil fuel imports that are coming from dictator-type countries.  It would benefit our balance of payments, benefit farmers' incomes and benefit world politics, but it still has not happened.  Even the auction system that was used previously does not allow for small-scale community facilities to get involved in that process, and I hope that can be allowed in the future.</p> <p> Much of the green energy production that has happened so far has happened in large-scale, international vulture fund-type companies which have come in to build industrial-size turbines right up against people's houses.  If one were to design a solution to turn people off energy, it would not be possible to select a better way than by doing that.</p> <p> Public transport is another logical way to reduce our fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions radically, and yet public transport has been the poor relation of transport for the past two Governments.  On several occasions I have spoken in this Chamber about simple projects like the rail line to Navan.  Meath has the largest number of commuters in the country.  It is the only county in the country where the majority of workers leave that county every day to go to work.  No other local authority has that experience.  Navan is the largest town in the country without a rail line and yet no Government so far has shown a jot of interest in it.  We may have a review in the future of some kind of potential for a feasibility study.  It goes back to the cynicism people have of process and talk without any action.</p> <p> The Minister spoke about regional development.  This country is turning into a city state.  London is considered a major outlier in British terms regarding the economic activity happening in London compared with the rest of Britain, but Dublin's overgrowth in comparison with the rest of the State puts it in the ha&rsquo;penny place.  We have an overheating city with a sprawling commuter belt that extends to a third of the country.  People are commuting from Munster, Connacht and Ulster into Dublin and we have an emptying rural sector after that.  This crisis provides an opportunity to reverse the lopsided development that has happened.  That change will not happen under current Government plans.</p> <p> Cycling and walking are simple things.  I have been cycling from Castleknock into Leinster House for ten years.  I have been on the quays and seen mothers with two- or three-year-old children on the seats on the back of their bicycles fighting for spaces with trucks and buses.  We appear to be designing road space to scare people away from making the transition to bicycles.</p> <p> Farmers should be the guardians of the habitats that help for biodiversity and carbon sink.  It is incredible that in applications to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine for the single farm payment, farmers are required to exclude from any calculations land that is not in use, in other words bogs, wetlands and scrub.  It is absolutely bonkers to use language about more biodiversity, but action going in the opposite direction.  Any talk about climate change must take into consideration that the Government took an ideological decision to allow beef to be imported into this country from South America through the Mercosur deal.  This means that vast swathes of Amazon forest will be felled to allow beef produced at a lower quality and in a less environmentally friendly manner to be transported thousands to miles to Ireland to displace Irish beef.  It is not possible to run with that policy while claiming to be in favour of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p> It is important that we bring people with us.  Sometimes if we find that people may be changing their minds or resisting a particular policy, the Government or the system can come down heavy on them.  Some of the Covid restrictions we have seen do not bring people with us.  They actually seek to force people to come in a particular direction.  I will give two examples of not bringing people with us.  One is the outsize industrial wind turbines that are on land.  We need to go offshore for our wind energy generation in the future.  The North-South interconnector is another example of infrastructure that annoys people.  It makes people furious because they are losing the quality of their living environment, the quality of their homes, and the value of their farms, businesses and homes.  There is no greater way to turn people against the Government than by building more than 400 monstrous pylons right up against people's homes.  That is the catalyst that causes resistance.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to ensure that the plan for the North-South interconnector, which I support because I support an all-Ireland energy market, is undergrounded.  I will introduce a Bill to the Chamber to underground the North-South interconnector.  The Fianna F&aacute;il website states that it wants to see it undergrounded.  Sinn F&eacute;in also claim it wants it undergrounded, but the Executive in the North has just given planning approval for it there.  We need to be able to end cynicism on these issues.  There needs to be a sympathy between the language we use on these topics and the actions we take in this Chamber.  That Bill on the North-South interconnector will allow for political parties to ensure they mean what they say.  That North-South interconnector would have been built ten years ago if the Government at the time had the cop-on to listen to the people in the constituencies and had undergrounded it.</p> <p> I went to Belgium to look at its network for transmitting electricity.  It uses the consent of the people as a central aspect to planning and development in its system.  That country is reducing the level of electricity transmitted on pylons because it is microgenerating it locally where it is used locally.</p></speech>

I am pleased, but not surprised, to hear statements from representatives of other parties in this Chamber confirming how urgent it is that we take action on climate change.  No one party has a monopoly on the topic of climate change.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies in the remainder of this debate to hear their perspectives too.</p>  <p>  It is incumbent on us all, from all parties and political traditions, to apply our best thinking on how we can transform society to lower our emissions radically.</p> <p>The task ahead is so hard it is almost unimaginable.  It will affect us all, urban and rural, young and old, rich and poor.  For decades, the growth of our economy and society has been predicated on the burning of fossil fuels.  We know we need to reduce this reliance extraordinarily quickly.  The science is clear, it is brutal and there is little time for nuance.  We will need all the talents in this House and outside it to make the necessary changes.</p> <p> Those of us who describe ourselves as socialists will need to bring to the task our awareness of equality and our desire to make a fair society.  Those of us who describe ourselves as capitalists will have to bring our awareness of the power of markets and enterprise to achieve innovation and rapid change.  Those of us who are republican will need to bring our awareness of the importance of cherishing all the children of the nation equally, for it is our children who will have to carry the burden of our failures.  Those of us who call ourselves technocrats must bring our awareness of the need to follow the very best scientific advice, no matter how uncomfortable our conclusions.  Those of us who are democrats, which is all of us, will have to call on our awareness of the need to bring people along with us.</p> <p> I will not attempt to categorise myself according to the political categories I have mentioned.  I will say that those of us who consider ourselves to be environmentalists, among whose number I include myself, need to bring an awareness that we do not have all the answers.  We have left it too late and we do not have time to celebrate a vindication.  Indeed, we have made our own mistakes in our political response to climate change.  We must work with everyone, from all political traditions, to achieve action on climate.  What we must not do is attempt to use the need for action on climate as a proxy for other political battles.  The battle is not one of eco-socialism versus eco-capitalism.  The battle is about harnessing both eco-socialism and eco-capitalism and combining the best ideas from both traditions in pursuit of our urgent need to leave a habitable planet for future generations.</p> <p> I am hopeful about the success of our efforts because the Oireachtas has already shown it can be done.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action in the last D&aacute;il was a cross-party committee that undertook an incredible amount of work, culminating in the publication of a 157-page report which was extremely comprehensive.  I pay tribute to the different political groups in the Oireachtas for contributing so ably to that committee, namely, Independents 4 Change, the Rural Independent Group, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party-Social Democrats Group, Fine Gael, Solidarity-People Before Profit, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Seanad Civil Engagement Group.  Each group brought its own analysis of the changes ahead and succeeded in working with others to achieve a consensus on the way forward.  It was universally recognised that the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, did a fantastic job of chairing the committee.  She is not in the Chamber this afternoon but I take the opportunity to thank her and the Deputies and Senators who contributed to the report.  They have shown us the way forward through hard work and intense co-operation.</p> <p> This Government has indicated its intention to take forward many of the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas committee by way of a climate action Bill that will be published soon.  I confirm my intention, as the incoming Chairman of the committee that will be examining the Bill, to work with all parties to interrogate that legislation and make it as ambitious as it possibly can be.  We have a tough task ahead of us.  If we work together, as Government and Opposition and from myriad political traditions, we have a small chance of succeeding in tackling the singular and existential issue of our time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700049#ZZ00300"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Michael Collins.  There is not one person in the Oireachtas who does not want to help with the climate action effort and who does not have a green initiative of his or her own.  Even if the Government is 100% successful in its plan to reduce emissions and have a greener way forward for Ireland, it will leave 1.7 million people and 300,000 households behind in its programme.  If we look at the process of building a new house, the planning permission states that one must include something that will contribute to a greener environment, such as solar panels, air-to-water heat pumps or geothermal heat pumps.  I am in full agreement with that requirement but what will happen to the people who cannot afford to upgrade their house, even with grants?</p>  <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, was established under legislation introduced in 2007.  I understand the agency sought a meeting with the Minister but was refused.  The Government should be sitting down with everyone.  NORA has &euro;300 million in reserve.  That money comes from the 2 cent per litre of fuel which the Government continues to collect from every Irish motorist and householder.  It is the person who does not have access to regular, reliable and convenient public transport who must pay this levy.  The person whose home has poor energy efficiency and which requires tens of thousands of euro to get it heat pump-ready is paying out.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about the impact of these measures on people in rural Ireland.  I have a document in front of me with a graph showing certain statistics as they apply in different parts of the country.  It shows that in Dublin, there is 10% reliance on oil products, while the figure for Limerick is 47%.  I will go though more of these figures to bring the Minister up to terms with how rural Ireland is paying for his projects without any reinvestment going back into rural areas.  Cork and Kildare both have a 40% reliance on oil, the figure for Roscommon, Carlow and Longford is 60% in each case, Mayo has a 62% reliance on oil, and the figure for Cavan-Monaghan is between 70% and 80%.  The only place in the country that has reduced its emissions, because it has access to natural gas and other alternatives, is Dublin.  That is being paid for by every motorist and householder outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  We might ask how the people in rural Ireland are being rewarded for carrying the levy.  Approximately 686,000 households in Ireland are dependent on oil because there is no available alternative.  Some 50% of the energy produced in Ireland is not liable to any carbon tax and there is no climate action levy applicable to it.  It is a fact that rural people use the most fuel but that is because they have no other option and they certainly are paying for it.  How does the Minister expect to reduce carbon emissions if he will not talk to the oil companies?  If I go to the petrol pump tomorrow morning, I will pay &euro;61.30 tax on every &euro;100 I spend.  If I am to get to work, I must travel and for that I must use fuel.  At the diesel pump I will pay &euro;56.50 in tax.  The Minister is rewarding people in rural Ireland with funding of &euro;8.5 million for gas projects in Dublin, &euro;20 million to Dublin City Council for heating schemes and &euro;4.5 million for the Tallaght district heating scheme.  He needs to give people in rural Limerick and other parts of rural Ireland their money back and help them to reduce their emissions by putting the necessary infrastructure in place.  I am asking the Minister to give us back our money.  We are not willing to pay for Dublin to have zero emissions.  We want zero emissions ourselves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700049#ZZ00400"><p>I am delighted to see the Minister back in the Chamber and I wish him and his family the best.</p> <p>Climate change is a key topic and I am keen to ensure our actions in the D&aacute;il will continue the safeguarding of our livelihoods and our way of life in our Ireland.  I congratulate the Minister on the recent passing of the National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Act 2020 which will establish the Climate Action Fund.  I sincerely hope it will be developed properly and efficiently by the Department.  I also sincerely hope the Government will not raise the tax on diesel in next month's budget.  At the moment crude oil is cheap and this has helped those with trucks and working vehicles simply to survive at this time.  I see an opportunity to create new industries around energy in Ireland.  I will be keen to discuss with the Government how we can create quality jobs and industries in my constituency and throughout Ireland.</p> <p> I wish to raise some key points about action on climate change which I have previously raised.  I welcome our transition to cleaner energy sources but we must transition in a practical, sustainable and just way.  Our economy and living standards must be prioritised.  We have all witnessed the severe disruption Covid-19 has brought upon us.  The failure of the Government to invest in our health system and our hospitals has created a security of supply issue for our healthcare.  We are still trying to flatten curves due to underinvestment and bad planning in our health sector.  We must ensure that vital sectors such as energy, agriculture, fisheries, health and construction are not falling into the same trap of bad planning and that the Government does not run off like headless chickens in one direction just because the optics look good in the short term.</p> <p> Offshore wind may be an opportunity for constituencies like mine, Cork South-West, to create jobs and it may suit the Government to site these wind turbines in areas like the south west.  However, the Government must help Irish-owned companies to get off the ground in this sector so we can build and promote Irish expertise and ownership in this area.  This will eventually allow us to export expertise globally.  For example, west Cork and Cork Harbour could be great locations for the assembly of offshore wind turbines.  There is also a big opportunity for us to develop rural areas in this sector if it is managed correctly.</p> <p> We must play the long game when it comes to our energy transition.  We need to consider all of the good options for our energy supply, especially given the crisis we are in.  Renewables will not solve our energy supply issues overnight.  It will take many years of good planning from Government Departments to solve them.  Having access to competitive energy will be a key issue for Ireland as we come out of this crisis and head into the future.  As we move towards cleaner energy, the most likely, realistic solution will be a combination of renewables and natural gas.  We must ensure we have access to competitive energy in the meantime as well.</p> <p> A case in point is that the Brexit readiness plan put forward by the Government is a shambles when it comes to energy.  It states that it is expected that the current rules for trading gas between the UK and Ireland will be the same but that the UK will no longer be bound by EU law obligations.  Expectations are not exactly something we can depend on, especially with the EU-UK negotiations.  There is also no mention of what might happen if the UK puts tariffs on energy exports.  This could hugely affect energy pricing in Ireland and hit us and our constituents directly in the pocket.  Gas is responsible for more than 50% of our energy production.  As the Minister knows, the Kinsale gas field recently finished production and we now import two thirds of our gas needs from the UK.  This amount is increasing as the Corrib field is in decline.  In the event of a gas supply emergency in the UK, how could we ensure we had gas flowing into Ireland given the UK is under no obligation to supply?  Therefore, we have a huge security of supply issue staring us in the face.  Even if there is a deal on Brexit after January, we must comply with our EU obligations on energy.  I want us to look for the best sources of energy for Ireland, deal or no deal.  The situation is amazing because we have had a long time to prepare and we are now sitting fully exposed as far as our energy supply is concerned.  What is the Government doing to mitigate these risks?  I ask that the Minister improve our security of supply situation for natural gas.  The Minister should consider, at the very minimum, a floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, import terminal which can guarantee our security of supply while offshore wind and renewables are developed.</p> <p> As I have mentioned before, I have companies coming to me that are ready to provide solutions to our energy issues and wish to move under existing policies.  What are the Minister and the Government doing to ensure the security of supply of our energy and to support my constituents in the creation of local jobs around offshore wind and LNG projects?</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for being present throughout all three and a half hours of this debate, a portion of which I chaired.  It has been very enlightening to listen to Members on all sides of the House talking about the importance of this issue.  I am very fortunate to have been appointed to the committee which will look at the forthcoming Bill which is being worked on.  I very much welcome the remarks of the incoming Chairman of the committee, Deputy Leddin, particularly his reference to the need for all of us to draw on all traditions in the House for good ideas.  As he said, no party has a monopoly on good ideas when it comes to the environment.</p>  <p>  There are a number of areas where the work of the previous committee and the previous Government in putting forward a comprehensive report on climate action and a climate action plan should be recognised.  I refer in particular to the need to pay very careful attention to those who are less well-off.  I echo the comments made by Deputy O'Donoghue about those we will miss, namely the individuals who cannot afford to invest in the level of improvements to their property which would lessen their carbon footprint and their heating bills.  That of course refers to older people and people in receipt of the State pension, among others, who reside in their own private dwellings or local authority stock.  There are schemes in place to assist, but sometimes a person is given a certain amount and cannot match it or come up with the initial sum required.  That is an area we need to look at in the climate action Bill, when it comes before the Houses in the next few weeks or months, and in any future plans we have.</p>  <p>  My constituency colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, covered some of the issues in our constituency quite comprehensively.  I will not repeat them except to say that climate change has led to very significant flooding in some coastal environments in the constituency.  This has particularly affected Portrane but also places like Rush.  While the local authority and the Government have stepped in, they have done so very late, such that we have already lost one property and we are about to lose another.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is aware of this.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is very much aware of it given that it is his constituency.  While we may have all the best will in the world when it comes to implementing proposals, sometimes we are very slow to come to the table and produce them.  We have EU obligations to adhere to, as well as domestic legislation and proposals.  It has been five or six years since the first of four Ministers with responsibility for the OPW visited Portrane beach.  I was there on each occasion but it is only now that we are engaged in the public consultation process to implement something.  While interim measures have been put in place, as Deputy Duncan Smith mentioned, five years have passed.</p>  <p>  Deputy Smith also mentioned a number of areas which are very close to my heart and this includes public transport in northern Dublin.  During Fine Gael's first term in office of the current sequence, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who is now the T&aacute;naiste, opened the Luas interconnector.  Many other projects must happen in order to take people out of their cars but BusConnects and Metro North, of which I know the Minister is very much aware, are projects I will be vigorously pursuing as far as the commitments in the programme for Government are concerned.</p>  <p>  There are a number of other areas I wish to touch upon.  The Minister mentioned some of them in his opening statement, which I was very pleased to hear.  I refer in particular to land usage.  This is not just about agriculture but also about the development of land and the impact that can have on our environment.  I worked on several development plans as a county councillor prior to becoming a Member of this House.  It is important that we recognise and perhaps upskill not just members of local authorities but also the staff of the local authorities about planning and what is appropriate to put into development land, particularly as we have so much of it in the north of the county.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The other issue I want to mention is that I am a firm believer in our afforestation programme but we need to be more ambitious.  I would like to see more community groups engaged in this through local authorities or the Department.  I would also like to see more indigenous trees forming part of the afforestation programme.  We have huge swathes of pine and other trees in the country and it would be advantageous in the long term for us to look at particular native species.</p> <p> I have already touched on housing standards.  It is fantastic that the standard is now so high but I echo Deputy O'Donoghue's comments on the less well-off who are not in a position to upgrade their properties for climate change and carbon emissions.</p> <p> I echo Deputy Leddin's hope that the committee of all parties will be able to go through the Bill when it is presented to us and vigorously assess how effective it will be in implementing the plans that are there and amending plans, if needs be, on the part of the State.  I very much look forward to this and I thank the Minister for his time this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700051#BBB00200"><p>I echo what Deputy Farrell said about the attendance of the Minister for the duration of the debate.  It is something I would have expected of him given his interest and certainly, like myself, he was a very regular attender at the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action in the previous D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Seven or eight months ago, we would not have thought there was something incongruous about speaking with such gusto about climate action in the midst of Covid.  The pandemic is a priority and people's minds are rightly focused on the issues facing us as opposed to the issues facing the planet and yet we recall, as though it were from a different lifetime, the early days of Covid when everybody went into their gardens and they were digging and planting.  We could hear birdsong in the cities and towns.  I remember getting a scent in the air that I had not experienced since I was a young boy and it evoked a whole load of memories.  There was a great uplift of spirits when we thought Covid was going to last just a couple of weeks and we could adapt our lives with the learning we had from the weeks of lockdown.  Those weeks of lockdown were instructive in terms of giving people hope and enabling people to see what quality of life is like, not only with their children and grandchildren but with nature, and that we do not have to travel to live a full life and have experiences through all the senses because they are all around us.  We are blessed to have such a beautiful country in this regard.  Even in the constituency I represent, people are 30 seconds from the hills and mountains and 15 minutes from the sea.  Everybody in Dublin South-West is a matter of minutes from the mountains and the great resource they are.</p>  <p>  I cannot help bring to mind the generation of those aged 20 and upwards.  Those aged 25 were born just before the first crash and they lived through it.  Those who are a little older saw their families suffer the consequences of global recession.  Covid has come and they are living with it.  They should be our priority because, to use their language, many of them have suffered the embarrassment and humiliation of having to return home to live with their parents and give up their independent lives and the ability to travel, explore, see the world and carve out an independent future for themselves.  We will probably face a further global recession.  On top of this, they also carry the burden of climate action, which is a considerable burden for a generation.  Climate action on its own is heavy and weighty, never mind the existence of a pandemic and the budgetary and fiscal situation facing the country, although, following the First World War and the Spanish flu the east coast of the United States went through the roaring 20s for seven or eight years and then hit the darkest depression that has ever hit anybody.  This generation needs minding, not in terms of cosseting but in terms of prioritising their future.  I am 55 and climate action is having some degree of impact on my life but it does not look like it will have anything like as dramatic an impact on the life of my generation as it will on those coming behind us.</p>  <p>  The climate action Bill has been mentioned throughout the afternoon.  It deals with the big ticket items.  There is no point in repeating what has been said and there will be other occasions to speak about it.</p>  <p>  The Minister is familiar with the fact that a couple of Dublin local authorities took incredible, positive advantage of the fact we had a lockdown and implemented measures such as cycle tracks and pedestrian measures which they had been attempting to do for years.  They did it under the cover of darkness but everybody applauded.  They have been widely and positively received.  Some were not as proactive as others.  My local authority, South Dublin County Council, was not as proactive but D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council deserves to be applauded for what it is doing.</p>  <p>  On the Minister's desk is a review carried out by his predecessor on e-scooters.  I would love a decision on them.  A very climate action friendly move could be made along the lines of the city bikes scheme, not to throw it open to everybody but to have a system where speed could be controlled, safety could be regulated and parking could be remotely monitored using the latest technology.</p>  <p>  Electric bikes are becoming popular and there is a promise in the programme for Government that they would be covered by the cycle to work scheme.  That is fine but it still means people have to shell out quite a few quid.  Electric bikes are not cheap but it is really exciting technology.  As the Minister knows, in Belgium employers receive 125% tax relief on any e-bike measure they introduce in the workspace.  These measures could be used to purchase e-bikes for their employees, to purchase equipment such as bicycle shelters or to construct shower facilities in the workplace.  It covers any investment made in e-bike technology.  Employers must demonstrate the employees have foregone their cars and are using the e-bike as a way of commuting to work.  Some employees in Belgium are paid by their employer to do so.  At the Velo-City conference last year, one employee spoke about receiving &euro;70 per month.  This is because the employees in question get so much per kilometre cycled if they forgo their cars.  I would love to see us be a little bit more dramatic on this.  I made this point to colleagues and I am disappointed not to see it in the programme for Government but we will keep plugging at it.</p>  <p>  I am working on a Bill and the researchers in the House have been very good and I pay tribute to them.  The Bill is on the disposal of waste packaging.  I will chat to the Minister before I am ready to bring it to the House and I hope he will support it.  Some stakeholders will not be too pleased about it because it would involve a degree of change but it would engender a chain reaction of behavioural change that could only be good for the environment and climate action.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700051#BBB00400"><p>We did not hear a single word denying the science of climate change as well as hearing the words of wisdom.  This is why I stand up proud of the D&aacute;il, our political system, the Seanad and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  To go back to what I said at the beginning of my opening contribution, it is not all bad in our country.  In other parliaments there is real division, doubt and dissension on this critical issue and science is not acknowledged.  This is not the case here.  I accept absolutely the words of wisdom.  What we heard is that we do not want to hit the individual.  The concern about carbon tax is that it is the only measure and all the guilt, shame and price is being put on the individual.</p> <p>That is not the plan or what will work or where we want to go.  This matter requires this and subsequent D&aacute;ileanna to work together.  As Deputy Leddin said, this will not work on a divisive basis because it will just stop and start and we will not get anywhere.  It will take a whole series of Parliaments making the investment and other decisions to make it easier for individuals to do the right thing without carrying all the costs or burden.  One needs all the tools, however, as it is such a massive change we have to make.  One needs carbon pricing and a whole range of other measures as well.</p> <p> Another point I heard was to not forget or harm rural Ireland.  Deputy O'Donoghue is the epitome of what I said about not denying climate change.  I heard him saying that rural Ireland has to go zero-carbon too.  Rural Ireland should be first.  The thing we are about to do is technically difficult, particularly insofar as it involves particularly switching to electric vehicles and heat pumps, which will be the two big changes which will affect people's daily quality of life for the better.  Electric vehicles are better cars.  That is why Tesla is ten times the value of Volkswagen.  Everyone knows electric cars are going to win.  There are only 40 moving parts in an electric car but 140 in a combustion engine.  One has a fraction of the maintenance and fuel costs.  Electric vehicles are going to win.</p> <p> The hardest challenge is going to be how we charge everything.  All those one-off rural houses will be much easier to put an electric car in because one does not have the problems, as I said in my opening statement, with the distribution grid.  Electric vehicles should be rolled out first in rural Ireland.  It is the same with heat pumps.  Managing a whole street of heat pumps and electric vehicles would be hard in urban Ireland.  In a one-off rural house, however, we would not have that problem.  The wind power is found locally in rural Ireland, by and large.  Let us use that to power the future and progress of rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland could proudly be one of the first places in this country to go zero-carbon.  We will do whatever we can to support and make that happen for the people of Limerick, as well as Dublin.</p> <p> I heard much concern about local economies, including the local forestry economy, and the need to use the Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations.  We should use our carbon fund in that regard.  Deputy James O'Connor spoke about how we must get building infrastructure in Youghal - a beautiful town - right.  We get it right by working with communities rather than going against them.  Deputy Carthy referred to Monaghan.  We must ensure enterprises are retained in Monaghan but we cannot keep extracting peat.  That may be difficult.  It may require huge ingenuity, which they have in spades in Monaghan.  That is why companies like Kingspan are successful in the green economy.  That is why companies like Glen Dimplex in the north east are so successful.  We are good at ingenuity, engineering and thinking how we can solve the quintessential problems of our day.  We cannot do it, however, if we keep remitting carbon.  Local economies and communities have to be centre stage in this.</p> <p> I heard other Members say we need to change the whole model and the whole economy.  I agree fully.  For example, we could use this Covid opportunity to have remote working one or two days a week.  Let us do things differently if it means savings in commuting and not having to spend on massive motorway networks.</p> <p> Deputy Duncan Smith spoke about being either radical or redundant.  We should go radical in terms of promoting cycling and the future of energy.  The scale of change will be so great that it will change the economic model, and it will be a change for the better.  It has to be a just transition.</p> <p> I heard many Members say we have done enough talking, and now is the time for delivering.  It is a pity that Deputy Farrell is no longer in the Chamber because I was going to take up his point about e-scooters.  We need to pass legislation for them quickly.  We need to do our job to make it easier for people rather than making them feel guilty that they are using them illegally.  Why not have greenways like the one in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in other parts of south Dublin?  I would love to sit down with Deputy Lahart and the transport committee of South Dublin County Council and any other council interested in this transition to discuss this matter.  As part of our Covid response, we must consider how to change the transport system to get thousands of people on bikes, e-scooters and electric bikes, while keeping public transport safe for those who have to use it.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which the Deputy mentioned, started the coastal cycle route in May and completed it in July.  It is spectacular.  We need to be radical.</p> <p> Deputy Patricia Ryan and others said we have to be able to sell power back to the grid.  We need to do this quickly in the House.  Before Christmas, we need to get the wind guidelines out so there is not so much division and difficulties around planning.  The biggest obstacle is lack of public confidence in and support for, as well as speed and clarity in, our planning system.</p> <p> Deputy O'Rourke asked where we are going with the climate Bill.  All it does is set up the framework to start considering all the measures.  I hope that it will be in the House in early October.  We are working on the final draft and it is due to go the Cabinet shortly.  I expect it to be in the House in a matter of weeks.  The real work starts early next year, however, because, as I said in my opening statement, we have to go to Glasgow this time next year with our heads held high that we have a climate change plan appropriate to the task.  We need to get that climate Bill through before Christmas.  We need to spend the first six to nine months next year having a proper serious debate on each of these sectors to determine what the real means of delivering on the target will be.</p> <p> As Deputy Leddin said, this is not small change.  This is beyond anything we have ever done before.  We will work it out best when we look at all the different options.  However, they have to be options based on science and not skirting around some of the hard decisions we will have to make.  They will be hard decisions but good for our people.  We will be good at this because the House is not divided on the underlying fundamental truth, the science.  No one here said that this would not be good for our people in rural Ireland or those less well-off.  That gives me confidence that we will be good at this and it will be good for the people.</p></speech>

I will not identify anyone.  I received an email yesterday stating:</p> <blockquote> 	My net pay for a fortnight after deductions this week came to &euro;250.  I have a mortgage and bills to pay which I now cannot afford.  We've been informed by our local Intreo office that we are entitled to jobseeker's benefit for the days that we are not working.  Aer Lingus have refused to sign the paperwork required for this payment. </blockquote>  <p>Here is another one:</p> <blockquote> 	Social welfare and Aer Lingus are still maintaining that we are only entitled to short-term working supports while on the EWSS and not the TWSS.  Furthermore, Intreo offices are still stating that they have not received clarity from Aer Lingus and their head of social protection on how to process any of the claims. </blockquote>  <p>The Minister yesterday, on radio, said this was a matter between Aer Lingus and its employees.  It is not.  It is a matter for her.  These people are absolutely desperate.  They have rent and bills.  We have heard some terrible stories.  I have shared with the Minister two of them.  I have had hundreds of them into my office.  Urgent action is needed on this.</p></speech>

Can the Minister confirm if employees were eligible to apply for applicable jobseeker supports for their days of unemployment, even when Aer Lingus was claiming the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS?  The company said it was receiving conflicting messages from Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and says it is for the individual employee to contact his or her local Intreo office.  What does the Minister have to say to the workers who could not get their forms filled?  Was this wrong, as I suspect it was?  Are they due arrears?  If so, for what maximum period - for the duration of the TWSS or not?</p> <p>How do they go about claiming those arrears?  The situation relating to the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, is clearer, but will the Minister confirm that all Intreo offices have been advised of the current position, which is that an individual may be in receipt of both?</p></speech>

That is six months of workers not knowing their income from one week to another and struggling from one week to another.  These are workers with families and with mortgages or rent to pay.  They have been under immense pressure in the past few months.  They have been told one thing by their local Intreo offices and another thing at work.  Aer Lingus has actively blocked employees at every turn from accessing their social welfare entitlements.  These are entitlements in respect of which workers pay PRSI in order that they can access assistance when they need to.  That is what social protection is supposed to be about.  The actions of Aer Lingus, as we have seen in the correspondence we have received, has been absolutely appalling towards employees in this State.  The company needs to be taken to task.  The Minister has responsibility and she needs to do this.</p>  <p>  When did the Minister begin engagement, if she has done so?  If there were talks between Aer Lingus and the Department or the Minister, how did they come about?  What was the outcome of those talks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700054#FFF00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I have also received correspondence from those involved and I acknowledge the huge stress many of the affected workers are under at this time.  I have received their emails and read their stories, and I accept that some of them are in an awful situation.</p>  <p>  We have committed billions of euro in funding to support people's income since the onset of the pandemic through the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP; the TWSS, and the EWSS, which is new and which took effect from the 1 September.  These supports have helped over 1 million people to date.  In the context of the issue at Aer Lingus, it is important to outline the position with regard to short-time work.  If a person is placed on a shorter working week - for example, if he or she is place on a two-day week as opposed to a five-day week - he or she can claim the short-time work support payment in respect of the days he or she is unemployed, even where the employer is claiming the newly introduced EWSS for days of employment.  This means that if a person works two days, the employer pays him or her for two days.  For the three days he or she is unemployed, he or she can claim jobseeker's support or the short-time working payment.  The normal scheme rules and application processes continue to apply, including completion of the relevant forms by the employer to certify the position.  The employer signs a form to certify the number of days the person has worked.</p>  <p>  Since the EWSS took effect on 1 September, many thousands of companies have transitioned onto it without any impact on their workers.  It is difficult to understand how an organisation the size of Aer Lingus, with a dedicated HR department, could have had problems in interpreting the criteria relating to the EWSS and short-term work, particularly when many small businesses throughout the country have had no such issue.  Notwithstanding that fact, my primary concern is for the impacted workers and ensuring that they can access their entitlements.  I spoke to my officials about this matter last week and the relevant officials from my Department have engaged directly with Aer Lingus on it since then.  Management of the company has today advised that any outstanding documentation required to finalise applications for jobseeker's support will be provided by Aer Lingus to their employees as a matter of urgency.  I have asked my officials to prioritise decisions on these applications on receipt of this information and to ensure that claims are put into payment as quickly as possible once it is received.  I hope this will happen swiftly in order that this matter will resolved and the workers will be able to access their entitlements.</p></speech>

The performance of Aer Lingus to date will not inspire the workers or give them much confidence that they will get their forms filled.  I ask the Minister to issue an instruction to her officials to accept those forms, if they are filled out correctly and if the relevant documentation, with the exception of that from Aer Lingus, is provided.  These people are desperate.  Receiving &euro;250 for two weeks' work when one has rent and bills to pay and children to feed is not acceptable and is not going to work.  Aer Lingus has been dragging its heels and an Teachta O'Rourke has asked the Minister about backdating those claims.  Will she confirm that they will be backdated?  People have been sending in these forms for months.  They have no confidence that the company will fill out the forms.  The Minister can intervene with her officials and make sure that those forms are processed as long as people have filled them out and provided as much documentation as can reasonably be expected.</p></speech>

I heard reference to the EWSS and that is what we received previously in responses from the Minister and her Department in written replies to parliamentary questions.  I repeat the question: will the Minister confirm if employees are eligible to apply for applicable jobseeker's supports for days of unemployment even when Aer Lingus was claiming the TWSS for that period?  The company stated that it received conflicting messages from the Department.  Will the Minister confirm that people are eligible and can and will have their applications backdated?  I appeal to her to please deal with the TWSS.</p></speech>

That has been the entire issue here: the employer has not been signing the forms and that has left employees in an awful situation.  I reiterate that this has been going on for months.  The Minister indicated that Department officials have been engaging with Aer Lingus since last week.  Is that correct?  This has been going on for months and it would seem extraordinary if engagement only began last week.</p>  <p>  Will there be further direct engagement by the Minister's office with Aer Lingus, given the way in which they have actively blocked their employees from accessing their entitlements?  That is no carry-on for any employer to be engaging in and the matter needs to go beyond officials in the Department pulling the company up on this.  As an Teachta O'Rourke stated, we need clarity on the TWSS, specifically in the context of backdating claims.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700054#FFF00700"><p>This issue only came to the fore in the past number of weeks.  My priority is in getting the issue sorted for the workers so they can claim the supports they are entitled to.  In order to do that, the employer needs to provide UP80 forms to certify the number of days that employees have worked.  We must have confirmation of the days people are unemployed because otherwise we would be paying money out to everyone.  We have to get the details.  I confirm that when those forms are received, claims will be backdated to 1 September.  Aer Lingus confirmed to my Department today that it will provide those forms to its workers as a matter of urgency.  Once the Department receives that information, my officials will prioritise the processing of the applications from Aer Lingus workers.  The Deputies will understand and appreciate that we need the forms because we need to have certification of the number of days a person is working before we can make a payment.</p>  <p>  I share the frustration of the Deputies as to why that has not happened previously.  There are thousands of companies in receipt of the EWSS and, to the best of my knowledge, this issue has not arisen elsewhere.  I spoke to the officials last week and they have been engaging with Aer Lingus.  My Department has clarified to Aer Lingus on a number of occasions the details that are required.</p> <p>I hope and expect the management at Aer Lingus to communicate fully with its staff members on this matter and provide them with the necessary documentation.  Once that documentation is received by my Department, these applications from workers in Aer Lingus will be prioritised for payment. </p> <p> Regarding the EWSS, when those forms come in, to be clear, they will be backdated to 1 September and claims will be paid from that date.  Turning to TWSS, that was a different scheme to the EWSS, and the key issue in this regard is that it is necessary for a potential claimant to have been unemployed for several days before it is possible to get the short-term working payment.</p></speech>

This is not an occurrence that happens every few years.  It is, unfortunately, an annual event now.  Some of these areas have been designated as special areas of conservation, SACs, and restricted agricultural practices, in the best weather and circumstances, ordinarily prevail in these areas.  As referred to previously, however, and evidenced only last week, and last year as well, this situation is not being resolved through minimalist clearance of pinch points on the Shannon, as evidenced by the impact of minor works in recent years.  It does not seem to be a situation that can be resolved with the current approach to the situation, where there are conflicting interests regarding water levels between the Office of Public Works, OPW, the ESB, local authorities, Waterways Ireland and other agencies.  </p>  <p>  The situation could be resolved if there was a single agency that could bring all these separate interests together and reach an agreement with local farming communities and organisations to maintain and adjust water levels to meet the requirements of all concerned.  I refer to water levels in locations such as Meelick.  I am thinking, in particular, of those dependent on these lands for their agricultural practice and livelihoods, and enabling them to maintain standards of living that one would expect them to enjoy from having such lands available to them.   </p>  <p>  It may be the case that there is an unspoken practice, within the OPW, which deems it appropriate for these lands to be flooded to safeguard other areas along the path of the Shannon as it nears the sea and Ardnacrusha.  If that is the case, it should be stated openly, brought to the attention of those affected by it and there should be a discussion regarding adequate compensation to deal with the impact on those 200 farms.  The effects are even wider than that and I know other representatives in the area have also contacted the Minister of State's Department, and others, to seek a resolution to this issue.  </p>  <p>  As it stands, without any such flooding, major restrictions on farm practices are imposed by the SAC designation, but those impacted are prepared to work within the confines of those regulations.  They cannot do so, however, because of this ongoing flooding.  The weather has not been so detrimental as to cause this situation.  The issue arises from the management, maintenance and delivery of adequate resources within the Shannon region to meet the needs of all the bodies to which I referred.  Those who suffer the most and who suffer regularly appear to be those constituents who have been in touch with me, namely, farmers and families in south-west Offaly, east Galway and parts of Westmeath.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to the various requests that I and other bodies associated with those farmers have made with a view to meeting and resolving this issue.  I refer to being upfront and straight regarding the efforts and deliberations of the OPW and to clarify if there is some unspoken action that allows these lands to be flooded to such an extent that farming, already restricted by the SAC designation, is not now possible.  </p></speech>

As we approach the winter season, it is opportune that we consider our preparedness as a country to respond to severe weather events such as flooding.  I am acutely aware of the impact that the recent flooding has had on individual households and on communities at large, and specifically in the midlands.  Since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, I have visited several areas affected by recent storms, witnessed the damage caused and spoken with the people and business owners directly affected in Kenmare, Kilmallock, Skibbereen, Bandon, Bantry, Clifden and elsewhere.  I compliment and thank the staff of the OPW, the local authorities, the emergency services and those volunteers who have provided assistance to all of those communities that have been affected by the August storms, including in the midlands.</p>  <p>  The Government's framework for major emergency management underpins co-ordination of responses to all emergencies in Ireland, including flooding.  Through that framework, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the lead Department with national responsibility for co-ordinating the response to severe weather emergencies, including flooding.  Local authorities are designated as the lead agency for responding to flooding events within their administrative areas and for ensuring that effective arrangements are put in place to receive and respond to public service weather warnings issued by Met &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  I recognise the proactive planning of the local authorities in putting in place temporary flood defences and putting response staff on standby in preparation for these recent weather events, including those in the midlands.  Their planning and rapid response to flood events helped to mitigate the damage and devastation caused.  Each local area has its own individual plan in the event of flooding.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the civil defence and the HSE are all involved in these plans and I acknowledge their work in responding to the recent floods as well.</p>  <p>  Turning to planning to mitigate flood damage in the future, on 3 May 2018, the OPW launched 29 flood risk management plans and a &euro;1 billion investment in flood risk over the coming decade.  These plans are the output from the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State.  The plans set out measures proposed to address the flood risk nationally, and include 119 new schemes to protect towns, villages and cities.  Procurement for 60 of the 119 flood relief schemes is now progressing and, in some places, is complete.  These schemes, with the 46 already complete, will mean that 95% of at-risk properties will be protected by flood relief schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, the OPW is co-ordinating Ireland's whole-of-government approach to flood risk management across three strategic policy areas: prevention, protection and preparedness.  The interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group was established to examine the potential non-structural measures that will inform the ten-year implementation strategy of the flood risk management plans and to ensure the preparation of policies that can benefit communities directly.  The Government also established the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group in 2016 to support existing plans to address flooding on the Shannon and to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon, to which Deputy Cowen referred.</p>  <p>  The group has taken several significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance activities at several locations, trialling the lowering of levels in Lough Allen and a study on the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen weir.  In October 2019, the group agreed to a &euro;7 million strategic programme of maintenance and the removal of constrictions or pinch points, as Deputy Cowen called them, on the bed of the River Shannon at the Callows region between Athlone and Meelick weir.  Progression of these works will be subject to the full environmental impact assessments required and planning consent to proceed.  The decision to undertake these projects was noted by the Government in December 2019 and Waterways Ireland has advised that it has commenced work on advancing the various interventions for these works, with implementation expected to commence in 2021.  This investment, as well as helping to manage flooding, can support the tourism, navigation and agricultural sectors for this region.</p>  <p>  Regarding water levels on the River Shannon, the ESB manages the weirs, sluices and other works that are part of the Shannon Scheme, and the water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The levels in between those lakes are managed by Waterways Ireland for navigation purposes.  Both organisations are members of the group to which I referred earlier and communicate on a daily basis to ensure a co-ordinated approach to managing the water levels on the river.  Queries arising from the protocols of the managing of the water levels at any given time are directed both to the ESB and Waterways Ireland.</p></speech>

In order to deal with this issue, I will concentrate specifically on the fact that the Government established a Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group in 2016.  Its specific remit was to support existing plans in place to address flooding.  As the Minister of State alluded to, measures that have been undertaken further to that include &euro;7 million towards a strategic programme of maintenance and the removal of constrictions or pinch points on the bed of the River Shannon at the Callows region between Athlone and Meelick weir.  Those works are ongoing and have not had the desired impact or effect we hoped or envisaged.  That must be addressed.</p>  <p>  The agency's other duty was to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon.  I am here and raising this issue for the second year running.  It is impacting at least 200 farms, their livelihoods and potential to provide livelihoods in the future.  That would suggest that the co-ordinated approach is not working.  The protocol to which the Minister of State referred that seemed to direct us towards the ESB and Waterways Ireland to deal with levels and their maintenance between Athlone and Meelick is not working.  That protocol is not sufficient because if it were, we would not have the flooding or the diversity of opinion about the management of those weirs as has been relayed to me.</p>  <p>  It is now incumbent on those with responsibility within the Government to again bring together that risk agency co-ordination working group, lay those questions at its table, seek resolutions from those at the table with responsibility and who had given commitments that such a co-ordinated approach would meet with the desired impact, resolution, success and support of those agencies and, especially, the people who depend on these lands for a livelihood.  That is not the case.  As I said earlier, the agency has failed in its responsibility in that area and, as a result, I implore the Minister of State to reconvene that group in the short term and meet the disaffected farmers and the representative associations to which I alluded in order that he is properly armed and has at his disposal all the relevant information.  He should have not only have access to the information provided by those at the table who have failed to date but also the input of the people who have been severely impacted by the group's neglect and have little hope of survival if a resolution is not forthcoming as a result of the meeting I have proposed.</p></speech>

I can commit to two of those things.  I commit to meetings and to be upfront and straight.  The Deputy knows me long enough to understand that.</p>  <p>  As for the resolution of the issue, flooding on the Shannon predates the foundation of the State.  It is a slow-moving river and we all know the issues associated with it.  We know where communities, man-made obstacles and agricultural land have interfaced with the Shannon.  The river flows through my constituency, albeit in a different context through the estuary.  It is a highly complicated body of water, running from Cavan to Kerry.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right that people have been inundated over the past number of years and terrible devastation has been foisted upon them.  Over the past nine weeks, I have seen seven major flood events.  They are happening more frequently and we must contend with the reality of the rate at which our climate is changing.  The Deputy, and other Deputies, can support me on this.  Our regulatory and policy platform has not changed as rapidly as it should have to take into account the changing environmental considerations.  Deputies will agree with me when I say that the regulations, directives and legislation which control the manner in which we can deal with flood events frustrates, to varying degrees, the process by which we can respond to people.  It might sound like passing the buck but the reality is that the powers available to the Houses of the Oireachtas have been set out under several items of legislation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Cowen asked if I would meet the relevant parties and I have no problem doing that.  Farming organisations have already been in touch with me and I intend to go to Offaly, Galway, Westmeath and that part of the Shannon basin as quickly as I can over the next couple of weeks.  I had hoped that the Deputy might be available to join me because he is right and I do want to see it first-hand.  We need to have an honest, upfront and clear discussion in this House and the Upper House about how our policy, legislative and regulatory platform is designed to cope with these kinds of events, which are becoming more frequent.</p></speech>

Some 18 months ago, a family was told that their unborn child had a fatal foetal abnormality by a member of staff at the National Maternity Hospital.  This was not the case and it was not a mistake.  The false diagnosis was given to the child's mother without fulfilling the necessary guidelines or adhering to the law.  The couple claims that their child would be with them today were it not for the actions of some people within that hospital.  It is alleged that medical professionals who were signing off on abortions have a commercial interest in the companies that produce the fatally insufficient test.</p>  <p>  Medical notes have shown that only one obstetrician met the mother in question.  That is clearly against the law, which says that the mother must be examined by two medical professionals.  The final element of the test used in the hospital showed that the baby was healthy but the abortion was carried out before the final results arrived.  It is only through the diligence of the mother that she found out that the child was fully healthy because the information was not readily and openly given to her.</p>  <p>  Moreover, the hospital did not report the abortion to the State until a letter was sent to the hospital by the solicitor for the family.  When the hospital finally reported the abortion, it was well after the 28-day statutory limit in the law.  The law was again breached.  These are just some of the many aspects of the law and guidelines that were ignored.</p>  <p>  It is incredible that such a level of information has been in the hands of the Government for 18 months and yet no efforts have yet been made by the previous Minister for Health, the previous Government or this Government to make sure that the family in question found justice.  There is another aspect to this because abortions due to false diagnoses may have happened since.  The parents affected may not even know it has happened.  There is no doubt that, under the current regime, such false diagnoses will happen again.  This is a public health issue and, as a result, the family are determined to seek the truth and achieve the necessary changes to ensure that this never happens again.</p>  <p>  Not only has the family had to go through this grievous wrong, all of its efforts to achieve justice for themselves and their son have been stymied by the State.  It is incredible that the mother and father were initially told that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, in Britain was to review the case but the RCOG said it would not be able to do so.  The parents met the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who assured them that there would be an independent investigation.  That meeting happened well over a year ago.  The family also met the Chief Medical Officer, who agreed that protective action was necessary to make sure that it would never happen again.</p> <p>However, no changes have been made so far.  The hospital has not co-operated in an independent, fair investigation.  A hospital cannot be allowed to investigate itself.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, stonewalled me on a number of occasions when I tried to raise this issue.  He stated that it was a private issue, although the family has clearly asked me to raise it.  Will the Minister of State do the human, just, fair and decent thing and commit that there will be an open and independent investigation into what happened to that family?</p></speech>

Our overriding concern is that the couple's questions are answered appropriately and that any patient safety learning identified from the case can be implemented at the hospital concerned and across all maternity services.  It is not appropriate to discuss the specifics of the case but I will outline the process that is being put in place to address these issues.</p>  <p>  We are strongly of the view that, when a serious incident occurs within the health service that requires investigation, the establishment of an independent review is the appropriate way forward in order to ascertain the facts of the case in line with the HSE's incident management framework.  We are aware that significant efforts have been made to establish an independent external review of this case.  I am advised that extensive engagement has taken place with the family regarding the composition of the review panel and the draft terms of reference with a view to addressing their concerns regarding the planned independent external review process.  It is of vital importance that all parties are confident in the review process.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that the review will be conducted in accordance with HIQA's national standards for the conduct of reviews for patient safety incidents and the HSE's incident management framework.  The review panel will include members with the appropriate medical expertise to allow for a full understanding of the facts to be developed and will incorporate clinical expertise from outside the jurisdiction.  The Department has been advised that the review panel should also include senior counsel among its membership to provide input regarding the specific requirements in Irish law with regard to the termination of pregnancy.  The importance of enabling the participation of patients in any such review is also well established and the panel will include a patient representative.  The clinical director of the national women and infants health programme, Dr. Peter McKenna, has also agreed to take a significant role in the review panel.</p>  <p>  It is important that the family concerned is at the centre of the review process.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, will meet the family in the coming weeks to listen to their concerns and to work together to move the process forward.  The Minister's view and that of the Department is that this review needs to proceed and be completed as quickly as possible to establish the facts of the case, provide clarity and answers to the couple concerned, identify any patient safety risks associated with the termination services provided by the National Maternity Hospital and other maternity services, and identify any patient safety learning that can be implemented in the National Maternity Hospital and across the wider maternity services.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said it is not appropriate for the details of that case to be mentioned here in the D&aacute;il but it is not appropriate that, 18 months after this happened, there has been no effort to seek justice for that family.  No truth has been given to them and no one at all has been held accountable.  That is not appropriate.  Christopher's mother and father are broken-hearted but they are not giving up.  They have shown steely courage in maintaining their fight for justice and, despite the hospital, the HSE and the Government dragging their feet, they are determined not to go away.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State says it is not appropriate.  It is not appropriate that it is virtually impossible for a family that has been wronged by the health system to achieve justice in that same health system or that so many elements of that system will fight tooth and nail to stop a family getting justice.  I do not refer to this family only but to virtually every family that tries to get justice within the health system.  Patients have to go to court to get justice.  That is not appropriate and it means that justice is only available to those who can afford it.  This means that families that have already gone through grievous wrong have to go through years of fighting to get the justice to which they are entitled.  It is not appropriate that the State burns through hundreds of millions of euro of citizens' money in forcing these families to go to court.  It is throwing this money at legal cases when it should be used to help those families.  This is a gross misuse of citizens' funds.</p>  <p>  All they want is the truth and to have what happened to them acknowledged.  The hospital could have done that on day one.  Here we are again.   I appreciate that the Minister of State says there is going to be a full and independent review.  They heard that story 18 months ago but nothing has changed.  I ask the Minister of State to take this family into his heart and ensure that this matter does not get long-fingered, pushed off the table or hidden.</p></speech>

The Minister fully agrees with the need for a fair investigation to take place into the incident that occurred in the National Maternity Hospital in March 2019.  He is committed to moving this process forward as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  The Department is satisfied that an independent external review is the appropriate mechanism by which to investigate this matter.  To ensure that services conduct appropriate reviews of patient safety incidents, in 2017 HIQA and the Mental Health Commission published joint national standards for the conduct of reviews of patient safety incidents.  The standards require that, for the most serious incidents, services must commission an external independent review.  Furthermore, the HSE's Incident Management Framework 2018, which is based on the standards, sets out the procedure to be followed by a service in conducting a patient safety incident review.  The framework sets out that serious incidents, referred to as "category 1 incidents", should be reviewed by a team external to the community healthcare organisation, hospital group or National Ambulance Service directorate.</p>  <p>  The Minister believes this review should proceed and be completed as quickly as possible to establish the facts of the case, provide clarity and answers to the couple concerned, identify any patient safety risks associated with the termination services provided by the National Maternity Hospital and other maternity services, and identify any patient safety learning that can be implemented in the National Maternity Hospital and across the wider maternity services.  It is the intention of the Minister to meet the family in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The ambulances in Thurles are based in the town with the intention of responding to emergency calls locally.</p><p>I will give the Minister of State an example of an average day for a paramedic in the Thurles area to explain to him why the service, as it stands, is totally unacceptable.  During one Saturday shift, the Thurles ambulance travelled from its base in the middle of Tipperary to a call in Kilkenny, some 50 km away and in a different healthcare region. <i>En route</i>, the ambulance was diverted to a call deemed to be a higher risk in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny.  The crew changed route and headed for the location to which it was directed.  The ambulance then received another call and was told to go back to Kilkenny.  The paramedics managed to make it to the location and dealt with the issue in question.  The ambulance then returned to a call in Thurles and<i>en route</i>was redirected to Kimaganny, County Kilkenny, a distance of 45 km from Thurles.  It is worth noting at this point that, of all of the locations I have mentioned, Thurles is the only one in the mid-west region which this ambulance should serve and to which these paramedics are assigned.</p><p>While the paramedics were driving to Kilmaganny, they received a call to tell them that they were now needed in Arklow, County Wicklow, as theirs was the closest available ambulance in the area and this was a higher priority call.  Arklow is 130 km from Thurles.  Then, as the paramedics followed their route across the bottom half of Leinster, they were again told to stand down.</p> <p>The message came through that they were now needed in New Ross, County Wexford.  New Ross is 80 km from Thurles and almost the same distance from Arklow.  That was not the end of it.  Before the ambulance could get to the call in New Ross it was again diverted.  This time, the Thurles-based paramedics were told to go to a call in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, which is 30 km from New Ross and almost 100 km from Thurles, County Tipperary, which is their base.  Finally, before the paramedics were able to reach the call in New Ross, they were again directed to stand down and told instead to attend to a call in Waterford.  Waterford is 50 km from Enniscorthy and 80 km from Thurles.  Out of all these calls only one was in the area that this ambulance and these paramedics are supposed to be servicing.  Out of these eight calls during a 12-hour shift, the paramedics only got to attend one.  In all other instances they were redirected to another area either because an ambulance closer to the scene had become free or because there was a higher priority call somewhere else.  These paramedics spent almost their entire shift driving around the south-east of the country.  During that time the environs of Thurles, where the ambulance was supposed to be based, was left without any service.  The paramedics who should have been servicing that area were in the south east.  Due to lack of resources in the south east, ambulances are being redirected and taken out of the areas where they are supposed to be operating to make up the shortfall.  This is simply not on and it is a bad use of resources.  I would nearly say it was an abuse of resources.</p> <p> I do not believe this situation is unique to Thurles.  It is nonsensical that an ambulance and paramedics will be pulled out of a town in the middle of Tipperary to go to a call in Arklow.  Yet, that is the reality of the situation.  The timetable I have set out from last Saturday and the list of calls are not unusual.  Unfortunately, they are the norm for a paramedic based in Thurles.  The first obvious issue is that the ambulance should not be pulled from the Thurles area to serve in other regions unless for genuinely exceptional circumstances.  It should not be a regular occurrence.  Yet, that is what is happening.</p></speech>

Therefore, to increase the response capacity of the south region of the National Ambulance Service, in 2020 an additional six whole-time equivalent posts have been allocated specifically to the south east.  In addition, a further eight full-time posts have been allocated to assist in the implementation of the recommendations of the report, A Trauma System for Ireland.  It is projected that these 14 posts will be filled before the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service continuously evaluates its services and aligns them to available resources and activity levels.  It is not a static service and as such deploys its resources in a dynamic manner.  It operates on an area and national basis as opposed to a local basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of the incident.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years and several important service innovations and developments have taken place.  Many of these innovations are aimed at improving response times and resources availability in rural areas.  Recent initiatives include the development of alternative pathways of care and a clinical hub, which facilitates a hear-and-treat model of care.  This went live in the national emergency operations centre in March 2018.  The hub has now been expanded to provide a public information telephone line on available mental health supports and services.  The service diverts some lower acuity patients away from busy emergency departments and frees up some emergency capacity.  In addition, the National Ambulance Service has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers.  This frees up emergency ambulances for more urgent calls.  Community paramedics have also been introduced in rural and urban areas to allow patients to receive care closer to home.  It is anticipated that such initiatives, coupled with the aforementioned increase in staff numbers, will help to improve availability of ambulance resources across the south-east region.</p>  <p>  Over recent years, year-on-year additional investment has been directed towards the National Ambulance Service.  This year, the National Ambulance Service budget has increased to &euro;173.9 million.  This will support the National Ambulance Service in continuing to deliver a high-quality service throughout the country.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is not what we see happening in reality in my home area.</p>  <p>  The second obvious issue I want to address is response times.  The ambulance services are under pressure to meet a 90-second turnaround from when the call comes in to getting an ambulance on the road.  It appears little thought has been put into where that ambulance is coming from.  Surely, we must look to see how long an ambulance takes to arrive at a call, not how quickly it can be put on the road.  The situation we have means an ambulance such as the one in Thurles is being directed to drive around the country all day without actually making it to calls, all the while leaving a large area without a service that it desperately needs.  I am asking for additional resources in order that our emergency services and paramedics are not spending their shifts driving from call to call and being redirected without even reaching the person in need, time and time again.  Our region, the south east, needs additional resources in order that Thurles, which is in the mid-west region, is not drained of its paramedics and ambulances to fill the gap.</p>  <p>  I read out the timetable.  It is nonsensical to think that an ambulance in Thurles would do such driving around the country.  We must take a serious look at the National Ambulance Service nationwide.  Measuring response times in terms of how long it takes to put an ambulance on the road is not correct.  It should be measured by how long it takes to get to the call and the person in question.</p>  <p>  I was talking to one of the paramedics who told me they were being redirected to a call in Kilkenny after being redirected from Borris-in-Ossory.  He said they were passing by Borris-in-Ossory and contacted the central location to find out whether to do the call in Borris-in-Ossory on the way because the patient would be going to Kilkenny.  He was told not to because there was an ambulance on the way from Ballinasloe to deal with the call.  This type of inefficiency cannot be allowed to continue.  It is happening at the moment and the paramedics are getting frustrated with the use of their resources.</p></speech>

I assure the House that the National Ambulance Service is focused on continually improving the ambulance service in the south-east region and throughout the country.  The improvement of the service is being implemented through a multi-annual reform programme, Vision 2020, which prioritises investment in new developments, increased manpower and fleet and improved technology.  Recent developments such as the new community paramedic model of care and the hear-and-treat clinical hub will divert some lower acuity patients away from busy emergency departments and free up emergency capacity in the south east.  I thank Deputy Cahill again for raising this important issue.  I hope that this can be resolved in the near future.</p></speech>

The issue of drugs is an important issue throughout the country but on the north side of Dublin, it causes great heartache.</p>  <p>  In June 2019 on a visit to political leaders in Dublin Bay North, the assistant Garda commissioner confirmed that a Garda station was to be located in the Dublin 13 or Dublin 17 area to serve the vast expanding community in Clongriffin and Belmayne.  It is expected an extra 50,000 people will be inhabiting the area in the coming years.  We have had several successful campaigns in that area for the establishment of a second level school.  We now have an Educate Together second level school and we are happy about that.</p> <p>I was involved with the local community, including the community in Clongriffin through the Clongriffin Community Association, in having a petition to ensure we would get a Garda station for the area based on community infrastructure.  We were delighted when the assistant Garda commissioner announced that negotiations with the Office of Public Works, OPW, on a particular site at the corner of Northern Cross were ongoing and that a Garda station would be located on the site in the coming years.</p> <p> Aligned with that, a Government commitment was made during the general election that a Mulvey-style commission would be established on the north side and in Drogheda as a reaction to a murder spree in both those geographic locations.  What I was trying to do, and what Deputy Ged Nash, who was then a Senator, was trying to say at the time was that the response to drugs and gangland murder should not be one of Garda resources only but also required an in-depth discussion about education, empowerment, oral language, youth development and housing along the lines of what happened with Kieran Mulvey's commission in the north inner city.  We wanted that approach to be replicated on the north side and in Drogheda.  After months of making repeated calls for such a commission in the Seanad - I was a Senator at the time - the then Minister for Justice and Equality agreed the Government would do so if returned to office.</p> <p> This commission is desperately needed.  While I acknowledge these are difficult times and establishing a commission at this time would be problematic because of the national crisis we are in, poverty, disadvantage and drug crime still exist and people still have murder on their minds.  I would like an update on that promised, pledged and proposed Garda station.  At what stage is the process?  When will the station be opened?  When can the community of Dublin 13 and 17 be satisfied that the campaign, which they were thrilled to see reach a successful conclusion in June 2019, will result in the next stage of the process and the opening of the doors of a fully staffed and resourced Garda station in this expanding area on the north side of Dublin?</p></speech>

Works in respect of Garda accommodation are progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the OPW.</p>  <p>  The current Garda building and refurbishment programme, which runs to 2021, is based on agreed Garda priorities and covers more than 30 locations across the country, supported by significant Exchequer funding across the Garda and OPW Votes.  While a new station in Dublin 13 and 17 is not part of the current programme, I understand from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that proposals for a new station will be considered as part of the next Garda accommodation programme.  In the meantime, the Minister has been advised that local Garda management have a policing plan for the district in question, which incorporates a weekly Garda clinic in the area operated by the community policing unit from Coolock.  This includes regular liaison meetings with residents groups to deal with policing matters.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, for example, the community alert programme and the Garda text alert scheme.  That said, the Minister is very conscious of how the impact of anti-social behaviour affects the quality of life for local communities.  Crime prevention and diversion, beginning with young people, are priorities for the Minister and the programme for Government contains a number of commitments to tackle anti-social behaviour, including a commitment to set up a special expert forum on anti-social behaviour to consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward.  These include new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders; new legislation implementing the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which will, among other elements, redefine policing to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable and mandate multi-agency collaboration in conjunction with impacted communities; and development of a youth justice strategy 2020-26, which will include consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work.</p>  <p>  I was a Member of the Seanad when the Deputy was a Senator and I am aware he raised this issue many times.  Deputy Nash who was also a Senator at the time outlined the position regarding Drogheda.  On the face of it, the north inner city initiative has been a success.  I will make the Minister aware of the Deputy's comments on setting up a commission to examine these two areas of the north side, specifically in the Deputy's constituency.</p></speech>

It states: "... I understand from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that proposals for a new station will be considered as part of the next Garda accommodation programme".  The assistant Garda commissioner announced in June 2019 that it would happen.  I worry when I see words like "proposals" and "considered" in the Minister of State's reply.  I appreciate his comments about the proposed commission for the north side and Drogheda.  This issue is not about police alone.  We cannot police our way out of a murder triangle, so to speak.  A commitment to establish a commission was made by an outgoing Minister for Justice and Equality of a party that is still in government.  As such, that should be considered and we are waiting for that to happen.  The issue of whether it will happen is not up for discussion.  A commitment was made in the heat of the general election campaign.  That is what it took for a commitment to be made to establish a Mulvey-style commission for the north side of Dublin, and not just to discuss policing.  It is all very well to talk about the policing element but there is so much more to talk about, for example, education, oral language, literacy, diet, access to employment, housing, transport, health and other issues.  That is what the Mulvey commission in the north inner city was about.  That commission was successful to a degree.  It has successfully cut through the red tape and created immediate access for the community by allowing their concerns to go straight through to the decision-makers rather than, unfortunately, all the bureaucracy.</p>  <p>  I need a firmer commitment on the Garda station, which was a commitment made by the assistant Garda commissioner.  I also need a date for the establishment of the Mulvey-style commission on the north side and in Drogheda, to which the Minister of State's party committed in the general election.  It is still in government and, indeed, still holds the Ministry for justice.</p></speech>

I will bring his comments on establishing a commission to look into these very difficult areas to the Minister.  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is, by law, responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and the deployment of resources.  As such, the Minister has no role in these matters.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am aware of a similar situation.  Commitments were made in December for a new Garda station in my area of Sligo.  I was of the same opinion as the Deputy that such commitments were made and I would like to see them being delivered on.  I was disappointed that the Garda Commissioner changed his mind on that.  We can try to work together to get our views across.  I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from in this regard.</p>  <p>  An unprecedented level of resources has been provided by the Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year with an allocation of &euro;1.88 billion.  That level of funding is enabling sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As of 30 June 2020, there were approximately 14,700 garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by more than 3,000 Garda staff.  These numbers are continuing to grow and have a positive impact at community level.</p>  <p>  Determination of the need for a new Garda station for Dublin 13 and 17, or in any other location, will be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the overall accommodation requirements arising from the ongoing expansion of the Garda workforce and policing reform plan, A Policing Service for the Future, and implementation of the new Garda operating model, which will inform the overall accommodation needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the years 2022 to 2026.</p> <p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for his commitment to this.  I hope that, in the future, he will have a Garda station and more Garda resources for Dublin 13 and Dublin 17.  I would like to see the commitments made by the last Government honoured by the current one.</p></speech>

No matter who one was or where one came from, when one sat the examination, one knew one&rsquo;s papers would be marked objectively and fairly.  In many respects, an outstanding student from Castleisland was treated the same as an outstanding student from Castleknock.  Unfortunately, that has not occurred this year.  Obviously, it was as a result of the pandemic that new, extraordinary measures had to be put in place.  To a large extent, those efforts were successful but there is a large contingent of students who were treated very unfairly by the State in this process.  These were the students whose estimated grades, provided by their teachers, were marked down by the State during the standardisation process.</p>  <p>  The decision made about the students has had a major impact on their lives.  Not only did very many of them not get the first course they were seeking but they did not even get the second, third or fourth.  Had they received the marks their teacher originally gave them, they would have been able to get into the courses they had at the top of their CAO list.  Unfortunately, the CAO process, which is usually very transparent, has not become transparent as a result of this.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to so many parents and children over recent days that I could not go into the full detail with the Minister.  It would take me so long.  The Minister will no doubt be aware, however, that there is considerable upset over what happened to the students.  They were treated unfairly.  It appears to be the case that these students, who are students of schools that previously excelled in the leaving certificate examinations, were downgraded because of their schools' excellence.  That is not fair.  The State needs to acknowledge that the students were treated unfairly.  We need to recognise this and try to determine what we can do for them.</p></speech>

She carries a great burden at this time &ndash; the burden of office associated with looking after and ensuring the smooth running of our primary and second level education systems during these extraordinarily challenging times.  The country, and certainly her party colleagues and everybody in the D&aacute;il, are grateful for the job she is doing and the manner in which she has taken on her task.</p>  <p>   Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has, in his usual erudite way, made most of the points I wanted to make, including the point on the leaving certificate being a great leveller.  Historically, there was a suspicion that if one went to a school with a high proportion of pupils from so-called disadvantaged areas, one would be unfairly penalised in the marking of the leaving certificate examinations.  To some degree, we are now looking at the other side of that coin.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, this matter needs to be treated with a sense of urgency that might not have been applied in respect of disadvantaged pupils in the past.</p>  <p>  The predicted grading has gone enormously well, and the Minister and her Department deserve great plaudits for that, but it appears to have been unfair on some students, who appear to come disproportionately from schools that achieved excellent results in previous years.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.  I have no doubt that it will be measured, bearing in mind the context of threatened High Court proceedings, appeals, etc.  We are grateful for the Minister's presence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700060#MMM00500"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and allowing me to address it.</p><p>The provision of calculated grades to students arose in the unprecedented circumstances of our not being able to run a leaving certificate examination, as the Deputies will all be aware.  The concept was first mooted by students and there was an extensive process of engagement with education stakeholders and an agreement to proceed with the calculated grades process.  Under the model, estimated marks from schools were adjusted, using a carefully developed standardisation model to ensure a consistent standard was applied across schools across the country, when judging the performance of students.  Standardisation takes place every year in marking the leaving certificate examinations.  That is an extremely important point.  While teachers are familiar with their own students, they cannot be expected to have knowledge of the standards nationwide.  Standardisation allows student-to-student comparability across the country.</p><p>As Deputies may be aware, at the start of September I brought to the Cabinet a proposal to remove school-by-school historical subject level data from the national standardisation process used to determine calculated grades.  This decision meant that no student's calculated grade was impacted by the historical performance of the school he or she attended.  The statistical procedure has been subject to a high degree of oversight by the national standardisation group which was established to oversee the work.  Its implementation has also been independently overseen by an independent steering committee, chaired by Dr. &Aacute;ine Lawlor, former director of the Teaching Council.  All the information regarding the process and its oversight is fully transparent and it is available online at .</p><p>As Deputies will know, as part of the process, schools provided the Department with an estimated percentage mark and rank order for each student.  Following the standardisation process, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and, subsequently, to a calculated grade.  This was provided to students on 7 September.  It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.</p><p>It is not accurate to state students were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process; rather, the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 leaving certificate calculated grades.</p><p>The system of calculated grades allowed the Department to provide results to over 60,000 students, many of whom have now received CAO round one offers.  Some 80% of CAO applicants received a CAO offer from their top three preferences.  Of all grades awarded, 83.1% were either the same or higher than the grade that school estimated percentage marks would have awarded, while 16.9% were lower.  The increase of 4.4 percentage points in the average marks across all subjects and at all levels this year is present across all types of schools.  It was inevitable, however, that some students would have their estimated marks adjusted downwards as part of standardisation.</p><p>The overall data from school estimated marks show there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally in examinations.  Without standardisation in some subjects, the number of H1s awarded would have been two to three times higher.  This would not have been tenable and would have presented considerable difficulties for higher and further education.</p><p>While some students had a lower percentage mark awarded following standardisation, it is possible that many of the concerns being raised are based on what marks schools estimated for their students this year rather than on the results attained in examinations across previous years.  I believe this is the point made by the Deputies.  The standardisation process was applied to all schools in the same way, irrespective of whether the school was in the State system or was fee charging.</p><p>With regard to schools outside the State system, data analysis in the report of the national standardisation group shows that schools in the non-recognised category, which is made up largely of institutions often referred to as &quot;grind schools&quot;, overestimated their student marks to a greater extent than in recognised schools.</p>  <p>Furthermore, when comparing the results of students in fee-charging schools in the State sector and in the private non-recognised schools institutes versus those in non-fee-charging schools, those in fee-charging schools and institutions still have higher scores than students in non-fee-charging schools even after standardisation.</p> <p> Students who are disappointed with one or more of their calculated grades had the opportunity to submit an appeal.  The appeals process closed yesterday, Wednesday, 16 September at 5 p.m.  The appeals process is a review focused on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.</p></speech>

I note she states it is not accurate to say that schools or certain students were downgraded but that is how the students see it.  Last Monday, when they got the estimated grades given to them by their teachers and learned those grades were above what they got in the official calculation grades, they viewed that as being downgraded.  I recognise this is an exceptional event.  One thing we can learn from this is that we need to get back to the leaving certificate as it usually operates because no matter what the unfairness of the leaving certificate may be, it is an objective and fair system of assessing academic ability.  </p>  <p>  What is going to happen in this appeal process?  There is a huge amount of uncertainty as to what is involved and who will make the assessments under the appeals.  Is it purely a clerical appeal or is there some further facility available to the students who put it in?</p>  <p>  We should acknowledge the upset that has been felt by these students.  A woman told me on the phone today that she was not prepared to leave the house because she was so concerned at how upset her son has been since he got his results.  That is across the board and not just in certain schools or in certain counties.  I have spoken to colleagues in this House and it is an issue throughout the country.  We need to recognise the unfairness these students believe they have been subjected to.</p></speech>

I take on board, as everybody does, that faced with an unprecedented set of circumstances her Department moved quickly and came up with a system that has attempted, successfully for the most part, clearly, in dealing with the challenges faced by students.  It is worthy of repetition and we do not want to lose sight of that.</p>  <p>  The Minister is right to emphasise, and we all knew it as public representatives at the time, that this was student-led.  As there is a movement at the moment within the present sixth years regarding how they will be treated next year, there are some lessons to be learned from here as well.</p>  <p>  In the short time the Minister has left perhaps she could give us some details on what my colleague said about the appeals process.  Given the closing time was yesterday, has she any idea yet on the nature and number of the appeals or what kind of cohort of school or schools they are coming from?  That is an interesting finding with regard to the so-called non-State schools, that is, the grind schools.  It is a sobering fact, and she presented it as such.  It is something that parents may bear in mind as they go forward because the success of this depended completely on objectivity as much as possible.  There are, however, some questions to be answered.  I look forward to the Minister's second response on this and perhaps some further correspondence on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700061#NNN00300"><p>I reiterate that the development of the model for calculated grades has been a challenging process and would not have been possible without the co-operation of teachers and schools.  I absolutely acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  For students who are disappointed with their results, the opportunity to avail of the appeals mechanism to ensure there were no administrative errors in processing their results was, as I have already outlined, provided to them.  I appreciate that in every examination system and in every leaving certificate system, as we are aware, there are students who will be happy and students who will be disappointed.  I absolutely want to acknowledge that.  I also acknowledge that it has an impact on entire households in circumstances of that nature.  I am aware and cognisant of that.  </p>  <p>  I also reiterate that students have opportunities at the postponed examinations in November.  I believe this is an important avenue open to students should they wish to available of it.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that this year, the CAO was able to make 78,950 first round offers last Friday.  That is 6% higher than in 2019.  Overall, CAO applications were up only 0.6% as a result of additional places being made available by the Government.  This means many more students will have received a CAO offer.  Some 52% of students received an offer for their first preference course while 80%, as I said previously, received an offer for a top three preference.  Again, given that we are in the midst of a pandemic and given the extraordinary circumstance in which we find ourselves, it is an extraordinarily positive reflection that so many students were in a position to avail of those offers.</p>  <p>  Inevitably, there will be students and parents who remain dissatisfied with the outcome of the calculated grades and the CAO process.  Every year, students miss out on CAO places as more students seek places than there are actually places available.  I would, however, encourage those students to explore the options available to them to achieve their goals and ambitions and I wish them well.  I recognise that it can be a difficult time for everybody involved.  It was, however, an extraordinary circumstance that meant we had to introduce an extraordinary measure and that was the agreed measure of calculation grades.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of Greystones community college with her this evening.  Greystones community college is a brand new secondary school in Greystones that had its first intake in September.  Obviously, all the parents and students were excited about the fact this new school was getting started.</p>  <p>  The school was due to was due to share accommodation with Greystones community national school, in a new primary school building that was also meant to open in September.  Unfortunately, the Department decided not to open that school in September at the last minute.  I believe the announcement was made in early August.  The rationale given was that the Department needed to make sure the school was fit to hand over.  This was one of the schools built by Western Building Systems.  Unfortunately, we now have two schools, namely, the Greystones secondary school and the primary school, Greystones community national school and that were not able to access their new school building.</p>  <p>  The Greystones primary school remained in the temporary accommodation in the rugby club where it has been for the past five years.  Unfortunately, because the Greystones community college was a brand new school it did not even have a plan B.  It did not even have temporary accommodation it could go back to.  The principal spent the month of August scrambling around looking for rooms in Greystones where they could house their new school.  </p>  <p>  Luckily, the tennis club became available for the school and that is where it is at the moment.  There are 64 pupils in this secondary school and, as I said, they are in the tennis club in Greystones.  While they were fortunate to get this accommodation, it is not suitable as a school.  A classroom is being taught in the foyer of the tennis club.  One must walk through the shower room to get into the principal's desk because it is in the changing area.  If a student wants to move or go to the bathroom, he or she must go through two other classes to walk around the school to get into use it.  </p>  <p>  It has also had significant impact on the classes that can be provided to these students.  The students were particularly keen on getting stuck into woodwork, as many first-year students are, and, unfortunately, even this simple subject is not being provided this year because the accommodation is not suitable.  The tennis club is available until October and we are not sure what will happen after that.  It is critical, however, that this school is sorted out.</p>  <p>  What are the issues with the new building?  It was due to be a rapid build.  It was meant to be a ten-month programme and years later, it still has not opened its doors.  It is sitting there.  My understanding is that there have been no visits from Department to see what is wrong with the school.  I may be incorrect, but I am hearing locally that no-one has attempted to get into the school.  What is the issue with school and when will it open?  When will the primary school, Greystones community national school, and the secondary school be able to access that brand new school accommodation?  It is important that the Minister's Department expedites this issue and makes sure the solution is provided to this school as soon as possible.  After October I really do not know what will happen to them.</p></speech>

On 17 December 2019 it was announced that the patronage of the new post-primary school for Greystones-Kilcoole was awarded to Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB.  It had been the intention to open the community college in the newly constructed community national school building in September 2020 but this has not proved possible.  Greystones community college opened its doors to 64 first year students on Friday, 28 August 2020 in Greystones Lawn Tennis Club.  The school, KWETB and my Department are grateful to Greystones Lawn Tennis Club for facilitating Greystones community college.  I acknowledge the efforts of the entire school community in preparing the accommodation for the school's opening in these particularly difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the building project to deliver a new 1,000-pupil school for Greystones community college is planned for the designated post-primary site at Charlesland.  My Department is committed to delivering this site for the new post-primary school for the Greystones and Kilcoole area of County Wicklow and work is ongoing to achieve this as soon as possible.  Discussions are ongoing with the landowner with a view to acquiring this site.  As the Deputy will appreciate, any site acquisition process can be lengthy and there can be complex issues which need to be addressed during negotiations, technical assessments and conveyancing.  At all times, my Department must strive to obtain best value for the Exchequer while seeking to complete the acquisition as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>  <p>  The project to deliver the permanent accommodation for the school is to be delivered under the Department's design and build programme.  As soon as there is sufficient certainty in respect of completion of the site acquisition, the architectural planning and design stage will be completed and, following grant of planning permission, the project will be expedited to tender and construction stages.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the issues the Deputy has outlined regarding the current accommodation.  I again acknowledge the work that went into making that accommodation available.  She will be aware of the difficulties with the proposed accommodation that was being made available.  My Department is in ongoing discussions with the contractor on that and it will be expedited as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

There is no indication as to whether the secondary school will be in the tennis club post October.  There is no indication as to when the brand-new primary school will be opened and both the primary school and the secondary school can go in there.  This school needs clarity.  Everybody involved has done an amazing hob.  The principal, staff, parents and students have put great effort into making this school as good as possible, but the tennis club is not a suitable location for them in the medium term.  It will get them to October but is not suitable post October.</p>  <p>  What are the Minister's plans for this school after October?  The school and its students need to know; they need clarity.  I have raised the issue several times with departmental officials.  I have sent emails and submitted parliamentary questions.  I have written letters.  Last week, I brought together the five Deputies from Wicklow and we are seeking a meeting with the Minister.  Will she commit to meeting the five Deputies to give us an update on the issue?  We need a firm understanding of where she expects the school to be after October.  At the moment there is no indication and no clarity, which is unfair on the students and staff.</p></speech>

For the duration of the work, the Department's project management technical advisory team included an architect, civil and structural engineer, fire consultant and others.  These parties carried out regular site visits and inspections for the duration of the works.  Matters raised by the contractor were tracked on an ongoing basis through fortnightly site visits and inspections by the project team to ensure the identified items were closed out.</p>  <p>  The Department also retained a full-time on-site clerk of works for the duration of the project.  Throughout the construction period the Department's project management team have used the appropriate provisions of the public work contract to secure the necessary assurance that the building is fit for handover prior to accepting it for handover.  The Department will only accept the building and make it available for occupation by the school when it is completely satisfied that it is fit for handover prior to accepting it.  The Department is taking appropriate steps to ensure this and engagement is under way between the Department and the contractor in this regard under contract.  It is too early to say how long this engagement process might take but, as the process develops, my departmental officials will keep the ETB and school management informed of developments.  I think it would only be appropriate to consider having a meeting further to that information becoming available to me.</p></speech>

I know he is extremely aware of this road and its fabled history, not just from his nine years representing this constituency with distinction, but crossing it many times.  I remember following him across this road some time ago when he was previously in government and attending the launch of a particularly impressive Coillte exhibition in the Dublin Mountains over which he presided.  I am delighted to say that my family and I will be visiting that site this weekend.  Thankfully, it is within the Dublin boundary.</p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, this road is not fit for purpose in the modern era.  During the summer, a very serious two-car collision occurred on the road.  This gave rise to concerns for many people and highlighted the need to progress with the plan to redesign the road.  That plan is 25 or 30 years old at this stage.  It predates the establishment of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and was originally drawn up by Dublin County Council.  The road in most parts does not even have a footpath.  In 2007, planning for the road was agreed but the project was put on hold due to the financial crisis.  Thankfully, just when I left the local authority and entered the Seanad some years ago, a new planning application was submitted and accepted for a far more contemporary project in line with all the best regional planning guidelines, including, most importantly, the provision not just of properly proportioned and designed footpaths but also cycle lanes.  I know the Minister would look forward many times to cycling up around the Dublin Mountains.</p>  <p>  A new layout has already been completed at the junction of Harold's Grange Road and Blackglen Road.  However, Blackglen Road still needs to be finished.  The compulsory purchase orders have just been completed and the tenders have gone out to secure the construction of this road.  I spoke to the engineer in the local authority today and was told that, all things going well, it would be able to begin the works in February.  To reach that stage, we need to hear a commitment from the Minister that his Department will contribute to the funding.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has reserved considerable funding for this project, but it will never get the go-ahead if it does not also get central government funding.</p>  <p>  It is vital because as soon as this welcome project is completed, the other two spurs of this three-road junction will need to be completed.  I refer to the Harold's Grange Road spur alongside Marley Park and, most importantly, the Hillcrest Road spur through Lambs Cross and going down to the M50 where every day we see articulated lorries going to the major shopping centres, Sandyford Business Park or the very famous livery yard on the Enniskerry Road.  They do so through a road junction where barely two cars can go across and in respect of which residents have had to campaign, sign petitions and have sleep-outs.  I appeal to the Minister to give that guarantee, not just to the local authority and the local representatives but, crucially, to the rapidly growing population of the greater Blackglen Road area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700062#OOO00800"><p>I am sure he will be following me all the way to ministerial office at some stage.</p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  State grants, where applicable, are intended to supplement the funding allocated to the maintenance and improvement of roads by local authorities from their own resources.</p> <p> In the case of the four Dublin councils, under the arrangement put in place by Government following the introduction of the local property tax, LPT, local authorities are required to fund their main regional and local roads programmes from their own resources, including LPT receipts.  While it is possible to seek grant support under the Department's regional and local roads grant programme for strategic projects, this is dependent on available budgets and the outcome of the project appraisal process required under the public spending code.</p> <p> As regards budgets, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post-2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.  The national development plan, NDP, provides for the gradual build-up of funding for the road network, but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason, the primary focus for capital investment at present is the maintenance and renewal of the network and implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP.</p> <p> Some limited provision is being made in the capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects.  This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.  Last year, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council raised with the Department the possibility of submitting an application for part-funding of the Blackglen Road-Harold's Grange Road scheme under this allocation.  The council was proposing at the time to deliver the scheme in two phases.  Phase 1 relates to the Blackglen Road and extends from the junction at Lambs Cross to the junction with Ticknock Road.  Phase 2 deals with the Harold's Grange Road, extending from the junction with Ticknock Road to the junction with College Road-Grange Road-Kellystown Road.  The council indicated that the estimated cost of phase 1 was of the order of &euro;22 million. </p> <p> Following on from a meeting with the council, the Department indicated that given its existing funding commitments for strategic road schemes under the NDP, the detailed project appraisal requirements under the public spending code and the scale of and proposed timetable for implementation of this particular scheme, it would not be feasible to consider it for funding under the regional and local roads grant programme.  However, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has allocated funding of just over &euro;2 million under its sustainable transport measures grants as an initial contribution towards the cost of the walking and cycling aspects of the scheme.  The NTA is liaising directly with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in respect of this allocation.</p></speech>

I will not pretend that I am not a little disappointed with the lack of progress.  As the Minister well knows, people in this area have been waiting more than 25 years for improvements to a road that is not fit for purpose.  In the time since the need for an upgrade was identified, 7,000 new homes have been built in the area and there has been a significant increase in traffic.  The population has grown to such an extent that since I was first elected to office in 2009, a dozen new national and secondary schools have been constructed in the area.  The volumes of traffic, including motor car, bicycle and, to a lesser extent, pedestrian have multiplied.</p>  <p>  Priority must be given to upgrading this major linear artery across the Dublin Mountains.  The road is used by people travelling to and from such places as Dundrum Town Centre, the M50 and Sandyford business district, and it encompasses a vastly populated and growing residential area.  Many people bought their homes in the area assuming that the road would be built before they even had children, let alone when they were sending those children off, as the case may be, to third level.  As I said, there was an extremely serious accident on the road this summer.  Fortunately, there were no fatalities but there were a number of injuries and the traffic delays were manic.  If we think back to the very bad snows of 2009 and 2010, there were four-hour to five-hour delays for motorists trying to cross this road.  It is a very serious matter.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials not just to engage with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council but to prioritise this project for funding, for the benefit not only of the immediate population but that of the wider population of south Dublin and north Wicklow.</p></speech>

I am also very familiar with Hillcrest Road, which the Deputy mentioned, and the travails of its residents over the years as a result of the inordinate traffic volumes on what is a narrow residential road.  The Department engaged with the council in July last year and came back strongly with the position that funding for this scheme could not be drawn down under the regional and local roads grant programme.  As I indicated in my reply, the roads already identified under the NDP will receive priority funding.</p>  <p>  The only prospect I can offer the Deputy - without in any way committing, because it is impossible to do so - is that any review of the NDP might led to a possible reconsideration of the funding it provides.  In the meantime, I understand the council has done the planning for the project and has started the process of securing compulsory purchase orders.  I do not know whether the council has the resources to proceed with the works or where the project fits within its strategic investment plans.  The Department, having considered the matter in some detail as recently as last year, concluded that the project would not be included in the regional and local road grants programme.  As to whether that might change under any review of the NDP, which would be early next year, we will have to wait and see.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700063#PPP00400"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, for attending.  It is a truism but one which cannot be said enough that rents in the private rental sector are simply too high.  For too many people renting privately, the cost is far too expensive.  New rentals in Dublin now cost more than &euro;2,000 per month, with average rents in the capital running at more than &euro;1,700.  Elsewhere in the State, new rentals are &euro;1,400 per month and the cost is even higher in many urban centres.  The latest data from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, published in March, show a 5.4% increase in rents since the same month last year.  While the latest price report from <i>daft.ie</i>in June showed that Covid-19 was having some impact on the market, it was, at best, a modest impact.  The report showed that asking rents were up 0.5% on June of last year.  The uncertainty in the student market is having little visible impact on the private rental market.  In fact, <i>daft.ie</i>, in its student housing report this week, recorded rises in student rents throughout the State compared with last year.</p><p>The much talked about shift of short-term rental units into the long-term market has failed to materialise and what new stock is coming on stream is high-end, build-to-rent housing.  In some parts of the capital, this new and exceptionally expensive stock is lying vacant.  Month on month, the number of tenancies registered with the RTB continues to fall.  According to figures I got from the board last week, there has been a loss of 3,295 registered tenancies so far this year.  Since January 2017, the first month in which registered tenancies started to fall, we have lost an astonishing 20,000 such tenancies from the private rental stock.  Accidental and semi-professional landlords are taking advantage of the return of positive equity and getting out of the market.  Despite repeated calls by me and others to the previous Minister to address this disorderly exit of landlords from the market, the problem continues to get worse.</p><p>Unfortunately, the future for many renters looks bleak.  At best, prices will stagnate as demand far outstrips supply.  For many, rent increases will remain a fact of life.  Thousands, if not tens of thousands, of renters will continue to pay excessive prices to keep a roof over their heads.  Research from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in 2018 showed that 70% of lower-income renters pay up to 40% of their income in rent.  These are people who are not eligible for the housing assistance payment, HAP, rent supplement or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  The latest Central Statistics Office, CSO, deprivation data, published this month, show an increase in deprivation rates among renters, from 27% in 2018 to 34% in 2019.  As we know, all of this was before the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>Since then renters have been disproportionately affected by lay-offs and income loss.  A huge number of people on the pandemic unemployment payment are younger or lower income workers in sectors such as tourism, entertainment and retail, and the economic impact of the pandemic has hit this group particularly hard.  While there is no doubt that the Government's income supports have helped, today many of these people will be hit by cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment of between &euro;200 and &euro;400 per month.</p> <p> Research published by the ESRI and the Department of housing in July suggests that the impact of Covid-19 income loss on renters' arrears was likely to be limited.  The report's conclusion contained a stark warning, however.  It said that the longer the economic impact of Covid went on, the greater the chance of struggling renters falling behind on their rent.  In fact they urged the Government to be cautious about withdrawing income supports too quickly.  Unfortunately the advice was ignored.  The Government also ignored the advice of advocacy groups such as Threshold and Focus Ireland when it ended a ban on evictions, notice to quit and rent increases for the vast majority of renters in July.  Instead, the Government provided a limited protection for a smaller group of tenants and within days Deputies across the House were, I am sure, receiving calls from tenants who had received notices to quit or indeed rent hikes.  I spoke to a woman who lived outside Dublin, not in my constituency and not in a rent pressure zone.  She did not qualify for the Government's limited protection and her landlord had increased the rent by &euro;100, the second such increase in two years.  Her income had fallen by 20% due to Covid-19 but she was not in arrears, not on any Covid payment and not eligible for the limited supports provided by the Government.  Families such as these need our protection.  Their rents are simply too high and they cannot afford any further increase.  The consequences of refusing to provide them with any relief will be increased financial hardship, increased emotional stress, greater poverty and deprivation and, unfortunately in some cases, the loss of a tenancy and possible homelessness.</p> <p> The Minister says he wants to promote home ownership and that is a good thing.  When he was on the Opposition side of the House, he rightly complained that high rents were locking first-time buyers into a rent trap, and he was correct.  They could pay rent or save for a deposit but not both.  For some, this not only delayed the date when they would eventually own their own home, but they were also forced to put off starting a family.  For others, the choice was worse: to live at home with family into their late 30s just to save a deposit.  Then there are those in the latter stages of their working life, some of whom may have lost their family home due to relationship breakdown, others due to mortgage distress or repossession.  They are fearful of a life of perpetual uncertainty and unaffordability in the rental sector.  The Bill I am proposing tonight is for all of these people.  It would protect young and low-income renters from further rent hikes, give older renters greater certainty into the future and help those desperately trying to save to buy their own home.</p> <p> A three-year ban on rent increases for existing and new tenancies is just one of a package of measures which Sinn F&eacute;in urged the last Government to take on board and we are doing so again with the new Government.  A ban on rent increases is not enough of course.  The cost of renting must also be reduced and that is why Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called for a refundable tax credit for private renters worth a full month's rent.  That would put an average of &euro;1,400 back into the pocket of every renter in the State.  We also need to see a massive investment in affordable cost-rental accommodation, led by local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.  Much was promised by Fine Gael and supported by Fianna F&aacute;il in budget 2019.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste claimed this was a housing budget and our current Minister made great play of his role in securing &euro;300 million to be committed to the delivery of 6,000 affordable homes by 2021 in the serviced sites fund.  To date, not a single affordable home has been delivered under this scheme.  In fact, only 50 are currently under construction in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and these will not be tenanted until next year at a cost of &euro;1,200 per month.  In my view, and that of many working people, this is not affordable for the vast majority of working renters.  We need thousands of affordable cost-rental homes delivered every year with rents somewhere between &euro;700 and &euro;800 per month.  This can and should be done by this Government if they are serious about tackling the crisis in the rental market and meeting the affordable housing need.</p> <p> We also need to reduce the over-reliance on the private rental sector to meet social housing need.  This will only happen if the Government revises its social housing targets upwards.  The 10,000 real social homes which it has committed to delivering next year is not enough.  We have over 90,000 households living in the private rental sector on social housing supports.  We need a plan to provide these families with real social housing which will in turn free up even more properties in the private rental sector for private renters or indeed first-time buyers.  We also need further reform of the private rental sector.  We need a real move to tenancies of indefinite duration, not just the removal of section 34(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act.  We need improved inspection and enforcement of minimum standards and fire safety through an NCT-type certification for landlords.  We need a comprehensive reform of the tax treatment of landlords which ends the appalling tax breaks for institutional investors while allowing good professional landlords to get a fair return when providing a good service.  Rebuilding Ireland has failed renters.  The rental market is in fact in a worse place today than it was when the then Minister for housing, now the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, launched his strategy for the private rented sector in 2017.  Only a comprehensive reform providing security and affordability for tenants and landlords will suffice.  Sinn F&eacute;in's Ban on Rent Increases Bill 2020 is one important piece of the package of measures needed to give renters a break and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</p> <p> Before I conclude, I note that the Minister was in my own constituency today and welcome it.  He was out in Adamstown surveying progress in the strategic development zone, SDZ, funded by the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  The Minister was rightly very critical of the slow pace of the LIHAF funding over the last number of years.  Just last year he rightly complained that just &euro;16 million out of &euro;200 million had been spent.  Adamstown is an interesting example because &euro;20 million was promised back in 2016 and 2017 with the condition that the 2,000 LIHAF-facilitated units were to be delivered by 2021 and only a fraction of them have been.  The Minister will be interested to know that very close to where he was standing there was an estate called Shackleton Park built by Cairn Homes and facilitated under the LIHAF.  Some 229 of those homes were sold this year by Cairn to what the Minister has on many occasions described as cuckoo funds.  If one looks on daft.ie today one will see a two-bedroom home is now for rent in Shackleton Park at &euro;1,800 per month and a one-bedroom home, which is quite small, for &euro;1,500.  The vast majority of the discounted units that were committed to - and this is no fault of the Minister as he was not responsible back in 2016 and 2017 - have not been delivered.  The 400 large or discounted units are not guaranteed at the price of &euro;320,000 or less because they are linked to inflation and construction prices, both of which have increased considerably since the original agreement was made in 2017.</p> <p> I raise this issue because if the Minister is considering renewing or adding to the local infrastructure housing activation fund in the budget, he needs to ensure he does not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor.  He needs to ensure funding only goes to developers who need it.  Cairn Homes did not need it, as it made over &euro;68 million in net profit last year and &euro;56 million the year before.  The Minister needs to ensure LIHAF delivers the homes within the time it is meant to and that there is genuine affordability, as was promised, through LIHAF and Rebuilding Ireland but which has not been delivered.  I raise this as a genuine issue of concern because the Minister shared many of my concerns before his appointment.  He is now in the driving seat and has the influence to ensure any future infrastructural funding is tied very clearly to timeframes for delivery and genuine affordability for working families.</p></speech>

I will have nine minutes and they will each have three.  I will look into the matter Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned.  Where I was today in Adamstown, I saw fantastic work that has taken place and continues to take place.  This is also the case in other parts of south Dublin like Killinarden where the Deputy's own party opposed 100 social homes and 300 affordable homes as part of another LIHAF scheme.</p> <p>I will be reviewing how LIHAF works but delivery on the ground is what is crucial.<i></i>I thank the Deputy for bringing forward the Bill and providing us with an opportunity to discuss the residential rental sector as it stands in Ireland today.  I will not support the Bill because I do not believe that banning rent increases is the solution to the current housing supply crisis we face.<br/><br/>I note with concern that Deputy &Oacute; Broin did not avail of the services of the parliamentary legal advisers.  The Bill he has produced today is a tweaked version of the Sinn F&eacute;in Rent Freeze (Fair Rent) Bill 2019.  I debated the Bill in the House when I was in opposition and I stated during that debate that I was willing to allow the Bill to proceed to pre-legislative scrutiny to provide an opportunity to tease out its ramifications, for example, the constitutionality or otherwise of the Bill and its potential impact in particular on supply throughout the country and not just in the rent pressure zones.  It is not clear to me that Sinn F&eacute;in has made any attempt to ensure the Bill is legally sound or whether, as a base requirement, it is, in fact, constitutional.  I suspect it has not and I suspect the potential impacts of the Bill have not been researched.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not seem to accept that a ban on rent increases will not increase the supply of rental accommodation.  Supply is a key constraint.  Rents rise when demand outstrips supply.  If Deputy &Oacute; Broin had sought the assistance of the parliamentary legal advisers available to him to draft the Bill, he would to know this.<br/><br/>We need to note that in the North, where Sinn F&eacute;in is in power, in February this year the Minister for Communities announced an increase in rents in one of the first acts of the Executive after its three year hiatus.  At the 11th hour, that same Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Communities decided to defer the increase but it will actually come into effect in a short 13 days' time.  There is one rule in the North and one rule in the South, as I have mentioned with regard to Killinarden.<br/><br/>On taking office I sought to quickly assist tenants.  Covid-19 has not been easy for renters or private landlords.  In my first month in office, I sought to act not just on rent increases but on tenancy terminations also.  I sought to help those most in need of help on foot of Covid-19 and those facing potential homelessness on foot of tenancy termination caused by rent arrears.  Incredibly, the Bill makes no reference to terminations or evictions.  It was my belief in opposition and it is my belief now in government that we need to strike a balance between restricting the level of rent tenants pay and keeping ordinary landlords in the system.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin rightly said this evening, if we look at the RTB data, we see that we lost almost 7,700 tenancies year on year to the first quarter of 2020.  This is a significant number that must be kept in check.<br/><br/>It is worth remembering that 70% of landlords own just one rental property and 86% of landlords own one or two rental properties.  These measures, while possibly well-intentioned, would drive more decent landlords out of the market, reducing supply and exacerbating the problem further.  The simple fact of the matter is that we need residential rental accommodation.  We have a well-regulated sector and rental properties need to be maintained.  It is not in the interests of a landlord to mistreat a tenant, and any landlord who does should be and is liable to stern prosecution, with sanctions of up to &euro;30,000 for those who breach rental pressure zone guidelines.  If we were to introduce a ban on rent increases, we would see more exits from the sector, thus stifling that much needed supply and causing an even greater problem in the sector.  I believe Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows this but the truth of it does not suit his narrative.<br/><br/>The temporary prohibition on rent increases and terminations under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expired on 1 August.  Sinn F&eacute;in's response was a blanket ban on all rent increases.  The Government recognises this is not possible and introduced measures targeted at those most in need, which I have just covered.  If we examine the two different approaches we see that section 2 of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill proposes to ban increases in rent for existing and new tenancies for three years from enactment.  There is no mention of evictions, no mention of Covid and no mention of rent freezes for those who need them most.<br/><br/>The Government's response is more comprehensive and targeted and is based on real independent research and advice.  As the Deputy mentioned, we have commissioned ESRI research on trends in rental price inflation and the introduction of rental pressure zones in Ireland.  As part of the rent index series, the RTB and the ESRI were asked to produce a short run index covering the period from January to June this year.  The key findings from the report show that rental price inflation has moderated considerably since the pandemic began.  National month-on-month declines were registered in three of the four months since March this year.  Rents in Dublin fell year-on-year in April, May and June, and rent inflation outside Dublin also dropped sharply.  Tenancy registrations with the RTB are also markedly down.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Department commissioned from the ESRI a research paper exploring the short run implications of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on the private rental market.  That report showed a very marginal increase in rent arrears and a stabilisation of tenancies, coupled with the fact the Government introduced the emergency rent supplement.  I urge anyone who is watching and who is in difficulty with rent arrears or paying rent to avail of this emergency rent supplement.<br/><br/>The Deputy might wish to share with us the findings of any independent research he and his party commissioned in the production of the Bill.  I am genuinely interested in examining it to see the research behind the Bill and the ramifications of a blanket ban for supply on the market.  The Bill presented by the Deputy focuses solely on rent increases.  There are no measures to address tenancy terminations or the impact of Covid-19.  Prior to the summer recess, with the support of my Government colleagues and acting on evidence in the ESRI research, I introduced significant tenancy protections in the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020.  This protects from eviction those who need it most and bans rent increases for those who need this protection.  The Deputy and his party voted against these protections.  Not only did they do so but they tried to convolute it further and make it harder for those who are to be protected.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin wanted people to have to declare themselves homeless rather than a simple declaration that they had been economically impacted by Covid-19.  Deputy Carthy went on radio and spoke in the D&aacute;il to suggest that we follow the lead of President Trump and make people jump through multiple hoops before they would be afforded any protection.  Instead, and in recognition of the fact that Covid-19 has been hard on tenants and individual landlords, I put in place much more targeted protections that protect the most vulnerable tenants while allowing the rental sector to resume activity in as near a normal manner as possible.  This is the responsible and correct thing to do.<br/><br/>Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears will be invalid if the warning notice has not been served to the RTB and the tenant.  Anyone who self-declares that their income and their ability to pay rent has been affected by Covid-19 will be protected.  These are real protections.  They are lawful protections.  They are protections that have been implemented and they are working.  A core principle of the Government is that everyone should have access to good-quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price in sustainable communities that offer a quality of life.  This is what we need to deliver.  The key to resolving the residential rental sector is supply.  This is why in the budget for 2020, to which the Deputy alluded, social housing delivery increased to &euro;2.63 billion, which is &euro;258 million more than 2019.  Even in this year of Covid, when we have had a shutdown, we will deliver more than 10,000 social housing units and we are pushing every week to ensure that public house building is delivered through our partners in the approved housing bodies and local authorities.<br/><br/>We are interested in real delivery of real protections for tenants from eviction in the Bill the Deputy and his party voted against.  We will have real delivery of extra homes through the most ambitious voids programme we have seen in a number of years, which will bring back 2,500 social homes into use this year through the July stimulus plan.  There is real delivery to empower local authorities to build themselves by raising the discretionary cap to &euro;6 million.  This has already been done.  There is real delivery to help those people whom the Deputy says he wants to help buy homes by increasing the help to buy grant to &euro;30,000.  A total of 19,500 people have availed of this grant and the Deputy opposes it.  He has publicly opposed it and he opposed it in the budget.  He has opposed affordable housing in the House also.  There is also real delivery in the call for housing the Government brought forward to focus on single properties and large properties to drive down homelessness for those who have been homeless for far too long.  We will keep working on this and we will deliver as a Government in the area.  We are ambitious for the country in resolving our housing crisis.</p> <p>This Bill will not help and the Deputy actually knows that.  That is why we are opposing it.</p></speech>

I concur with the Minister on what is proposed in the Bill.  As he said, the Government recently passed the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 which puts protections in place for tenants, particularly in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It makes it unlawful to evict people who are impacted by the pandemic until 11 January 2021, a welcome provision.  It also introduces new protections for those tenants who have been negatively impacted by Covid-19.  It is targeted and focused law which provides short-term and long-term measures to protect those tenants who have experienced rent arrears and hardship as a result of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Where a tenant makes a written declaration that the economic impact of Covid-19 puts his or her tenancy at risk, the Act provides protection for them.  It prohibits rent increases where tenants are impacted by the pandemic and are in receipt of income support or rent supplement.  In the long term, the new law mandates that before a notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can be served, a tenant has a further 28 days to pay any outstanding rent.  This is a welcome measure and one which has assisted many individuals.  The involvement of the Residential Tenancies Board at an early stage will help tenants vindicate their rights and help prevent evictions.</p>  <p>  It is important that the proposers of this Bill recognise the recently passed Act because it provides many protections.  These include the swift resolution by the Residential Tenancies Board on hearing disputes between tenants on deposits and the reform of the fair deal scheme to incentivise renting out vacant properties, a particular issue in my constituency.</p>  <p>  I question the Bill's constitutionality and will be opposing it.  While I am open to all considerations to assist renters, any Bill put before the House must be focused, targeted and sustainable, as well as constitutionally sound.  Accordingly, I will not be supporting the Bill.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity provided by the Opposition to highlight again the real experience of renters, the lack of security of tenure, the uncertainty, the disproportionate percentage of rental cost relative to their income and the failed housing policies pursued for the past nine years rather than providing public housing for everyone.  We know affordable housing ultimately benefits each individual in society, communities, as well as improving the competitiveness of our country.</p>  <p>  I do not welcome, however, that this Bill does little to overcome the constitutional advice a ban on rents has faced for some time.  I am disappointed the Opposition did not do more work to amend this legislation which is a copy-and-paste version of previous versions.  Fianna F&aacute;il facilitated such a version to ensure its implications could be debated.</p>  <p>  Bringing this legislation forward gives us all the opportunity to raise the issue but it does little to provide a solution.  Just short of eight weeks into the role, the Minister will provide some of the solutions.  I look forward to having the details of an affordable rental scheme, an affordable purchase scheme, tenancies of indefinite duration and a rent deposit scheme put before the House, along with the details of the many other commitments in the programme for Government published only 75 days ago.</p>  <p>  People voted for a change in the direction of housing policy.  The Government has promised this change.  Just weeks into the job, the Minister has already pressed go on many of its measures.  I welcome again the opportunity to speak about the dysfunctional housing market in Dublin.  I look forward to the solutions the Minister will bring forward.</p></speech>

I want to cut to the chase.  There have been many debates on renters and housing in this Chamber.  Renters are being ripped off in the State.  A small cohort of landlords are doing extremely well out of this.  They are doing so well that they have commodified the basic human right to shelter.  Does the Minister know how that has happened?  It has happened because his Government and previous Governments have facilitated it.</p>  <p>  Getting to the juicy details, billions of euro have been transferred to private landlords through housing subsidy payments.  This year more than &euro;1 billion will go to private landlords because of the absence of public housing.  Vulture funds were allowed to buy up billions of euro worth of loans and NAMA sold off property portfolios at vastly reduced prices.  The vulture fund, Lone Star, paid &euro;500 in corporate tax in 2016 while in the same year it made &euro;15 million in profits.  Has the world gone mad?  The bad policy was created by previous Governments.</p>  <p>  The single biggest cause of homelessness is evictions from the private rental sector.  Due to the lack of supply, rents have been inflated by the private sector.  We have a generation that has witnessed the worst housing crisis in decades, not only in the rental market but in terms of the homelessness situation.  Prior to the Covid-19 public health emergency, affordable houses were unaffordable and rents were almost unaffordable.  In the past three months, rents in this State have risen by 0.5%.  It is obvious that rent increases are Covid-resistant.</p>  <p>  In Dublin Mid-West, landlords do not accept HAP but they accept homeless HAP which is 20% more than the market rate.  For example, the rent for some houses is probably double what it was perhaps two years ago.  Landlords are causing the crazy inflationary situation where people are being completely priced out of the market.</p>  <p>  This has been created by the neo-liberal policies of the Minister&rsquo;s Government.  That will only be challenged and overturned when that policy is overturned.  There are still almost 9,500 people in emergency accommodation in this State.  It is an absolute shame that this is happening.  Until that is challenged, we will continue to come back to this Chamber to raise the same situation.</p></speech>

Between my time in the D&aacute;il and previously on a local authority, I have been elected for 11 years and housing has consistently been the number one issue I have dealt with and it is getting worse year on year.</p>  <p>  I agree with much of what Deputy Gino Kenny said about HAP and trying to find HAP properties.  It is almost impossible for people to find a property for which HAP is accepted.  I was going to take the opportunity to say to the Minister, if he was here, that the HAP system needs to be looked at.  Perhaps that message could be passed on because, when a landlord accepts HAP, that is a celebration in itself.  Much of the time someone will not get that money until the end of the month.  If, for example, a person moves into a property on 1 October, the payment is not made until the last Wednesday of the month.  People often do not have the money themselves.  That is in respect of people who qualify for HAP.  A large number do not qualify for any supports and they are trying to save, potentially for a mortgage.  It is absolutely impossible to be in the private rental market while saving for a mortgage.  It is totally unfair that just because one is in that situation, one is locked out of the housing market.</p> <p>There was a scheme a number of years ago whereby local authorities were able to provide mortgages for those with a 3% deposit.  These were for people who could prove they were able to pay rent but who perhaps just were not able to come up with a 10% deposit.  We need to start looking at imaginative measures such as this again.  We have gone totally backwards on housing.  We do not ever hear of affordable housing schemes, let alone affordable rental schemes.  At least if rents were affordable for people, they could hang on a little longer on the housing list.  One of the biggest issues we see day in and day out is people saying they do not mind if they have to wait but that they cannot afford to make up the difference in HAP or cannot find a landlord who will take HAP.  A whole bunch of other people say they do not qualify for anything.  Even though they might be on modest incomes, they are totally locked out of any supports.  People are living with their parents well past a normal age, and with their own kids.  It is totally unacceptable.  That does not even cover people facing homelessness, in emergency accommodation or in totally unsuitable accommodation but who are afraid for their lives to open their mouths for fear they will be put on notices to quit.</p> <p> Those are the main points I wanted to make.  Disappointingly, the Government has stated it will not support the Bill.  There needs to be solutions to housing, affordability and the building of public housing.  Rents are a massive part of this because if people can afford to pay their rent, it will lead to fewer notices to quit.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said earlier, it puts less pressure on the whole system if people can afford to pay.  There cannot be a Deputy here who does not hear from people day in and day out about notices to quit, not being able to find a place, or unsuitable accommodation.  It is a major stress for everybody in those situations.  I do not know how many more times we have to talk about this here or how many more debates we have to have on it, but we really need to see some solutions.  It is disappointing that the Government will vote against this.</p></speech>

It is only fair we share the time.  While everybody wants to support the Bill tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, and the Labour Party also appreciates the opportunity to speak on the issue of housing, I am disappointed the Minister is no longer in the Chamber.  We have, however, had some constructive engagement with him in the past, particularly on one of the housing strategies the Labour Party is trying to pursue, which is a rent-to-buy scheme.  The Minister of State will appreciate that, particularly in high-rent areas, it is difficult for couples or individuals to rent and to save for a deposit at the same time.  We were trying to reintroduce a previous scheme whereby an individual could, through the local authority, rent for three years, with all that rent going towards a deposit, and walk away from the scheme after three years if they so wished or put that towards a deposit and get on the property ladder, the idea being that one did not have to rent and save simultaneously.  Many of these schemes were reasonably successful previous to the crash but were then discontinued.  We want to work proactively with the Department and try to get some of these State-sponsored schemes up and running again to benefit people.</p>  <p>  I will say this much about the Minister's response.  I served in government for a particularly short period of 18 months, and one of the big lessons I learned there was that when Government says something is not possible, unconstitutional or not legal, all those barriers can be overcome if the matter is important enough.  There are any number of things we were once told were not possible, potentially not legal or potentially unconstitutional, concerns which were all swept aside once the Covid crisis hit.  I refer to rent freezes, eviction freezes and the nationalisation of health services.</p>  <p>  I wish to outline how serious the situation is by referring to the Daft rental report for quarter 1 of 2020.  It states that rents increased by 3.8% nationally year-on-year, which marks the lowest rate of inflation since late 2012.  However, while rents fell nationwide by 2.1% between March and April of 2020 in the teeth of the Covid crisis, between their lowest point in the early 2010s and the peak of quarter 1 of 2020, they increased by between 52% in Connacht-Ulster and 107% in Dublin.  As for rent-a-room trends in quarter 1 of 2020, in Dublin city centre, the average rent for a single bedroom was &euro;715, an increase of 8.2% year-on-year.  The average rent for a double bedroom in the city was &euro;820, an increase of 4.6% year-on-year.  In south-east Leinster, the average rent for a single bedroom was &euro;389, an increase of 16.1% year-on-year.  In Limerick city centre, the average rent for a single bedroom was &euro;429, an increase of 16.3% year-on-year.  In Waterford city centre, the average rent for a double bedroom was &euro;399, an increase of 9.6% year-on-year.  In Galway city centre the average rent for a double bedroom was &euro;1,260, an increase of 19.7% year-on-year.  According to the Daft housing report of July 2020, the average national rent was &euro;1,412.  The average rent in Dublin was &euro;2,030 in July 2020.  Monthly rents were on average 0.5% lower in Dublin but higher than March levels elsewhere.  Rent has increased in Laois by 4% year-on-year and is now at an average of &euro;1,002.  Rent has increased in Longford by 3.3% year-on-year to &euro;737 on average.  Rent has increased in Kilkenny by 4.2% year-on-year to &euro;999 on average.  Rent has increased in Limerick county by 3.4% to &euro;925 on average.  In Longford, the monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment has increased by 8% year-on-year to &euro;556 on average.  In Carlow, the monthly rent for a one-bed apartment has increased by 9% year-on-year to &euro;724 on average.  I will give just one more example because I know that other Deputies wish to make contributions.  In Dublin 24, the average monthly rent for a one-bed apartment increased by 5% year-on-year to &euro;1,425.</p>  <p>  The point I am trying to make is that people in opposition are genuinely trying to find solutions and coming into this Chamber from a good place.  I challenge the Minister's contention that when legislation is put in front of him, people are playing games, are not serious or are not dealing with crisis situations facing families and individuals day by day.  When answers come that refer to constitutionality or legality, I do not necessarily take them at face value because of my experience.  With a bit of imagination and the same sort of energy and belief we all came together with at the beginning of the Covid crisis, we could overcome a significant number of issues.  With that in mind, I would like the Minister of State in his contribution to refer to the rent-to-buy scheme the Labour Party is trying to pursue.</p></speech>

I wish to make just a few points.  First, I wish to address the issue of supply of rental units.  There is something of a narrative that if rental income levels are not increased, that will hit supply.  The one thing we can say with certainty about this is that rental incomes have gone up considerably in recent years, particularly during the period before RPZs were brought in but also since they were brought in.  In most areas, rental incomes were increasing beyond the percentage allowed for under the RPZ legislation.  We have the statistics on this from the Daft reports.  Insufficient rental income is not causing problems with rental supply.  In most parts of the country, rental income is well above the cost of a mortgage in the area.  The landlord or investor in most instances is, therefore, able to cover his or her repayments and make his or her tax contributions, whereas in the past landlords sometimes had to supplement their mortgage repayments based on rental income.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Income is not the problem.   There are problems with infrastructure and constraints in the development of new housing.  There are issues with land supply and who controls development land, and the lack of affordable, social and cost-rental housing schemes.  However, rental income is not the issue.</p> <p> In 2004, the RTB was set up, limited regulations were brought in to address the private residential sector and modest improvements to security of tenure were introduced.  At the time, there was a strong narrative to the effect that this would lead to a big exodus from the private rental sector.  This is what we were told.  What happened after 2004 in terms of rental supply?  Did it contract?  Was there an exodus?  The opposite happened.  Between 2006 and 2016, there was a doubling in the number of households that were renting following the introduction of those modest measures that we were told would lead to an exodus.  Much of that increase happened after the collapse of the Celtic Tiger and it is clear that some of the issues relating to supply are not connected to rental income because many of the increases in rental supply that happened at that time took place while rents were not increasing.</p> <p> We know from the ESRI study that was published in July that, before the pandemic, one in three households in the private rented residential sector had insufficient income after paying the rent to meet basic costs of living.  Rental costs are having a major impact on people&rsquo;s lives and their ability to do the basics.  I refer to families making a decision about whether they can afford to pay for a GAA camp for their children over the summer and so on.  They may not be able to meet those costs because of rental pressures.</p> <p> I am glad that a number of Government Deputies raised constitutional issues.  I am also glad that there is the commitment to a referendum on housing in the programme for Government, and I welcome that the T&aacute;naiste confirmed that there will be a referendum on the right to housing on Leaders' Questions earlier.  This is significant because that was ambiguous in the programme for Government.  I urge the Minister to ensure that referendum is brought forward as quickly as possible.  If the Government has concerns about constitutionality, it is in their power to bring forward the referendum, which would balance constitutional rights to private property and would mean, in all these areas, we could do more to protect tenants and to balance those rights.  That is within the gift of the Government.  </p> <p> In addition, on the issue of constitutionality, significant intervention is made by the Exchequer and the Government in the private rental sector that increases and inflates rent.  The massive amounts put into the rented sector, which have to be provided because there is a lack of social and affordable housing, through various housing subsidies, HAP, rent supplement and other schemes have an upward pressure on rents.  If such Government intervention was not made, rents would be much lower.  On that basis, it is justified and proportionate for the Government to take measures to control rent because there is such a large amount of taxpayers' money going into the sector and distorting rents.  The Government has a responsibility to do that in the interests of those who are renting and not in receipt of State subsidies.  They are paying higher rents as a result of the State's failure to provide sufficient social, affordable and cost-rental schemes on housing.  There is a strong argument on that basis that this would be constitutionally justifiable.</p> <p> I will conclude there in the interests of time and I look forward to the response from the Minister.</p></speech>

I thank the previous Deputies who cut their time short.  I strongly welcome the Bill that has been brought forward by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  This is something I have always strongly supported and I believe all of those in our communities who believe in fairness and justice will also support it.  Only the vested interests would oppose it.  I acknowledge there are decent landlords out there, whom I have met, who have not raised their rents to the horrendous levels that we are seeing.</p>  <p>  It is disingenuous of the Minister, who has, disappointingly, left the Chamber rather than waiting for the end, to claim that one measure will solve the housing crisis.  That is utter nonsense and he knows it.  We know the housing sector is in a complete and utter mess but it is not by accident.  It is by design.  It is the failure of this Government and, in particular, previous Governments over the years who have failed to provide social and affordable housing for people in our community.  That has created this situation.  The desire and drive to push everything into the private sector and the abandonment by previous Governments of social and affordable housing has led to where we are now.  That is important to note.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned landlords who own one home, and we hear this all the time.  However, he never talks about the influx of institutional landlords and vulture groups who come into this country.  That is never mentioned in this Chamber.  We see them in my constituency of Dublin West.  They are buying blocks of apartments and rows of houses because it is extremely profitable.  They see that this Government and previous Governments have made any attempt to rein in the ever-increasing rents.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, I received a message concerning a landlord renting two box rooms, one for &euro;550 per month and another for &euro;600 per month.  Some landlords are moving families out of their homes to allow them to move individuals in because they can charge such amounts for small rooms and they do not get the same &ldquo;value" when it comes to families.  That is why a lot of families find it extremely difficult to rent accommodation.  I met another family recently who had been in housing but had lost the house.  They did not qualify for HAP.  They were a working family and well above the threshold.  They were in a bidding war with other people.  It started at &euro;2,000 and ended at &euro;2,400 per month for a traditional three-bedroom house in Littlepace, Clonee.  It is shameful that a person would stand there looking at families desperately trying to cobble money together to get up to &euro;2,400 per month.  They did it because they had no choice whatsoever.</p>  <p>  I support the Bill.  I am disappointed that the Government will not support it.  It is time that we took on the vested interests, the institutions and vulture groups who are buying huge tracts of property in this country and stood with the people.  We should build social housing and affordable housing.  We should get people back into affordable rental accommodation to solve this problem for the future.  We can do it but it will only be done if people really want to see it done. </p></speech>

It will be a first if I do not go over time.  I thank my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, for bringing this forward.  Everyone accepts we are dealing with a nightmare scenario as regards rentals.  We have a situation that has been created by the fact that the State has failed to build houses.  There was an acceptance that the private sector would sort things out and the market would regulate itself but that has not happened.</p> <p>I accept that there have been some useful initiatives from the Minister concerning voids.  As my colleagues have stated, however, we need multiple solutions to what is a complex problem.  We must ensure we have affordable cost rental opportunities, mortgages and rents.  All that has already been detailed here.  The baseline is set by HAP.  It is necessary to ensure people who should be able to avail of social housing, which does not exist, can access HAP.  Houses in towns like Dundalk, even modest houses in local authority areas, now have prices that we would not have been thought possible some years ago.  Families are being charged from &euro;1,200 up to &euro;1,600 a month.  That is absolute madness.  Those families are also being outbid by groups of young people who may work in factories locally and can afford that level of rent.  However, that means there are many people who fall between two stools and that is the story with which we are dealing.  Many people have already mentioned that the PUP is being cut and that means we are now dealing with a cohort of people who need all possible protections.</p> <p> I welcome that the Minister is going to meet Louth County Council soon, because we have a major issue with land banks that were bought at great cost on instruction from the Government in 2007, back at the height of the boom.  These lands are costing Louth County Council about &euro;1 million per year.  We must ensure we deal with that problem as it impacts local authority funding.  We must begin a proper housebuilding project.  That is absolutely necessary.  The underfunding of local authorities is another major problem.  Not only were many voids let go for six months to a year, and we welcome the moneys provided to turn around some of them, but there is also a great deal of housing stock but an insufficient budget to deal with it.</p> <p> This is only one small step, but it is absolutely necessary in stopping the rot of rising rent prices.  We must deal with the difficult issue of institutional landlords and ensure we give protections not only to tenants, but also to decent landlords.  Organisations such as Threshold and Focus Ireland have spoken about the need to professionalise the sector.  I refer to landlords with three houses, or fewer, who want to do the right thing.  The first thing we must do, however, is ensure that rents do not go up and that we allow them to fall by increasing supply.  The responsibility here lies with the Government.  If there are constitutional difficulties, it is up to the Government to offer another solution.</p></speech>

We all meet people in our clinics with genuine concerns and the most vulnerable people we see are those affected by the issues raised here tonight.  It is important that we respond in the most genuine fashion in trying to ensure we protect the most vulnerable.  We all know that rents are unaffordable, that we need a sustainable rental market and that people want to own their own homes.  We are also aware that there has been a major response to the problems in the housing and rental sector.  One amendment, however, amounting to fewer than 100 words, will not fix our rental market.  This is a simplistic, opportunistic headline to legislate by soundbite.  There is supporting evidence attached to this legislation.  I do not see any response from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers, which is a service that Deputies can use to back up their proposed legislation with evidence.</p>  <p>  Major actors in the rental sector, such as the ESRI, Threshold and the RTB, have highlighted rent arrears as a major issue.  The Government responded to those concerns with a real solution by bringing forward the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, which recognised, in a targeted manner, the need to protect the most vulnerable in our society.  A ban was placed on the eviction of tenants with rent arrears because of the impact of Covid-19 to ensure they could remain in their tenancies until 10 January 2021, along with a freeze on rent increases.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward this simplistic Bill, with zero evidence, which will provide no solution to the issues outlined.  The Government has taken action.  We have 53 rent pressure zones, covering 75% of tenancies.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 made it a criminal offence for landlords to contravene the law regarding rent increases.  We have increased the associated penalties up to &euro;30,000 and there are 188 ongoing investigations.  These are real solutions.  I encourage all politicians, in every party and none, to work with the Government to provide genuine solutions, backed up with evidence, that will work.</p>  <p>  I also strongly believe that this proposed legislation would have unintended consequences regarding housing supply.  The legislation is unworkable, and that has been proved.  My major concern, however, arises from Sinn F&eacute;in being the major Opposition party in our Republic.  In the North, a proposed rent increase of 2.7%, supported by Sinn F&eacute;in, comes into effect in 13 days' time, which is at variance with what is being done in this Republic.  What is proposed in the North, is opposed in the South.  Conor Murphy constantly takes the credit for rates waivers and business supports, supports which I think were delayed.  At the same time, Sinn F&eacute;in blames the British Government and claims it has no control.  The exact opposite is the case.</p>  <p>  Genuinely vulnerable people who are crying out for real solutions in our rental sector do not want to be misled by proposed legislation which is not workable and cannot be implemented.  People want real responses that can make their week easier and genuinely secure their tenancies.  I believe fully that the Government's response is the best possible in the current climate.  It is a targeted response that protects the most vulnerable, including those in difficulties with rental arrears.  As the rent supplement has been increasingly publicised in recent weeks, more people have availed of it.  We want to create a way to get secure tenancies through a link with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service and other supports.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Department have worked hard to produce an affordable housing scheme that will provide homes at affordable rates to ensure people can realise the dream, to which so many rightly aspire, of owning their own home.</p>  <p>  Regarding the marketplace, some 86% or more of landlords own just one or two properties.  We must ensure that supply is maintained and that we have a fair and affordable rental market.  What is key in doing that is not for a political party, in fewer than 100 words, to claim it has the silver bullet that will secure and fix our rental crisis and keep vulnerable families in their rental properties, when that claim is not true.  Anyone proposing a Bill in this House should come forward with real evidence and legal advice - in this case, evidence from Threshold, the ESRI and the RTB - to demonstrate that he or she is pursuing an avenue that can deliver the desired results for the public.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-17a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700069#VVV00400"><p>It is regrettable that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, did not stay to listen to the contributions of other Deputies and to the conclusion of the debate.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State.  It gives the House the impression that the Minister is not interested in a genuine debate, where we thrash out differing opinions to try to reach the best solutions. The former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, unfortunately developed a similar habit and his Minister of State, Deputy English, often had to come in to do the graveyard shift.  In the few short weeks that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has been in that position, he is increasingly sounding and acting like his predecessor, which was something he told us he would not do when he was on this side of the House.  I thank the Minister of State for his comments.</p> <p>If he had been here for my speech, he would have heard me address one of the key points he went on to make.  This measure on its own is not going to solve the crisis in the rental sector.  I went on to list another eight or nine measures for which Sinn F&eacute;in has been arguing for years and which the Government has previously ignored.  In the round, those measures would resolve these problems.<br/><br/>I must also say that both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, criticised the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Communities in Northern Ireland for increasing council rents by just over 2%.  That is not the same as what this Bill is about.  This Bill is about the private rental sector and I would have thought that a Minister of State would know the difference between social housing and private rental housing.  Rents in the social rental sector in the North had not been increased for five years and because of a lack of funding from Westminster, the Minister for Communities did the right thing to provide additional funding.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il councillors across the country are also increasing council rents because of a failure of central government to provide adequate income.<br/><br/>In the quarter-on-quarter rent index of the Residential Tenancies Board, one will see that rent pressure zones, the centrepiece of the policy of Deputies Coveney and Eoghan Murphy to constrain rents, have been an abject failure.  Not in a single year have rent pressure zones constrained rents within the designated areas by 4%.  They have not worked.  The Minister of State should read the data that he is telling me I should present to him before he comes and makes arguments that are factually incorrect.<br/><br/>The Minister should not doubt for one second my seriousness in bringing forward these propositions or the work my colleagues and I do.  He may disagree with me, and I respect that, but to suggest that I am bringing forward Bills that I know will not work is deeply disrespectful to any Member of this House.<br/><br/>The Minister made some other points.  He criticised Sinn F&eacute;in councillors for voting against a housing development in Killinarden in South Dublin County Council.  Our councillors did the right thing.  Up to half of the homes on that public land will be sold at unaffordable prices on the open, private market.  That is not a good strategic use of a vital public asset, public land.  All of that development should be social, affordable rental and affordable purchase homes and I must say that any councillor who allows houses to be sold at prices of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000 clearly does not understand the crises facing working families to rent or buy.<br/><br/>The Minister criticised me for not doing any legal research and I am surprised he made that comment because we have had this discussion before and I told him them what I will tell him now.  I consulted with two of the country's leading constitutional law experts at some length between the presentation of the most recent Bill and this one.  Professors Kenny and Walsh from Trinity College are so eminent that they are two of the five authors of the standard academic text on the Irish Constitution.  They have not told me any secrets.  After Fianna F&aacute;il issued the legal advice it had received from a non-constitutional law expert last December, Professors Kenny and Walsh published in <i>The Irish Times </i>and on <i>thejournal.ie</i>their conclusions that such measures could well be constitutional.  They criticised the repeated attempts of Governments over the years to hide behind the Constitution because it is ultimately only the Supreme Court that makes that decision.  <br/><br/>I do not have the advantage of having an Attorney General.  If the Government wants to share that service with the Opposition, we will happily take them up on it.  I am willing to say that, if I were the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I would go all the way to the courts to defend the rights of renters and if the Constitution needed to be changed to do that, so be it.  There is quite a lot of legal weight behind the proposition we have outlined today.<br/><br/>The Minister and the Minister of State have said that they are concerned that temporarily banning rent increases will have a negative impact on supply.  Think about for a moment.  What that means is that institutional investors who pay no tax on their rent roll or capital gains, have access to large volumes of cash and the highest rents in the history of the State, will stop investing.  The Minister of State is actually telling us that the only way we can see the increase in supply that he says is needed is if we allow those institutional investors to keep increasing rents.  That is what he is saying.  The proposition I have put forward is that we freeze rents at their high point.  We are not taking anything from those institutional investors or landlords, we are simply saying that rents cannot go any higher and tenants cannot pay any more.  I believe that if that measure is combined with the other measures I outlined earlier, particularly a major capital investment in affordable cost rental by the Government in the budget, renters will be protected and supply will be increased at the same time.<br/><br/>The Minister criticised me for not putting every other proposal around protecting renters into this Bill.  That is because I want a single focus on this issue but the Minister should rest assured because I have five other pieces of legislation currently with the Bills Office and there will be many more to come.  The one thing the Minister will know from when he was on this side of this House is that we are not short of propositions or ideas.<br/><br/>I must say that the defence by the Minister and Minister of State of the appalling piece of legislation that they rammed through the House in a short period of time in July is a disgrace.  That legislation stripped vital protections from thousands of renters.  The Minister and Minister of State have said that is a good thing.  Of course, the very small number of renters who will receive the new protections will welcome them but I am concerned about all renters and that is why I opposed that Bill and would do so again.  <br/><br/>I have to laugh when I hear the Minister talking about the voids programme because, when he was in opposition, he agreed with us that the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was being deliberately misleading when he presented the small amount of top-up funding for refurbishing casual re-lets as somehow bringing voids back into use.  There are virtually no long-term voids left in our housing stock and certainly not in urban areas.  What the Minister has done is give a small amount of top-up funding to local authorities to refurbish vacant units that have recently been vacated by a tenant but because the Government traditionally would not give the local authorities enough money to vacate and refurbish properties, it is now giving that top-up.  Those are not voids, they are casual re-lets and the Minister and his officials know it.  It is time we are honest about that.<br/><br/>The Minister also criticised Sinn F&eacute;in's opposition to the help-to-buy scheme.  It is one of the most appalling housing policies that was introduced by the previous Government.  It has without doubt helped some people but it has disadvantaged many more because it inflates house prices.  It locks in house prices and, in fact, 40% of the households who got significant sums of money did not need it because they had the deposit before they applied for the scheme.  Even still, we gave them another &euro;20,000 of taxpayers' money that should have gone to struggling families who cannot save a deposit, buy or rent a home at affordable levels.<br/><br/>I am not surprised at the policy positions of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael because they have never stood by renters and that is why our rental market is so dysfunctional.  Not once, for decades, have renters got a good turn.  The idea that a balance has to be struck between landlords and tenants suggests that somehow there is an equivalence between the two when landlords will always have greater power because they own the asset whereas tenants will always be more vulnerable.  I do not like to criticise the new Chairman of the housing committee because we are only beginning to build a relationship but I am disappointed that the silence of the Green Party in the debate has been deafening.  Of course, that is because this is a policy the party previously supported.  The fact that nobody from the Green Party has come in to explain their position will be seen by many people as the beginning of a substantial shift in the policy of that party on housing and that is disappointing.  I mean no disrespect to my colleague who is here.<br/><br/>First-time buyers and struggling renters will judge this Government by what it delivers.  The Minister of State said that his party did a great job with renters when, in fact, the rental market is worse today than it was when the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, published his rental plan a number of years ago.  That is true by every single indicator of the Residential Tenancies Board, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the non-governmental sector.  We have a new Government and we will judge it by what it does.  If it delivers large volumes of generally affordable homes for working people to rent or buy, I will applaud and commend it from this side of the House.  However, if it continues to do what Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Coveney did, which is to promise much but deliver next to nothing for struggling renters, we will hold the Government to account, criticise it and demonstrate that better policy alternative are available until such time as the tables are turned and Sinn F&eacute;in is on that side of the House, delivering real change for the renters and potential home buyers who need the support of a Government, which they have not got since 2016.</p></speech>
