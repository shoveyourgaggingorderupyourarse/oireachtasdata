Will he confirm that on foot of engagement from his Department, the Department of Finance is to organise a roadshow for institutional investors in the residential property market, including so-called cuckoo funds, to "reassure" those investors, in the words of the Department of Finance, following moves introduced by the Government to try to reduce the level of bulk-buying of family homes by such funds earlier this year?</p></reply>

It gets two priority questions every six weeks, and it did not ask about rent, homelessness, affordable housing or building capacity in the construction sector but has raised this non-issue.  It has done so, and deems it as important, because it wants to create a controversy and sow discontent.  It wants to put its own sinister, disingenuous slant on this.  The tactic is reprehensible.  I watched the party leader earlier in the week and the attitude she had on this, trying to create this issue that does not exist.  It is dishonest and the Deputy knows it is.</p>  <p>  That is irrelevant, however.  Why let the facts get in the way of a good story?  The Deputy should be better than this.  He should be honest with people.  He has a responsibility as a Deputy and legislator but his priority is to raise a non-issue to create a controversy.  As he knows, I have no plans to attend any of the proposed events he referenced.  The action in Housing for All relates to ensuring there is investment in the Irish property market.  Ironically, the Deputy's party leader said Ireland should be open for investment.  What does he want?  We are investing &euro;4 billion a year through Housing for All, which is &euro;1.2 billion more than the Deputy's party proposed in its 12-page submission to the strategy.  Where will the rest of the capital come from?</p>  <p>  I have no plans to attend any such proposed events.  Perhaps we can get onto some real issues.</p></speech>

When the Minister was in opposition, he was very vocal, and rightly so, about the impact of certain categories of investors, which he called cuckoo funds, and the impact they were having on the affordability crisis.  This question is about affordability because the Government continues to pursue the same policies as the previous Government, incentivising the wrong kinds of investors into the residential property market, to buy up homes - not build them - from under the noses of buyers.  Given the excessive tax breaks they get from the Government, they are able to outbid not only buyers but approved housing bodies, local authorities and others.  Sinn F&eacute;in is doing nothing other than reporting on a memo secured under freedom of information by Craig Hughes from the <i>Mail on Sunday</i>, in which the Department of Finance stated these investors, investors the Minister called cuckoo funds, were spooked and that the Minister needed to engage with them to reassure them Ireland is open for business.</p><p>Perhaps he will treat the question with the same seriousness with which he addressed this issue when he was in opposition, or perhaps it is another one of the commitments he has abandoned now that he has become Minister.</p></speech>

The Government has a plan with 213 actions to tackle it.  We have introduced the Affordable Housing Act, which Sinn F&eacute;in supported even though it criticised it throughout its passage, and a reformed Land Development Agency to build on State land to increase supply, which is what we need to do, but Sinn F&eacute;in voted against that.  In the case of most other legislation we have introduced as a Government, while Sinn F&eacute;in has criticised it, it has ended up supporting it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy proposes non-ideas.  This is a non-issue and he knows it.  This is what he deems to be a priority.  This is Sinn F&eacute;in's priority.  Once every six weeks, it gets to ask two priority questions, and the Deputy is raising an issue to try to stir up a controversy that does not exist.  I reiterate there are no plans such as those he suggested.</p></speech>

When he was in opposition, he rightly highlighted the distorting impact of certain categories of investors, which he called cuckoo funds, on people's ability to buy homes.  The mealy-mouthed measure the Minister introduced earlier this year, of a mere 8% increase in stamp duty, will do nothing to stop this category of investor bulk-buying at inflated prices homes that should be bought either by working people and families or by approved housing bodies and local authorities for social and affordable homes.</p>  <p>  Again, the origin of this story is a memo from the Department of Finance at the request of officials from the Minister's Department to set up a roadshow to reassure these same investors.  That he cannot just honestly admit there was a proposal to do that, and that he is now saying he will not attend such events because he is fearful of the political backlash, shows he is not serious about tackling an issue he claims he was serious about in opposition.  It is time to stop these funds buying up homes from working families, something he promised but has failed to do.</p></speech>

We have banned bulk-buying of family homes and duplexes.  Just this week, we introduced an owner-occupier guarantee, which will come forward in the large-scale residential development, LSRD, Bill, which I assume the Deputy will support.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in the conditions of two recent decisions on planning permission, has underpinned what the Government did and has restricted the sale of any of those properties to more than one individual.</p>  <p>  They are the facts, but they do not matter to the Deputy because what he wants is a video clip for social media.  He continues to want to try to create a story and issue that does not exist.  Is Ireland is open for investment, in Sinn F&eacute;in's view?  Does it want investment?  We need investment of about &euro;20 billion, or &euro;12 billion a year, in housing.  Is Sinn F&eacute;in going to provide all of that?</p></speech>

He will be aware that Housing for All is our Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 units per year over the next decade.  This target includes the delivery of about 90,000 new social homes and just short of 54,000 new affordable homes from 2022 to 2030.  As I mentioned, Housing for All is supported by an investment package of more than &euro;4 billion each year, through an overall combination of &euro;12 billion in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5 billion through the Land Development Agency, LDA, and &euro;5 billion through the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  Under our plan, we will deliver 47,600 new build social homes from 2022 to 2026.</p>  <p>  We are setting individual targets now for the delivery of social housing and they have been provided to each local authority under the Housing for All plan.  I have asked the local authorities in Tipperary and elsewhere to develop housing delivery action plans and those plans must be submitted to me, the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Burke, and the Department by December 2021.  These plans will set out details on how and when local authorities will deliver their housing targets.  Turning to Tipperary specifically, the county council there has been issued a target to deliver 887 new build social homes between 2022 and 2026.  This includes a target for 2022 of 230 new builds.  We will also allow a small amount of acquisition in that space, but those 230 homes are new builds.</p>  <p>  Details on social housing delivery for each local authority are included in the social housing statistics published quarterly by my Department.  We want to have transparency in this endeavour for elected representatives, including Deputies and councillors.  The social housing construction status report, which is also published quarterly by my Department, will include scheme-level detail on social housing building activity.  Therefore, we have provided the finance, we now have the target and we await the housing delivery plans from Tipperary County Council to arrive before the end of December.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1609" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100004#B00200"><p>The housing department of Tipperary County Council is progressive and organised and it does a pretty good job in delivering social and affordable housing.  However, it must be noted that due to a lack of building over the years and because of changes in policy, we have a problem in Tipperary regarding the availability of social housing.  When many people read about housing issues, they think the problem is a city issue and a Dublin issue, but it is not.  It is also an issue in rural Ireland.  In my constituency of Tipperary, Carrick-on-Suir, for instance, has 353 approved applicants with no houses.  Tipperary town, Cahir and Cashel have 862 applicants with no possibility of getting houses in the short term.  Clonmel has 662 approved applicants for housing, while Nenagh has 757 and Templemore has 954.  Overall, we have a total of 3,588 people living in substandard housing conditions and we are told that 230 houses will be available in the next year, so there is a massive shortfall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100004#B00300"><p>The Deputy is correct that there are challenges in this area, including in building up resources in local authorities.  I agree with the Deputy completely that the challenges we face in housing are not just urban-centric, they exist all across the country in urban and rural areas.  Our job as a Government and my job as the Minister is to support local authorities to enable them to deliver in this regard.  We are providing the human resources for county councils, like the one in Tipperary, to enable them to create their own housing delivery teams and we will provide those posts for them.</p>  <p>  We must build that capacity up.  The target for next year of 230 new build homes will stretch some local authorities, but it is achievable.  In the short term to 2026, delivering just short of 900 new social homes will make a significant impact.  We have gone through those targets individually with each local authority, including with Tipperary County Council.  We will provide whatever support is needed to help the local authority to meet those targets and to make real strides in reducing the housing waiting list in Tipperary.</p></speech>

St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Thurles is a campus of Mary Immaculate College, MIC, and it trains teachers.  The college has a development and expansion plan, and it has been a successful venture for everybody, including for the economy of Thurles.  I contacted the Minister, as well as the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris.  Can he tell me if there has been any progress in determining how we can fund the development of this accommodation on the campus of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Thurles?</p></speech>

On Tuesday of this week, I had a bilateral meeting with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to discuss several issues around student accommodation.  Included in those discussions was the issue of how we might be able to assist in providing accommodation on the campus of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Thurles.  We met with senior officials and representatives from the area and we are progressing this project.  I have asked the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to engage directly with the Housing Finance Agency in this regard.  As the Deputy rightly said, we have a commitment to allow technological universities to borrow money for the construction of accommodation.  A small bit of legal work is being done on that aspect to bring it to conclusion and that will be completed by the end of the year.  The initial view is that St. Patrick&rsquo;s College in Thurles could very well be able to access funds from the HFA now, and I will ask the representatives of the technological university to engage directly with officials of the HFA.  We will be there to assist in any way we can, because there is a unique opportunity in Thurles to provide a significant amount of student accommodation in a short time.  Everyone would welcome that, so we will do everything we can to help.</p></speech>

After deliberating on the proposal for two years, An Bord Plean&aacute;la rejected the proposal, but that has been struck down in a recent High Court decision.  While I am not asking the Minister to talk about any individual planning application or court decision, because he is prohibited from doing so, the recent High Court decision is the latest in a series of decisions that have found An Bord Plean&aacute;la at variance with planning law in respect of strategic development zones and strategic housing developments, SHDs.  Is the Minister of State concerned about this trend and will he consider a review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions to ensure that they are consistent with good policymaking?</p></reply>

I wish to explain from the outset that under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in respect of any particular case in which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may be concerned.</p>  <p>  Sections 50, 50A and 50B of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, codified a statutory right of judicial review of any decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la takes full cognisance of any settled legal adjudication in respect of its decisions and seeks to apply any principles arising from such adjudication to its application of its statutory decision-making role.  Section 3.2.4 of Housing for All - A New Housing Plan for Ireland sets out several objectives with the aim of improving the functioning of the planning system, including a comprehensive review and consolidation of planning legislation.  The review will also include a fitness check and upgrade of relevant provisions of planning law to ensure that it is more accessible and streamlined from a legal perspective.  The review, which is being led by the Attorney General, is due to be finalised by September 2022 to allow updated legislation to be enacted by December 2022.  </p>  <p>  A review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la was undertaken by an expert panel and published in March 2016, as the Deputy may be aware.  An implementation group, with representation from the Department and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, was established to oversee the implementation of the review's recommendations.  The review contained 101 recommendations concerning legislative provisions and a review of those 101 recommendations is under way in respect of the proposals we are considering in that context.</p></speech>

I will repeat it, therefore, but I will also give some more context.  We have now had three, if not four, High Court judgments where decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on planning applications for material alterations to the docklands SDZ have been struck down.  We have also had a growing number of conflicts between local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of its decisions on strategic housing developments.  In fact, of the 89 SHDs that have been granted, almost half have been opposed by the planning authorities.</p> <p>That is an important fact.  Dublin City Council has opposed almost 25% of the 29 approved strategic housing developments, SHDs, in its jurisdiction.  Almost half have been opposed by South Dublin County Council in its area.  Exactly half have been opposed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The planning authorities in Fingal, Meath and Cork have taken views at strict variance with the board.  Given the growing conflict between the High Court and the board and between local authorities and the board, surely this is something the Minister should be looking at now, not putting off for a year or more until the review of the Attorney General is published.</p></speech>

The recommendations on foot of that review are now being examined as to their implementation subsequent to that.  My Department has an oversight agreement with An Bord Plean&aacute;la where vital issues and concerns are raised on an ongoing basis.  The Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, has statutory functions to conduct reviews in this area.  The powers and armoury are there and are being acted on, as I referenced in terms of the implementation group, the oversight agreement with the Department and in connection with the OPR.</p>  <p>  More issues relating to the case will be coming at the end of November so I want to be very careful about issues that are before the courts.  All these issues are taken into account.  I wish to reaffirm the board's independence.  That point is important in the context of this debate.</p></speech>

I am not asking about the implementation of the 101 recommendations of the 2016 review, nor am I asking about the more comprehensive review of the planning system by the Attorney General.  I am asking about a specific trend.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, raised similar concerns in the context of a court case between Dublin City Council and the board.  It is not credible to have six or seven local authorities in constant conflict with the board, and the board losing a string of High Court decisions.  I am not asking the Minister of State to comment on the court decisions or the individual planning applications.  A trend has emerged recently as a direct result of the strategic housing development, SHD, policy, which, thankfully, the Minister is scrapping, albeit he is taking far too long to do so.  At the centre of this is the section 28 mandatory ministerial guidelines for building heights and substandard apartment design standards, which will continue even after the SHD process expires.  I am asking the Minister of State to give a commitment to using the oversight body he just mentioned to raise this recent trend as a matter of urgency with the board to try to have the matter addressed.</p></speech>

Some 27,000 planning permissions are granted in this State per annum, 10% of which go to appeal.  The process is working as prescribed.  There are instances, such as those the Deputy has outlined, of concern and we are actively engaging on those issues.  The Minister and I are working on the judicial reform Bill, another key piece of legislation which will improve the functioning of the planning system and ensure it is delivering key capital projects that this Government is putting finance behind.  All of this is being worked on actively.  I assure the Deputy we are keeping a watching brief and acting on any points of concern within the planning code.  The review that is ongoing with the Attorney General's office will be most comprehensive to ensure that the planning code is fit for purpose and passes stress tests to ensure it is delivering for society.</p></speech>

The application of the derelict sites levy is only one of those powers which also include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites and acquiring derelict sites by agreement or compulsorily.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.  Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a primary concern for this Government, as demonstrated by the fact that one of our four pathways is dedicated solely to this priority area in the new Housing for All strategy.  Work is under way in the Department of Finance, through the current local property tax returns, to assess the present vacancy situation and once collated and analysed, this data will contribute to a number of the policy initiatives outlined in Housing for All, including a new local authority-led programme to help local authorities buy or compulsorily purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market and will ensure homes do not lie vacant; reform of the fair deal scheme to remove disincentives to selling or renting unused homes; the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund, which will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of service sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages in a sustainable way; and our new towns first policy, which will include approaches to utilising stock and new financial incentives.  These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax consideration being pursued by the Department of Finance.  The Department intends to engage with the local authorities in a proactive way and continue to do so and to ensure effective enforcement of the provisions of this legislation.  It also intends to carry out a review of the Act, which has been improving its effectiveness since 1990.</p></speech>

That figure was released to me in a reply to a parliamentary question.  It is disappointing.  In fact, it is a scandal and it is happening under this Minister's watch.  All across this State, potential homes are being left to rot every day.  That is clearly a Government problem.  Not one single local authority has collected the full levy, with the majority collecting nothing at all.  This is not a case of local authorities dropping the ball.  It is a case of systematic underfunding and a failure to support local authorities.  The most powerful tool local authorities have for returning derelict houses to the housing stock is the derelict sites levy.  Some 30 local authorities did not impose any such levy and 21 local authorities did not collect a cent.</p></speech>

That can be proved with evidence.  If one is to critically evaluate the network, one should look at Waterford.  Almost 55% of Waterford's repair and leasing scheme has been utilised.  That is delivering properties on the ground.  I was there to see it first-hand.  One should look at how compulsory purchase orders are used in Louth to deliver local properties that were derelict back into use.  There is &euro;50,000 available from the Department and every local authority will be required to have a full-time vacant homes officer by the end of the year.  Many of those officers are currently working part time, notwithstanding the fact that the Department gives &euro;50,000 per annum towards a salary for a vacant homes officer.  Only three local authorities employ a vacant homes officer on a full-time basis.  We are going to be strictly monitoring that situation.  Some &euro;12 million will be available next year for the repair and leasing scheme.  That money will be used right across the local authority network.  The Department of Finance will be applying the vacant homes tax.  We are getting the data for that initiative through the property tax re-evaluation this November.</p></speech>

He started talking about the vacant homes officer but I am talking about derelict sites, which is a different matter.  Thousands of derelict sites and buildings around the State are being left to rot.  COP26 is going on at the moment and the most sustainable way of reducing our carbon footprint is to repair and retrofit houses that already exist.  It is a win for everyone.  It is a win for local authorities because housing stock can be turned around more quickly.  More importantly, it is a victory for people who need homes and we protect the environment at the same time.  There are now 100 derelict sites within the Cork City Council area.  Frank O'Connor and Jude Sherry did a survey and identified 400 derelict sites across each local authority in Cork.</p> <p>This is the case in every local authority area.  Scandalously, the Minister of State and his Department allowed landlords to get away with derelict sites that are destroying communities.</p></speech>

I saw derelict sites being brought into use through the utilisation of schemes of the Department.  I ask the Deputy to engage with his local authority to ask it what it is doing regarding the 400 houses he mentioned.  The support exists in the Department to bring them back into use.  I ask the Deputy to take up the question of why they are not being brought back into use.</p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission is continuing to review the CPO process.  On a larger point, on the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund, our towns-first policy, we are unlocking the potential of cities and towns and bringing derelict and vacant properties back into use through sustainable tenancies.  The Government is singularly focused on trying to offer the opportunity to have a sustainable tenancy to all citizens.</p></speech>

The review is addressing several key aspects, including noise, setback, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividends and grid connections.</p>  <p>  Guidance on the noise aspect is currently being finalised by my Department in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters.  Significant work has been undertaken on the noise elements and the two Departments recently met to discuss new developments in this regard, including consideration of the impact of the revised 2030 target to generate up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources and the need to ensure proposals regarding the measurement and assessment of noise from wind turbines are fit for purpose.  These aspects are currently being considered by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and further engagement between the Departments is expected imminently.  Following this interdepartmental engagement, I will be in a better position to provide an update on the expected publication date of the revised guidelines, the finalisation of which remains a priority for the Department.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the review and finalisation of the guidelines have been included as a specific action in the recently published Climate Action Plan.</p></speech>

When will the interdepartmental engagement come to an end?  Have we a timeframe and timeline?  For years we have been waiting for revised guidelines to address the concerns of communities that have legitimate fears over noise and shadow flicker.  There is great concern.  In Lemanaghan, County Offaly, which is in my constituency and where there is a proposal for a wind farm, there have been 2,300 submissions from residents.  It is just one small area but it indicates the extent of the issue.  We need to ensure, as legislators, that there is balance and fairness and that the rights of all communities are upheld.  The respectful and right thing to do is to give people a timeline and a guideline, in addition to a date as to when the guidelines will be published, rather than an indefinite answer to the effect that publication will be whenever engagement finishes or otherwise.  Let us give the people some certainty and a date.</p></speech>

In the first instance, I would love to give an exact date, but unfortunately I cannot because I do not have one.  The Deputy referred to public consultation.  There were 500 submissions in the round of public consultation to bring about the draft guidelines.  Some are very technical in respect of noise and they are being assessed on a bilateral basis with the Department of the Environment, Climate Action and Communications.</p>  <p>  With regard to publishing the finalised version, if there is a significant revision of the guidelines, another strategic environmental assessment may be required.  That is a distinct possibility.  We are engaging proactively to try to resolve this.  It is very technical.  I, being from a rural community, know exactly what the Deputy referred to because it has been a significant issue in my county also.  We need to strike a fair balance for residents and ensure, on the other hand, that we can meet our renewable energy targets.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if he could come back with a direct and definite answer on the interdepartmental engagement.  The Minister of State mentioned that step in the process.  I would like to know when it will finish so I can inform my constituents what is happening and give them some idea of the position on both the process and dates.  The affected communities are experiencing genuine difficulty at pre-planning stage, on which stage the objections of local communities are routinely ignored.  There seems to be a charade of compliance and meaningful consultation but, really and truly, communities are not falling for this.  They need certainty and definite and strong protections.</p>  <p>  Wind energy developers say they have been committed to implementing the current code of practice, which emphasises full and transparent engagement with local communities.  This, however, is not the experience of many communities, which feel powerless in the face of the commercial power of the companies.  Therefore, there has to be an urgent approach to producing the draft guidelines.  What has been happening has been going on for years, and it must not go on any longer.</p></speech>

The position was the same when I entered the Department.  I have brought a sense of urgency to this matter also but, unfortunately, it is beyond our control.  I say that genuinely because, in addition to there being another Department involved, there is the difficulty that we may require another strategic environmental assessment given the technicality of the noise measurements.  That is going to take a significant period if it is required.  As soon as I have an update &ndash; it was only last week that we had a meeting about this in the Department &ndash; I will revert to the Deputy in writing.  I understand her concerns, however.

It is important, relevant and particularly timely.  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each local authority chief executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.  The role and duties of biodiversity officers comprise a matter for local authorities within the context of their wider obligations under the relevant legislation.  Importantly, however, the programme for Government outlines our ambition to tackle the biodiversity crisis and provides a framework for meeting the challenges that we face in doing so.  Local authorities are uniquely positioned, within their own biodiversity plans and working with communities, to help to halt biodiversity loss in their areas.  Biodiversity officers are a key part of this and are crucial to the implementation of the actions for biodiversity at local and regional levels.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting each local authority in the important role it plays in the implementation of actions contained in the national biodiversity action plan.  Right as we speak, my officials are working on establishing a programme to facilitate the roll-out of biodiversity officers within local authorities nationwide.  That will be a step change in how we tackle biodiversity loss all around the country.</p> <p>The investment of my Department in biodiversity officer programmes through support of local authorities will enhance the efforts to deliver benefits for biodiversity.  In that context, I and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, have allocated &euro;600,000 in 2022 towards this programme.  We want to see a real change in 2022.</p></speech>

Like the Minister, I know the really good work that is done at local authority level.  For example, the heritage officer of Wicklow County Council does a significant amount of work in this area.  However, the roll-out of biodiversity officers to all local authorities would assist heritage officers, planning services and local and district engineers as they attempt to tackle some of the causes of biodiversity loss.  We know the main factors are habitat fragmentation, loss of habitats, pesticides, pollution, invasive species and, of course, climate change.  Wicklow County Council established a climate and biodiversity strategic policy committee.  It was one of the first local authorities to do so.  The addition of a biodiversity officer to Wicklow County Council, and the other councils across the country that are doing that good work would be a very positive move to address that issue.  We are facing a real emergency and crisis in the context of biodiversity.</p></speech>

Right now, five local authorities - Fingal, which is my local authority, Wexford, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin and Kerry - employ biodiversity officers, so there are 26 other local authorities where we have to get dedicated biodiversity officers in place.  Neither I nor the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, want that role to be shared across other functions.  It is crucial.  There is a need to have a person at local authority level to bring communities and community activists, who are so prevalent on the ground, together.  I refer to the work communities have done, such as in my area of Fingal, where rewetting programmes have been successfully completed.  That work has been from the ground up and there is a need for a person at local authority level who is able to co-ordinate it.  The allocation for 2022 is &euro;600,000.  I and the Ministers of State, Deputies Noonan and Burke, will be encouraging local government to fill those posts and get them up and running.  We have a really good national biodiversity plan that needs implementation on the ground and we intend to do that.</p></speech>

I hope to see Wicklow County Council added to the list of local authorities with a dedicated biodiversity officer.  I have spoken to the chief executive of the council on this issue and will be speaking to him later today to encourage him to engage on that role and apply to the &euro;600,000 fund.  I note the positive work being done by the Department in terms of the resourcing of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the funding allocation that has brought it back up to its previous levels.  I refer to the work that has been done by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on the river basin management plans and the work done on marine protected areas.  It is a massive challenge in the context of the interconnection of the marine and terrestrial environments.  I am encouraged by the work that is being done by the Department and the message sent today by the Minister in terms of his support for the roll-out of biodiversity officers across the country.</p></speech>

The Deputy, as Chairman of the joint Oireachtas committee, has an important role in encouraging local authorities to get up and running in this space.  We have a lot of work to do.  There is no question about that.  As I stated, we have a robust plan to arrest the decline in biodiversity and it needs to be led at local level.  The biodiversity grant scheme is still supporting actions around the country.  Approximately &euro;1.35 million was made available in 2021 and 119 projects were supported across the country.  However, it could be even better if we have people leading that on the ground.  We want this to happen.  We have provided the finance for it.  It is good that the Deputy has already spoken to the chief executive of Wicklow County Council.  I encourage all Deputies representing local authority areas where there is no biodiversity officer to engage with their local authority and ensure those posts are filled.  I have no doubt they will be well over-subscribed as there is such an interest in this issue and as we have great expertise in this country.</p></speech>

In light of the urgency of the need for rental protections and regulation in the rental sector, I would be grateful if the Minister would update the House on the establishment of the commission and its terms of reference.</p></reply>

The Deputy was central to those negotiations.  It is in the programme for Government.  The commission will examine issues such as tenure, standards, sustainability and quality-of-life issues in the provision of housing, which is really important, and will take a longer-term view on matters.  The programme for Government also commits to holding a referendum on housing and we are going to do that.</p>  <p>  Housing for All, which was agreed by the three Government parties and published in September 2021, commits to the establishment of a commission on housing, with the timeline being this quarter, that is, quarter 4 of 2021.  It notes that the commission will work on the referendum on housing, which it will.  The establishment of the commission presents an opportunity to build on the policies set out in Housing for All, taking a long-term strategic view on these aspects of housing over an extended time horizon, as well as the issues identified as being suitable for in-depth examination.  I envisaged that the commission would bring together experts from various housing-related sectors and play a role in the  State achieving good quality, affordable homes for all, which is what we want.</p>  <p>  The chairman designate whom I have appointed to the commission is Mr. John O'Connor, an eminently qualified and well respected public servant with decades of experience in housing.  I announced his appointment in May.  The draft terms of reference have been prepared by me and the chairman.  I have been directly involved in that regard.  The necessary administrative arrangements for setting up the commission, which relate to the staff needed to support it, have also been progressed.  A memorandum for Government seeking approval to establish the commission with the terms of reference has been circulated to other Departments to get observations and with the intention that I will bring the memorandum to Cabinet in the coming weeks, as I will do.  I will then be in a position to publish the terms of reference and speak further about the intended process for appointing members.</p>  <p>  The plan is for the commission to work to bring forward proposals on the referendum on housing that I mentioned.  The commission will establish a sub-committee with appropriate expertise to examine the complex constitutional questions arising and examine the various proposals that have been made in respect of potential wording for an amendment to the Constitution.  It will advise the  Government in an independent and objective manner with regard to the critical factors for consideration and will make recommendations to me as appropriate on the wording.  The commission will be established as planned in quarter 4, before the end of the year, once its terms of reference and membership have been finalised.  It is a really important step forward for the country and the Government and we are seeing another commitment we made in the programme for Government being met.</p></speech>

In light of the delay in establishing the commission, will the Minister indicate when we will be at the ballot box to vote in a referendum on the right to housing?  Furthermore, I understand the commission will examine issues such as tenure, rental protections and accommodation standards, as the Minister mentioned.  As most of these issues are hashed out and discussed in detail with the relevant stakeholders and experts at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, will the commission have regular engagements with the committee?  Will that be included in its terms of reference?</p></speech>

There has been a lot of work in this.  Obviously, we want to ensure the commission is populated with the right people with the right expertise and that we have a cross-section of knowledge and expertise feeding in.  It will meet formally once a month, with 12 meetings each year.  Work will also be done within the subgroups.  I expect the Chairman of the joint Oireachtas committee, Deputy Matthews, has no question regarding the fact that if the committee wishes to engage with the commission, it will do so.  My focus is getting the commission up and running.  Its chairman is in place already.</p> <p>Mr. O'Connor has done a lot of work with me on the terms of reference.  We have circulated the memorandum for observations.  The commission will meet before the end of the year, even if it is just an initial meeting.  We want to set out its work programme.  I cannot go into the detail of the terms of reference as they have not been published, but they will certainly be broad enough to give the commission the latitude to tackle issues the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage or I believe they should.  The referendum on housing is a commitment that we made and it is one that I am committed to.  The commission is the right place for that work to be finished off, and then we can move towards a referendum.</p></speech>

Waterford is the only local authority that delivers on the repair and leasing scheme.  In respect of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, only the Louth local authority delivers on that.  Only one third of money due under the vacant site levy is collected by councils.  They are slow to get projects on-site.  That problem needs to be addressed.  It may be about capacity or power.

The commission will be independent of my Department and independent of Government.  I do not want to set its work programme.  However, the terms of reference will be broad enough.  The Deputies will see that.  I expect that the commission will look at areas such as standards, delivery, cost and constitutional reform, where it is required.  The terms of reference will be broad enough for the commission to set out its work programme.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Bruton's point regarding delivery, I am acutely aware of the issue.  We need to be across all streams, such as repair and leasing and CPOs, as referenced by the Deputy.  We are going to co-ordinate CPOs through the Housing Agency, which will manage that for local authorities.  There will be a new fund for CPOs of vacant properties.  I do not want the commission to be a shadow Department.  There is other work it can do and it can take a longer-term view.  The delivery issues are real and the Ministers of State and I are acutely aware of them.  We are focused on addressing them.  We have given additional resources to the housing delivery co-ordination office.  Experienced people are now co-ordinating with local authorities on the delivery not just of new builds, but also on refurbishments and repair and leasing.</p></speech>

It has knocked people off the housing list who have been on it for eight, nine or ten years in a way that is arbitrary and wrong.  I do not believe that there was any intention for that to happen.  It is an unintentional consequence, but it is a problem that I would like to be addressed.  I ask the Minister to give it his attention.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="09:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100008#F00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 17 together.</p><p>The 2011 social housing assessment regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.  The 2011 regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the household means policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, universal social charge and additional superannuation contribution.  The policy provides for a range of income disregards and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.  The determination of whether an applicant household meets the income criteria is based on a calculation of their preceding 12 months' net average income prior to the date of receipt of application.  This ensures that the most comprehensive picture of a household's current and previous income is available at the point of carrying out the assessment.</p><p>Social housing support is intended to address a household's long-term housing need.  Rent supplement is a short-term income support for people in the private rented sector.  If there has been a recent change in a household's circumstances and the household requires short-term support with its rent, it is open to it to make application for rent supplement.  It remains open to that household to apply for social housing support at any stage, subject to meeting eligibility and need criteria at the point at which they apply.  The documentation required with regard to proof of income is set out in the social housing application form.  A degree of discretion is permitted to the local authorities as to the extent of documentation the authority deems necessary to ascertain a household's average income over the preceding 12 months. </p><p>Under regulation 28 of the assessment regulations, a household's qualification for support may be reviewed at the discretion of a local authority.  Regulation 29 provides that the household's qualification for support shall be reassessed at the point of allocation of support.  It has been the case since 2011 that where a household on the waiting list exceeds the income limits at the time of review, it may be removed from the list.  The household means policy has not changed that position.  It provides for a standard method of assessing households means, which applies right across all local authorities.</p></speech>

I will provide examples of what this policy change is doing.  I will re-emphasise that I do not think there is any agenda here. These are unintended consequences, but they needs to be fixed.  The Minister of State has emphasised the point regarding discretion.  That is not the local authorities' understanding of it and it is not my experience of it in Cork.  From listening to other Deputies, it is also an issue in other local authorities.  It is not a case of one tor two local authorities misunderstanding the situation.  Local authorities are reading it as being a case of them having less discretion.  That is the reality.  I would probably like the circular to be revised.  here is a wider issue about how low the income thresholds are, but in the meantime, the level of discretion needs to be strongly emphasised to local authorities and made very clear to them.  </p><p>  I have dealt with well over a dozen families who have lost places on the housing list.  The Minister and the Minister of State know that that is money in the bank for people.  The problem is that there is a rigidity to this and applicants cannot go back and get that once they come off the list.  If they are on the list for six, seven or ten years and then come off the list, they are gone and the clock starts again.  I know of one family who were on the list for seven years and had an offer of social housing taken from them on the basis of this new policy.  They had to start again.  I know of another family who were on the list for nine or ten years and were taken off it.  They had to move in with parents.</p></speech>

That is why I have emphasised the point regarding discretion in my response to the Deputy.  However, if he wants to get in touch with me and provide me with examples that he has raised in the House, we will try to clarify the situation.  If that means sending out a clarification to the local authority network on the point of discretion, we will do that.  We do not want to see vulnerable families losing their places on the social housing list.  I have highlighted quite clearly in my response the discretionary aspect of the policy.  As I have also stated, there is a review ongoing in that regard.  We are trying to frame it in the context of the other affordable measures that are coming through under Housing for All, the Affordable Housing Act 2021, cost-rental schemes and other options available to individuals.  We will clarify the point if there are concerns.  I ask the Deputy to liaise with me and provide examples of that.</p></speech>

We can be critical of local authorities at times, but my experience of the officials who are involved in these assessments is that they want to enable people who need housing to get it.  They want to work with these families.  It is more likely to be an issue in the large urban centres, where incomes and rent are probably that bit higher.  I think &euro;37,500 is the highest net income threshold for a couple with children.  It does not take very much for a double income family to be above that threshold.  Many families are skirting the edges of that threshold.  A 12-month average applied too rigidly can mean that even though what someone was earning last month and what he or she is expecting to earn at the end of the year might be below the threshold, doing a few months of overtime or a new project in work can take him or her above the threshold.  I imagine what the Minister is saying to the Minister of State is that the discretion is still there.  That does not seem to be how it is working on the ground.  The local authorities do not seem to be getting it.</p></speech>

We had a detailed discussion and one of the key problems is that where somebody's employment circumstances have changed in the past 12 months and their income has fallen, local authorities rigidly state it is the 12-month average irrespective of a change.  This is not the flexibility provided for in the circular.  The circular provides for flexibility with respect to a one-off payment.  This needs to be changed.  I will also send details to the Minister of a family in exactly this case.  Their income is now below the threshold but their previous income as calculated over the previous 12 months was not.  They have been removed after nine years on the list.  This is simply not acceptable.</p></speech>

I have highlighted that as we see it, the discretion should be carried forward through the local authority network if someone's circumstances have changed.  It is beyond their control.  The last thing we as a Government want to see is the vulnerable people that I meet every week in my clinics being knocked off the list due to unintended consequences, as have been cited here.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Bruton's question on cost rental, we will publish the regulations and details before Christmas and they will be very clear for people.  These will be on the new pathway of tenure that will be below market rent and will offer sustainable options for people.  This is part of a suite of measures we are introducing in the affordable sector that were supported through the House.</p></speech>

A lot of work is going on with regard to the defective block mica scheme that I hope to bring to a conclusion very shortly.  This will impact on other counties in a positive way.  I visited Clare over the summer and I met homeowners and visited their homes with the Deputy and colleagues.  We received a submission from the local authority in July requesting an extension of the defective block grant scheme to County Clare.  We issued a response on 3 August indicating we would review the submission and we did so.  We saw details of a breakdown of costs associated with the report.  That was received on 28 September.</p>  <p>  A number of issues arose, none of them insurmountable.  It is standard that clarification is needed.  I have been directly involved with regard to the submission on Clare.  In this regard, I asked my officials to deal with clarifications and outstanding matters.  That meeting happened the day before yesterday on 9 November.  We have been very clear on what further information is required.  The director of services in Clare has been excellent as has the local authority.  They have indicated they are confident they can address the issues raised.  They will revert to me and the Department in a relatively short time.  I am dependent on getting this information.  Once I do, we will process it as a matter of priority.  Any extension of a scheme to Clare or other local authority would be considered as part of the wider deliberations under way with regard to the scheme.  I intend to bring a memorandum to the Government shortly on these changes.  I am focused on Clare.  I thank the Deputy for his engagement on it and his interest in the matter.</p></speech>

It is a very dedicated voluntary group that has led from the front on this issue, raising awareness about pyrite in concrete blocks in houses in County Clare.  I also recognise the director of services in Clare County Council, Anne Haugh, and the engineer, Tony Neville, for their work.  The Minister visited the home of Mary Hanley in the county.  Five houses were part of the core sampling.  All of them have pyrite in the concrete blocks.  They are at stage 4, which means demolition.  People are extremely worried and they are suffering mental torture.  They want to know when this vital scheme will be extended to County Clare.  I recognise the Minister's work in driving this.  He had a meeting with the officials on 9 November.  I hope the engagement will push this matter on.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Cleary and Mary Hanley in Clare and the group of residents.  We are not losing time.  I want to say very clearly there is no objection to expanding the scheme.  If the data stacks up, and I have no reason to think it will not, the scheme will be extended to take in the county.  It is important to note that even if there was nothing outstanding in the current submission and it was fully in order, it would not be to the homeowners' advantage right now to access the current scheme.  We are working through some of the changes.  The changes and improvements that I will bring forward to the defective blocks scheme will apply to any new homes that come into the scheme.  We will conclude this work very shortly.  We will need legislation to underpin it.  I expect, all data being equal, that it will be extended to Clare.  With regard to the timeframe, we are working through some of the outstanding details with which Clare County Council needs to come back to us, which it will.  Anne Haugh and the team have been excellent.  There will not be any delay from the Government's perspective.</p></speech>

It was a positive meeting.  The Department and the local authority are working together to deal with some clarifications.  I say clarifications rather than issues.  This is not unique.  We have had submissions from counties Mayo, Clare and Limerick.  They are detailed with a lot of information.  There are costs, engineering reports and other matters that need to be looked at.  There is nothing that I can see about which I would be overly concerned in this regard.  It is simply additional information and clarification being worked through by the Department and the local authority.  I expect it to be resolved shortly.  I will keep the Deputy informed.  I know he will keep residents informed.  I have asked the local authority to keep engaged with Dr. Martina Cleary, Mary Hanley and the group in Clare so they know what is happening.

This is whereby a developer could build a private sewerage treatment plant.  These would be used for the further development of small towns and villages.  It is a good proposal.  The key issue is that Irish Water would have to take the unit in charge.</p></reply>

The Department builds in strategic water policy and infrastructural delivery programmes around the National Planning Framework 2018-2040 and the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  Investment is primarily delivered through Irish Water while the Department operates the rural water programme directly.</p> <p>The programme for Government supports the uptake of Irish Water&rsquo;s Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020 2024, which would provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements that would not be otherwise provided in Irish Water's capital investment programme.  Complementary to the programme, my Department is currently examining wastewater requirements in the context of villages and settlements that do not have public wastewater infrastructure.  This process is at an advanced stage.  </p> <p> Housing estates that are not taken in charge by local authorities and do not have their wastewater services connected to the public network rely instead on infrastructure provided by the estate developers.  My Department is currently operating a multi-annual resolution programme to provide funding for the progressive resolution of housing estates with legacy developer-provided water services infrastructure.  Significant challenges exist, however, in realising solutions for all of those problem areas.</p> <p> As to possible future reliance on developer-provided infrastructure, experience has shown that this infrastructure is often temporary and not properly maintained.  This can lead to environmental and public health risk.  Policy in the past had allowed for the developer to provide water and wastewater infrastructure as an interim solution, which would become redundant or partly redundant on the public scheme that would be constructed.  However, in reality many of these estates that were constructed using developer-provided wastewater infrastructure were not of critical mass and size and were geographically remote from the Irish Water network.  It is difficult to envisage a situation where reliance on developer-provided wastewater infrastructure could be supported more in the future.</p> <p> Finally, the draft development plan guidelines for planning authorities published in August 2021 has a strong emphasis on proposals for new developments being clearly based on availability of new infrastructure, including wastewater infrastructure, to enable development to take place.</p></speech>

This is an issue in rural Ireland and in County Clare in particular.  Some 52 settlements in small towns and villages in the county just do not have the infrastructure.  If the infrastructure is not there, it is not possible to develop a village further.  This is an innovative idea.  If the Department can work in conjunction with others and came up with a prototype or an agreed standard for a treatment plant, it could be provided in each of these smaller settlements and would provide for that type of development.  Without this type of initiative, I am fearful that these towns and villages will go backwards, which we do not want.</p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister of State and his officials engage with Clare County Council on this and come up with a prototype.</p></speech>

We are establishing a programme early next year to support villages and towns that do not have public wastewater infrastructure to enable them to develop that through Irish Water.  The senior Minister was down in Broadford and in a number of other parts of County Clare during the summer and I am very aware of the problem that if infrastructure is not there to support development in a small town or village, there is a very significant problem for the locality and society as a whole.  The Department will try to implement a number of schemes in that context in small towns and villages in rural counties, which will provide the assurance and certainty for development to happen.  The great aspect of that method is that it is through Irish Water, its future is guaranteed, as are the environmental considerations and operation of the infrastructure.  In that context, we believe that Irish Water is the best mechanism through which this can be delivered.</p></speech>

Is that something that the Department will give consideration to?  As I said, there are 52 settlements in County Clare alone, not to mention the rest of the country, which do not have these standard basic facilities.  This is an interim solution where a private developer can be brought in to provide this basic infrastructure and Irish Water can then be allowed to take it in charge.  It would facilitate the development of these key small settlements in County Clare and throughout the country.</p></speech>

As to what the Deputy has outlined in the context of the taking in charge by Irish Water of a treatment plant, that depends on the criteria and there should not be an issue with that.  If he has an example of that he might revert to us with it and the Minister and myself will have a look at it.  I assure him that in the context of the work that he has done in the summer in County Clare highlighting those settlements that do not have the infrastructure to develop, that we are acutely aware of these.  We will respond with a scheme to hopefully facilitate towns and villages as referred to by the Deputy so that they have the certainty into the future and have first-class infrastructure to allow them to develop in a sustainable way.  That is critical for all society.</p></speech>

I raise the issue of the residents of St. Helen&rsquo;s Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is a multi-unit apartment complex directly across from my office, which was bought out by vulture funds a number of years ago.  The first vulture fund made two attempts to mass evict on the grounds of sale, refurbishment or various other ruses.  Because we fought them at the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, it then flipped the complex to another vulture fund, which has made two successful attempts to mass evict and has now succeeded.  The tenants are now over-holding and are faced with homelessness unless there is an intervention.  I just want to know what can be done here?</p></reply>

It is a serious one and I am familiar with it because the Deputy has raised it a number of times.</p>  <p>  To move away from the standard answer on this and give the Deputy the facts as they stand, I have engaged with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, as has my Department, to make every effort to ensure that those dwellings in St. Helen&rsquo;s Court are referred to be secured for social housing.  AHBs have engaged directly also on several occasions with the owners&rsquo; representatives with a view to buying and acquiring the dwellings at the location for social housing.  The problem is that in both instances, through DL-RCC and AHBs, the owner is not willing to sell the units.  I have said that I would provide the finance to do so.  The council has also engaged with the owner with a view to leasing, even though some people want to cancel leasing tomorrow morning.  We have a pipeline of leasing for 3,400 real families who are going to be housed.  These are families comprising real people that the Deputy is advocating very strongly for.  We have looked at that but again the owner has decided not to proceed.</p>  <p>  On foot of this question I will personally engage again with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  We are doing as much as we can to try to secure this property but if the owner is not willing to sell, there may be other options that can be looked.  I am happy to continue to work with the Deputy on this.  Both the Department and I have engaged directly with the council on St. Helen&rsquo;s Court.  I am fully in favour of securing those properties as social housing on a permanent basis, that is, that we buy them, but we need the owner to be willing to engage to sell.

Here is the irony.  This vulture fund went into the RTB and the tenants said they thought that the claim the fund was going to sell was a ruse because the fund owns 20 apartments and said that it was only going to sell the ones where there were tenants, and the ones that were sitting empty, where the fund had managed to drive the other tenants out, were not being sold.  This was totally not plausible.  The fund then evicted tenants on the grounds of sale but then told the council that it is not selling.  It is a joke.  We all know what they are up to.  The fund just wants to drive up the value of the property and the rents it can charge.  The council is then saying that it cannot buy the ones that are supposedly for sale because there are tenants in them and that it does not buy apartments with sitting tenants as it can only buy the empty ones.</p> <p>That means they will be homeless unless we change that view.  </p></speech>

There have been comments that people are skipping the queue.  They are HAP tenants.  They are on the list.  Some are quite elderly.  Some have children and are very vulnerable.  They are well up the list.</p>  <p>  We have to remember that 13 empty apartments have been sitting there for two years while people are crying out for places.  The whole thing is an utter scandal.  Do not let bureaucratic box ticking stuff get in the way of preventing people from being made homeless.  They are currently being threatened with court action and have been told that they will pay the costs if they do not get out.  They have nowhere to go.</p>  <p>  I am pleading with the Minister to get around this.  These people cannot be allowed to evict these tenants.  Even now, the tenants are paying their rent and have never missed a payment.  They have done absolutely nothing wrong.  The representatives of the vulture fund went to the RTB and said they know it is ugly, but they are maximising the value of their asset.  It is disgusting.</p></speech>

We are very serious about providing permanent homes for our people.  That is what we are doing in this particular instance.</p>  <p>  I know this is serious.  We are doing our best.  I will re-engage on this and revert to the Deputy will an update.  If we need to meet, which I am sure we will do, we can do so in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It is not working for them.  It was part of a pilot scheme at an early stage, but did not advance.  It is inevitable that, sooner or later, Irish Water or the State will have to step in and resolve the issue.  I want to get an update on advancing the project.</p></reply>

As he said, on 21 September last year I announced allocations under a new multi-annual capital investment programme which was developed to provide a water infrastructure resolution programme for 2019-2021.  That will allow a progressive resolution of housing estates with developer-provided water infrastructure.  It will enable us to take the infrastructure and estates into charge.</p>  <p>  The focus of the first multi-annual programme is on the estates, towns and villages where the resolution involves connecting their water services to the public network.  Over 1,000 homes will come in to the public network that heretofore would not have been.  The programme will also support a number of pilot projects where connection is not feasible in the immediate future.  These pilot projects, including Crossbarry, County Cork, which is the project to which the Deputy referred, together with a major study, are currently being undertaken by Irish Water and are due to be completed quarter 2 of 2022.  That will inform the future policy consideration of resolving substandard developer-provided infrastructure with sustainable solutions. </p>  <p>  On 22 October, Cork County Council submitted a report on the proposed pilot project at Crossbarry.  The report is being considered by an expert panel, which will bring the recommendations forward to me.  It has a central role in reviewing bid proposals and making recommendations for the funding of individual projects.  I am awaiting the report.  Following the Deputy's parliamentary question, I will make further inquiries to try to expedite that review and get it to me as soon as possible.  I want to be able to improve the situation for people in areas like Crossbarry.  I am awaiting the report and will chase it up following the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

We have discussed the situation in Crossbarry.  I want to acknowledge that the Minister has brought forward a scheme and has recognised the difficulties for people in Crossbarry.  There has been considerable back-and-forth between the council and Irish Water and the Department.  I want to try to understand whether any further outstanding information is required or if all of the details are available.</p>  <p>  Crossbarry was part of an earlier pilot scheme which, it seems, focused only on smaller settlements.  It is possible that Crossbarry can open up further development ground and deal with the wider village.  I want to confirm that the scheme now being considered involves larger schemes and do not just smaller stand-alone schemes and could serve their wider village and open up the development ground beside it.</p></speech>

I am expecting that in the coming weeks.  As he knows, I will visit his constituency very shortly and will endeavour to have an update around that time.</p>  <p>  A detailed review of a number of projects is being carried out, which includes how the pilot project worked and how it could potentially be extended.  We need a more robust scheme, to be frank.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, alluded to that in a previous response.  We are working on a scheme to partner with local authorities with regard to towns and villages that do not have any wastewater infrastructure.  I know that is not specific to Crossbarry in this instance but there are other towns and villages across the country that need to be addressed, which will not be addressed solely through the Irish Water capital programme.  We need to see how that can be speeded up.  As I said, I will ask officials to expedite the review of this submission and revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

As he can well imagine, it has been very difficult for residents over many years.  They thought they were in a pilot scheme.  They have experienced backups in the sewer, smells and nuisance.  More recently, they have had to value their homes, which is being impeded by this issue.</p>  <p>  This has been going on for a number of years.  Some have sought to sell their homes and move out.  It has been very difficult.  We need a solution in a timely manner.  I appreciate that the Minister is progressing this.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the scheme is delivered in a timely manner.  Whether it is Irish Water or Cork County Council, once there is a green light there should be every opportunity for the scheme to advance quickly and be brought to construction.</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that we will move as quickly as we can on this.  The review is detailed and needs to be carried out.  The submission involves a technical review and needs to provide clarity as to where we go next.</p> <p>I would like to bring that to a conclusion very shortly.

My officials and I have been engaging with the various sectors to address some of the challenges faced throughout the past 20 months in the run-up to the Government's decision and also following that decision.  This extensive stakeholder engagement has resulted in the production of an updated set of guidelines for nightlife and entertainment to provide for the safe operation of the sector, as Covid-19 is still circulating in our communities.  The guidance contains a range of advice, including on ventilation, hygiene, management structures, face coverings and so forth.</p>  <p>  In light of the epidemiological situation that has emerged over the last number of weeks, it is imperative that we carefully manage reopening.  The Government's aim has been to allow as many businesses as possible to reopen in the safest possible way.  This is why we need regulations and robust guidance to assist businesses to reopen safely and, importantly, to stay open.  Central to these guidelines is a commitment to adhering to best practice in infection prevention control measures which are necessary to protect individuals and society, as well as supporting our continued progress towards a full return to the operation of various sectors.  Compliance with these measures should not be considered best practice but rather the minimum standard required to protect our communities.  Individual businesses must proactively risk assess their premises to calibrate mitigation measures in a bespoke way for the business.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 infection rates have been increasing, along with hospitalisation and ICU admissions, but thanks to the exceptional levels of engagement with the vaccination programme we were in a position to continue our careful and gradual approach to reopening.  However, we must redouble our efforts to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.  The night-time economy sector, which includes so many businesses, has been patient and was one of the last sectors to return.  The sector has worked very constructively with my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments in developing and implementing the relevant guidelines and regulations.  This engagement is continuing with a view to safeguarding public health while ensuring we continue to move forward with reopening.</p></speech>

We cannot blame this on any single sector but, clearly, the reopening of hospitality has had a part to play in that.  We also cannot ignore that mask wearing requirements are very lax in nightclubs.  People are exempt if they are dancing, but that is what one does in a nightclub.  It is one thing if it is happening when everybody is fully vaccinated but some premises are not asking for Covid vaccine passes and in others, people are using passes that do not belong to them.  What is the Minister going to do about non-compliance?  Has she made particular recommendations regarding non-compliance to ensure we curb the spread of Covid-19 and allow the reopening to continue?</p></speech>

Since the reopening of the night-time economy from 22 October 2021, compliance officers from the HSE have been undertaking checks, with an initial emphasis on the nightclubs and late bars.  This included 123 inspections undertaken between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m. on the initial bank holiday weekend, where overall compliance was generally found to be good.  A further 50 inspections took place on the weekend of 29 to 31 October covering retail, cinema and related areas.  As for the night-time economy, compliance officers from the HSE have been engaged in compliance checks in the night-time sector since 22 October and over the initial bank holiday week over 40 teams of compliance officers undertook checks focusing on the hospitality service sectors, particularly pubs, restaurants and late night venues.  Nightclubs in Dublin, Cork and Galway received particular attention.  In the engagement this week with the hospitality and nightclub sectors and in further engagement with the arts and culture sector, I believe leadership is being shown by the industry on this.  The sectors realise the real risk.  Everybody needs to be on board on this in order to keep their livelihoods safe, to keep business reopened and to protect public health.</p></speech>

Regarding the percentage that is complying, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, revealed last week that the percentage of people not having Covid certificates checked in pubs was 37%, which is quite high, and it was 34% in restaurants.  That is quite serious given the way things are going.  Again, what sanctions are there for businesses in food and hospitality that are non-compliant?  Also, would the Minister support the call for a helpline for members of the public who do not feel safe in an environment where they see that Covid passes are not being checked or health guidelines are not being adhered to?  Would she support that not only for patrons but also for workers in those environments?</p></speech>

It should be noted that anybody doing so would have to press number 3, which is the other issues category.  It might be useful to tailor the helpline to allow members of the public to report specific instances in a more targeted manner.  This is something we will communicate to the Department of Health, as the HSE is under the remit of that Department.  It will a subject of discussion between officials in the Department of Health, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department.</p>  <p>  Regarding what happens when there is non-compliance, the fines have been set out but, ultimately, there is the threat of closure.  We are appealing to businesses that are not checking for certificates, because it is not fair to the other businesses and it is not fair for public health.  For both reasons, to protect public health and to help the businesses that have been through such a tough time to keep their businesses open, everybody should abide by the rules.</p></speech>

This is the former national film studios set up in 1958 with State assistance.

It is a positive indication of the increasing sophistication of the development of the screen sector in recent years and a vote of confidence in the future of Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual industry.  The inward investment will assist in establishing Ireland as a primary location for strategic investment in film and TV drama.  I understand that the studio will shortly see an expansion of its studio and support spaces with an additional 21,000 sq. ft. of sound stages and 21,000 sq. ft. of support space added.</p>  <p>  This sale was conducted between two private sector entities.  The grounds for any investigation into the circumstances of the sale are not immediately apparent.  In any case, queries about the conduct of the sale would be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s ambition as stated in the audiovisual action plan is to establish Ireland as a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation.  Ireland competes internationally to attract inward productions that brings valuable investment to Ireland and this company with its global reach will assist the growth of our audiovisual industry.  This development will underpin that ambition.</p>  <p>  With the growth in streaming services, the demand for high-end TV series is almost limitless.  The audiovisual industry is transforming at an exponential rate and I would not favour taking studio infrastructure into State ownership.  The circumstances of the sale is a private matter for the studio&rsquo;s commercial owners.</p>  <p>  The studio is and was, before its sale, in full commercial ownership and the State has no stake in ownership.  It did not receive public funding in the past decade.  From an EU perspective, studios are subject to state-aid rules and any state intervention would require EU approval, which would not ordinarily be forthcoming.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the very significant success of our audiovisual industry in recent years.  This success has been underpinned by the Government&rsquo;s investment in Screen Ireland, the agency responsible for the development of the screen industry.</p>  <p>  The studio provides world-class production facilities for both indigenous and incoming productions alike.  This sale has the potential to bring new investment which will allow ongoing expansion and secure the future of this iconic studio.</p></speech>

In the beginning it was referred to as "a studio".  This studio was set up with the assistance of Se&aacute;n Lemass in 1958.  It then became the National Film Studios of Ireland in the 1970s.  It was where "My Left Foot" and "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" were filmed.  I could go through the list of classic films.  This is part of Irish cultural heritage and history.  I should also mention Troy Studios.  Is the Minister joking in suggesting that public money did not go into it?  I believe that Troy got &euro;9 million or &euro;10 million from Limerick County Council, which extraordinarily ends up in private ownership.</p>  <p>  Section 481 tax relief to film producers has probably come to &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion in recent years with about a &euro;250 million in Screen Ireland grants and the State owns nothing.  IDA Ireland sold off its share for an undisclosed price in 2018 and then it was flipped to an American company in a deal rumoured to be worth about &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million.  Somebody has made a lot of money here and we used to own this studio.</p></speech>

There is no rationale for public intervention in the provision of film studios as the private sector is doing so effectively.  There is no evidence that the public sector would be more successful than the private sector in running a film studio.  Taking one film studio into public ownership would be seen as anti-competitive by other film studio owners.</p>  <p>  Public funding of film studios is a state-aid matter and the agreement of the European Commission is not likely to be forthcoming if we were to attempt to take this studio into public ownership.  There is a well-known case, involving Ciudad de la Luz film studio in Alicante in Spain.  In 2012 the European Commission ruled that public subsidies of &euro;260 million had to be repaid to the regional government as the subsidies violated European competition law and the studio closed as a result.</p></speech>

Virtually nobody has a job in the Irish film industry.  They go from film to film, as the producers keep saying.  In cases before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, at the moment, film producers have come in and said to people who worked on those film productions funded by public money, "You are not my employee and you never were."  That is what is going on.</p>  <p>  Every film production is funded with section 481 tax relief and with grants from Screen Ireland.  The people are paying - this is the people's money - but the money ends up in the hands of a small number of film producers.  IDA Ireland sold off the bit of film infrastructure that it had.  It had a one third share in it.  We put money into it and into Troy Studios, which now end up in the hands of an American real estate firm.  It is cultural treason and it is shocking.  The EU requires us to build up companies of scale for state aid and a permanent pool of workers.  We have neither but we pumped out billions of euro and got nothing for it.  </p></speech>

As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value this sector brings to all Irish citizens.  It is something we really felt during the Covid-19 pandemic when they were taken from us.  The importance of Irish culture, art and productions as a whole cannot be understated and it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output.  The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society was particularly evident during the pandemic, as I mentioned.</p><p>Against this backdrop and my own experience of the arts, funding for the basic income guarantee pilot scheme was a key priority of mine for the budget and I secured &euro;25 million to realise the pilot scheme next year.  With regard to the timeline for the launch of the pilot, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise.  This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications during the first quarter of 2022.  The oversight group continues to meet regularly and met yesterday with a representative from SIPTU.</p><p>My Department will hold a stakeholder consultation forum on 8 December on the basic income guarantee pilot scheme, in particular to tease out the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  It is really important we develop the scheme in close consultation with the sector.  We will be using a professional facilitator to run a world caf&eacute; method event to ensure the arts sector and resource bodies and representative organisations are given the opportunity to feed into the policy development for the scheme.  The selection process for recipients of the basic income will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month.  However, I can confirm that participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test and it will be a non-competitive process, so once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, that person will be included in a randomised selection process.  A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive <i>ex post</i><i>facto </i>appraisal of the pilot in due course.  Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.</p></speech>

These people are exceptional and need to be supported just to maximise value both from a societal and economic perspective.  I thank the Minister of articulating the timeline in general.  Who is the scheme for?  What internal sectors within the artistic community is it for?  I appreciate the Minister has indicated the first quarter of 2022 for the devising of the scheme but when is it anticipated that payments will start to flow for the people involved?  How will people apply for this?  Will they apply in writing or online?  Will there be interviews or how will that be teased out?  If the Minister does not have this information to hand now, perhaps there may be a press release or further details issued in the next couple of months.</p></speech>

It is my intention that the pilot scheme will be open to eligible artists and creative arts sector workers.  The process for recipients will be finalised through the stakeholder engagement I mentioned, which should happen next month.  I can confirm it will be a non-competitive process and people will be chosen randomly.  My intention is to have a number of streams, such as professional artists, emerging and developing artists and arts workers.</p>  <p>This will be subject to two further stakeholder engagements in the coming weeks.  This consultation is key in that regard.</p></speech>

I would argue that it also needs to be supported infrastructurally.  There are many small towns and villages throughout rural and regional Ireland that do not have an artistic centre, although they have digital hubs.  Perhaps this is an issue the Minister will raise with her Cabinet colleague, the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  Many of the digital business hubs are underutilised at the weekend and evenings.  Could these spaces be provided for use by the artistic and creative community at weekends and after normal business hours?  It is good that the artistic community will be supported financially, and I look forward to the launch of that scheme, and its expansion in 2023 and thereafter.</p></speech>

I would be interested in any proposal that allows digital hubs to be adapted for arts purposes and I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on this matter.

We have had many discussions here about the value of this sector.  For years, people have talked about its value while not placing an actual value on it.</p> <p>I have also focused on the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery task force, which related to this pilot scheme, because I saw an opportunity post Covid to place that value on those sectors and to support them.  We know that uncertainty about how they can live can prevent musicians and actors from creating.  That is why I was delighted to secure that commitment in the national economic recovery plan, which emphasises my commitment to the intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society, which we really saw during the pandemic.  These people were deprived of opportunities to perform and earn a living.  The next step was to secure that &euro;25 million in the budget for this three-year pilot.  </p> <p> As I said to Deputy Berry earlier, while stakeholder engagement in general is ongoing, facilitated stakeholder engagement will take place next month.  I want to cover the disciplines the Deputy mentioned, but with the engagement of the sector.  I have mentioned emerging artists, arts workers and everything the Deputy has referred to.  This will all have to be teased out in close consultation with the sector.  Everything I have done with regard to the sector has been done in close consultation with it.  This is a very important issue.  What we are doing is groundbreaking and we need to do it properly.  That is why I want that consultation with the sector.</p></speech>

I and, more importantly, people in the sector have campaigned for this for a long time because income and employment insecurity is rampant.  While I welcome this measure, let us not sit back on our laurels and act as if this is a panacea.  We should remember that the background to this, which I acknowledge predates the Minister's tenure, is that we see spend six times less on the arts and culture sector, as a proportion of our GDP, than most countries in Europe.  It also does not help for us to sell off infrastructure that we helped to pay for in the first place.  Imagine if the Abbey Theatre was flogged off and people had to apply for a job each time there was a play on.  The backdrop to this is that we need more income and employment security in general and more funding to create that security in the film, art and music sectors.  It is important that everyone be eligible for this pilot scheme.</p></speech>

I secured an unprecedented and record level of funding for the Arts Council this year on foot of last year.  I held onto that &euro;130 million.  I secured funding of &euro;25 million for this income guarantee pilot.  It is to be a three-year pilot so I will obviously seek to secure that funding for three years, and I will secure it because I have a commitment from Government.  The intention of the pilot scheme is to study whether such a measure will contribute to ensuring those in the arts sector have that security blanket of knowing that money will come in to help them to do what they do best, to create.  It aims to ensure the arts sector remains intact and to provide the artists and creatives with the opportunity to increase their practices, thereby minimising the loss of skills and contributing to the sector's gradual regrowth.  It is a no-brainer.  I can see why it was the number one recommendation, which is why I am absolutely delighted to have been able to secure that commitment from Government.</p></speech>

It is a step forward.  It is a pity it took a pandemic for us to realise just how important culture and arts are to us and how life is so much diminished when those in the sector are not able to perform live and so on.  I hope we have learned something from the pandemic in this regard.  While I welcome the scheme, does the fact that it is for three years mean that we cannot expand it before those three years are up?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.  I would hate to think that this would become a substitute for much more thorough reform of the sector and increased investment to tackle the more general problem, which is the lack of overall investment in permanent infrastructure in arts, music and culture and the jobs that go with that infrastructure.  I always contrast our situation with that of Germany.  Virtually every village in Germany has a theatre with a full complement of performers, artists and crew who are securely employed.  A great many of our artists and culture workers lack that security.  That is what we should be aiming towards.</p></speech>

I am looking around the Chamber and there are many Deputies here who grew up surrounded and enriched by the arts.  I do not think I am alone in that.  I am looking at Deputy Boyd Barrett and it certainly did not take a pandemic for him to appreciate the arts either.  I am in a position where I can make a difference.  That is why I am delighted to have been able to secure this commitment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the three-year pilot, this duration was specified in the number one recommendation of the stakeholders' group.  I can go through the detail.  It is on page 42 of the arts and culture recovery task force's report.  I am taking guidance from, and being steered by, the sector itself.

The sports capital and equipment programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  More than 13,000 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  On 30 November 2020, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and I announced that a new 2020 round of the programme was opening, with at least &euro;40 million available to allocate.  The original closing date for applications was 12 February 2021 but, in view of difficulties some applicants were encountering as a result of Covid restrictions, this deadline was extended until 1 March 2021.  By this closing date, more than 3,000 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed in accordance with these procedures.  Approximately 1,000 of the submitted applications were for equipment-only projects.  These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021.  The letter of provisional allocation encouraged all grantees to draw down this funding before the end of the year, if possible, and in recent weeks my Department has been prioritising payment of all existing grants.  Ensuring that as many older grants as possible are paid before the end of the year will maximise the funding available to allocate for the 2020 capital applications.  With regard to these applications, assessment work is continuing and every effort is being made to complete it as quickly as possible.  It is likely to take a number of additional weeks for these assessments to be completed.</p>  <p>  With regard to the funding available to allocate, as already stated, the payment of as many older grants as possible before the end of this year will help increase the potential allocation amount for the remaining capital applications.  I am pleased that, following completion of the 2022 budget discussions, there was an increase of &euro;6.6 million on the 2021 allocation, bringing the total to be allocated for 2022 to at least &euro;34.5 million.  This will cover all existing allocations under the previous rounds in addition to significant new allocations for the 2020 capital applications.  Every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable.  We are in ongoing discussions with the Department of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on additional allocations for this round.  We will announce the results of these discussions in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I was listening to what Damien Duff had to say on his announcement as manager of Shelbourne FC about the soccer infrastructure in Ireland being horrific.  As the Minister of State outlined, every sports club, as well as local authority, is trying to get a slice of this &euro;200 million fund, yet there is a Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from which only one industry benefits, to the tune of about &euro;100 million a year.  Every cent on every bet placed in Ireland goes into this one fund that benefits one sport, and the majority of that funding goes to prize money.  Is there not a significant imbalance between a major soccer figure saying the soccer infrastructure is horrific and the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund going in its entirety to benefit one sport, with the majority of that going towards prize money and nobody else benefiting, regardless of what the bet is placed on?</p></speech>

One step the FAI has taken is to maximise the number of its applications.  In regard to the sports capital and equipment programme, there has been a huge increase in the number of applications from football clubs.  Under the large-scale sports infrastructure fund, in which my colleague, Deputy Griffin, was involved, a significant number of football projects were announced under both streams.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's point on betting.  I have had feedback from various sporting organisations relating to the matter.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Browne, is establishing a new gambling regulator, and a fairer spread of betting tax more generally would be more equitable.  We are focused, with our allocation for this year, on putting a significant injection into all sporting infrastructure.  The Deputy mentioned football, but it will apply to the development of a range of sports.  Moreover, we have a positive budget allocation for next year.</p></speech>

There is a direct correlation between the priority a state, parliament or government gives to sport and the performance of the senior international team, regardless of the code.  There is a complete imbalance if the levy placed on every bet supports just one industry, to the tune of &euro;100 million a year ring-fenced in legislation, with the majority of that going towards prize money, although I am not suggesting the 20,000 jobs it supports should not be supported.  There is a reason that industry is thriving, while sports such as soccer have, as Damien Duff described, infrastructure that is horrific.  The Minister of State acknowledged there is an imbalance that needs to be addressed but we need to tease it out further.  It is not good enough for us to celebrate sporting achievements without asking the difficult questions in Parliament.</p></speech>

There is considerable support for our sporting system and it is important to acknowledge that.  The sports capital programme will provide significant support for sporting infrastructure and communities throughout the country.  If we compare what was allocated in, say, 2005 and 2006 with how we supported our Olympic athletes last year, and taking account of our national sports policy on doubling funding between 2018 and 2027, which underpins record levels of investment in our high performance system, there have been record increases.  Through programmes such as the sports capital and equipment programme, it is important we ensure sporting organisations and clubs will make applications to develop that infrastructure.  The State is underpinning record levels of investment in our sporting system and it is important to acknowledge that.</p></speech>

My question relates to the sports capital grants.  Throughout my constituency, Cork East, as he will know from his visit, many clubs are hoping to get positive news on the increased investment for new capital infrastructure works.  Given the two years we have had with Covid-19, investing in sports clubs and allowing them to continue their planned developments, as a type of reward given back to the communities as a consequence of what they have lost from Covid-19, would be one of the most positive impacts the Government could have.  I strongly encourage both the Minister and the Minister of State to seek as much funding as possible and to consider a further round of funding in the near future once this round is complete.  Will the Minister of State update the House on the process?  It is crucial to my constituency and that of the Acting Chairman.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity, therefore, for clubs and sporting organisations to rectify errors, and that will dictate the date on which we announce the final assessments.</p>  <p>  We are in ongoing engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I am confident there will be an increase on the current baseline we announced in the budgetary allocation for next year in light of, as the Deputy mentioned, the great importance of investment in sporting infrastructure and the extent to which it matters to so many communities and clubs throughout the country in order that they can underpin their ambitions for their club and their considerable volunteer efforts to have that ambition fulfilled in the form of better sporting facilities for their clubs and young people.  I acknowledge also the point about Covid.</p></speech>

Major schemes have been proposed, such as for Fermoy GAA, and the Minister of State has been in close contact with Youghal GAA and a number of soccer clubs within the constituency.  It is important also to recognise on the floor of the House that Midleton FC is seeking significant investment.  There are major capital developments, therefore.</p>  <p>  The increase in construction costs is causing significant difficulty.  It is important that context be given to that in the coming year, as well as additional funds that may become available from future sports capital grants.</p></speech>

In the case of many existing grantees, there is a gap between their capital allocation and the impact of increasing constructions costs.  As for what we can do now for existing applications and those who will receive a grant, we must maximise the allocation in order that the funding gap for clubs will be as low as possible.  That will be dictated by the quality of the application and whether the club in question is above the threshold of &euro;150,000 for local or &euro;300,000 for regional applications.  The Minister and I are trying to maximise the allocation for sports capital this year in order that as many clubs as possible, in the Deputy's county and throughout the country, can fulfil their ambition.</p></speech>

That was welcome.  I am aware, however, that the demand that exists and the overall request for &euro;200 million in funding cannot be addressed by the amounts originally allocated, and that is why the additional &euro;6 million provided in the budget was welcome.  I think I speak for most Deputies when I say that the work the Minister of State is doing to try to get extra funding through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for existing applicants is critically important.  More money will be needed in this regard.  Will he provide a breakdown of the amount remaining in the context of outstanding applications, when the equipment-only element is taken out, if that detail is available?  If we want more clubs to get more funding, we will need a bigger overall budget.</p></speech>

A process is under way in respect of applications.  As I said, between 40% and 60% of applications will require a second-chance opportunity in cases where insufficient documentation may have been supplied or there were errors.  Applicants in such situations will have that opportunity.  A percentage of applications in every round will not provide the required documentation or will be unable to do so, and that will have a consequent effect on the net overall request.  Equally, a certain proportion of what some applications are seeking may not align with what can be funded by the sports capital and equipment programme.  Until all the applications are fully assessed, therefore, we will not be able to provide a net overall figure.  I am confident, though, that we will see an increase beyond what has been announced thus far.  To conclude the discussions under way with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, we must know what the net funding request is, and that assessment process is ongoing.</p></speech>

He has my full support and I think I speak for many Deputies in that regard concerning his endeavours in this area.  Since 1998, more than &euro;1 billion has been distributed through the sports capital programme.  It has transformed the landscape of Irish sport in the time it has been operating.  Much more must be done, though, and a great deal of catching up must be undertaken, particularly regarding certain sporting organisations that have not availed of the programme as enthusiastically and in as organised a way as others may have.  This catching up must happen and money talks.  If we can get the overall budget pot increased, the other problems will tend to take care of themselves and the outcome for many more clubs will be much better.  That is why the macro situation in respect of the overall pot of funding available is critically important.  I commend the Minister of State on his efforts in that regard and I ask him to keep going with them, because these funds will make a massive difference on the ground for so many organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100018#Q00400"><p>I agree that the programme thus far has transformed the sporting landscape, with the improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  It has funded the smallest clubs in rural areas all the way up to national centres of sporting excellence, and everything in between.  Another important element is that many clubs and organisations are now submitting joint applications, such as between clubs and schools.  Those applications maximise the use of the investment because the schools use the facilities during the day, while the clubs use them at night.  That kind of collaboration across communities provides for even better participation in sport.  As the Deputy will know, having been involved in the programme previously, its focus is on overall participation in sport.  Increasing female participation in sport is a major part of what we are trying to do in this round of funding, as well as focusing on participation by disadvantaged groups and encouraging the sharing of facilities.  I thank him for his remarks.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has visited County Clare on several occasions, where he met and spoke with representatives of clubs and in that way heard from the grassroots about the importance of this funding stream.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that more money in this regard is secured through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If more funding is secured for the programme, more clubs will benefit.  The original figure provided in this context was &euro;40 million.  Some &euro;16.5 million of that went to the equipment grants and then &euro;6 million was added in the budget.  A figure of approximately &euro;29 million then remains.  How much funding overall will be requested from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  What kind of increase in funding is being sought?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100018#Q00600"><p>I am not going to speculate on this issue.  The increase is quite open-ended, let me put it that way.  As the Deputy will be aware, sports capital funding is allocated on a multi-year basis.  Therefore, we are not only negotiating funding for next year but for subsequent years as well.  We are calculating what the potential drawdown will be overall and what the capital allocation will be under particular subheadings.  This is not about securing a certain amount for next year, therefore, but for many years, and that process is under way.</p>  <p>  We secured extra funding for next year in the budget, as the Deputy mentioned, but part of what we are trying to do in getting as much capital funding as possible paid out this year is to open up opportunities for additional capital allocations through this programme and that will help us to formulate that final calculation.  Finding out what that overall net amount to be requested will be is important in the context of our engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>  I reiterate that one point of concern in this area is that between 40% and 60% of applications have insufficient documentation.  It will be important that we work through that aspect and that those organisations are given the opportunity to make corrections to ensure their applications can then be considered legitimate for potential funding allocations.  That process will dictate what the final requested amount will be.</p></speech>

Is it safe to say, though, that allocations of funding will be made by the end of the year?  Can he envisage a situation where this process might continue into next year?  If it were to happen, could he find himself in a situation where he might be using money from next year&rsquo;s budget along with this year&rsquo;s budget to make a more rounded sports capital block grant available for clubs?  In addition, when does he expect that the next sports capital and equipment programme will open for applications and will it include a large-scale sports infrastructure scheme?</p></speech>

The programme for Government contains a commitment to running the sports capital and equipment programme regularly.  We have not set a date for when the next round will be, but that commitment is in the programme for Government and it is also referred to in the national development plan, NDP.</p>  <p>  Turning back to the current programme, it will take some weeks to try to assess what the net request to be made will be.  I am hopeful that it will be done by the end of the year, but I am not going to set a date until I am presented with the final assessments.  It could be the end of the year, but it will make no difference if it is the end of this year or early next year, because no capital will be drawn down in respect of any allocation made this year since successful applicants have just received formal notification of their allocations.  It will, therefore, make no difference to the capital envelope whether the announcement is made at the end of this year or early next year.  It would not be possible anyway to draw down funds in such a short timeframe, even if the details of awards were announced tomorrow.  It would be unlikely that grantees would be able to draw down funds in the context of the documentation and protocols required to enable that process to happen.</p></speech>

One point highlighted in the opening remarks concerned encouraging the drawing down of existing allocated grants.   It has been an extremely tough two years for sport.  Every club has been devastated at every level and resources, including human resources, time and fundraising abilities, have been devastated.  In turn, the ability to draw down funds is also now greatly reduced.  Simply encouraging clubs, therefore, is not enough.  What efforts are being made by the Department to work with clubs and sports associations to ensure they can realise those already-allocated grants?</p></speech>

All staff in the sports capital division have been prioritising the effort to pay out existing grants.</p> <p> We are all involved in different sporting clubs and organisations so we know that fundraising has been difficult.  The Department is prioritising those matters, working with clubs.  That was in the formal note to all the equipment-only grantees and the Department is working with clubs.  A significant number of the equipment-only grants have been paid out.  A significant amount was paid out in the previous quarter to grantees who were granted payments in the two most recent sports capital rounds.  Those payments were outstanding because works could not be commenced during the pandemic.  There has been a lot of capital moving out to clubs.</p> <p> On specific funding gaps, we are not in a position to bridge gaps in existing allocations because that would undermine the existing application process.</p></speech>

I am not necessarily talking about funding gaps; I am concerned with capacity gaps.  The volunteers simply are not there and numbers coming out of clubs have not been there.  Clubs, to a large extent, have been dormant for a considerable time.</p>  <p>  I will tease out something he referred to regarding the influence of sports capital grants, particularly on involvement in and encouragement of women's sports.  I would be interested to know what engagement, either through the sports capital programme or more generally, he and the Minister are having with the IRFU on its review of the women's game, the failure to qualify for the Rugby World Cup and the fact that the union has not met its targets.  Quite frankly, the IRFU is failing female participants in the sport.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland, on behalf of the Government, is engaging with all sporting organisations on our priority to maximise female participation and support our female athletes at high-performance and grassroots levels.  On the sports capital programme, the Minister and I have directly prioritised clubs that are promoting female participation at grassroots level.  That is central and new in this sports capital round.</p>  <p>  With regard to women in sport funding, we have announced increases for the sporting organisations, which will be funded by Sport Ireland.  That will be a two-year funding cycle and was announced earlier this year.  We regularly engage with all sporting organisations about their participation and performance.  Sport Ireland does that on behalf of the Government.  We will certainly reflect on what the Deputy has outlined.  We were all disappointed that we did not qualify for the Rugby World Cup.  There has been great growth in female participation in grassroots rugby and we want to see that maximised in the coming years.  We will certainly reflect that in our engagements with the union.</p></speech>

The work of the agency is funded jointly by the Northern Ireland Executive, through the Department of Communities, and the Government of Ireland, through the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and the Media.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Communities is under the remit of his Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Ms Deirdre Hargey MLA.  That Department provides 75% of funding for this agency.

The programme included a variety of activities which provided opportunities for people of all ages to engage with different aspects of Ulster-Scots language, heritage and culture.  As I have previously informed the Deputy, funding was neither sought nor allocated by the Ulster-Scots Agency for the living history component mentioned.  The group funded that element from its own resources.  To be absolutely clear, the agency funded a singer for a selection from Sam Henry's Songs of the People; a talk on the works of Sam Henry; an arts and crafts workshop; an Ulster-Scots language workshop; traditional Ulster-Scots music, poetry and dancing; and hiring a bandstand and sound system.  It is important to factually set out what the agency did or did not fund.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, we are now in the final and perhaps most challenging period of the Decade of Centenaries.  The events of the period now being commemorated, which include the foundation of Northern Ireland, radically altered relationships on this island.  We are acutely conscious that the events of this period do not belong exclusively to one tradition or another.  I will outline further details in my supplementary reply.</p></speech>

However, that is not reflected in the poster for the event.  The poster refers to Northern Ireland centenary celebrations and a historical re-enactment of the B-Specials.  It states the event is backed up by the Ulster-Scots Agency.  That is reflected in the poster.  I do not know whether subsequent to this emerging, the Ulster-Scots Agency has been encouraged or asked by the Minister of State or his Department to disassociate from that event, in particular the part that celebrates partition and, even worse, the part which celebrates the B-Specials and its role in Irish history in the nearly 50 years it existed.</p></speech>

I want to be clear that funding was neither sought nor allocated by the Ulster-Scots Agency for the living history component the Deputy has mentioned.  It is important that we are factual about this matter.  I hope the Deputy is not undermining agencies of the Good Friday Agreement in what he is trying to do here.  It is also important to note that the Deputy's Sinn F&eacute;in colleague in the North, the Minister for Communities, Deirdre Hargey MLA, provides 75% of the funding for this agency, while the Irish Government provides 25% of the funding.  We have sought a breakdown, as I outlined, of where the &pound;2,500 was actually allocated.  I referenced some of those activities, which included an arts and crafts workshop, art and the Lambeg drum, a language workshop for children, Ulster-Scots music, a display of Scottish country music and dancing, drumming, Scottish and highland music, traditional Ulster-Scots music, the hiring of a sound system, language and poetry.  That is what the agency funded and it is for that I am accountable to this House and for which the Deputy's colleague in the North is accountable to the Assembly in the North.  I hope the Deputy will be taking up his variety of questions with her as well.</p></speech>

She is not answerable to me because she is a Minister of the Assembly and the Minister of State needs to bear that in mind.  The matter has been raised in the council, which also part-funded this event.  I will repeat my supplementary question in the hope I will get an answer this time.  Has the Ulster-Scots Agency been asked to disassociate from the part of the event, which celebrated the deeds of the B-Specials?  I did not ask what exactly the funding was.  The Ulster-Scots Agency is associated with the event because it is referred to on the poster.  There is no disassociation.  It is not said that the agency funded a stage, which was used as a part of the event.</p></speech>

I have set that out and it is important we are factual about what it did or did not fund.  I have been informed that the particular component of the event to which the Deputy has referred was funded by the organisers themselves and not by the Ulster-Scots Agency.  That is the factual position.  We sought answers on that to get a breakdown of what the agency did or did not fund.</p> <p>To me, partition was devastating for this country.  I believe in uniting our people and bringing people of all traditions on this island together, underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, which is about respecting difference and history.  We sought a breakdown of what was funded.  It is important that we provide a factual basis for that.  Funding was neither sought nor allocated by the Ulster Scots Agency for the component the Deputy referred to.</p></speech>

Equality in sport is a key priority for both me and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  Our overall vision for women in sport is one where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying lifelong involvement.</p>  <p>  Government support for inter-county female Gaelic games players, which is distributed through Sport Ireland, is an indicator of the recognition at national level of the contribution of the athletes to their sport and their commitment to play the game at the highest level possible.</p>  <p>  Last May, I announced my intention to ensure equality in grant funding for female Gaelic games players from this year forward.  Additional funding of &euro;1.7 million is being provided in 2021 and for future years for enhanced support of female inter-county Gaelic games players on a basis equivalent to that for male inter-county Gaelic games players.  This additional provision brings the total amount available for female players in this context to &euro;2.4 million.  Sport Ireland has established a working group, which includes player representation, to finalise the detailed arrangements for the distribution and oversight of this enhanced State funding to the 1,650 female players concerned.  I am very pleased that the funding gap has now been eliminated and that, from this year, female Gaelic players will have parity with male players in respect of grant funding.  This is important to the development of women's sport and demonstrates the Government's commitment to equality in sport.</p></speech>

His commitment to grant equality is very welcome.  The grants are important to the individual players involved.  It is important that they be equal.  With regard to inter-county players, the grants probably have a larger impact in that they result in players becoming role models for young women in sport.</p>  <p>  We are aware that kids start out with an interest in sport.  To give an example, the gender balance at nursery level in a GAA club in my constituency, Na Fianna, is a result of great work in that club.  Parity was reached for the first time in 2020.  While it is positive to see kids starting off in equal numbers, we are aware that women tend to drop out in larger numbers as they get older.  Sport Ireland's research report Adolescent Girls Get Active identifies role models as comprising one support for keeping young women involved in sport.  I am wondering about the level of data tracking on the impact of the grants.  Are they being allocated in the proper way?  What is the position on other infrastructural supports for women in sport?</p></speech>

In many nurseries and clubs across the country, the increase in female participation has been so positive.  We are seeing this across so many sports but, as the Deputy said, there is attrition, particularly in the teenage years.  That creates the participation gap.  Sport Ireland has an Irish sports monitor that produces quarterly reports and examines the gender gap.  A priority of mine and of the Minister is to abolish the gender gap when it comes to participation and to track the attrition, particularly in the teenage years.  It is also a question of trying to promote participation throughout adulthood.  There is a lot of oversight and research by Sport Ireland to ensure active participation so women and girls will be given opportunities to stay in sport.  We must track the trends in disadvantaged communities and places where participation levels might be lower and address the issue.  We are committed to that.</p></speech>

We are all looking forward to the hurling final.  Castleknock GAA club, in my constituency, is in the Senior B championship and is hoping to get promoted to the Senior A championship.  I hope to be at that match.  We wish all the players of Na Fianna and Kilmacud Crokes well.  We have had a great autumn of league action in football, hurling and camogie.  Large numbers have attended local grounds.  We had a very positive summer season in sport.  There was significant participation over recent weeks and attendance figures have been really positive.  In the Ceann Comhairle's constituency, Naas won the Kildare final for the first time since 1991.  Different clubs have been winning championships.  The essence of sport is clubs competing at county level and bringing everyone along.  We wish Deputy Hourigan's club well.</p></speech>

C&eacute; go bhfuil na freagra&iacute; sin ar f&aacute;il sa tuairisc, t&aacute; an St&aacute;t ag seasamh i mbealach na f&iacute;rinne agus t&aacute; an Garda anois ag cur in &eacute;adan foilsi&uacute; na tuairisce.  Caid&eacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas le d&eacute;anamh cinnte go mbeidh an tuairisc seo foilsithe?</p>  <p>  It has been more than a month now since the families of the victims who suffered the most horrendous abuse at Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court, Stranorlar, County Donegal were given a glimmer of hope that the long-awaited Brandon report would be published and finally give them the answers they have been awaiting for years.  In circumstances such as these, the comfort of the truth is significant.  We know from leaks to the media that more than 118 occurrences of sexually inappropriate behaviour were carried out by a resident who is given the pseudonym of "Brandon" in the report, and that there were 18 victims at Ard Gr&eacute;ine.   As the Minister is aware, these victims are among the most vulnerable in society.  Many of them are non-verbal.  They placed their trust in the centre and the HSE to protect their well-being and safety.  Obviously, that did not happen.  They were failed again and again.</p>  <p>  The bravery of the whistleblower some years ago led to reports to HIQA and the Garda.  The individual identified as Brandon was eventually isolated and the abuse stopped.  However, astonishingly, two years after that, Brandon was relocated and the abuse started all over again.  This was a catastrophic failure.  What happened at Ard Gr&eacute;ine can never ever be allowed to happen again, but the HSE continues to fail these families.  It moved to block the publication of the independent report.  To make matters worse, we have now learned that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also moved to block the publication of the report.  The Garda is concerned that the report does not accurately reflect the actions it took.</p>  <p>  I am saying clearly to the Minister that this needs to stop.  It is not acceptable.  The Government cannot stand by any longer and allow organs of the State to conceal the truth.  This is an independent report that contains findings to which the families are entitled.  The ongoing charade, the shrouds of secrecy and the circling of State wagons have no place in a modern democracy.  Those days are over and it is the responsibility of the Government to make that message clear.</p>  <p>  In 2016, I wrote to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to raise issue of the under-reporting of abuse at the facility.  I got a response from the Minister stating it was a matter for the HSE.  Five years on, we now have an independent report that is being blocked by the HSE.  This cannot be fobbed off any more to the HSE or any other State agency.  The HSE has let these families down again and again.  This needs to be dealt with at a political level by the Government.  My question is very simple.  When will these families have the full report?  When will they know the truth of what happened to their loved ones?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100021#T00600"><p>First of all, the Government is very aware of the trauma that many individuals and families continue to go through in the context of this issue.  The families will get to see a full report.  We want that to happen as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned the national independent review panel, NIRP, to carry out a review of abuse allegations at a HSE-provided residential service for adults with disabilities.  The purpose of the NIRP was to review the governance arrangements for the facility to which the Deputy referred and to understand why this situation continued over a period of years without any effective action being taken by management during Brandon's residency to stop and prevent these highly traumatic assaults.  The report identified 108 occurrences of sexually inappropriate behaviours by one resident, referred to by the pseudonym Brandon, towards 18 other residents of the facility between 2003 and 2011.  The report notes that these incidents occurred with the full knowledge of staff and management of the facility at the time.</p>  <p>  The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount and the first concern of the Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, is to ensure that the needs of the current service users are being prioritised fully and addressed.  The HSE has assured the Minister that there is no ongoing risk to service users and that the national governance and accountability structures to oversee implementation of the recommendations arising from the report are in place.</p>  <p>  Local garda&iacute; wrote to the HSE on Thursday, 4 November, requesting that the HSE continue to maintain the agreement not to publish the detailed executive summary until it completes its process.  Separately, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote to the HSE on Friday, 5 November - the following day - indicating there was a factual inaccuracy in the executive summary which it indicated should be corrected and requesting a copy of the full report.  The correspondence is being sent to the chair of the NIRP, who drafted the report and executive summary, for her attention.</p>  <p>  At this point, the only pause on progressing full publication is the specific request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Currently, if the chair of the NIRP is satisfied that the report is accurate, there will be no need for any further delay.  My understanding is that the Minister is very keen to ensure this report is published as soon as possible and that if there are any issues that need to be addressed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the chair of the NIRP and the HSE, they need to be addressed quickly.  Families deserve to get the full truth and to see this full report - not an executive summary or an extended executive summary, but the full report.  They have already been through enough in relation to this case.  The Deputy is correct that there does need to be political input to ensure the full unvarnished truth in respect of what happened here and the responsibility that comes with that in terms of those who were in positions of decision-making needs to be published and it needs to be transparent.  That is the least the families deserve.  The Minister of State met families who wished to meet her last Friday on a one-to-one basis to discuss the events and to outline the approach she is taking.  I assure the Deputy that the Government wants this report published, and quickly.</p></speech>

It is really important that families have the full information.  He can imagine the nightmare these families are going through in the context of the many vulnerable loved ones who were in this facility.</p> <p>Even though the HSE knew that this abuse was going on, it never relayed that fact to the families at the time.  That is just appalling.  It is not acceptable.  Along with Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Pringle, former Deputy Pat "the Cope" Gallagher and others, I met representatives of the HSE in 2016 at the time of the publication of the HIQA report.  We were not told of it either, at the time.  Thankfully, the whistleblower came forward and gave that information.</p> <p> It has been a week since the Garda raised the issue.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has said there needs to be political input here.  Is there any indication whatsoever as to when this report will be published?  Is there a chance that it will be published next week?  In what format will the report be published?  Will it be sent to the family members before it is made public?</p></speech>

The Minister of State met the families that wanted to meet her on a one-to-one basis last week.  The Minister of State has also been in contact with Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE, and the HSE board on this matter, including last week regarding the publication of the report.  The Minister of State also wrote to the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner last week regarding any communications they may have received about the case, as well as reminding them of the importance of publication.</p>  <p>  We, in the Government, are more than aware of how traumatising this has been and how totally unacceptable it is that vulnerable adults in a residential facility like this could have been abused in a way that happened over a sustained period.  We want this report to be published in full.  We want completely transparency and accountability on the back of that.  The Minister of State is working hard to bring that about.  I do not want to give an exact date of publication but certainly, there is an urgent effort to get it done quickly.  </p></speech>

Our former President, Mary Robinson, made an emotional appeal to world leaders yesterday for more ambitious action to be taken.  She is right; we cannot negotiate with science or facts.  This is on our watch.  If we do not radically act to reduce our carbon emissions, temperatures will rise by more than 1.5&deg;C.  I want to see a better future for my children, Aoibhe and Senan.  I am sure the Minister wants the same for his children.  I want them to have a healthy planet to grow up on.  I also want a prosperous Ireland for them that can continue to attract jobs and inward investment.</p>  <p>  Climate change is real; we know that.  However, I am seriously concerned about our energy security and the delays in delivery.  I have been raising the issue week after week in the House.  We are not acting fast enough to decarbonise.  I believe we are losing inward investment and world-leading companies, potentially.  Developers of offshore wind are continually frustrated by delays.  We will have to resort to the use of emergency gas generators in the years ahead.  Most offshore wind developments remain a pipe dream until 2023, when the new maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, will be up and running.  It is said that most of those projects will not come online until 2028, which will be too late to help with emission reductions and meeting our target 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030.  Serious questions are also being asked about our grid infrastructure, regulatory and planning processes and why we find ourselves at risk of blackouts.  Personally, I must say that I am at a crossroads as regards my confidence in the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and EirGrid.  Moneypoint, which is located close to where I live, was to become a base for renewable energy and green hydrogen.  Instead, it is back to burning coal.  Equinor has pulled out of the &euro;2 billion offshore floating wind farm development that would have powered 1.5 million homes.  It is embarrassing.</p>  <p>  I had the honour of representing Ireland at the Paris Agreement talks.  I know how important the issue of climate change is.  It is a challenge but it is also an opportunity.  Ardnacrusha was built and we were at the forefront in relation to our foresight of where we needed to go as regards renewables.  We are now at a very difficult crossroads.  Ireland is reportedly one of three possible countries on a shortlist for the development of a major Intel plant.  We are all aware of it.  It is very important.  A number of other projects, industries, businesses and companies are also potentially coming to Ireland.  However, we are facing reputational damage.  What efforts is the Government making at COP26 to deliver a meaningful deal that will change this for us on the ground?  Has the Government got some tactics or strategies to look at fast-tracking renewable energy projects, especially offshore wind and solar?  Critically, is foreign and direct investment at risk because of the lack of generating capacity and grid infrastructure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100022#U00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the question.  I know that given his previous experience as a Minister, the issue is something that he knows a lot about.  I was in Glasgow yesterday with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who, people should be glad to hear, has been drawn into serious negotiations on issues such as climate finance and so on, in terms of trying to get general agreement, which I think is a recognition of where Ireland stands now in the challenge of climate action debate.  Of course, former President Mary Robinson spoke passionately yesterday, which made a big impression and drew big crowds in the COP26 campus in Glasgow.  I shared the stage with her at a number of events and I can tell the Deputy that the crowds were there for her.</p>  <p>  We are a credible voice in this space now, but we have to deliver on that.  The ambition that we have in this country around a renewable energy revolution in many ways, in terms of the scale of what we need to do between now and 2030, is going to be hugely demanding of the Government in terms of licensing systems, certainty, grid management and investment and indeed, bringing new technologies on stream, in particular around hydrogen, by the end of this decade.  We are planning supply increases, including 5 GW of offshore wind, an extra 1.3 GW onshore, 1 GW from solar power, around 0.5 GW from microgeneration, which we have been talking about for years but have not managed to deliver, but I think we will, 1.45 GW from batteries and another 2 GW from conventional power sources, predominantly gas-fired power stations.  We have got to do all of that in the space of less than ten years, and as I said, we have to provide the investment environment for it to be done, because predominantly, it is all about private sector investment.  That is a huge challenge, particularly on the offshore side, where we are finalising legislation, as well as a marine spatial planning plan, and putting certainty around licensing and auctions in place for offshore wind developers, in respect of both fixed and floating platforms, to deliver on that enormous potential not just on the east coast, but also on the south and west coasts.</p>  <p>  The challenge in the short term, of course, is one of certainty of supply.  The CRU has been challenged in recent weeks and months, as we know, and as the Deputy has raised in this House.  The fact that the Huntstown and Whitegate gas-fired power stations were both offline  for a number of months has contributed to those challenges.  Huntstown is now back online and Whitegate will be online before the end of this month, which will make life a bit easier.  It is a difficult management exercise while we bring the substantial renewables that we are planning for onto the system.  </p></speech>

The Minister knows that, in fairness.  He did not answer the question I asked.  Are we potentially losing inward investment?</p>  <p>  I have huge time for the IDA and I think Mr. Martin Shanahan has done a superb job at IDA Ireland.  He has warned, in submissions to the CRU, EirGrid and others, that attracting inward investment is now at huge risk because of the situation we have as regards the grid and access to it.  As I could have done, the Minister listed off a whole range of potential renewables that we have to have in place in ten years.  What has happened for the last number of years to plan for the investors that are looking at coming in now?  I have referenced one of them already.  Are we losing investment because of a lack of foresight over the last few years in order to ensure that we have energy security?</p> <p>It is a simple question.</p></speech>

If we look at the investment flow that has come in over recent years, through IDA Ireland work predominantly and elsewhere, it has been a very strong pipeline of investment.  The strength of foreign direct investment here and its expansion have been hugely helpful through the Covid period.  The Deputy is right.  There are two challenges here.  In my view we will lose investment if we do not decarbonise our electricity grid over time because I believe major multinationals will demand electricity grids that prioritise renewables in the future, with regard to their own corporate governance demands on the shift to renewables and away from a carbon-based society.  The other challenge is that they will demand energy security.  They will demand consistency of supply, whether it is a data centre that uses huge amounts of power or something else.  We have to do both.  This is the challenge.</p></speech>

This was the Government that in its programme said it would eradicate homelessness in five years.  That Government made a decision in June 2011 to discontinue capital investment in social housing and to rely instead on the outsourcing of social housing to the private sector.  Since 2011, average rents have increased from &euro;740 to &euro;1,500 nationally.  In Dublin, average rents are now &euro;2,082.  My area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire in south Dublin has the highest average rents anywhere in the country at &euro;2,280.</p>  <p>  The policy of outsourcing is being discussed in the media today, although I received these answers in July.  By the end of this year, housing assistance payments, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS and leasing arrangements will have cost &euro;1.8 billion.  This will go to the private sector.  In most cases, it will be to pay for properties that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, sold, another decision made by that Government.  This is, in itself, fairly extraordinary.  One target in Rebuilding Ireland that the Minister met when he had responsibility for housing was to get to 80,000 RAS, HAP and leasing properties.  To get another bit of information out there, we now have 61,312 HAP tenancies, 17,507 RAS tenancies and 952 leasing arrangements.  There are 10,000 to 15,000 more projected for the course of 2022.  This far exceeds the amount of local authority housing or public housing that will be built in that period.</p>  <p>  As if all of this, landing us with the housing crisis we are now in, were not bad enough, during the same period, including the period the Minister was the Minister with responsibility for housing, the HAP limits in this dysfunctional incredibly expensive system have not increased since 2017 while rents have continued to increase.  Given the average rents in some areas of Dublin, including my area, people are, by definition, homeless if they need accommodation and are relying on HAP limits.  The maximum HAP even for people who are homeless is &euro;1,950 and the average HAP is &euro;1,300.  In the same period since the Minister entered Government in 2011, the income thresholds for eligibility for social housing have not changed.  If people are knocked off the housing list, as many are, because they exceed the income threshold they are not entitled to HAP either.  This means they are, by definition, homeless.  Does the Minister accept this was a disastrous failure?  What will the Government do to compensate those who have suffered as a result in terms of delivering them affordable and secure housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100023#V00400"><p>The Deputy and I have had this debate many times in the House.  He is right on one thing.  Overly relying on rental supports is not a long to medium term solution for the housing challenges we face.  Supply is the solution, with more social housing, more affordable housing, more targeted and tailor-made solutions for people who need housing and who want to own and pay for their own homes but need the support of the State to do so, and people who want to be in the rental market and need supports to be there.</p>  <p>  The truth is that there has been an over-reliance on HAP in recent years because we simply have not been able to deliver enough new builds at the pace needed.  This is a simple and practical problem.  We are now committing to spend &euro;4 billion on housing each year but it takes time to build significant numbers of houses.  We will provide approximately 10,000 social housing units per year, as well as affordable housing on top of this which, in time, will have a huge impact on responding to housing need.</p>  <p>  The Deputy cannot on the one hand say we should not be continuing to spend more and more money on HAP and at the same time make the case for increasing thresholds and increasing the amount of money tenants can get.  This is a contradiction.  In many ways, HAP is an emergency response for people while the State builds a housing stock that responds to the extraordinary demands we are seeing at present.  This is what we will do in the coming years.  Next year, in 2022, there will be 11,800 social homes delivered, including 9,000 new social housing builds.  This year, in 2021, there will be 12,750 new social homes, including 9,500 new builds, 800 targeted acquisitions and 2,450 homes through leasing programmes.</p>  <p>  I can remember clearly when I came into the Department with responsibility for housing.  Deputy Kelly was the Minister prior to me.  We were faced with trying to reignite a building sector to build huge quantities of housing stock from a completely flat start.  I think, and I stand to be corrected, that the year before I became Minister with responsibility for housing, all of the local authorities combined built 75 social houses.  Now, that figure is 7,000 or 8,000.  This is something that will take time to fix.  In the meantime, we need to support people in rental accommodation through HAP and other solutions which are there.</p></speech>

Let us just be honest about it.  It was a policy.  The reason so few houses were built in the year the Minister referred to was because a policy decision was made in 2011 to discontinue them.  Meanwhile, we were selling properties, which we are now renting back at extraordinary cost.  The target for HAP, RAS and leasing was not an accident.  It was a policy.  It is in Rebuilding Ireland.  It was the Minister's policy that the amount of HAP, RAS and leasing would be 2.5 times what we were going to deliver in terms of actual local authority housing.</p>  <p>  Is it a contradiction to say I want the thresholds raised?  No, it is not.  I am sorry.  The Minister has created the mess but I am afraid the consequence of this mess is that while the Government ramps up, and it has to do so at far greater speed than it has been doing, it cannot have a situation where people who are ten years on the housing list get made homeless because their average income briefly goes over the threshold.  Huge numbers of people have lost out.  They cannot afford the rents.  They are then thrown off the housing list.  HAP levels are not enough in the capital and many other areas for people to get properties.  They are, by definition, homeless.  I am afraid the Minister is going to have to do something about it.  This week, I met a family, who are solely dependent on social welfare and who have been in homeless accommodation for three years, who have been taken off the housing list because they exceeded the limits.</p></speech>

There are areas, particularly in the capital, where rental prices are significantly higher than HAP can support.  I recognise this.  It is an issue that is being looked at.  To correct the record, it was not policy, either for me or my predecessor, to not build large numbers of social housing homes.  It was the opposite, in fact.  It was about ramping up as quickly as we possibly could and spending billions of euro in taxpayers' money to do so.</p> <p>That has taken years to deliver and continues to do so.  We are now spending &euro;4 billion as opposed to &euro;2 billion.  It is important that we do not start rewriting history here in terms of what happened pre-2011 and where this country was and what it could afford to do.</p> <p> The issues the Deputy raised in respect of thresholds and ceilings have some validity but the truth is that these support programmes for leasing and rental are necessary while we dramatically increase social and affordable housing stock, which we will do in the years ahead.</p></speech>

Our country is currently facing the greatest housing crisis since the foundation of the State.  At the heart of our housing delivery problem and the requirement to increase supply in this precarious market is the application of planning policy.  Some 80% of strategic housing development, SHD, grants of planning permission that were judicially reviewed were quashed, primarily because the board went rogue and attempted to apply ministerial guidelines as higher planning policy, completely ignoring 20 years of jurisprudence and the laws laid down by this House.  Professional planners and this Government deployed a narrative that it was not they who had caused this problem but the NIMBY objectors who took judicial review proceedings.</p><p>Last Friday in a landmark judgment, Cork County Council <i>v</i>. the Minister, the Attorney General and the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, laid bare the rot that exists at the heart of the planning system.  The judgment filleted the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Department&rsquo;s planning policy unit.  An eminent planning senior counsel described this planning judgment as one of the most accurate and scathing he has seen.  What is striking about the judgment is the frustration of Mr. Justice Humphreys at the obvious and fundamental lack of knowledge of the Office of Planning Regulator in respect of the basic legal principles of planning law.  At paragraph 30, Mr. Justice Humphreys said of the regulator that, &ldquo;If the caselaw had been engaged with, the untenability of [his] point would have become apparent.&rdquo;  He continues at paragraph 62 to state, &ldquo;The attempt by the OPR and the Minister to turbo-charge non-binding guidelines by drawing the conclusion that non-compliance contributed to a conclusion that the council was in breach of s. 10(1) is unfortunately a rewriting of the Act.&quot;</p><p>I could continue with these damning quotes because they are endless.  No planning system or those who operate it could survive such a damning judgment.  Thankfully, Cork County Council saw fit to bring proceedings to vindicate its decision and, as a consequence, it has been made plain that it is the regulator and the planning policy unit that are undermining the planning system by making it up as they see fit and consequently we are removing certainty from the system.  Having regard to this judgment, the dissemination of unlawful advice by the regulator to local authorities concerning the application of section 28 guidelines will potentially undermine the legality of county development plans and cause further expense to the State in legal proceedings.</p><p>What actions is the Government taking to restore confidence to the planning system to ensure that the Office of the Planning Regulator complies with and operates within the law?  Further, has the Government confidence in Mr. Cussen to continue in his position as the planning regulator?</p></speech>

The Government has confidence in the Office of the Planning Regulator and in the individual referred to by the Deputy.  The role of the Office of the Planning Regulator is clear.  This office ensures that county development plans, as they are developed, are consistent with national planning framework.  If mistakes are made and there are legal challenges, then that is why we have a court system.  I do not want to go in to the detail of the particular court judgment referred to by the Deputy but if mistakes were made there, then we need to learn from them.  The principle of having a planning regulator, however, which ensures that we have consistency across the country in how we plan for and pursue development into the future is a good one.</p>  <p>  Countries need national planning frameworks which set the guidelines and parameters within which the local authorities work in how they plan in a sustainable way for how we live and move around, and the infrastructure that is needed to facilitate that.</p>  <p>  There will always be tension and challenges when there is disagreement, and that happened here.  I am very familiar with the case referred to by the Deputy but it does not call into question, in as fundamental a way as the Deputy is suggesting, the role of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  The planning regulator has a difficult job to do and sometimes it is not a popular one.  He, of course, needs to be transparent about how he makes his decisions and has to be consistent with planning law and other legislation.  His office&rsquo;s relationship with the local authorities is an important one, so that we have consistency across the country from all local authorities in our national planning framework.  It is the role obviously of the Minister and his Department to ensure we get that balance right.</p></speech>

In regard to the Minister being familiar with the 26-page judgment and him making a statement like that, this was not a disagreement.  It was ignorance of basic planning policy and the legal framework.  Mr. Justice Humphreys spelled it out in black and white, saying that irrespective of the law of the land, the regulator fails to operate within the law and makes it up as he goes along.  Those are Mr. Justice Humphreys&rsquo;s words on the case the Minister is familiar with.  They are not my words.  I will give the Minister another quote from the judgment that demonstrates the total incompetence.</p> <blockquote> 	...the [planning regulator] and the Minister are trying to shoehorn the circumstances here ... even though the council did not fail to comply with any requirement ... That is in effect a shortcut and a failure to do the necessary groundwork... </blockquote>  <p>The Minister&rsquo;s endorsement of the planning regulator is unbecoming.  Even the most ardent supporters of the regulator could not have confidence in him, having read last Friday&rsquo;s judgment that the Minister states he is familiar with.</p></speech>

I said I was familiar with the case and the issues around it as are others in this House.

It involves both Cork City Council and Cork County Council and an ambition to develop a big new retail centre in east Cork.</p></speech>

A number of weeks ago the Minister, Deputy Ryan, appointed two friends to the Climate Change Advisory Council.  This was despite a recommendation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Climate Action recommending that there should be an open, competitive and transparent process attached to such appointments.  I am sure the Minister is aware, more than most of us in this House, of the need for this given the stroke that he tried to pull in the summer in appointing a former Cabinet colleague to makey-up job.  At that time he said lessons needed to be learned from that but they clearly have not been because the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has done it all over again.  I am sure the two members appointed are eminently qualified but that does not preclude or take away from the fact that Government appointments should be transparent and open and that has not happened in this instance.</p> <p>Will the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, come before the House to explain this appointment process?</p></speech>

The one relating to my county is insane.  The headquarters are in Ennis in County Clare.  There are headquarters in Limerick, Ennis and Galway.  A lot of business is done in and large volumes of traffic go through Tipperary, but it does not have a headquarters.  Imagine travelling from Ballyvaughan to Carrick-On-Suir across an area comprising 2,000 sq km.  The scale of the division is too big.  The AGSI has expressed serious concerns that its members will be able to operate within it.  I ask that the divisions be re-examined.

A number of these organisations receive funding from Irish Aid.  The allegations made against them are extremely serious and are designed to smear anybody who stands against Israel's continued brutal occupation of Palestine.  Israel will continue to do this with impunity and will give the Minister and his EU counterparts the complete runaround regarding its crimes.  If that is the case, as we have said many times why it does this country and the European Union continue to treat Israel like a normal state?  It is not a normal state.  It is an abnormal state.

The perception is that Galway County Council is being punished for the fact it has not amalgamated with Galway City Council.  The expert advisory group set up to examine the amalgamation recommended that the existing deficiencies relating to human and financial resources be expeditiously resolved as an essential prerequisite to the amalgamation process.  Galway County Council will run a deficit of &euro;4.5 million next year if its members decide to pass a budget.  So far, all of the municipal districts have rejected the budget presented by the executive.  I ask that, once and for all, the cloak is lifted on how funding is being given to local authorities and, in particular, to Galway County Council, which presides over the single biggest area geographically in the entire country.  The area in question is larger than that in Cork because of the process that has happened there.  Given the geographical layout of the county, it is important that it is done.</p></speech>

That includes &euro;2.7 million in equalisation funding.  As the Deputy knows, it is open to councillors to decide whether they want to increase LPT rates.  That has happened in Clare, Limerick, Donegal and Sligo, which have all decided to increase their rates by 15%.  Mayo decided to increase it by 10% and Kerry by 7.5%.  Leitrim and Roscommon also raised their LPT rate for next year by 15%.  I wish to reassure the Deputy that there is no question of Galway County Council being punished for anything.  It made its decisions.  The important thing is that we provide resources for Galway County Council to be able to provide adequate services for the people it is serving.  I will raise this issue with the Minister directly and ask him to come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Concerned citizens are very upset about how the bypass system is working because they are relying on social media rather than Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the design team to get information on a road that is going to go through their houses.  I want the Minister to set out guidelines for people in order that they will have information, from the time a route is decided, on procurement, the time it will take for each individual section to be completed and how long it will take for the road to be built.  This has been an issue since 2010.  The lives of farmers and householders have been put on hold because they are not getting the information they need.  I want a liaison officer to work directly with me in order that I can give people in Limerick succinct answers and timelines.  The latter will allow them to a breather when a the route is decided.</p></speech>

They are all vocal international groups.  They have been to forums such as the EU, the UN and the International Criminal Court to push for accountability and justice.  This move by Israel is absolutely abhorrent.  The Minister cannot reply within a minute, but I want to ask if he would be prepared to discuss and debate this in the D&aacute;il next week.  We should have at least a two-hour debate on this matter, particularly as it relates to a serious move on the part of Israel to clamp down on human rights in Palestine.  I do not think the Minister's previous response was strong enough.</p></speech>

It is difficult for me to give a comprehensive response within this timeline.  I have been vocal on this matter and I have raised it directly with Israeli Government Ministers.  The EU has also been quite vocal on this issue in terms of expressing concern.</p> <p>I have parliamentary questions on foreign affairs on Thursday next week and I would happily discuss it then.  Perhaps that is the best way to get a more detailed answer.</p></speech>

What efforts are being made by the Government with European partners to dissuade the British Government from making this move and to ensure that the British Government meets its commitments to international law?  In addition, what efforts are being made to mitigate any lingering damage that this could cause to the Irish economy?</p></speech>

Obviously, we are working with EU counterparts and speaking directly to the Biden administration.  I got a chance to speak to one of President Biden's most senior advisers this week and to members of Congress, such as Congressman Brendan Boyle and others, at COP26.  However, the main focus is to try to encourage progress in the discussions between Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič and Lord Frost.  They are meeting directly again tomorrow.  I will meet Vice-President &Scaron;efčovič on Tuesday for lunch and, hopefully, will have an opportunity to have direct discussions with Lord Frost as well next week.  Listening to what he said yesterday in the House of Lords, there is still some time to try to ensure that negotiations and partnership can work.  We will continue to focus on those efforts and do everything we can to dissuade the British Government from triggering Article 16, which I believe would be a very serious, negative and retrograde step.</p></speech>

In no way do I wish to cast aspersions on Childline, its services, the extremely important work it does and the volunteers who work for it, but in this case a volunteer was instructed not to speak to a child in Irish.  A child rang Childline, spoke Irish and by a stroke of luck somebody at the other end of the line was able to respond in the child's native language.  It is unacceptable that a volunteer would be instructed not to respond to that child as Gaeilge, the child's native language.  The Coiste na Gaeilge has heard stories from Tuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta about speech and language services and health services.  It is unacceptable.</p></speech>

I am trying to get more detail about how best we can respond to it.  Let us not forget that Childline is not a State agency.  It is a service that gets some State funding, but it gets a lot of private funding as well.  It is providing a very important service and we have to put some thought into how we can ensure that the service provided by Childline can also be provided for children who use Irish as their first and daily language.  However, we must do that in a way that does not undermine Childline's core work and the number of calls it is taking and dealing with daily.  The Deputy has raised a valid issue but we need some time to think about how we can respond appropriately, not undermine Childline but at the same time try to provide a service for those who seek a support service in Irish.</p></speech>

I have in mind areas within the Minister's remit in his respective Departments such as developing an Air Corps presence for training purposes or utilising the airport to support the work of Irish Aid being undertaken overseas.  If we are serious about increasing activity at regional airports in the wake of the pandemic, we should identify Departments with the potential to increase their operations at Knock and counter the dominance of Dublin Airport in the years before the pandemic.  Utilising the regional airports through simple steps such as Irish Aid logistical support and packages being flown overseas from Knock would make a practical difference.  There should also be greater use by the Air Corps of airports such as Knock for training missions.  It would certainly be a strong show of support for our regions.</p></speech>

When the Air Corps was central to the search and rescue, SAR, operations off the west coast, Knock was used as a strategic location.  However, since the Air Corps withdrew from SAR operations in 2004 that activity has effectively ceased.  Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel remains the main logistical airport for the Air Corps now.</p>  <p>  On the location and prepositioning of essential humanitarian supplies, Ireland does this in different parts of the world.  Currently, we have three stockpiles of emergency supplies.  One is in Ghana, which I visited seven or eight years ago, one is in Dubai and one is in Panama.  They have to be strategically located close to where we expect that emergency crisis situations are likely to unfold.  I will talk to the Deputy about other ways in which we might be able to help with what he is trying to do.</p></speech>

There is nothing else - no new actions or measures.  I have repeatedly made the point that the fuel allowance is extremely limited.  That is the problem.  I have learned from a recent reply from the Minister for Social Protection to a parliamentary question that the increase in eligibility that was announced in the budget will only extend the fuel allowance possibly to an estimated 4,500 households.  That does not become operational until January.  The other fuel allowance measure announced with regard to jobseekers will benefit an estimated 3,300 households.  There is support for an additional 7,800 households but the vast majority of them will not see that support until January.  Given the scale of the energy crisis, this is not enough.  I again ask that the Government consider a discretionary fund.  This has been proposed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is spending millions of euro every year supporting families.  We have to acknowledge that the energy crisis is an emergency and that more is needed than the fuel allowance.</p></speech>

Independent assessments of the budget have shown that the Government is successfully compensating for that.

I acknowledge the work of the staff in that office.  It has been an extremely busy time for them, particularly in the last number of months.  Some were re-tasked to assist the Department of Social Protection and other Departments during the height of the pandemic.  I am sure I speak for all Deputies when I express gratitude for the work they have done and for assisting many members of the public.  The Minister will be aware of the backlog of paper-based applications and of more complex applications.  Indeed, there is a heap of applications by parents for children's first passports that need to be dealt with.</p> <p>When does the Minister expect those new staff to come on stream?

I know that many Deputies are getting requests for help from families to get passports turned around quickly.  There are all sorts of reasons for that, nearly all linked to the Covid pandemic.  We are dramatically ramping up the human resources in the Passport Office.  We have worked with the OPW to get a lot of extra space.  In the next week or so we will put up Perspex units between staff and their colleagues in the Passport Office to allow the full complement to be back to work, consistent with Covid restrictions.  We set up a new call centre service for emergency cases for Oireachtas Members, which applies to everybody in this House.  We are increasing the limit of no more than five cases per week up to 15 cases per week in response to concerns that have been expressed to me.</p></speech>

While that is welcome and appropriate at this time, can he give a commitment that such additional funding in the ever-increasing pot of overseas development aid that Government is providing for will include those sums for future years to ensure countries such as those islands that identified themselves through impassioned speeches during COP26 will be supported by this country?</p></speech>

This will go to supports for catastrophe insurance and climate adaptation funds.  We have given this significant commitment of more than doubling our climate finance as part of overseas development aid funding by 2025.  We will go from spending &euro;93 million on climate finance currently to &euro;225 million.  I insisted that that be new money so that we are not diverting money away from other essential humanitarian assistance to fund that.

Unfortunately, crews in our area are constantly being deployed to other HSE areas.  Deputies elsewhere say the same is happening in their HSE areas.  It is evident there are not enough crews on the ground.  The HSE is measuring performance on the response time of the crews.  I ask the Minister to ask his Cabinet colleague, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to get a measurement of the time it takes for paramedics to get to the patient, which is the accurate reflection of the performance and the service that is being given by the ambulance service in rural areas.  At the moment, through no fault of the paramedics, the time taken to get to the patient is excessive.</p></speech>

Meath County Council owns approximately 3,500 houses while Westmeath County Council owns approximately 2,500.  Every week we contact local authorities about doors, windows, heating, plumbing and electrical issues, and the response is that there is no maintenance grant for these works.  The Government needs to put in place a maintenance grant specifically for repair and maintenance of local authority housing.  I ask the Minister to consider that.

That is part of the management of that housing stock.  I am not quite sure what the Deputy is referring to and whether he wants grant aid available for the tenants or for the local authorities.

The prospect of having to reduce their herd could well mean the end for them.  Many farmers in west Cork have come to me in recent months and I will give one farmer's example.  This farmer farms with his wife and two young sons.  They milk 75 cows on a fragmented and average-quality farm to the best of their ability.  They have invested heavily in infrastructure to ensure more than adequate slurry storage and excellent infrastructure for the animals.  This is spread using a trailing shoe only when they are allowed.  They test the soil on the farm regularly and use fertiliser to match these results.  They are good farmers, complying with every rule thrown at them.  They have been advised that new rules will reduce their herd by 19%, but will allow low-yielding herds, predominantly larger herds, to increase by 11.5% on the same farm.  If this goes ahead, it will cripple this farm family financially.  I ask the Minister to assure this family that these new rules will not go ahead as proposed because if they do, they will wipe out dozens of hard-working farmers in west Cork and throughout the country.</p></speech>

The reason Ireland has a good reputation globally as a sustainable and high-quality, safe food producer is we try to see ahead in terms of what consumers will demand in future.  Consumers are going to demand a food product they can consume knowing it has been produced in a way that takes the environment and climate into account.  We must bring farmers with us on this journey through new income opportunities that will emerge in this new era of greening agriculture.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="13:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100029#EE00200"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to update the House on the work being carried out by the commission of investigation into certain matters relevant to disability services in the south east, and related matters, also known as the Farrelly commission.  At the outset, it is important to note that I am mindful this is an active commission of investigation and that the commission is entirely independent in the conduct of its investigations, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the substance of reports at this time as I do not wish to interfere with or prejudice the commission's ongoing investigation.</p>  <p>  By way of context, the commission of investigation was established, in May 2017, to investigate the care and protection of "Grace" and others in a former foster home in the south east which has been the subject of abuse allegations.  The commission was given two bodies of work - phase 1 and phase 2 - to be carried out over a 12-month period.  Phase 1, which began on 15 May 2017, concerned the investigation of the role of public authorities in the care and protection of Grace, who resided with a foster family in the south east of Ireland between 1989 and 1995.  Phase 2 will take into account the facts established through phase 1 of its work and consider the scope for further investigations.  As Members of the House will be aware, four 12-month extensions have been granted to allow phase 1 to be completed in accordance with the terms of reference.</p>  <p>  Since taking up the role of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I have met the commission on two occasions, most recently in May 2021.  Having followed this investigation from the Opposition benches in the last D&aacute;il, it was important to proactively engage with the commission, insofar as possible, which is why I sought these meetings.  I needed to understand fully the reason the commission's work is taking as long as it has and to hear from the commission directly on the matters concerned.  It will not be to the surprise of anyone that both the Minister for Health and I were disappointed to learn the commission needed more time to conclude its work.  All options were considered.  Let me be honest with the House.  Were the commission scrapped, we would have spent &euro;7 million and not have a final report to show for it.  This would be of no use to anyone; no lessons would be learned.  We must ensure the final report can be drafted and submitted to Government in order that we can obtain a true understanding of the events that occurred and exactly where there were failures in Grace's care.  There must be accountability.  We must know exactly what happened and who was responsible for any failures that may be uncovered by the commission.  I hope, when full details of the commission's findings are eventually published, we will have answers to these important questions, including recommendations for the future.  When granting the most recent 12-month extension, in July 2021, an account of the progress made to date, the provision of the two substantive interim reports, and an outline of work still to be carried out were considered.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 has, without doubt, taken longer than anyone could have anticipated.  From what I was told when I met the commission, there have been a substantial number of interviews, agencies and correspondence to be considered by the commission.  I note from my discussion with the commission, it is also aware of the length of time the work is taking.  Of course, the current public health emergency has had an effect on the ability to conduct investigations and this too has had a knock-on effect.</p>  <p>  The first substantive interim report covers the period 1989 to 1996, at which point Grace reached adulthood.  During this time, State childcare policies governed the responsibility of public authorities regarding her care.  It also informed us of the methodology in the context of the commission's investigation.  The first interim report also includes details of the role of public authorities in Grace's care and protection; the arrangements whereby her foster home was identified and used; statutory checks and duties of care and responsibilities; and how the relevant public authorities interacted on her care during this period.  The second substantive interim report represents the commission's findings on a range of matters on the role of public authorities in the care and protection of Grace over the period 1997 to 2007.</p>  <p>  The substantive interim reports represent the first findings by the Farrelly commission.  There is now an opportunity to engage with the relevant organisations and care providers to discuss the findings, the evolution of care in the interim and to confirm that we have addressed the circumstances that enabled this situation to arise in the first place.</p> <p>However, the work of the commission has yet to conclude on a number of important issues relating to Grace.  In particular, we await its findings regarding the care provided to Grace by the foster family and whether she suffered abuse.  This is one of the most important issues to be considered by the commission and there is a significant interest in its resolution.  The Minister for Health and I are continuing to consider the two substantive reports and are keeping the work of the commission under review.  It is also important to note that the regular progress updates on the completion of phase 1 are ongoing within the Department of Health.  </p> <p> In discussing this issue here today, I cannot ignore the fact that I have, in recent months, raised the issue of failures in care in a HSE-run service in Donegal.  In that instance, the HSE's own national independent review panel, NIRP, carried out a review of allegations of abuse at a facility.  Its findings are detailed in the so-called Brandon report.  This was discussed earlier, during Leaders' Questions, so it is timely in that regard.  The NIRP report identified 108 occurrences of sexually inappropriate behaviour by one resident, referred to by the pseudonym "Brandon", towards 18 other residents in the facility between 2003 and 2011.  The purpose of this review panel was to review the governance arrangements in the facility and to understand why this situation has continued over a period of four years without any effective measures having been taken by management during Brandon's residency to stop and prevent these highly traumatic assaults.  I mention this again, having read the full Brandon report.  It appears to contain echoes of the failures in care being discussed today that cannot be overlooked.  The report itself notes that these incidents occurred with the full knowledge of the staff and management of the facility at that time.  The full Brandon report provides a detailed overview of what happened, where the processes failed and how these incidents occurred.  The NIRP process provides clear answers but its full findings need to made public as the Minister, Deputy Coveney, mentioned earlier.  </p> <p> The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount.  When issues such as these arise, we need to approach them will the fullest sense of openness and transparency.  The Government's first concern is to ensure that the needs of current service users are being prioritised and addressed.  Whether having regard to the matters being investigated by the Farrelly commission or those detailed in the Brandon report, it is imperative that lessons are learned and timely improvements made where needed in the system.</p> <p> I will also use this opportunity to once again ask the HSE to reconsider its position on the Brandon report and to publish it in full rather than just publishing the executive summary.  Why it will not shift its position is beyond me.  I hope it will reconsider.  Some Deputies present here today and some former Members of this House have been closely involved in bringing these events into the public domain and are keen to see the commission's work progress and its ultimate findings published.  I look forward to listening to other contributions here today.  I am acutely aware of the sensitivities involved and the need for timely action on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="13:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100030#FF00200"><p>I am sharing time with some of my colleagues.  Grace was failed by the State and by individuals in charge of her care.  Some 46 others went through this home and it is welcome that all of their cases will be fully investigated.  Grace was failed by the South Eastern Health Board and by a system that did not have adequate safeguarding laws and processes in place.  Red flags were raised but they were ignored and no action was taken.  There are a lot of parallels with the Brandon case the Minister of State raised.  I echo her view that the report and its executive summary need to be published and given to the families of all of the victims, who need to be front and centre in the process.</p>  <p>  In the Grace case, there was either gross incompetence or someone did not want to know.  We should not hold back in calling that out.  One of the things we need to ensure and one of the changes I want to see in this area is accountability.  I have been championing advances in adult safeguarding for some time.  There has to be accountability at an organisational level.  That must include sanctions because there must be accountability at an organisational level where there is abuse and neglect, whether in the case of a public care home, a private home, a centre for people with disabilities or a child who has been fostered out.  If there have been systemic failures and if there has been awareness of those failures, there must be accountability at an organisational level from the very top right down to the people responsible for those failings.  People want to see that type of accountability in this area.</p>  <p>  Concerns about abuse were raised as far back as 1993 and yet Grace remained in the home for a further 16 years.  Concerns were never raised with her mother, who I believe has yet to receive an apology she can accept.  I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for some time and we had the then director general of the HSE before the committee at that time.  He refused to give an apology on the basis that he wanted to see the report of the Farrelly commission.  We all knew then and all know now that there were systemic failings.  Obviously, we needed to establish the full facts, which is what this commission will do, but there was enough awareness for an apology to be given.  Despite this, that mother is still waiting for an apology from the HSE.  She was misled all along the way.  She was told that Grace was happy, that she was attending day care and that she was in a loving, caring home.  As we know, none of this was true.</p>  <p>  A number of failures have been identified in the substantive interim reports of the Farrelly commission.  I acknowledge that no finding has yet been made in those interim reports but the following failures have been clearly identified.  There was an ignorance and lack of knowledge of legal responsibilities and guidelines among key staff involved in managing Grace's care.  There was a failure to remove Grace from the home after concerns were raised or to even investigate those complaints.  There is no evidence that repeated evidence of unusual injuries to Grace was investigated and there was a failure to secure her legal status once she turned 18 and to ensure she received regular medical attention.  There was ignorance of her generally poor appearance and hygiene and a failure to monitor, review and supervise Grace in her placement.  There was a failure to maintain a case file or to designate an authorised officer to oversee her case.  There were extended periods with no health visits and no key worker on the case and there was a general overall failure to ensure her safety and well-being and to protect her.  That is already damning even before we see the findings of the final report.</p>  <p>  Even after a disclosure was made by a disabilities service provider that raised serious concerns about Grace's condition and behaviour and with which I and others in the Chamber have engaged several times on this issue, particularly when the Committee of Public Accounts was dealing with it, she was left in the home without any investigation.  The service provider even reported this to the Committee of Public Accounts when an Teachta McGuinness was its Chair.  The provider felt its funding had been targeted because it came forward.  That is also a very serious issue and something which I and others raised with the director general of the HSE.  An organisation that was receiving State funding was raising concerns or whistleblowing and felt it was then targeted because of the work it did in bringing this issue to public attention.  </p>  <p>  I will finish on this to allow my colleagues to come in but that type of institutional resistance and failure to take responsibility, to deal with or follow up on complaints and to make sure that proper safeguarding is in place is why we end up with these types of commissions of investigation.  They need to be put in place to establish the facts.  If, however, there was accountability at an organisational level and honesty and truth from those in power, we would not need to have the high number of these commissions we are seeing.  Grace was failed by the HSE, by the family involved and by people within the HSE.  Whatever happens, people need to be held to account for those failures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="13:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100030#FF00300"><p>That there were systemic failures and shortcomings, a failure to monitor, review and supervise, that there were numerous and notable warning signs and that her case disappeared from view are just some of the devastating findings of the two interim reports of the Farrelly commission of investigation.  Running to nearly 800 pages, the two interim reports map out in significant detail the breathtaking failures of a system that was meant to protect a vulnerable person.  There have been reviews, investigations and a number of inquiries over two decades and what seems evident from this wealth of information and investigation is that Grace was being systemically abused and failed over a prolonged period of time.</p> <p>I often wonder whether we ever learn from history or mistakes to ask and understand the reasons systems designed by people to protect others fail so miserably.</p> <p> There is little doubt the key personnel within the South Eastern Health Board at that time were outrageously inept in their roles and had little understanding of their duty of care towards Grace.  To read they had no real understanding in regard to the discharge of their duties in the care of Grace beggars belief, and at times I wonder whether it is just a convenient excuse.  It shows Grace was placed in a wholly unacceptable foster placement and simply forgotten, yet when staff in day services noted and reported disturbing behaviour, they were dismissed.  Most worrying was the revelation that after an allegation of abuse, a decision to remove Grace was taken but then reversed.  It is difficult to read that whatever failings Grace encountered as a minor not only continued but escalated amid confusion over her legal status, abandonment by officials for years on end and the fallout of the decision not to remove her from the foster home.  The detailing of Grace's behaviour at this point is very distressing and difficult to read.  This is compounded by the fact Grace could not articulate what she was suffering but rather suffered in silence.</p> <p> I recently spoke about this issue on my local radio station and said, as I say regularly in the House, that I sometimes run out of words when it comes to the treatment of children by this State, both historically and in the present.  Here we are again having a debate about which we are all shocked, dismayed and concerned, yet I can almost guarantee that in a few years' time, something else will happen and we will have a similar debate in here.  We need to start putting the resources in place to ensure this will not happen to other children or vulnerable people.</p> <p> The Garda was so concerned that it sent a file to Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, in 2020 recommending prosecution.  I am open to correction but I think the DPP has yet to decide on the case.  We were all shocked to learn in May of this year that the commission of investigation's work was to expand to examine a further 46 others in the home and whether they too had been abused.  To think this went on for 20 years and could have an impact on 46 others is wholly unacceptable.</p> <p> That this State has an appalling record when it comes to the treatment of children is a depressing understatement.  When one considers Magdalen laundries, mother and baby institutions and industrial schools, it seems that, unfortunately, we never appear to be able to learn any sort of lesson and make positive changes.  I have significant reservations regarding the use of the commission of investigation format to investigate these abuses properly.  To date, the investigation has cost &euro;7 million.  Imagine if only a tiny fraction of this money were channelled into providing vulnerable young people and adults such as Grace with the care they so rightly deserve.  We have seen with the mother and baby home investigation how the commission of investigation system is not fit for purpose and as legislators we need to consider amending that.</p> <p> I sincerely hope I never again have to stand in the Chamber and talk about a case of absolute dereliction of duty but, unfortunately, I will not hold my breath in that regard.  It is imperative that any staff working with vulnerable adults clearly understand their role and the legal status of those in care, particularly in respect of wardship and guardianship, and that they be held accountable in their roles.  When they have the courage in certain cases to come forward and talk, they must not be discriminated against or dismissed for that.</p></speech>

I am a member of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with my colleague, Deputy Funchion, and in my short time as a member, I have heard heartbreaking testimony from those affected by mother and baby homes and the real-life stories of those who have been impacted by forced adoptions.  I am also very aware of the enduring pain inflicted on women and children in Magdalen laundries and industrial schools.  The list goes on; I could mention other examples.</p>  <p>  As a society, we must not forget our past but must learn from it.  We must make amends to the people the State failed and ensure issues such as this will not arise again.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Farrelly commission&rsquo;s reports and the case of Grace.  As was said, Grace was failed by the State and the people entrusted to look after her.  She was failed by the South Eastern Health Board and an inept system that did not have proper safeguarding measures in place.  Concerns that Grace was being abused were brought to the attention of the authorities but a decision made to remove her from the foster home was later reversed and she remained there.  Grace, who cannot speak, was allowed to remain in the foster home by the health authorities despite suspicions of sexual and physical abuse.</p>  <p>  Allegations of sexual abuse were made by a former resident in 1995.  Red flags were raised but ignored.  Forty-six other children passed through the home and I welcome the announcement their cases will be investigated because that is very much needed.  Concerns of abuse regarding Grace were raised as far back as 1993, yet she remained in the home for a further 16 years.  The State left an intellectually and physically disabled woman to remain with a foster family for 16 years, despite concerns about sexual abuse.  That is 16 years of systemic failures by the State.  This was either gross incompetence or people just did not want to know and simply looked the other way.  The report charts various concerns that were flagged over these years regarding Grace's condition and discussions of her case among social care staff.  In 1995, for example, her hips and arms were found to be bruised, and while in day service, she completely stripped herself for no apparent reason.  Her behaviour was described as chaotic and she took to headbutting trainees.  There is no evidence this bruising or these concerns were investigated at the time.</p>  <p>  As I was researching the matter in preparation for this contribution, I was shocked but not surprised to learn that some of the people who had been entrusted by the State to care for Grace remain working for the HSE.  There cannot be a circling of the wagons, as we have seen in the past.  It is simple: those who were responsible must be held accountable.  If they are not, we have simply learned nothing and the State will have failed Grace again.  As was asked earlier, could circumstances like this arise again?  The system remains chaotic and is still not working.  There never seems to be accountability but this needs to be put in place.  There are still too many changes of social workers into and out of children's lives, which leads to a lack of continuity of care, particularly for young children.  There are still too many gaps in the system, which allow vulnerable people to fall through them, and we need safeguarding measures to ensure circumstances such as Grace's never develop again.</p>  <p>  There must be accountability and we cannot settle for less.  Grace should not have to settle for less.  Those who have failed Grace and vulnerable children in the care of the State or of foster families on behalf of the State, must be held to account for their actions or inactions.  There can be no cover-up or excuses and the Government must ensure all the appropriate sanctions will be applied to those responsible.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on any Government to investigate cases of abuse and neglect in State institutions and provide answers for the families of victims.  It is clear for all to see the State and State bodies, well into the 1990s, failed their most vulnerable in a catastrophic way.  The way in which the mother and baby homes investigation was dealt with by the Government and others served to cause more hurt for victims and their families; this cannot happen in this case.</p><p>It is disappointing these investigations regularly seem to be prolonged and extended but in this case, that is due to the volume of evidence that has come to light during the investigation.  I have no concerns regarding the cost of such investigations because they are vital for victims and their families.  It is the responsibility of the State to examine these cases and deliver transparency in respect of the inaction or neglect of State bodies.  It is shocking how many State bodies and actors in this case either turned a blind eye, delayed action or did not act for reasons such as seeking legal advice on the case.  This led to Grace remaining in the foster home, and I fear for similar cases where this may have happened elsewhere.</p><p>Empowering People in Care, EPIC, has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	It has emerged that families of the victims of abuse at the &lsquo;Grace&rsquo; case foster home are deeply upset at the &ldquo;highly confrontational and adversarial&rdquo; nature of the Farrelly Commission of Investigation.  This is deeply disturbing.  The welfare of the families of the victims of this investigation must be paramount. It is imperative to the integrity of this and all future investigations that victims, and the families of victims, are treated at all times with respect and sensitivity.<br /><br />EPIC now calls on the Government to ensure that the concerns of these families are listened to, heard and responded to, to ensure that this is not the experience of those other families yet to give evidence.<br /><br />EPIC supports the granting of a 12-month extension to complete phase 1 of the investigation if this will ensure that the full facts of the case are brought to light.  In light of the requirement for a 12-month extension to deal with the unanticipated volume of evidence, EPIC also calls on the government to carry out a review of resources to ensure that the investigation has the capacity to complete this and future investigations within agreed timelines. </blockquote> <p>Where the State has clearly failed in the past, it must ensure that all families are heard and receive appropriate communications from the commission and that the State does not add further pain by continuing the bad communication and inaction which have led us to this point.  Despite the criminal convictions and allegations of sexual abuse, the State did not act.  It should have acted promptly to ensure the protection and safety of a child, and then an adult, who was vulnerable.  It will be difficult for members of the public listening to or reading about the details of this case to understand how correspondence could be exchanged between Mr. X and relevant Ministers regarding a case and then for no action to have subsequently been taken, when correspondence would indicate otherwise.  </p> <p> I accept the commission's findings that neither Minister made personal interventions in this case and that the remit of responsibility lies with what was then the South-Eastern Health Board.  These interactions, however, speak to the systemic levels of inaction that occurred in this case, notwithstanding that it was positive that no Ministers intervened beyond their remit in this instance.  The case shows us that the concurrent lack of clarity with the legal status of a vulnerable person only produced more difficulty.  We have seen from so many of the wrongs of the past that the most vulnerable were left without support and that the State and its entities failed in their duty to protect, shelter and protect vulnerable people, such as Grace.  It is unacceptable that the role and legal status of Mr. and Mrs. X and Grace's mother in regard to decision-making for Grace was allowed to be misconstrued.  The State and its authorities should have provided legal certainty and acted promptly when any misconceptions arose.</p> <p> One of the most troubling aspects of the case is that there was a complete failure to gain legal clarity from the State authorities involved to ensure that decision-making on behalf of Grace was carried out appropriately.  When dealing with cases such as these, it is paramount that State bodies and actors involved in such scenarios act in unison with other State bodies in respect of actions or work carried out concerning the protection of a vulnerable adult.  The recurring neglect to make a definitive decision and to act in the full possession of all information relating to a case is simply unacceptable.  For so many State bodies and arms of the State involved in cases such as this, this represents a complete and systematic failure of those of State bodies tasked with care and protection.  It would not be unjust for an independent onlooker reading this review to conclude that because of the difficulties presented in the case of Grace that numerous people within State bodies, and those State bodies themselves, swept this problem under the rug or away from view and that this inaction and indecision in turn only led to further neglect in the support and protection of a vulnerable person.</p> <p> One line in the second substantive report really exposes the blatant neglect in this case.  The fact that a decision to seek legal advice, including on wardship in Grace's case, was always seen as a last resort rather than a first priority bears emphasis.  This is an appalling failure and it would lead us to believe that those responsible never intended to seek clarity in the case or to ensure that Grace was in an adequate setting, with adequate care and protection.  I remind this House of the words spoken during the meeting of the First D&aacute;il by Tom Johnson, who said: "It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children [...]".  The Democratic Programme was the founding document of this Republic, and it has been violated by what happened in this case.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, as well for her opening statement.  These reports make for extremely difficult reading.  They are long, detailed and harrowing in the extreme.  Amid all this information, sometimes it is the smallest details that affect us emotionally and key us into the wider context.</p>  <p>  Grace was born on 28 September 1978.  She is just one year younger than me, and we would have spent a great deal of our lives not 50 miles from one another.  We grew up in different Irelands though.  By accident of birth, I was born into what was the socially-acceptable family unit, with every advantage and in an Ireland that was slowly shaking off its repressive shackles and facing forward.  Although Grace was younger than me, she was born into an Ireland of the past.  It was an Ireland with an extraordinary and dark history of incarcerating its women and children and anyone who did not conform to the narrow and constricted mores predicated on a twisted version of Christianity, which I believe has little to do with the words of love and forgiveness that we find in the Gospel.</p>  <p>  Grace's life is linked by that dark thread to the industrial schools, to the Magdalen laundries and to all those repressive outworkings of an unhealthy relationship between church and State which existed from the foundation of the State.  Prior to her birth, Grace's mother lived in a mother and baby home in Cork for two months.  Her birth was as traumatic as her later life was to be and the cause of her disability.  She was delivered by forceps and suffered significant trauma to her brain and asphyxia, and she also required intubation.  In May of the following year, she left the mother and baby home and entered into foster care, but that placement was not to last.  Grace was then placed in a children's home at the age of ten months, before being placed with a family in north Wicklow.  That arrangement, which was a happy and stable placement, it seems, lasted until 1989.  At that point, Grace was moved to live with family X on a temporary placement.  That temporary placement lasted 20 years, despite all the concerns and all the warning signs.  </p>  <p>  We failed this child over two decades and it is that harrowing detail that makes up the body of these reports.  I do not propose to go over those details, but I want to address the idea that perhaps this information was not known or that this was an isolated case that just fell through the cracks.  The truth is that the Ireland of the time did not want to know.  We were collectively content to turn a blind eye to what was happening behind closed doors.  This is not an Ireland of ancient history that we are talking about.  Grace was not removed from the home of family X until July 2009, after all the bruising and after she was brought to a sexual assault treatment unit.  She was not removed from that situation until her mother, who had not been properly informed all along, was finally told about the bruising and demanded that action be taken.</p>  <p>  We knew at the time.  A local journalist in Waterford has shared with me a series of newspaper clippings from 1995 and 1996 detailing concerns raised again and again about the South-Eastern Health Board, as it was then, by Councillor Garry O'Halloran, although those concerns were not specific to the case we are discussing here.  I do not know the man and I was not aware of his work at the time, but he took a brave stand, in the face of vocal opposition, to raise his concerns time and again.  This makes me think of the Kenneally case, which was also in Waterford.  Some of the survivors of that abuse are known to me personally.  I admire their bravery, and I wish that I had a fraction of it.  They deserve to get their full story told, just as the Farrelly commission has documented Grace's.  Again, this was an open secret, hiding in plain sight, and we decided as a society just to not see it.</p>  <p>  That is the responsibility we bear here today.  We cannot unpick Grace's tragic history.  While I acknowledge that an apology was finally made to her by the HSE and a financial settlement was agreed, I am not sure how much that means to her, although I hope it will at least ensure that the rest of her life is spent a little more comfortably.  What we can do is to choose to not repeat that tragic history.  I have taught children in foster care and met some wonderful foster parents, but our foster care system is not where it needs to be.  My colleague, Deputy Costello, has a record of vocally advocating on this issue and it is a sector that he knows well from his previous working life.</p>  <p>  As a teacher, I welcomed the changes in the child protection guidelines and the move to make those receiving a disclosure a mandated person in the eyes of law.  None of us should abdicate our responsibilities to advocate for a child or vulnerable person in danger.  As other Deputies said, this is about accountability.  In that context and in my present role as a Deputy for Waterford, I ask the Minister of State whether other national independent review panels or look back reviews are in place in disability services.  If some are in place, what community healthcare organisation, CHO, or CHOs, are they taking place in?  I ask that because we have a responsibility to Grace and the other children so damaged by this State in the past not to repeat our mistakes.  We also have a responsibility to shine a light on the systems and the culture that failed these children and to ensure that it never happens again.</p></speech>

In this case, however, I am absolutely sickened to the pit of my stomach having read the details of the various reports of the Farrelly commission.</p> <p>Most people will have a little knowledge of the commission's work, particularly as it relates to the sorry tale of Grace.  Nonetheless, it is better that we speak about it in public so that somebody somewhere, perhaps a care worker or a family member, might hear about it, read a bit more and ask questions.  Perhaps such a person would be more inclined to question a bruise, scratch, behaviour or word that seemed out of place but was brushed aside by a colleague or was forgotten in the hustle and bustle of a busy workplace.  Something might make them think twice about staying silent and that might save another vulnerable human being from suffering a similar fate to those mentioned in this report.</p> <p> The report sets out what the commission describes as systemic failings and shortcomings in the care of Grace over the two decades she stayed in the home.  Indeed, for several years, she was forgotten altogether, with few or no checks being made as to her welfare.  The report states that Grace fell through the cracks and out of sight.  She was placed with a foster family in what was meant to be a temporary arrangement.  The health board knew that both the foster parents had convictions for theft but that did not raise any red flags.  Concerns about alleged abuse in the home were first raised in 1992 but Grace remained in the foster home until 2009.  Records show that Grace was absent on a worrying number of occasions form her daycare facility between 2002 and 2006.  In 2006, she was marked absent on 170 occasions.</p> <p> Grace was not alone.  There were several other children living in the home over that period.  Grace ended up with the family because of a severe shortage of residential places in the south east.  She was failed by the system that was meant to protect her.  The health board failed to monitor, review and supervise Grace in her placement, failed to maintain a case file and failed to designate an authorised officer to oversee her case.</p> <p> In October 1995, a large bruise was noticed on Grace's hip.  Ten days later, an incident report stated that for the first time in daycare, Grace completely stripped herself for no apparent reason.  Other documents also referred to bruising on Grace's body, bad behaviour, poor hygiene and the stripping off of her clothes.  In 1996, the mother of a different girl said that her daughter had been sexually molested while being fostered by the same foster family.  That allegation was never properly investigated by the Garda because a formal complaint was not made.  In 2000, a burn mark on Grace's inner thigh was found by a nurse but was not reported to management and the matter was not followed up.</p> <p> Concerns were then raised after Grace turned up for a day service appointment in August 2008 with a black eye.  The following March, she was found to have bruising on her breast and thigh.  Finally, in July 2009, Grace was removed from the home after her mother was informed of the bruising and demanded action be taken.</p> <p> There must be consequences for the perpetrators of this abuse and for those who turned a blind eye and failed to look out for Grace.  We need to start treating whistleblowers with the respect they deserve.  There is a lesson to be learned from this scandal, and from the cases involving Maurice McCabe, Jonathan Sugarman, Tom Clonan, Anthony O'Brien and all the others.  There must be consequences for wrongdoing and whistleblowers need our support, not our suspicion or, worse, our contempt.  This Government must enact the protected disclosures (amendment) Bill 2021 and give effect to the relevant European directive.</p></speech>

I got very little sense of the State's response to this appalling case.  The Minister of State took a lot of time talking about the Brandon case with which there are obvious parallels which we need to address.  I acknowledge Deputy Pringle and all of the work he did on the Brandon case.  However, this is a separate case and I would have thought, as a Minister of State and a representative of the Government, there would have been a more detailed response to this report.  I did not hear that today.</p>  <p>  This tragic story began in a mother and baby home.  It is a litany of the most appalling official neglect of a young person and adult, as she later became, by the State.  It started with an unmarried expectant mother who, like many others at that time, was effectively cast aside.  It is an approach we have not entirely stopped yet.  The State was not prepared to take responsibility for a vulnerable person and, essentially, handed over that responsibility to the church.  The State had a duty of care to this woman and her child but there was an abdication of that responsibility, an approach that was taken to many women and children in those days.  The complications during the birth meant that adoption was "out of the question".  The mother and baby home had "no services to offer Grace" and handed her back to the State.  She was clearly an inconvenience and this was an issue that the State wanted to forget.</p>  <p>  Grace did not fall through the cracks, she was abandoned by the State.  This vulnerable child, and later adult, was completely forgotten about.  She was left to languish in abusive, neglectful and dangerous circumstances for 20 years.  There were repeated failures to respond to the awful circumstances in which she was left.  A 1996 decision to remove Grace from family X, following sexual abuse allegations by another individual, was not followed through on.  For a year, she had no social worker assigned to her.  When a new social worker was appointed, Grace's case was not flagged as a priority and no visits took place in the two-year period encompassing 2002 and 2003.  When the social worker left their post in 2006, they were not replaced.  That sorry tale continues to this day.  There is still a shortage of social workers.  It is often young and inexperienced social workers who are allocated to vulnerable children.  They hang around for a year or two years before moving on and not being replaced.  Let us not think this is only an historical issue because it is still going on to this day.</p>  <p>  Why did it take 20 years for Grace to be moved?  Referring to 20 years of "systemic failings and shortcomings" does not even begin to describe the situation.  To essentially dismiss it as a systemic failure will not cut it anymore.  We have had too many situations where Ministers and various taoisigh have referred to some of these scandals from our recent and more distant past as systemic failures.  That is not what they are.  This was a failure, an abdication of responsibility and a dereliction of duty.  We need to get to the bottom of that.  A system cannot be blamed.  The people in the system must be blamed and made accountable.  That was one of the key recommendations for the health service arising out of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We called for the HSE to be regionalised and, critically, to have legal accountability for the provision of services and the standards being set.  We still do not have legal accountability for senior managers who are well paid to provide services.  When those services fail, it is a failure of the management concerned and there must be accountability for that.  </p>  <p>  Grace, of course, has paid an enormous price for those failings and shortcomings.  The HSE has described the 1996 sexual abuse allegations as a missed opportunity to remove her but concerns arose before and after that.  There were bruises, burns, erratic behaviour, poor hygiene and prolonged absences from daycare, etc.  Still serving public servants who failed Grace must be held accountable.</p>  <p>  Grace's placement with family X was supposed to be temporary, yet it became permanent despite blatant concerns.  Mr. and Mrs. X had convictions for theft and larceny, yet they were deemed appropriate carers for vulnerable children.  Who deemed them appropriate carers?</p> <p>What were the standards, and who thought it was somehow okay to put a very vulnerable child with people like that?</p> <p> The Conal Devine report of 2015 found that 47 children were also placed in the care of the family.  Judging by the pace of the investigation, it will be a long time before we know exactly what they suffered at the hands of family X.</p> <p> It seems the intersections between the care decisions and legal obligations are not understood, or are being, or were, completely ignored.  This will not do.  We need to find out the exact position.  We must not have commissions of investigation like the one in question going on indefinitely for years.  Justice delayed is justice denied for everybody, especially vulnerable children.  We have spent &euro;7 million on this already.  We have not even completed phase 1.  This is another failure.  Unless we can address these issues in a meaningful way, whereby people are held to account, they will continue to occur.</p></speech>

Grace was failed by the State and her service providers.  Concerns were raised as far back as 1993.  Grace and her family deserve the truth and the establishment of the full facts of the case.</p><p>The commission, under chairperson and sole member Marjorie Farrelly, SC, commenced its investigation on 15 May 2017.  Four years on, it is regrettable that we do not have a final report.  My colleague, Deputy McGuinness, has consistently raised this in the House.  I commend him on his tenacity in this regard.  It is important for this House to see the final report.</p><p>Under the terms of reference, as approved by the Government in March 2017, a final report on the commission's phase 1 work into Grace's case was due to be submitted to the Minister for Health within one year of the commission commencing its work.  The commission has received a number of time extensions to enable it to carry out its work in accordance with the terms of reference.  The pandemic will have had an impact on the work of the commission.  That is understandable.  In the circumstances, I support the extension for another 12 months so the commission may continue with its work but I would like to see the final report on Grace's case.</p><p>The interim findings of the commission are a matter of deep concern as it is clear that, at the time in question, the South-Eastern Health Board, and subsequently the HSE, failed to adhere to their statutory obligations.  These reports point to a series of historic systemic failings on the part of the various public bodies.  It should be acknowledged that the national policy on the care of children and adults with intellectual disabilities has developed significantly since the periods covered by the reports, including through the establishment of the national safeguarding policy and the safeguarding committee in each of the community healthcare organisations, the appointment of a confidential recipient, and the establishment of a national independent review panel.  However, as we have seen in the Brandon report, Grace's case may not be an isolated incident.  There may be more systemic failures.  The needs of service users must be prioritised, and lessons must be learned.  A start would be the full publication of the Brandon report, as called for by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on several occasions.</p><p>Last month, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State responsible for disabilities published two substantive interim reports of the commission of investigation.  The first covers the period from 1989 to 1996, when Grace reached adulthood.  It covers the role of public authorities in her care and protection and the arrangements whereby her foster home was identified.  The second report covers the period from 1997 to 2007.  The commission has found that there were repeated and systemic failings in the management of the care of Grace, an intellectually disabled woman left in foster care for two decades despite concerns about physical and sexual abuse.</p><p>As an infant, Grace was given into the voluntary care of the State.  She lived in several residential and foster home settings within the Eastern Health Board area up to the age of 11.  She was then placed in the foster care of family X by the South-Eastern Health Board in February 1989.  This was in a home in the south east.  She lived with family X into adulthood, or until she was nearly 31 years of age, which was almost for 20 years.  The commission found that Grace was placed in foster care along with other vulnerable adults and children despite her foster parents &ndash; identified only as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. X&quot; &ndash; having criminal convictions.  The investigation could not conclude whether Mr. X's convictions for larceny and theft, dating from 1966, and Mrs X's convictions for larceny in 1988 would have prevented them from being approved as foster parents for Grace in 1989, &quot;but considers that it is unlikely to have done so&quot;.  This is extraordinary.  The HSE was unable to tell the commission whether there was a policy within the South-Eastern Health Board in or around 1989 that would have prohibited children from being placed in the care of individuals against whom there were criminal convictions.  Grace remained in the family's care until 2009 despite allegations of abuse.</p><p>The commission found that, in the care and decision-making in Grace's case from 1997 to 2006, there were:</p> <blockquote> 	&ndash; [an] ongoing lack of clarity about Grace's legal status as a vulnerable adult; <br /><br />&ndash; misconceptions about the role and legal status of Mrs. and Mr. X and Grace's mother with respect to decision making for Grace; <br /><br />&ndash; ongoing confusion/misunderstanding about what had occurred in Grace's case in 1996; <br /><br />&ndash; ongoing failure to seek legal advice or to follow through on the issue of wardship; <br /><br />&ndash; inconsistent approach to monitoring; <br /><br />&ndash; failures in information sharing and working with incomplete information; <br /><br />&ndash; absence of proper supervision and oversight; <br /><br />&ndash; paralysis around interconnection between care decisions and legal considerations; <br /><br />&ndash; lack of co-ordination and follow through; and <br /><br />&ndash; delay, indecision and U-turns. </blockquote>  <p>Failings in Grace's care and overarching systemic issues affecting her case &quot;resulted in her case disappearing from view within the health board&quot; from when she was 18 until she was 28.  That sends a chill down our spines and those of parents or others who look to the State for care.  We saw a programme some days ago on historical failings in this State but the case we are talking about arose during my lifetime, not decades ago.</p><p>The commission stated that the reactive, rather than proactive, manner in which the disability service operated, together with the absence of oversight and regular file reviews, &quot;contributed to Grace's case falling through the cracks and out of sight in 2001&quot;.</p><p>The commission has found that the South-Eastern Health Board and its officials were the decision-makers.  It is clear they failed in their responsibility to Grace, and possibly other vulnerable individuals under their care.  Grace has been failed by the South-Eastern Health Board and State.  She and her family must receive justice.  Lessons must be learned and all vulnerable people must be protected in the future.  I look forward to examining the final report of the commission.</p></speech>

There are no words strong enough to describe the horrific abuse to the girl known to us all only as Grace.  While we finally have another interim report, and while I appreciate the work of the commission on the case, there are still too many outstanding questions.  Regardless of the questions the public should have answered, Grace and her family are the ones who deserve to know what exactly happened, why it happened and why it continued to happen.</p>  <p>  Has the commission detailed exactly why a couple with serious criminal convictions was entrusted with the care of Grace?  We are not talking about minor convictions; these were convictions handed down in a public setting in a public court.  The relevant authorities knew well about the convictions, yet no one acted.  While I understand and support the process of reforming criminals, this was not what happened here - far from it.  In fact, when Grace presented with injuries, they were not even investigated, and some were not even correctly reported to the relevant authorities.  Can we even be sure that the commission has been able to detail the entirety of Grace's injuries at the hands of the two people entrusted with her care?  I am not satisfied that we can ever be assured of that.</p>  <p>  If it had not been for those who finally raised the alarm and their voices on Grace's behalf, we probably would never have discovered the sheer horror that this girl lived with.  I use the word "girl" because that is all that Grace was.  She was only a child when this happened to her.  Those of us with children know fully what that means because everything in our lives is about caring for them.  Grace was a child who deserved to have her voice heard and needs met, but these were denied to her.  Even worse, she was forced to endure the abuse even when it became apparent to others that she was living in circumstances that were resulting in both physical and emotional damage to her and others in the setting.</p> <p>I wish to put on the record that although the commission found no wrongdoing on the part of politicians involved in supporting calls for Grace to remain with her foster family during this time, we all need to be reminded that it was a factor in delaying her removal from the house which, by default, elongated the abuse she suffered.</p> <p> There is no doubt the commission has outlined the serious deficiencies in the care of Grace, but the Minister of State now has the responsibility of correcting and combatting the failures it outlined.  I know she will take that responsibility seriously because we cannot allow this to happen to any child or adult in the State again.  As other Deputies have stated, the reality is that right now across this country there are similar children in similar circumstances but the State is blind to that simply because the resources have not been put in place to deliver the right level of care.  People from my constituency come to me all the time to highlight issues, particularly with social care and fostering and all of that, and there simply is not an adequate response in place due to a lack of resources.  I am sure all other Members have had similar experiences.  Tusla and the social care services tell me they are inundated with work.  They simply cannot cope with the case file loads they have.  We really need not just a reflection of action on this case and the horrific problems in the context of what happened to Grace and others whose cases have been documented so widely in the public domain, we also need to consider our responsibility to ensure the State provides the services for those who are in potentially similar circumstances right now.</p></speech>

What was done to Grace was done in our name.  That is a difficult thing to say but it is true.  When we give Tusla and the HSE the duty of care for an individual, they assume that duty in our name.  We, as citizens of Ireland, allow them to care for individuals.  We hope they will do that responsibly and with the care needs of those individuals uppermost, but we do not want to face up to it when that is not the case.  Sadly, they are doing this in our name.  We did not give Tusla or the HSE permission to leave Grace in a home where she was attacked and brutalised.  When issues were raised by brave whistleblowers, they were subjected to abuse and had their careers ended by the same organisations about which they complained.  All that was in our name.  We have to make sure those organisations and the people they are protecting are not acting in our name.  It needs to be plainly outlined to them that they are not acting on our behalf.</p><p>It is shocking that concerns were raised in 1992 and 1995.  It seems we still have not out found why nothing happened at those times.  Mr. Conor Dignam completed his report on 29 August 2016, before the Farrelly report.  He queried why the Garda would not allow the publication of a review of the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports.  Why could the Garda not engage with the tribunals and redact any problematic statements, thus facilitating the publication of the reports?  In his report, he recommended:</p> <blockquote> 	The HSE should seek to put in place an arrangement or protocol with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within which engagement and exploration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s view that material should not be published in a particular matter can occur to facilitate the HSE making an independent decision in respect of publication. </blockquote>  <p>That recommendation is very interesting and the date of the report particularly so.  I met a whistleblower regarding Ard Gr&eacute;ine Court, County Donegal in October 2016, while the Dignam report was submitted in August 2016.  That meeting led to the Brandon report on the abuse of 19 residents by a person referred to in the report as Brandon.  That abuse went on with the knowledge of the management of the facility but was uncovered thanks to the diligence and concern of staff.  In that case too, the management turned a blind eye to it in our name.</p><p>It seems the two whistleblowers in the Grace case went to the Department of Health and the HSE in 2009 to highlight the abuse of Grace out of concern for her safety but nothing was done apart from the whistleblowers being targeted by the Department and made to suffer.  They lost their jobs on foot of this.  This is a shocking litany of abuse and neglect - neglect on behalf of the Department and the HSE, which act in our name and should have stopped this savage abuse.</p><p>The similarities between the Brandon case and the Grace case are astounding, which is why the two have to be mentioned together.  The events in question occurred years apart at different ends of the country, but the same things were going on.  We still do not know whether there are other cases within the HSE that have been investigated and reported on, and that is the problem.  The Minister of State has herself said that we need to know what exactly happened and who was responsible for any failures that may be uncovered by the commission in the Grace case.  However, she has also rightly stated that it is imperative that lessons are learned in the context of the Brandon report.  When will the Brandon report be published?  When will the Garda be held accountable through the publication of the report?  Let everyone see whether it has questions to answer in the context of the report.  These questions need to be answered because they are relevant to how the State, acting on our behalf, has behaved.  They are important in terms of showing the State is responding to and changing from how it has behaved in our name in the past.  It is only by exposing and accepting the wrongs of the past that we can ensure they will not happen again.  At this time, I am not overly confident they will not happen again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100035#LL00300"><p>I listened carefully to the remarks of the Minister of State and the other contributors to this discussion and I have to say that I am shocked and appalled that what is happening here today is a further abuse of Grace and the 46 others.  We are completely ignoring the fact that there are reports within the HSE that clearly outline what happened to Grace.  In the beginning, when this happened and the whistleblowers decided they were going to explain the case, it came up at the Committee of Public Accounts under the guise of the money that was spent on the Resilience Ireland report and the Conal Devine report.  That is how it began to seep out into the public domain.  That is how it was exposed.  It was not the HSE or any other body else facilitating an inspection of what went on or an investigation.</p>  <p>  The minute all of this happened, the two whistleblowers were targeted by the HSE.  They were targeted in their employment in Waterford and they were put under horrendous stress.  I read the reports from the whistleblowers.  I discussed it with them.  I could not believe this type of abuse could happen in our State; that a young woman was put into a home and sexually abused and that sexual abuse was reported by a HSE worker because he was concerned that she had objects put into her that would cause her a bowel problem in her future, as it did.  It was reported to the Garda and nothing happened.  The HSE called to the house and inspected it and found that she lived there with three male residents.  There were people found locked under the stairs.  There were children in outhouses.  There were men of the road, as they were called at the time, calling to and leaving that house, and nothing was done.  When the whistleblower, against the wishes of the HSE, went to court seeking for Grace to be appointed a ward of court and for her to be the Committee, the HSE resisted this, but she ploughed ahead and was appointed.</p>  <p>  The other really disgusting thing about this case is that it continues today through the Department of Health and the Waterford Intellectual Disabilities Association, WIDA, because the whistleblower lost her job as a result of contacting Deputies about the case.  That is what she was told.  As strong as she was, she took a case to the High Court.  The case was settled on the steps of the court with what I am sure was some sort of financial reward, so we are never going to know what happened.  How much did the Department of the Minister of State or did WIDA pay in legal fees and in settlements to keep Grace's whistleblowers quiet?  Is it a fact that the whistleblower had to sign a confidentiality agreement?  Will we ever know what was said?</p> <p>We know enough in these reports to know that there was corruption and criminality involved, and the Garda or the State took no action whatsoever.  Instead, when the Committee of this person, Grace, decided she was going to find out exactly what happened, she received reports like the ones I have in my hand, blanked out and redacted.  No sense can be made of some of the pages in the reports, except for the commentary that Grace spent years attending a day care centre.  She turned up, stripped off her clothes and presented lying on the floor in a sexual position.  She was non-verbal and intellectually and physically challenged.  Nobody reported the abuse.  Nobody thought fit to report the bruises on her thighs, legs and breasts, which were all inflicted by the hands of people, and not, as it was said, by a fall on the bus.  Nobody spoke up for her or tried to help her.  Other children in that house were left at the end of the road to make their own way to school or elsewhere.  No one asked where Grace was.  It was said that she had a cold, she was not well or she would not be in.  She had not seen a doctor for six years.  All during the time after the Committee was appointed, the HSE continued to stonewall the efforts of the Committee to get the information that was required, including even her medical information, so that person, the Committee, responsible for Grace would be able to take some form of care of her.  It did not happen.</p> <p> Looking through the many redacted reports from 2009 and previously, it can be seen that incidents were reported to Piltown Garda station.  I spent two hours in Pearse Street Garda station making a protected disclosure and nothing has ever happened.  I have not heard a single word from them.  Dogs will bark but the caravans will move on.  This debate will end.  I am holding the Taoiseach and the Government to account on this.  I believe that the D&aacute;il should insist on accountability.  The Taoiseach and the Minister should be sitting in the Chamber listening to what happened to Grace and responding, not hiding behind legal advice or rules about who cannot be named.  </p> <p> Someone sexually abused Grace and others in that house.  They abused her financially, because they took her disability allowance and paid nothing to her.  When the Committee got two boxes of her belongings back, there were clothes in them that could not be associated with Grace because they were too big for her.  There were thongs in a box that were not hers.  Other underwear and items of clothing in the boxes were not hers.  Some of the clothes were filthy.  There were no photographs, birthday cards or Christmas cards.  There was nothing, only two boxes.  When the HSE was asked if it wanted to see the two boxes received by the Committee, it declined.  In the investigation by the Committee - the person who blew the whistle - the HSE did not reply to some of the queries she put to them.  They ignored her and said that it was a godsend that we have such places to send these children to.  What a disgusting way to treat that young woman and all of the other 46 victims.</p> <p> I stood on the other side of the Chamber in opposition and insisted that what the former Minister of State, Finian McGrath, presented was wrong and that he was ignoring the 46 victims and other aspects of the case.  In fairness, Deputy Howlin and others stood up and demanded change.  My party supported what was to be a lesser type of debate, which is pretty typical, because it wanted to protect the institutions and the agencies.</p> <p> If we do not open up and demand transparency and accountability in this matter, and if the Minister and the Taoiseach are not asked to come back to the House to answer the questions that we have all raised here today, then we should be ashamed of ourselves.  We should understand that we are further abusing Grace and the other 46 victims.  I would like to know what is going to happen to the other 46 victims.  Are we going to have more rosy reports put before us?  It is horrendous, absolutely horrendous.  </p> <p> The money of the State was used by the HSE, through solicitors, to perpetuate the corruption that went on, and the turning of a blind eye to what was happening.  It happened on the border of counties Kilkenny and Waterford.  It is shocking to think that even the red flags from the UK authorities were ignored.  I could go on and on, because I have all the evidence with me.  Suffice it to say, the whistleblower, the Committee of Public Accounts, and in particular, former Deputy, John Deasy, did an excellent job in uncovering what must be the greatest scandal of our times.  We are adding to that scandal and pain with the response that the Minister of State read out here today.  If we do not demand accountability, then what is this House for?  How do we represent people and ensure that this does not happen again?  </p> <p> There was the Kilkenny incest case.  There are lots of examples from back then, and nothing has happened.  When newer Members to this House contribute to the debate, which I welcome, they miss the central point, which is the State knew about it all along.  Officials knew about it.  Those responsible for the care of these people knew about it and reported it.  The officials did the usual thing that the State does.  They employed people who were at one time employed by the HSE but were now in private practice to investigate.  The investigations were a complete and utter whitewash.  The detail of this report may be okay and may look grand.  It does not give any kind of description to the abuse that these 46 people suffered when they were in the care of the State - none.  Having listened to the two whistleblowers and read the reports, it is the first time in my 24 years here that I have been sickened to the pit of my stomach.  I cannot believe it happened.</p> <p> In conclusion, when the officials came before the Committee of Public Accounts, they told blatant lies about what they had done.  They should be called back in and put through the ringer in relation to the misinformation that they gave this House.  Politicians will be blamed for the wrongdoing, but there are individuals in the HSE who know what went on.  They are criminals.  They should be brought to court, they should be prosecuted and we should not be afraid to chase them down.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for her opening statement.  I would have preferred more detail, but I understand that she was being deliberately vague in light of the fact that there is an ongoing commission of investigation.  I, too, will be quite circumspect in my use of language for the same reasons.</p>  <p>  I wish to make two brief points on behalf of the Regional Group.  First, I thank the Farrelly commission of investigation for its work so far.  I fully appreciate the frustrations of the House regarding how long it is taking, but I accept the need for the most recent extension of 12 months that was granted.  I have read the substantive interim reports.  They are, indeed, substantive, and make for grim and harrowing reading.  Direction is more important than speed; I would rather wait another few months to get a more comprehensive report that is accurate and contains appropriate recommendations.</p>  <p>  Second, I wish to extend my solidarity to Grace and her mum, who I believe no longer lives in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>As Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh so eloquently put it, Grace and I have a lot in common in that we grew up in the same county.  While we may have grown up in the same county we grew up in completely different worlds.  I had a very uncomplicated birth and I grew up in a family that was socially acceptable at the time.  Unfortunately for Grace, the lottery of life dealt her a much more cruel hand in that she had a very complicated delivery that resulted in physical and intellectual impairment for the rest of her life.  She also grew up in a family unit that was completely socially unacceptable at the time and suffered enormous stigmatisation, marginalisation and isolation as a result.</p> <p> I have two questions for the Minister of State, who might be kind enough to provide the answers during her wrap up.  This is the fourth extension for phase 1.  Is the Minister of State satisfied this will be the last extension and that we will be looking at the final report of at least phase 1 next July?  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this.  Is the Minister of State satisfied there are no more Graces in the system at present and will not be in future?  Have the appropriate safeguards been put in place to ensure this will never happen again?</p> <p> I wish the Farrelly commission well in the remainder of its investigation.  I very much look forward to reading the final report next July.  It cannot happen soon enough from my point of view.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy McGuinness.  We did not think it was appropriate, given the profound nature of the disability, what has happened and the abuse, to give him a round of applause but he certainly deserves one.  I feel nauseated.  I was on the Committee of Public Accounts and following his very good work and the work of the committee, including Deputy Deasy.  The current Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, was Chair at the time.  It is testimony to Deputy McGuinness's creativity and the creativity of the committee that he found a way to get the whistleblowers to come before it.  We also heard from the whistleblowers.  It is something that has never left me and I thank Deputy McGuinness.</p>  <p>  The cost of the Farrelly commission to date is just over &euro;5.6 million.  To be precise, it is &euro;5,640,451.97, and we still do not know about one of the primary terms of reference with regard to the care and abuse of Grace.  We do not know about the treatment of the whistleblowers who have been mentioned, or about their allegations that there was suppression of these events.  We do not know anything about how they were punished as a result of coming forward.  On page 4 of the second report we are informed that principal tasks remain and there is no indication as to when the report will be completed.  There is a reference to previous reports and that eight interim reports have been published.  Indeed, they have not.  I am aware of five.  I can get five of them but not the other three.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is hands on, her heart is in the right place and she works very hard but the speech she gave today is an insult.  It is an insult to the D&aacute;il, it is an insult to Grace and to the 46 other children.  At the very least, I would have expected the senior Minister to be here given the gravity of the topic and that what the two substantial interim reports, separate from the other eight, are saying to date would have been set out.  I also expected to hear the reason three of the other eight reports have not been published and a date for the completion of the Farrelly report.  At the very least I expected the findings to date to be set out.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGuinness gave the background to this and he did so very well.  What we know is that back in 2009 the brave whistleblowers came forward, although concerns were known well before that.  That led to the establishment of the Devine investigation to look at the care, the service problems and the cause of those problems.  This led to Resilience Ireland, which I will come back to if I have time.  The Resilience Ireland report was to look at the 46 others who were placed there.  This was followed by the Dignam report to review the previous two reports and look at their procurement and the reasons for their non-publication.  I will be careful with my words with regard to Resilience, although I have lost all sense of carefulness because of the nausea overpowering me at that narrative of what is going on.  The Resilience company was formed with employees who worked previously for the health executive.  On top of this, we had the Deloitte report that came about as a result of the presentation to the Committee of Public Accounts.  That report was published on 15 September 2017.  It looked at the money given to the service provider where Grace went eventually because the service provider felt it was not getting sufficient funds to look after her and felt it was being targeted.</p>  <p>  What is interesting about these reports is that the Devine report was from March 2012.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh said we all knew but let us see what happened with the reports.  The Devine report was completed in March 2012 but not published until February 2017.  The Resilience report was completed in March 2015 but not published until 2017.  The Conor Dignam report was completed on 29 August 2016.  This was a review of certain matters relating to a disability service.  It was as a result of this report, which was not published until June 2019 but given to the health board in 2016, that we got the other reports.  All of the time, there was a Garda investigation similar to what is happening in Donegal, as outlined by my colleague Deputy Pringle, when there were no reasons for that at all.  Conor Dignam clearly pointed this out.  As I have said, on top of these reports we had eight interim reports, some of which are available, and two substantial reports, which the Department did not see important enough to set out today.  The commission was established in 2017.  As has been said, it was to report in 2018.  Here we are in 2021, four and a half years later, and there is no sign of a final report.</p>  <p>  Grace was a vulnerable child and a vulnerable adult with serious learning difficulties.  We can portray her this way.  Certainly she was a child and a woman that as of right deserved the protection of the State, which the State utterly failed to give.  Let me give the human side of Grace.  Grace was born on 24 November 1978.  Her birthday will be coming up shortly.  Grace was fostered in Wicklow to very good foster parents, who took a great interest in her despite their own difficulties and the mother's health problems.  In preparation for a case conference on 27 January 1989, the sister in charge at the Wicklow school she attended prepared a report.  The report showed that Grace had started in the Wicklow school on 14 February - how ironic is this - on 14 February 1984 and was in the senior class.  The report provides a picture in time of Grace when she was 11.  It states she was a pretty 11-year-old girl with long fair hair and a pale complexion.  It states that her mobility was good and that she loved swimming and was very good at it.  It states she loved all the playground activities and the climbing frame and the indoor trampoline.  It states she still needed help with ball games and loved musical play.  The last time Grace attended school was shortly after this.  After this, there was no schooling and no attendance at services.</p>  <p>  There are many psychologists' reports.  In addition to Grace's disabilities they set out her capabilities, particularly the alternative strategies needed given her absence of language.  It never happened, of course.  Her absence of language is all the more ironic given the thousands of words we now have in the various reports that have cost millions, all for the purpose of protecting the system even now.  The reports are protecting the system and not exposing the system or seeking to change it but trying to find ways to protect the system.  It is even more nauseating that this is still happening.</p>  <p>  Some of the findings the Department of Health failed to set out in the Minister of State's speech are the concluding observations in the second report, the ongoing lack of clarity about Grace's legal status, delays, indecision and U-turns, a lack of co-ordination and follow-through, paralysis in the interconnection between care decisions and legal considerations, an inconsistent approach to monitoring, ongoing confusion and misunderstanding and misconceptions about the role and legal status of Mr. and Mrs. X and Grace's mother with respect to decision-making.</p> <p>Let me mention Mr. and Mrs. X.  Their marital status is immaterial for me but the health board was at all times unaware of their marital status and believed that they were married.  It never checked up on the fact that Mrs. X said that she was a registered childminder or on the criminal history.  What is even more astounding and is perhaps captured in another pen picture is that when Mr. X died in June 2000 or 2001, which I will come back to, the health board and all of the caring professions were unaware that he was dead until the following February.  Nobody saw fit to inform it, not least Mrs. X.  I am making no finding as to Mrs. X but am simply pointing this out.</p> <p> To add to this confusion the interim reports, Nos. 1 and 2, have the wrong dates.  They talk about Mr. X  dying in June 2000 and then of him dying in 2001.  The point being that they were unaware from June until the following February.</p> <p> I will finish up with some of the flavours of the comments on this report, as in: &ldquo;case falling through the cracks and out of sight&rdquo;, that it was "an outlier post" in respect of the disability posts; &ldquo;ongoing systemic failure&rdquo;, concern about repeated absences not followed up, &ldquo;The correspondence simply fell into the sand&rdquo;, &ldquo;a flawed approach" continued, &ldquo;a further missed opportunity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grace's case recedes again&rdquo;, &ldquo;no system at the time to stop cases from falling through the cracks&rdquo;, &ldquo;a fire brigade service&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grace&rsquo;s case goes into abeyance&rdquo;, &ldquo;sort of left up in the air&rdquo;, and, of course, Mrs. X&rsquo;s comment: &ldquo;over my dead body" would Grace leave, and then other missed opportunities and so it goes on. </p> <p> I will finish by paying tribute to the whistleblowers because without them, their courage and persistence, we would have no reports.  As one can see from most of the reports, they are to protect the system.  As has been outlined by Deputy McGuinness, the whistleblowers have suffered dreadfully and certainly, if we go by that, then nobody else is ever going to go come forward.  I join in his call to have a full and proper debate in here with the senior Minister on the two substantial interim reports that have been published and to seek an explanation as to why only five of the eight others are available.   I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his forbearance.</p></speech>

As Chairman of the Business Committee, the call for further debate on this matter is absolutely warranted and the call for regular debate, if that is what is required, to see this matter brought to a conclusion, is something that we would also need to pursue.</p>  <p>  I do not think that I have ever heard contributions similar to the ones that I have heard today.  Certainly the contributions from Deputies McGuinness, &Oacute; Cathasaigh and others would have left anyone with a heart deeply moved.  The challenge is now for us, as Members of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il, to do what the people elected us to do and to make sure that the vulnerable are protected and that this Chamber will collectively act to try to ensure that.  I know there is nobody more likely to support that than the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, whose personal courage in these matters is above reproach.  I ask that the Minister of State might try to address the matters raised.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that my opening statement was scant.  I do acknowledge that.  Perhaps it gives me the opportunity to address all of the issues that were raised.  I have to remind myself because sometimes I sail a little bit close to the wind in my commentary.  Today it is about the commission.</p>  <p>  At the outset, it is important - and this is for my benefit as much as it is for anybody else&rsquo;s, I remind the House - to say that I am mindful that this is an active commission of investigation.  As the commission is entirely independent in the conduct of its investigation, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the substance of the report at this time as I do not wish to interfere with or prejudice the commission&rsquo;s ongoing investigation.  However, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to address the comments of what my colleagues have brought up here on floor of the Chamber, if that is okay.</p>  <p>  Needless to say, I start by thanking the role of the whistleblower in this case and in the Brandon case.  I also acknowledge the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in keeping this right, front and centre.  I welcome the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s suggestion to have regular meetings.  Perhaps when we are discussing the Grace case and the Farrelly commission, we might look at the broader lens, whether it be historical or current reports.  I welcome that and I will engage at all times with anybody who wishes to have such meetings.  I thank the Business Committee for allowing this opportunity today.</p>  <p>  I completely agree with Deputy Shortall in her comments that justice delayed is justice denied.  I thank all Members again for their contributions.  It has been a very honest discussion and it is one that is needed at this juncture to remind us of what exactly the Farrelly commission is.  As Deputy Connolly has said, how many reports has it taken for us to get to the stage we are at now, which is not even at a halfway house, four years on?</p>  <p>  Deputy Connolly mentioned some figures on costs.  It is important for me to deal with that issue, which may answer some questions.  The Farrelly commission&rsquo;s costs to date are &euro;7,022,820.04.  This figure includes the commission&rsquo;s legal team, staff, administrative and accommodation costs and third-party legal costs.  This does not include the ward of court Grace&rsquo;s costs, which were &euro;442,000.  There is a sum there in between.</p>  <p>  There is no denying that the work of the commission is taking longer than it should.  I have to acknowledge the support I received from my senior Minister, Deputy Donnelly, at both of the meetings that I have had with the Farrelly commission to try to ensure that we are moving this along and that it is not just left on a shelf and sitting idly by without terms of accountability arising from it.  I myself am incredibly disappointed that after this length of time, we cannot bring it to a conclusion because I sat on the benches opposite here demanding that we would have accountability and transparency and that it is not all about a system.</p>  <p>  People are paid to do a job and they should do that job right.  That is the accountability that I talk about.  While there have been system failures, which I accept, at the end of the day, no different to the way in which I am held to account for the job that I do, as are all the Deputies present, people in roles of responsibilities need to be held to that accountability too.  We should not be stonewalled by report after report after report to ensure that the truth is not told.</p>  <p>  Why do I refer to the Brandon report today?  The reason I spent time on the Brandon report is that one has to look at the similarities and at the timeline on it.  It started in 2016 and I can tell the House that the result of this report and the NIRP is absolutely brilliant.  It has all of the answers in 77 pages.  We need to be able to see that because one does not have 77 pages but one has 800 pages and does not have transparency, accountability or the various bodies either under that microscope.  If we cannot solve and fix it, how can we move on as a State?  That is where we need to get to, the underbelly of where it is going wrong.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked me a very clear question there.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows, I am one to answer a straight question when I am asked one.  He asked me clearly if there are more NIRPs.  The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  He asked me how many and there are two.  He asked me which CHO they were in and they are in CHO 5.  We have not got to the bottom of that in itself.  It is still ongoing.  Me laying that out here today has in itself its own ripple effects because it is in disability.  One can go from Donegal to Kilkenny to Waterford and these are all different organisations.</p> <p>We need to know exactly how to understand a person who has intellectual disabilities and is non-verbal in the care of the State.  We are all responsible for the administration and care of our most vulnerable people.  We have to know that the system works.  We have to have confidence in it.  The staff need reassurance that the systems they are working in and the services they are providing are of the highest standards and protect our most vulnerable at all times, from the early years into adulthood and day care, and adult residential and respite services.  That is important and I will not stop until I get the Brandon report published. <br/><br/>The publication of the Brandon report sets a very clear lens as to our expectation of all reports going forward.  I was not in this role when the commission was set up.  I did not set the rules of engagement.  That does not mean that I will not hold it to account, get it published and will not have continuous engagement with the commission's inquiry to ensure that the report is published.  My thoughts are also with the other 46 people because this is not just about Grace.  Forty-six other people have to be thought about, in terms of the impacts and implications for them and their families.  Where were their voices and advocacy?  The question we need to know is whether there was advocacy.  That is the most important question.<br/><br/>I want to address a few other things.  It was stated that nobody thought it was fit to ask why, nobody spoke up for her, Grace was failed and Grace cannot speak and was intellectual non-verbal.  My thoughts are also with the other 46 affected who were then children and are now adults.  I agree that those responsible need to be held to account.  I wish to reiterate some of the words that were said.  I was asked when will Brandon report will be published.  I was initially told that we would have an interim executive summary within 28 days of when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote the first letter.  I am now led to believe that it will be within 56 days of the first letter.  Either way, I was heartened to hear the Minister, Deputy Coveney, today call for its full publication.  I am heartened by the support of the Taoiseach on the publication of the Brandon report. <br/><br/> Deputy Berry asked whether I am confident there will be a final report next June.  I have to be honest.  I am not because it has taken us four years to get this far.  I would love to think that it would be concluded by June but if I stood here and said that I would be misleading him because I have seen how hard was to get to the publication of the interim report.  I have to thank the Attorney General for his support in the publication of the two substantive interim reports. <br/><br/>The legislation on safeguarding and accountability needs to be enacted as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is doing an awful lot on that.  I want to thank Deputy Connolly for bringing together the steps of all the other reports that laid the bedrock to eventually have a commission and for understanding the timeline involved.  There was a report about a report, but there was never action for Grace.  I never felt that any of that was about Grace.  Rather, it was about protecting the State rather than the State protecting Grace.  Until such time as we put every Grace at the centre of our conversation and persons with disabilities have their rights vindicated under the UN optional protocol, we are doing a disservice to people with disabilities. <br/><br/>That is as much as I can say on all of the matters raised, but I will be very open to coming before the House at any stage on this.  The structure was unfortunate, but we are where we are.  We need to ensure that full publication in a speedy manner happens, and I will not be found short in wanting to ensure that happens.</p></speech>

It is not that there is not merit in most of them, it is that most are not connected to one another.  It will make our road traffic legislation even more complicated.  I know the Minister of State is aware of that particular issue.</p><p>Last week this was pulled from the draft schedule.  Obviously the Bill had not been completed.  It has all of the hallmarks of something that is rushed and yet it contains some important things.  I believe a lot of amendments will be brought forward on Committee Stage and I understand the Minister of State herself may well bring forward amendments on some aspects.</p><p>Our road traffic legislation was incomprehensible even before this Bill.  This Bill makes it worse.  How exactly does the Minister of State expect members of the Garda to do their job and enforce road traffic laws when the Department appears to be determined to make them more difficult to understand?  We have a responsibility to ensure that the laws that we pass in this House are comprehensible, not just to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Law Library but to every citizen.  How many people would go to this Bill to look for some of the things that are in it? </p><p>When it comes to road traffic legislation, we have failed in this regard.  At the same time, I want to acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to consolidating the Road Traffic Acts which, I am sure, is a mammoth task.  She might address that issue when she sums up.  When are we likely to see that?  Will be during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il?  It is needed.  The last thing we want is the law being circumvented by people who can get around things through technicalities in our courts system.  We need clear, consolidated legislation.  </p><p>In the first instance, I want to start almost at the back of the Bill.  I want to draw attention to section 45, which, as I understand it, will provide An Bord Plean&aacute;la with the power to override local authorities and local development plans.  The amendment states:</p> <blockquote> 	An Bord Plean&aacute;la shall approve a scheme, or a proposed road development, that contravenes materially any development plan or any local area plan (within the meaning of the Act of 2000) only if it considers that one of the following is the case ... the (proposed) development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development (scheme) is concerned ... the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the transport strategy made under section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the regional spatial and economic strategy for the area, guidelines under section 28 of the Act of 2000, policy directives under section 29 of the Act of 2000, the statutory obligations of any local authority in the area, and any relevant policy of the Government, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage or any Minister of the Government ... [T]he scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the pattern of development, and planning permissions granted, in the area since the making of the development plan. </blockquote>  <p>It seems to me that captures, or potentially captures, an awful lot.</p> <p>I can think of a couple of road proposals that are very controversial and are likely to fall exactly within the terms of this provision.  For example, there is a park between Lucan and Leixlip, St. Catherine's Park, that is jointly managed by three local authorities.  There is a proposal, and it was even published yesterday as part of the Dublin transport strategy, to put a dual carriageway through the middle of the park.  There will be many people lying down in front of bulldozers if that happens.  If the local authorities are going to be cut out of the decision-making on this, people would have a right to ask: what is the point of local government?  Another proposed road in my constituency has failed twice through the Part 8 process.  It is judged to be in the wrong place by the residents in the area.  Do they count for anything?</p> <p> The Minister of State might elaborate on why this provision ended up in this legislation in the first instance.  Why is it not in a planning and development legislative measure, where one would expect to see it, rather than in this road traffic legislation, and a very miscellaneous legislative measure at that?  If we are to build confidence among the public, people need clarity.  A debate in the Seanad has just started on new legislation relating to the replacement of strategic housing developments.  I remember when the legislation on strategic housing developments was being debated in this House.  I told the House that the legislation would end up in the courts because if one removed the ability to appeal a decision and if one bypassed the local authorities there was only one place the legislation would go.  That is exactly what happened.  It is very important that we pay attention to the mistakes that have been made.  This section should be deleted from the Bill.  It is not properly positioned in the legislation and I would like to hear an elaboration on why it was included in the first place or what were the circumstances or perhaps some examples as to why it was included.</p> <p> There are a number of provisions in the legislation relating to e-scooters.  One can either ban them or legislate for them.  I believe we should legislate for them, but that does not happen without significant issues.  I am quite sure the Minister of State is more than aware of that.  E-scooters typically travel at approximately 20 km/h and have a range of between 15 km and 25 km between charges.  They do not require the same licensing, insurance and tax considerations as motorbikes.  There is no doubt that legalising and regulating the use of e-scooters have been necessary for a long time.  E-scooters have been a common feature on the roads in our cities and towns, using the cycle lanes.  If one is using one, which I would be terrified to do, it is very difficult to know where is the safest place to do so.  They are probably an important component of moving people away from cars and giving them an ability to move around quite quickly, but questions remain about exactly how they will be regulated and who will regulate them.</p> <p> When this legislation is passed, there are over a dozen firms lined up who are interested in providing e-scooter rentals.  These rental companies have caused a great deal of chaos on the streets of other European and American cities due to the rental scooters being just left behind on footpaths and so forth.  For people with disabilities, people with visual impairments and people who are not fast on their feet to get out of the way, it is a big issue of concern that e-scooter users would mingle with people on footpaths.  How do we plan to regulate, and who will regulate, the industry?  We cannot make the same mistakes that have been made elsewhere.  E-scooters do not have a licence plate.  Who carries the liability?  Does the renter carry the liability if somebody gets injured, including the person who is using the e-scooter?  How does one identify it and how realistic is for members of the Garda to be able to deal with an incident where they cannot identify the vehicle that has been used?  What consideration has been given to the examples from other European cities where there have been problems?  While there are fewer accidents with e-scooters because there are not as many of them as there are bicycles, when accidents occur they tend to be more serious.  There is quite an amount of information and I have more questions regarding how the regulation will work in practice than I have answers.</p> <p> The Minister of State said that the Government intends to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to allow asylum seekers to access driver licences.  That is a welcome development.  It has been called for over many years by asylum seekers, human rights groups and several Members of the Oireachtas.  The delay in affording driver licences to asylum seekers has caused more hardship than has been necessary.  It has added to the hardship.  Direct provision centres are often in isolated locations and not having the ability to drive has been an impediment to getting work, bringing children to school, socialising and so forth, so it is very important.  There was a court case recently and I do not understand why it appears that the State was fighting that court case and objecting against the National Driver Licence Service while at the same time there were plans to deliver this in legislation.  I do not understand why that would be the case.  In 2018, the then Minister for Transport, Mr. Shane Ross, stated that he had received legal advice that it was possible to issue driver licences to asylum seekers, so why did the State contest that case?  It does not make sense that it was not just regularised in legislation rather than fighting it through the courts.  That would have been costly and it was going to be remedied in this way anyway.</p> <p> Deputy Gannon will deal with the issue of scramblers, which is incredibly important for many people.  It is welcome that they are being legislated for here.  Many issues will be raised with regard to the regulation of those as well.</p></speech>

One matter that is a huge concern in constituencies such as mine and in those of other Deputies is the issue of scrambler bikes.  This has been discussed not only in this House but also in local authorities in search of a resolution.  I hope this Bill brings some resolution to this serious issue but there will have to be amendments made on Committee Stage for that to happen.  There will have to be broader engagement with the Garda and other sectors on some peculiar aspects of the law, regulation and enforcement with regard to scrambler bikes.</p>  <p>  Scrambler and quad bikes have been discussed at length in the political and media arenas, including their association with antisocial behaviour, their use for purposes of intimidation and the risk associated with them.  It is hoped this Bill will finally enable us to deal adequately with them when they are used dangerously.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill.  However, the fear is that no resources are being invested in this area.  There is just the risk of the stick without understanding what that will look like.  We all have stories from both ourselves and our constituents regarding scrambler and quad bikes.  The stories are tragic in many ways.  I am reminded of a story from my constituency on Christmas Day in 2014 when a young man lost his life.  There are other harrowing stories about scrambler bikes coming over hills and landing on top of people in parks in Santry.  There have been other issues in Tolka Park.  They are significantly dangerous issues, creating the potential for antisocial behaviour.  There is so much fear for people in the parks that we hope we can get to grips with this issue.</p> <p>No one buys a scrambler bike for a child in the belief that they will get hurt.  Some people want to use scrambler bikes safely but we need to create the conditions in which that can happen.  I am conscious that 41% of those killed or injured in collisions involving quad bikes or scramblers on a public road between 2014 and 2019 were 18 years or younger.</p> <p> The measure in the Bill specifying where it is lawful for scramblers and quad bikes to drive will help ensure the safety of the public, as well as users of these vehicles many of whom are not engaged in antisocial behaviour and do not maliciously intend to cause harm.  However, we need more procedures and best practice for these vehicles.  The Bill mentions strengthening the powers of the Garda, but has the Minister engaged with the Garda to see if the issue is only related to the extent of the power that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has when it comes to scramblers and quad bikes?  I am wondering about the level of engagement with the Department of Justice.</p> <p> All of us have contacted the Garda about scramblers and quad bikes.  Invariably we are told that garda&iacute; cannot chase young people on these bikes for obvious reasons.  How in practice will members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seize scramblers and quad bikes?  That is the biggest factor in scramblers and quad bikes being such a long-standing issue in communities, and it is one the Bill does not yet adequately address.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could provide any practical information on how the stopping and seizing of these vehicles will take place.  I am not sure if that is even within the remit of the Bill at this time.  It will require best practice and evidence.  It will require alternative places for where young people can use these scrambler bikes.  Unless we have that I am not hopeful.</p> <p> As my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy said, we also need clarity on the powers of An Bord Plean&aacute;la potentially to bypass local or county development plans for roads as a result of this Bill.  I sat on Dublin City Council for six years, some of that time alongside the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mitchell.  Last night Dublin City Council introduced its city development plan.  More than 300 amendments were made to that development plan over the last three days and yet we are told that An Bord Plean&aacute;la can simply bypass city or county development plans at the stroke of a pen, which fundamentally undermines the very concept of local government and local democracy.</p> <p> As we argue the merits and demerits of the Bill, I cannot help thinking how it will further erode local authority structures.  What was the point of the level of engagement by counsellors on Dublin City Council in passing that local development plan with its 300 amendments if we are simply going to bypass it?  What was the point of giving them authority but then taking it away?  That needs to be addressed substantively not only at committee level but potentially through legislation.  Those city and county development plans must matter or else the very concept of local government is further eroded, which is a real shame.  We should not further compound it through this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100041#RR00200"><p>Sometimes in this Chamber we face deep levels of frustration and I wonder whether we are making any progress on the issues before us.  Today is not one of those days.  While this is a very wide-ranging Bill that in many ways will help us meet some of our key climate action targets, I want to focus on the amendments relating to scrambler bikes.  The term Teachta D&aacute;la, messenger of the people, is an interesting phrase because who knows what messages were sent here from the people?  We meet many people during an election campaign and hear about many issues.  All of us know the things we were sent here to try to fix.  The issue of scrambler bikes was one that I was sent here to resolve.  I am very pleased to see the amendments to the Bill which go a long way to changing national policy on this issue and solving the issue on the ground.</p>  <p>  Last year, I was deeply disappointed that despite it being part of the programme for Government, replies that I initially received from the Department appeared to be very similar to replies provided for the best part of a decade, suggesting that there was no obligation to have new laws, that there were issues with the definition of a public place and the belief that the Garda already had sufficient powers.</p>  <p>  It is said that success can have many mothers and fathers.  It is important to acknowledge the people who helped us to get this across the line.  It starts with the Taoiseach, who at an early stage identified this as an issue similar to the issue of joyriding in the 1980s and 1990s in Cork.  He realised that it would not be solved by one measure, but by a range of measures.  I thank Deputy Lahart for the work he did and for allowing me to co-sign the Bill.  After that Bill was introduced, the Taoiseach convened a meeting of a Cabinet subgroup attended by the Ministers of State, Deputies Naughton and James Browne, and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, before she took her short leave, and their officials.  It became clear that the support of the Attorney General would be needed in addressing the legal issues.  I am grateful for the work of those in the Office of the Attorney General, without which we would not have these amendments.  I am also grateful for the willingness of the Department of Transport to grasp this nettle and solve the issue.</p>  <p>  What does the Bill do?  It introduces fundamental and substantial changes to the law.  It grants powers to garda&iacute; on the ground.  That sends a message to those in the constituency I represent and many others.  For ten years people attending safety forums have been saying they cannot understand why garda&iacute; could not respond to this issue.  When a scrambler bike tore up and down the road with innocent families on the road terrified and their children in danger, when communities and sports clubs despaired over delayed matches or when shoppers saw someone doing a wheelie on the main street in Finglas village or elsewhere, they could not understand why nobody was doing anything about this.  The belief was that nobody cared.  Today we are saying that we very much care and that these laws will resolve the issue.</p>  <p>  The Bill introduces a new category of vehicle, a new offence, a new power to seize and dispose and a new obligation to reclaim from the District Court rather than from the Garda station.  Other Deputies have rightly identified the issue of interception as being key.  That was what put people in danger.  It put the garda&iacute; pursuing these vehicles in danger.  It put the children who should not be driving these vehicles at their age in danger and it also put innocent people in the vicinity in danger.  The decision to give the powers to the Garda to seize a vehicle from the curtilage of the property means that garda&iacute; now only need to follow the vehicle at a safe distance and when the vehicle is on that property, it can be seized.  That is fundamental and will prevent people dying in order for us to solve this problem.  It will also deal very toughly with those people who purchase and use illegal scrambler bikes thereby endangering their neighbours and friends in their community.</p>  <p>  While I was very tough on resolving the scrambler bike issue, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, was very keen to introduce a measure for young people engaged in this activity.  I have been involved in youth work for years - long before I was involved in politics.  I was pleased with the Minister of State's commitment because I was very focused on the legal changes, but he introduced a new scheme which I understand many local groups in my area and other areas have applied for.  Funding will be put in place to resolve this issue.</p>  <p>  As I said, success can have many mothers and fathers.  I acknowledge the Deputies in this Chamber, including my constituency colleagues and many other people, who have continued to raise this issue.  On this side of the House, we have had the ability and opportunity to make this change because we are in government and we have access to Ministers and their officials.  I take nothing from the commitment of other Deputies who have been speaking about this issue for many years.  In a short time during the term of this Government, we have managed to resolve this issue.  It is now over to the Garda to administer it.</p>  <p>  I ask Members to do everything they can to get at least this portion of the Bill across the line because communities out there really need it.  They should do everything they can to ensure the Bill is dealt with as quickly as possible and that it gets to the President's desk and is signed so that communities throughout the country know that not just this Government but also this House understand this issue and we are willing to do it.  If we send that message, there is an opportunity for the Government to deal with the many other issues in our community, such as open drug dealing, unemployment and dereliction.</p> <p>There are many challenges outlined in the programme for Government and this is an example of how committed both my party and the other parties in government are to resolving some of these long-standing matters that have been spoken about for too long and on which there has been too little action.  Today is a good day to be a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1470" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100042#SS00200"><p>I introduced legislation similar to this on several occasions over the past five years to tackle the problem of illegal use of quads and scramblers.  It was opposed by this and previous Governments supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  On each occasion the Attorney General was indicated to have opposed it so what has happened since?  How many deaths and injuries could have been avoided if the legislation had been implemented?</p>  <p>  The most consistent area of use of scramblers has been in parks and green spaces, particularly in and around housing estates.  We have always argued for and given our support to measures that would strengthen Garda powers to seize scramblers and quad bikes being used illegally.  I welcome such additional powers proposed in this legislation.  A very successful pilot scheme was run in Finglas that led to the seizure of up to 60 scramblers.  The scheme has since been discontinued and garda&iacute; are being instructed not to pursue scramblers.  The closing of this pilot scheme should be reconsidered, with proper specialist training provided for garda&iacute; and the use of appropriately powered motorbikes.</p>  <p>  There are significant gaps in law with regard to electric scooters.  I should point that this is not about punishing electric scooter users but rather the putting in place of proper protection and rules for the safe use of these scooters.  Serious consideration must be given to a number of matters when operating such vehicles.  For example, there must be a requirement to wear a helmet and high-visibility clothing.  There must be proper lights on the vehicle, along with proper insurance and registration of the scooter.  An age requirement for the driving of an electric scooter should be imposed and there should be speed limits for the vehicle.</p>  <p>  Under existing legislation it is illegal to use an electric scooter.  As this legislation progresses, there will be opportunities on Committee Stage to scrutinise their use in more detail and we will look to making such amendments where necessary.  It is important that electric scooters should not be used on footpaths as they are a potential danger to those with visual impairment or disability.  These scooters are currently classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, which requires them to be insured, taxed and licensed if used in a public place.  This means all such vehicles being used now in public places are being used illegally.</p>  <p>  In both Germany and Belgium, electric scooters are licensed and insured.  We may need another category of licence for these vehicles.  These scooters should only be used by one person, even if two people do not exceed the permissible total weight for the scooter.  There are proposals in the legislation that they should not be used in pedestrianised areas, national roads or on motorways, and these have merit.  However, I question the 30 km/h maximum speed limit for the vehicles.  In Germany, for example, the maximum limit is 20 km/h.  I also have difficulty with the lack of provisions for compulsory safety equipment such as helmets, contradicting the advice of both the Road Safety Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which wants such equipment to be mandatory when operating such vehicles.  It is the law in other European countries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100042#SS00300"><p>On the point made by Deputy Ellis about the mandatory wearing of helmets, it has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions - Australia is a case in point - that when we make the wearing of helmets mandatory, particularly with cycling, the participation rate drops.  Dublinbikes is a great example of a micromobility solutions and much of that comprises incidental use.  We really want people to feel comfortable stepping up to electric scooters or bicycles to use them.  What we really need to focus on is making the environment safe for people to do so.  The majority of injuries and fatalities from bicycle usage involves collision with a vehicle, and I am not entirely convinced a piece of Styrofoam on my head will prevent injury being caused by an 18-wheel lorry.</p>  <p>  I find myself somewhere between Deputies McAuliffe and Catherine Murphy in my assessment of the Bill.  I am not quite as enthusiastic as Deputy McAuliffe but I certainly do not see it anyway as bad as how it was painted by Deputy Murphy.  It is important work that will bring about many of the programme for Government commitments that we wanted to see, particularly around unlocking sustainable transport modes.  That is my view in any case.  I welcome the assurance we will have consolidation of the road traffic laws once we have this Bill passed through the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I will start my consideration of specific provisions with electric bikes and scooters and micromobility provision.  I wonder whether we have gone far enough.  Electric bikes are very important for unlocking sustainable transport options and we have seen much research in the Dutch context in particular.  These allow people to travel further and use bikes later in their lives, which has all sorts of attendant benefits around health etc.</p>  <p>  I wonder about the adaptation kits that we see many food delivery drivers using, for example, and whether the legislation goes far enough to cover that.  We speak about "pedal-assist" only, for example.  It would be a difficult enforcement task to ask the police on the street to decide if something is a pedal-assist electric bike or one that does not require pedal-assist.</p>  <p>  The electric scooters question is interesting.  Research indicates they do not tend to displace car journeys but instead they tend to displace walking journeys.  There is still certainly value in them when it comes to micromobility around cities, in particular.  I am interested in looking at research on this, particularly use of demographics, specifying who uses electric scooters and what they use them for.  It is something important to consider, particularly in light of the concerns raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy around clutter if we see the rental model coming in that we have seen in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  I have a slight issue in the Bill with the question of providing for only one rider either of a electric scooter or bikes in general.  When I was growing up, it was giving somebody a "backer".  In the Dutch context they call it "dinking", which is a slightly nicer way of saying it.  I have seen many people riding electric scooters "two up", as they call it, particularly young girls.  We might miss this in legislation or are content to see it, as the Dutch do, "through fingers", which means they kind of choose to ignore it.  Again, it may create an enforcement problem.  Do we really want garda&iacute; to stop two girls travelling down the road on an electric scooter?  Perhaps we do.  We should certainly consider that in the Bill.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the regulation of scramblers and quads and this is overdue.  This is a major safety concern.  Other Deputies have spoken more to the specific matter but I will refer briefly to the use of kissing gates.  Never was a term less well applied as there is nothing romantic at all about kissing gates unless a person is kissing goodbye a friend on a cargo bike who cannot go through, or children in a double buggy who cannot go through or somebody on a mobility device who cannot fit through.  As we are planning more sustainable and active transport and travel corridors, we must ensure they are fit for all those people.  In particular, those reliant on mobility devices must be able to use segregated and safe infrastructure that is in place for them.</p>  <p>  There is an omission from the Bill and I will consider tabling an amendment on Committee Stage.  It relates to a reporting structure for close passes, which we have seen operating in other jurisdictions.  If a person is subject to a close and dangerous pass on a bicycle, whether it is by a car, bus, truck or whatever, he or she should be able to use a video device, if one is being used, to make a report.  There is value in that.  The question has been asked whether people could falsify videos.</p> <p>One role of a judge is to weigh up the evidence and make a finding based on the validity of that evidence.  If we make a provision in the law that allows people to provide video evidence to prove instances of close passes in particular, I am confident the courts would be able to deal with, and it is a provision for which cycling advocacy groups have been pushing for.</p> <p> I refer to the whole area of autonomous vehicles.  Instead of considering driverless cars, I would prefer if we were discussing carless drivers and if people could get around their cities without the use of a car, be it autonomous, electric or whatever.  We should consider other mobility solutions that do not involve a car.  I am concerned about the provision of test beds for autonomous cars.  The technology is improving, however, I do not believe it is sufficient as of yet.  I worry deeply about beaconing which involves people tagging their locations.  While this may not be included in the provisions of the Bill, it is certainly something we will have to consider in the future.  We should not have to tag ourselves within a setting so that autonomous vehicles do not strike us.  We should certainly not have to beacon our children.  I am also concerned about the data gathering required for test beds.  Who will have access to that data and to what extent will we give our data to the creators of this technology, allowing them to gather that data within an urban environment?  This is an area we should consider in more detail.</p></speech>

It includes many sensible provisions.  The issue of scramblers has been raised often and it is a big problem in our urban areas and needs to be addressed.  The Bill also deals with the issue of insurance.  I am concerned with the slow pace of reform in this regard.  Some progress has been made, although there are significant issues outstanding.  Insurance companies in this State continue to rip off their customers.  Costs are extortionate.  Companies still use dual-pricing to target loyal and vulnerable customers who are charged premiums higher than the real cost of their policy.  It is not right that insurance companies continue to be a law unto themselves.  There is a need for firm legislative action to curb these sharp practices that cause people significant hardship, make businesses unviable, in some instances, put community organisation under pressure and keep young people off the road.  Legislation that would ban this dual-pricing practice has been brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, but the Government continues to block it.  I urge the Minister of State to address that issue as soon as possible and to work with Deputy Doherty on this.  The Government's Bill would reduce insurance costs for customers by precisely 0 cent in my estimation.  The Government needs to work with Deputy Doherty's Bill.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise the issue of driver tests, which is contained in the Bill.  I note with concern the point raised by Deputy Sherlock yesterday about the fear some driver test instructors may be laid off.  I find that hard to comprehend because the backlog of people waiting for a driver test has yet to be cleared.  This has a major impact on people's ability to go about their lives, in particular, young people in rural areas or elsewhere who rely on a driver licence for independence.  This issue is costing people money and their jobs.  While the length of waiting times have reduced to some extent, they are still very long.</p>  <p>  When discussing road safety, some of the biggest issues are localised and relate to the condition of footpaths, pedestrian crossings and other road safety measures such as speed ramps, etc.  The purpose of this debate is not to discuss specific road junctions, but we have a systemic problem that applies to every local authority.  It is not the case that one local authority is doing a great job and the rest are not.  Most local authorities find it difficult to ensure the safety of pedestrians by introducing the measures they want, which is frustrating for local communities.  I refer to the condition of roads and footpaths and the places where pedestrian crossings are required.  They often come up against the obstacle of inadequate local government funding.  This issue must be urgently addressed.  These are the bread and butter issues that affect people's lives.  It is an uphill battle to get traffic calming measures in place throughout the State.  This is not only an issue in my constituency but everywhere, and it is caused by underfunding of local government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100043#TT00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak today.  I raised the issue of electric scooters on Leaders' Questions recently.  This issue is becoming more serious as more electric scooters are used on our footpaths and roads.  At present, electric scooters are not regulated in Ireland, with no specific law covering their use.  They are considered mechanically propelled vehicles which should mean if they are used in public places, the user must hold a licence and insurance.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill today, which will create a new classification in law of powered personal transporters, which will include electric scooters, and will legally allow their use in public places.  The Bill will classify electric scooters as powered personal transporters with a minimum design speed of 6 km/h and a maximum speed of not more than 25 km/h.  Local authorities will be afforded the power to set a lower speed limit of 20 km/h for electric scooters on specific roads.  I note it would be an offence under the Bill to supply an electric scooter to a person under the age of 16 years and to drive an electric scooter while using a mobile phone or entertainment equipment.  It would also be an offence for anyone travelling on an e-scooter to carry another person.</p>  <p>  I welcome many of these provisions introduced in this Bill, but I also have a number of questions.  Many e-scooters in use at present can travel at speeds in excess of 25 km/h.  How will the introduction of these laws affect these devices?  I have seen electric scooters travel at speeds in excess of 25  km/h on our roads and footpaths.  The use of electric scooters has become increasingly popular in Ireland.  This is evident in Dundalk, where it is common to see electric scooters on our roads and footpaths.  It is one of the most frequently raised issues in my constituency offices.  Many people, particularly pensioners, are concerned about the safety of these devices and the fact they can travel so quickly on our footpaths.  It is clear their use is an accident waiting to happen.  Somebody will be seriously injured our worse.  I take no issue with electric scooters once they are used in a responsible manner with other road and footpath users respected.  The major issue I envisage with the use of electric scooters is that in many instances users do not respect the rules of the road.  We often see users of electric scooters travel through red lights or cut across traffic in towns, thereby putting other road users and pedestrians in danger.  The use of electric scooters should be classified in the same way as the use of motorbikes under the cubic capacity of 50 cc and the same rules and regulations should therefore apply.</p>  <p>  Far too often, the users of e-scooters have no understanding of the rules of the road.  There must be a form of driver licence required to ride an electric scooter.  Let us consider the situation in which a person on an electric scooter travelling on a road approaches a pedestrian crossing.  In theory, the person must stop to allow another electric scooter user to cross the road.  Insurance should be required to use electric scooters in public places or roads.  If an electric scooter user hits a pedestrian on a footpath or on the road and causes him or her serious injury, who would be at fault for insurance purposes?  How would the injured party be protected in this circumstance?  If an electric scooter hits and damages a motor vehicle, how would the motor vehicle owner receive compensation for the damage done to his or her car?  These are questions that need clarification.  One can be sure these issues will arise and major problems will emerge as a result.  The bottom line is that scooters travelling at 25 km/h have to potential to cause serious damage to other people and vehicles, while not required to have insurance.  This is an issue we must address.</p>  <p>  I note it will be an offence to supply an electric scooter to anyone under the age of 16 years, which again leads to many questions.  To get around this obstacle, parents or other adults might buy the scooters.  Will the parents who buy these scooters for under 16-year-olds be held responsible?  Will this also be an offence for a child under 16 years?</p> <p>One only has to look to any second-level school in the evening to see how many pupils are using electric scooters.  Not all of these users are over the age of 16.  What will happen to them now?  Clarity is needed.  Another issue that needs clarification is the proposed offence of using an electric scooter while using a phone or entertainment equipment.  The vast majority of the users of these scooters usually wear headphones of some sort.  This is a major distraction and should not be allowed.  People who are riding an electric scooter and using headphones at the same time cannot be fully aware of their surroundings.  Will it now be an offence to wear headphones while using an e-scooter?  </p> <p> I welcome the introduction of the provision making it an offence for users of electric scooters to carry another person.  I have seen two people on the same scooter many times and to say that this is reckless is an understatement.  Travelling at speeds of up to 25 km/h with two people on an e-scooter is extremely dangerous not only to the users, but to other road users and pedestrians.</p> <p> I welcome the fact that we are finally getting around to introducing legislation to address the use of electric scooters.  There are still too many questions to be answered.  The Minister for Transport stated recently: "These proposals in the Bill should be seen as part of our wider efforts to encourage alternative forms of mobility, reduce our culture of reliance on the private car and open opportunities for active and healthy travel."  While I agree with this statement in principle, we must not allow travel to become more dangerous.  If we do not introduce proper rules and regulations regarding the use of e-scooters, this will happen.  The use of e-scooters will not encourage safer driving.  In fact, the opposite may be the case.   </p> <p> A number of areas need to be looked at more closely.  A licensing system should be in place to show that users of e-scooters have an understanding of the rules of the road.  It is simply not right that people with no previous experience of the road can use an e-scooter that has the potential to travel at speeds of up to 25 km/h without demonstrating that they have knowledge of the rules of the road.  Insurance should be mandatory.  How can we have a system in which one set of road users are legally obliged to have insurance while another set, the users of e-scooters and similar vehicles, are not?  As I said earlier, who is responsible for the damage caused by e-scooters?  </p> <p> A Dutch company called Dott, which supplies e-scooter services in 16 cities, has stated that various measures should be implemented for users of e-scooters.  These include the introduction of a minimum age of 16 and an upper speed limit of 25 km/h, a ban on the use of e-scooters on footpaths and mandatory insurance.  I am pleased that some of these measures are being addressed but the most important ones are not being addressed, that is, insurance and the use of e-scooters on footpaths.</p> <p> It is important that we also discuss the enforcement of these new regulations.  How exactly will they be enforced?  If a group of teenagers, all under the age of 16, leave school on their e-scooters, will An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be in a position to enforce the law?  There will be many instances in which these regulations with regard to e-scooters are broken.  The law will simply be unenforceable.  We need to be aware of this and provide realistic solutions.</p> <p> I will quickly comment on the other measures being introduced in this Bill.  I welcome the introduction of laws to deal with the dangerous and antisocial use of scramblers and quad bikes.  I also welcome the amendment to existing legislation to provide a robust underpinning for the motor insurance database, which will go towards combating the issue of uninsured drivers.  The strengthening of the link between driver licensing and vehicle ownership records will enhance law enforcement capabilities with regard to traffic offences.</p></speech>

I agree with previous speakers that its contents will make a significant improvement in a number of areas that affect road users across the State.  This Bill deals with a number of different policy areas.  I will use my time to address some of the most significant issues.</p>  <p>  Crucially, this legislation will begin the process of regularising the use of electric scooters and certain electric bikes as well as providing for other forms of micromobility in the future.  As the Minister of State will be aware, in March of this year I introduced a Private Member's Bill to do just this.  I am pleased that she and the Government have acted on this issue.  This will result in safer roads.</p>  <p>  E-scooters and e-bikes are a common sight on our roads and streets across Ireland and have been for a number of years.  They provide a clean, sustainable and effective way of completing the last mile of a journey and provide people with an alternative means of getting from A to B.  Despite their frequent use and presence on our streets, they remain illegal.  Fine Gael has been active in pursuing legislation in this area both in the previous D&aacute;il, through myself, my former colleague, Noel Rock, and others, and in this D&aacute;il, with the assistance of the Minister of State.  The programme for Government set out an ambition for us to see the use of these vehicles legislated for and regulated.  The introduction of the Bill will be a positive day for many users of e-scooters and e-bikes and for the businesses involved in their sale.  The creation of a new class of vehicle in this Bill will see e-bikes and e-scooters no longer classified as mechanically propelled vehicles but rather as personal powered transporters, PPTs.  Importantly, the Bill will give the Minister the ability to address future technologies and micromobility options under this category of vehicle, allowing us to be more proactive and less reactive in this field of transport.  We are currently confined under the Roads Acts.  </p>  <p>  I am also pleased that the creation of the PPT category will see these vehicles exempt from requiring insurance, licensing, tax and registration.  They will be treated like bicycles, which are capable of far exceeding these vehicles' speeds.  We must regulate for the safe use of these vehicles but, in doing so, we should not create barriers to their use.  These vehicles are electric and environmentally friendly and provide people with a climate-responsible option for travelling across our cities, towns and villages.  </p>  <p>  I regularly speak in this House about the need to create a more environmentally-friendly society, which would not only benefit our personal health, but also reduce emissions and pollution and protect the planet, allowing us to pass on a healthy and habitable earth to our children and grandchildren.  This also offers great possibilities to Ireland and its people.  The green economy is a chance for Ireland to capture significant investment and attract international companies, while also developing global companies here at home.  Historians often remark that Ireland missed the Industrial Revolution and, in the time that followed it, swept away what remnants there were in respect of our railways.  In doing so, we missed the rewards of such development.  We are now in a position to be a leader in a new green industrial revolution, which has the potential to bring new levels of prosperity to our country while providing sustainable jobs for our people well into the future.  We can achieve this if we have the will and imagination to act.  By regulating and legislating for PPTs such as e-scooters and e-bikes, we can begin to foster growth in these companies, some of which are Irish or have expressed an interest in entering the Irish market, having been unable to do so to date.  Some of the companies that have their origins in Ireland started out in third-level institutions such as Dublin City University and University College Dublin.  </p>  <p>  There are, rightly, some concerns among the public regarding the safety of these vehicles.  Speed limitation devices, minimum age requirements for their use and offences relating to driving without consideration are all areas that should be considered in the context of this Bill.  Moreover, we should consider the role of ride-sharing companies and the place they will hold in the micromobility sector in Ireland in the not-too-distant future.  While yesterday evening the Minister of State rightly pointed out that the operation of these types of schemes will be managed by local authorities, we should consider what that means.  As has been mentioned, Ireland is behind the curve with regard to this technology when compared with our European partners.  This will allow us to learn from the mistakes of others and avoid the pitfalls they have experienced.  To this end, I believe that full harmonisation should take place in respect of ride-sharing schemes implemented by local authorities, which I presume will happen next year.  The NTA has a significant role to play in the process, setting out standards and requirements.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, any ride-sharing service should be geofenced.  This simply means that e-scooters and e-bikes must be returned to a specific and designated location by the user at the end of a journey.  This is not dissimilar to the way in which DublinBikes scheme, among others, operates.  Stands on our roads will be required as e-scooters, in particular, tend not to stand by themselves.  Experience in other jurisdictions shows that electric scooters do not stand on their own unless delivered with a stand, which is unlikely in a ride-sharing operation.  We do not want to see them lying about on the street.</p> <p>The introduction of geofencing will avoid this scenario.  One of my colleagues attended an Inter-Parliamentary Union, IPU, conference in Rome recently and told me e-scooters were all over the streets there, which shows some people are not learning from the experience of other jurisdictions.</p> <p> The distance these vehicles can travel greatly exceeds how far somebody might travel on a bicycle.  For instance, DublinBikes stations are limited to the area between the canals, whereas an electric scooter has the capacity to travel up to 30 km.  On that basis, consideration should be given, particularly in cities and counties where there are multiple local authorities, to designating one or two providers for that area, as opposed to local authorities approaching different organisations.  Accordingly, if I wanted to get on a scooter in Dublin city, whether at Bus&aacute;ras or Heuston Station, and travel to Howth, which I would be well able to do on an electric scooter, I could leave it in Howth.  That is why uniformity is required by local authorities and the NTA has a significant role to play in that regard.</p> <p> I had prepared a longer contribution but my time has expired.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has moved a number of motions and Bills on this topic in this D&aacute;il and previous D&aacute;ileanna and it is good the issue is finally being acted on.  Scramblers plague communities throughout Dublin Bay North and people are fed up.  They are sick of not being able to go out for a walk or go to the playground with their kids because of the noise pollution from these bikes going up and down their roads morning, noon and night.  People have been seriously injured when they have been involved in incidents with scramblers.  There have been countless cases of people ending up with life-changing injuries because of them.  Recently, in my constituency, a young mother was knocked down and remains seriously injured in Beaumont Hospital.  The vehicles are driven dangerously by people who do not have a licence and are not insured or even taxed.  I hope the Bill will change parents' attitudes and make them think twice about buying these bikes for their children at Christmas.  They are a danger to everybody and a scourge on our communities.  Enough is enough.  Our communities deserve better.</p>  <p>  I welcome section 5, which will create the offence of dangerous driving in any place and address some of the issues the Garda has had in securing successful prosecutions.  I welcome also section 11, which will allow the Minister to make other vehicles similar to scramblers fall under these new laws.  We need to ensure the Garda is resourced fully to tackle the scourge of these bikes in our communities.  As I said, people in my constituency are beyond tired of having to deal with this daily.  It is important people can go about their business without the fear of being injured or, worse, even ending up in hospital because of these bikes.</p>  <p>  The Bill has been a long time coming, but I am grateful, on behalf of my community, that the Government has finally realised the need for legislation on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100045#VV00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill to the House.  Many aspects of it are long overdue and need to be addressed, especially given we have to address spiralling transport emissions and the planning of the past 40 or 50 years that has led to car dependency and urban sprawl.  We urgently need to get people onto public transport, but it is difficult to provide high-frequency public transport when settlement is so dispersed.  The NTA recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member, and many Deputies from all parties expressed enthusiasm about investment in public transport and rail and bus services.</p>  <p>  The national development plan, whose review we recently launched, covers well the 2:1 split there will be in respect of investment in public transport versus new roads, along with considerable investment in active travel such as cycling, walking and safe routes to school.  While we try our best to get people out of cars and onto public transport, many of those journeys, before they step onto the train, the bus or whatever it may be, involve active travel, whether by walking or cycling to the train station or whatever the case may be.  That is where we have to focus our investment.  Our inter-town objectives, and what we want to do to get people to be able to travel between towns more easily, are good and solid and there is investment in that.  The issue is with intra-town travel, that is, where people try to get around their towns or children try to walk to school safely.  Many of our towns have become quite hostile for children to walk around.  I walk my children to school some mornings and it is dangerous for them.  Many of the roads are dangerous for them to cycle on and the footpaths in many of our towns are narrow and dangerous to walk on.  Many car drivers seem to think it is fine to keep the carriageway free but block the footpath.  I recall an Oireachtas committee meeting about this, when the Road Safety Authority stated it was considering a publicity campaign to promote keeping footpaths free of vehicles.  That is something we still have to aim for because it is a problem.</p>  <p>  The Bill will address e-scooters, which will be a significant part of that move to active travel.  As a transport mode, they are relatively easy to use, although I have had a go on an e-scooter and it does take a little practice.  I would recommend people not go full throttle straight away because it takes a little getting used to.  We need to introduce that legislation.  I have seen e-scooters travelling at varying speeds and with varying standards of construction.  Some of them look pretty flimsy.  The legislation will mean there will be guidelines on the legal use of these scooters, relating to where they can be used, who can use them, permitted speeds and so on, and that is critical.</p>  <p>  E-bikes, too, are incorporated into the legislation.  It is critical that we be agile in our legislation to accommodate technology as it improves.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh mentioned automated vehicles.  While they are not yet on the roads, we do not know how long it will be before they are.  It could be a decade before we see them on the roads or it could be much quicker than that, given technology moves so fast.  It is good that our legislation is agile, incorporating that aspect and allowing for that test bed and those opportunities in order that when technology advances, as it is doing and work is being done in that regard, our legislation will be there to cover it.  It is critical that we legislate for it.</p>  <p>  I do not know how many ordinary cycling or walking journeys might be replaced by e-scooters.  I would much rather see whether short car journeys of 2 km or 3 km, which cause so much congestion in our towns in the mornings, will be replaced by e-scooters, rather than them replacing the journeys of people who already cycle or walk, and that will be a challenge.  Throughout that switch, we need to provide safe infrastructure.  Whether we walk, cycle or use an e-scooter, we need safe infrastructure to be in place.  There is no doubt about that.</p>  <p>  Part of the Bill addresses the traffic management measures on the M50.  I have not driven on the M50 for quite a while because I now use the DART to get into and out of town but in my previous role I used the M50 frequently.  Driving on that motorway, there are points where, for no reason, the traffic just backs up and it creates unsafe circumstances as drivers try to weave in and out and save 30 m on their journey.</p> <p>It does create unsafe situations.  If we are putting measures in place that will slow traffic down, then there should be good advance warning that is happening to keep the traffic flowing.  People do not get as frustrated when they are in flowing traffic, even though they might be slowed down to 60 km/h or 80 km/h, or whatever it may be.  It is good safe traffic management and I welcome that aspect of the Bill as well.</p></speech>

There is a need for legislation to stop the misuse of these motorbikes and to deal with the scourge of these machines.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent on this issue right from the start.  My colleagues, Deputies Ellis and Munster, introduced legislation on this issue in previous stalls and a group that included myself and Deputy Paul Donnelly introduced legislation during this D&aacute;il.  It is needed, because in areas such as mine we have seen scramblers destroy public spaces and football pitches, resulting in matches having been called off.  We have also seen the other aspect of the harm these machines cause, with some high-profile incidents where people have been badly injured and, in some cases, killed by scrambler bikes.  We need robust legislation to stop this type of activity happening again because these machines are weapons in untrained hands.  As was also mentioned earlier, we have also seen unscrupulous gangsters and criminals using younger people on scramblers to transport drugs and money.  Legislation must be brought in to tighten up that aspect as well, and Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed such legislation in the past.  It has always been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so I am glad to see the Government taking heed of what we have introduced before.</p>  <p>  E-bikes are new and something I have seen around my area.  I have used them, not here, but when I was over in Brussels, in Belgium.  I found them convenient to get around.  We must have regulations in place, however, that will safeguard the people using the e-bikes and the public.  We must tease out details such as whether these machines can be used on roads, footpaths and cycle paths, where lights will be necessary and at what age they can be used.  All that kind of detail will have to be explored.</p>  <p>  I drive a hybrid car and I am conscious that new electric technology makes everything quieter.  People do not hear electric cars and e-bikes coming.  One of my constituents has a visually-impaired child and it used to be possible to let that child go out to play without any fear, because she could hear a car coming and get off the road.  There are not many cars on that road and she would be able to hear them.  One day, however, there was an electric car and it was not possible for her to hear it.  Nothing happened, thank God, but it could have.  I went to the local authority seeking to have signage put up to warn drivers coming down the road that there was a visually-impaired child there, but that was turned down.  Therefore, as well as requiring legislation on e-bikes, we must also ensure that the local authorities are resourced appropriately to allow them to put in protective measures in this regard.</p>  <p>  The extension of the Luas to Lucan was promised in 2008, but the report that came out this week stated that it could be 2031, at the earliest, before that happens.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I had a comprehensive transport study undertaken in and around the Lucan area.  Transport was one of the major issues that arose on the doorsteps when we were canvassing before the election.  BusConnects is coming, but that is not the panacea that will solve everybody&rsquo;s problems.  We must start looking outside the box regarding this issue, because BusConnects is only part of the solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100046#WW00300"><p>I concur with Deputy Ward regarding the necessity to regulate scramblers, etc.  When his Bill, or at least a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, was being debated in the House previously I raised the issue of regulating jet skis.  I appreciate that the regulation of jet skis is not something that belongs in a road traffic Bill, but nevertheless it is something that must be regulated because of the nuisance and the danger they can cause to humans and to livestock, especially when they are being used in areas not accustomed to them.  I raised this matter previously and it is something on which I would like the Government to bring forward legislation.</p><p>Regarding talking about what does not belong in a road traffic Bill, I concur with the previous contributor who spoke about how impenetrable our road traffic laws typically are.  They are impenetrable and that can be seen if we look at the consolidated legislation.  I know it is possible to look at the consolidated legislation on the website of the Law Reform Commission, LRC, but not everybody does.  Even as someone who has had the benefit of legal education and training, and many would say it was wasted on me, but nevertheless I had the benefit of it, I find it hard to read some of the legislation.  It is completely impenetrable to ordinary people and it is almost Byzantine in how it is put together.  There are amendments to amendments to amendments going all the way back to the Road Traffic Act 1961.  I am not sure that it is fit for purpose anymore.  When is all of this going to end?</p><p>Here is another amending Bill, which I think has 12 Parts, with 12 completely different amendments to the existing legislation.  They are completely disparate and unrelated, except in that they all relate to road traffic.  We must start to see consolidated legislation in this area at some stage.  There is a discussion concerning consolidated legislation in respect of the Health Act, but that is only by necessity because Ministers gave commitments that things would not be rolled over and now those things will be rolled over, so there must be consolidated legislation.  That is one reason to bring in consolidated legislation.  There is a better reason to do that than to help a Minister to keep his word in circumstances where he meant what he said but did not mean that the effect of the legislation would not be rolled over.  In that instance, the Minister meant that it would not be section 4 of the 2020 Act, for example, but section 8 of the 2021 Act, but it will do the same thing.  More importantly, however, the general point is that legislation must be coherent and accessible and our road traffic legislation is not.  That must be remedied.</p><p>I turn now to one specific Part, which I was surprised to see in the Bill.  I refer to Part 5, which regulates licences for driving instructors.  Section 18 in the Road Traffic Act 1968 provides for that.  Part 5 of this legislation, however, brings in a whole new grouping of persons who are automatically disqualified from holding a licence and a grouping of persons who are automatically disqualified for a period from holding a licence.  In that context, anybody who has committed murder or rape is disqualified for life from holding a licence to be a driving instructor.  I commend and praise anything that makes it safer for the public to receive driving instruction.  That goes without saying and I think we all do.  Murder and rape are heinous offences, and that also goes without saying, and I abhor and condemn such offences, and whatever other similar words one might want to use to describe such crimes.  </p><p>There is a sense, however, that people do the crime, do the time and then perhaps carry on with their lives afterwards.  Now, I do not know how many convicted murderers are driving instructors.  I suspect very few.  Convicted murderers are released on licence, and not just released after 12 years, and one of the conditions attached is that they never cannot enter a licensed premises thereafter.  I do not know whether that condition is policed.  The more important point in this respect, though, is that although there are many recidivist offenders in our criminal justice system and in our society, there is a very low incidence of people convicted of murder reoffending.  That fact should be borne in mind.</p><p>I am not making a cheap political point, but are some of the people released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, GFA, now driving instructors and, if so, have those people committed any offences since?  If they have not, then I would question the danger that people like them - just anybody else who has done their time and not committed any offences since - pose to society.  I dare say it is relatively low and perhaps lower than that posed by many others, yet these people are being automatically disqualified from doing anything.  It is a novel step in our criminal justice system.  This measure is contained in a Road Traffic Act, but it is effectively a consequence of a criminal offence and something we should think about and tease out regarding whether we want it.  </p><p>To take an example from abroad, the Lebanese criminal code is full of things that one cannot do for life or for a certain period, and I suppose that comes from the legacy of the Ottoman legal system.  That is not the way our system operated.  I am sure that the Minister of State will have seen <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>, and I appreciate that as a singer she may even have sung it, but the central debate within that work of artistic fiction centres on whether somebody can be rehabilitated and be trusted after committing an offence or whether they are forever damned by the mark of the offence committed.</p> <p>It is a serious question and one that should not, with respect, be thrown in as an addendum to an item of road traffic legislation.  It should be fully debated.</p> <p> There are a number of offences for which one receives a three-year disqualification from holding a driving instructor's licence.  In the event that a prison sentence is imposed, the three years run from when the prison sentence ends.  These are serious offences which I abhor and condemn.  People who commit them should be tried and punished if found guilty.  However, I wonder about the coherence of the disqualification period.  Manslaughter is included, for example.  I am not for a moment suggesting that manslaughter is not a very serious offence that should be punished but a number of other offences are included.  Any offence under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, other than section 2 or section 6, attracts an automatic three-year disqualification period.  Section 2 is an assault and section 6 is a syringe attack.  Piercing somebody's skin, or threatening to pierce somebody's skin, with a syringe is a very serious offence, perhaps as serious as any other offence.  That is my subjective opinion on offences.  Threatening somebody with a syringe or piercing their skin with a syringe happens in circumstances where the fear the perpetrator wishes to instil is that the victim is going to contract HIV.  To me, that is a very serious offence and one which displays a particular amount of forethought.  If offences that attract a particular disqualification are to be included in the legislation, why not that offence?  Will the Minister of State explain to this House why she thinks persons guilty of that offence should be excluded if some offences are going to attract a disqualification.  I have a philosophical question about this part of the legislation.  We should be asking whether people pose a risk to society because they may reoffend  If they do, certain measures must be taken to protect the public but if they do not, why are we tarring everybody with the same brush and presuming that anybody who has committed a particular offence is a risk to society or to those they instruct when others are not?  For example, somebody who has committed a syringe attack is not a risk, nor is somebody who has committed an assault, but somebody who has committed assault causing harm is a risk.  Someone who has committed a syringe attack is not a risk.  I have a question mark about that.</p> <p> Several offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act are listed among those offences that attract automatic disqualifications.  Offences under sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 22 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act are included.  Those are all very serious offences that I condemn and abhor, particularly as the father of a young daughter.  I shudder to think of some of these offences, but why are these offences listed whereas section 18 of the same Act is not?  Perhaps it is not on the Statute Book anymore.  I think it is, but I am open to correction.  Section 18 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act is an offence committed by a person in authority.  Someone who committed all of the offences listed under other sections of that Act cannot be a driving instructor but a person who committed an offence while in a position of authority can be a driving instructor.  What is the coherence of that?  Whose personal morality informed this legislative provision?  How is it coherent with the objectives of the legislation?  Surely one of the risks with a driving instructor is that they will abuse their authority and yet section 18 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 is not among the scheduled offences. </p> <p> More importantly, given the debate we have just had, section 21 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act refers to a sexual act with a protected person and is not among the offences listed in the legislation we are considering.  I meant to print the definition of "a sexual act" and bring it to the House but I did not.  In any event, a sexual act with a protected person is committing a sexual act with somebody who does not have the capacity to consent and who does not understand the nature of the act involved because of their lack of capacity.  That is not an offence that requires a disqualification but, for example, having been involved in a riot does require a disqualification.  I abhor riots and political violence of any type.  Riots can sometimes be political.  Involvement in a riot does involve a disqualification but having committed a sexual act with a protected person who is unable to consent to the act because they do not understand what is going on does not require a disqualification.  Where is the coherence to that?</p> <p> I question the coherence of the Schedule.  More fundamentally, we need to look at the risk posed to the public by persons who have been convicted and have served a sentence.  I would like to think we live in a society where people can be rehabilitated.  I would like to think that is the purpose of our criminal justice system.  Even though I sometimes suspect to the contrary and that our criminal justice system, in particular our jails, are about brutalising people, I would like to think perhaps they could be about rehabilitating people.  This legislation is one of the first I am aware of, although there may be may others, that assumes that because a person has been convicted, they remain a danger to society once they come out of jail having served their time.  The legislation covers a whole raft of offences and, philosophically, I would question that.  Is the Minister of State telling these people if they have committed an act, been convicted by their peers and served their time, they will thereafter always be a danger to society in the case of some offences, or for at least three years in the case of others?  If that is the case, I would at least ask the Minister of State to ensure the approach is coherent and serves its objectives.  I presume those objectives are not to punish people further because if that was the case, it would be part of criminal justice legislation that would go before the justice committee for debate, rather than a part of road safety legislation as it is.</p> <p> I would welcome any contribution, discussion or point the Minister of State would like to make in response to my points about Part 5 and the licensing of instructors before the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage.  I am aware this Bill was pulled at the last minute last week and may not have received as much attention from the parliamentary draftsman as might otherwise have been the case.  That is not a reason to advance legislation which is incoherent or legislation which introduces a new philosophical departure for how we deal with the punishment of criminal offences in this State.</p></speech>

The Bill also includes measures to increase the speed of the implementation of BusConnects and underpins the investment in a much-improved public transport system.</p>  <p>  Significantly, the Bill also introduces legislation to deal with dangerous and antisocial off-road use of scramblers, quads and similar vehicles.  There are amendments to strengthen laws concerning insurance and road traffic law enforcement.  These measures will help to improve road safety while helping us to drive down the cost of insurance for law-abiding drivers.  These initiatives will help us to advance towards our ambitious shared EU Vision Zero objective of eliminating deaths and serious injuries on our roads by 2050.</p>  <p>  While I generally welcome the Bill as part of the Government's efforts to introduce and encourage alternative modes of mobility, give people more options and reduce our reliance on cars, I believe there are issues with it.  I hope the Minister will be open to amendments on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I will deal with each of the principal aspects of the Bill in turn.  Currently, both e-bikes and e-scooters come under the definition of a mechanically propelled vehicle, MPV.  A person driving or riding an MPV must have insurance, tax and a licence.  This has caused confusion as there is no specific licence available for an e-scooter or e-bike.</p>  <p>  Section 16(e) of this Bill amends the 1961 Act and defines a new category of vehicle, the powered personal transporter, PPT, and sets out certain technical details characterising such vehicles.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states, "This vehicle category is intended to encompass a range of small, lightweight micro-mobility vehicles such as e-scooters, electric skateboards, segways, hoverboards, etc. which are not accurately captured within the vehicle categories as set out in the 1961 Act due to technological innovations in the intervening years."</p>  <p>  Section 16(b)(ii) amends the Road Traffic Act 1961 to exempt PPTs from the definition of an MPV.  This means there will be legal clarity meaning PPTs such as e-scooters and e-bikes can be used without the need for registration, tax, licensing and insurance conditions, as are necessary for MPVs.</p>  <p>  Part 12 also defines an e-bike for the first time in Irish legislation and differentiates between low-powered and high-powered models.  Many of the amendments in Part 12 are technical and add the term PPT or PPTs to existing legislation.  While e-bikes and e-scooters will not be treated as MPVs, there is still legislation that prohibits drink driving on a bike and speeding and this will extend to PPTs.</p>  <p>  The Bill clarifies that PPTs are also required to be roadworthy and may be examined by a garda to ensure they do not have a dangerous defect.  It will be an offence to supply a powered personal transporter to a person under the age of 16 years.  This is somewhat problematic.  I hope consideration will be given to reducing the age, perhaps for low-powered PPTs, or restricted-speed models, to allow children over 12 &ndash; basically all secondary school children &ndash; to use an e-bike to get around.  E-bikes are popular in that age category in secondary schools.</p>  <p>  Section 109A will give the Garda significant powers to crack down on antisocial and reckless criminal behaviour of those using scramblers and quad bikes.  Provisional RSA statistics show that, in the period 2014 to 2019, three of the six people who died in Ireland as a result of an incident involving a quad bike or scrambler were aged 18 or under.  The RSA statistics also show that, between 2014 and 2019, 60 people were injured in collisions involving a quad bike or scrambler on a public road.  Of those killed or injured, 41% were 18 years of age or under.  My Fianna F&aacute;il colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, has already dealt with this issue in detail so I do not propose to repeat what was said other than to compliment him and my colleague, Deputy Lahart, for championing this issue in the House.  </p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Bill introduces amendments concerning the information that motor insurers must provide to the Motor Insurance Bureau Ireland and the use of this information.</p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 stipulates that every person using an MPV in a public area must have an approved motor insurance policy.  This Bill will ensure insurance companies will have to provide details to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland within five working days.  This will be useful for garda&iacute;.  It should enhance enforcement and drive down the cost of motor insurance for responsible drivers.</p>  <p>  I note improvements to fixed-charge penalties included in Part 7 of the Bill, which amends the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975 and will treat fixed-charge notices issued by traffic wardens in the same way as those issued by An Garda under Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  This means a person will have another opportunity to pay a fixed penalty, at the point of summons, before the case goes to court for offences specified in the section, such as parking offences.  That is particularly welcome because cases in this regard are clogging up our courts.  I would say the vast majority of the cases before the District Court concern road traffic offences.</p>  <p>  The Bill introduces provisions to deal with variable speed limits on the M50, in addition to technical amendments on novice drivers and driving instructors.  All are welcome.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will have regard to my suggestion to allow all second level students to use e-bikes and consider points raised by Deputies on e-scooters to ensure there is not a free-for-all.  Concern in this regard was the main deterrent to introducing legislation.</p>  <p>  It might be useful if the committee hears from experts in this area to reach a cross-party consensus.  Disability advocates and groups representing older people, for example, have concerns, and they need to be heard.  I hope we can amend the existing legislation.  I hope we can make progress on this Bill because its provisions are certainly demanded and needed.  We need regulation, but the vehicles in question are very popular and people want to see them introduced on our roads.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100048#YY00400"><p>I welcome the publication of this legislation.  Along with my colleagues on the transport and communications committee, which I chair, I engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  We are very much involved in it.  E-scooters were not included in the original draft where pre-legislative scrutiny was concerned.  We covered the matter as best we could.  We ask that, in order to have substantial pre-legislative scrutiny, all aspects of a Bill be made available.  The e-scooter aspect is quite substantial and should have been subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny.  We scrutinised what was available to us based on submissions made and briefs provided to us by the Department, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.</p>  <p>  I want to refer to several points related to the legislation.  We await Committee Stage, on which I expect the committee and Ministers to spend a significant amount of time.  We were asked to expedite the pre-legislative scrutiny and we did so last July.  It is important that we get this right.  We are in a fast-changing world.  There is a need for legislation.</p>  <p>  The Bill is called the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021.  It probably should include a reference to e-scooters or some such term in the Title.  While the Bill deals with the road traffic aspect, the matter of e-scooters and e-bikes is very new.  I would like to see the Bill before the committee as quickly as possible so it can be given time and so we will reach a point where everyone will work together to have something that works.</p>  <p>  Let me deal with a couple of aspects.  On the road traffic aspect, my colleagues on the transport committee and I visited the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, control room for the M50 and other locations last Tuesday.</p> <p>In practice, what is being proposed relates to improving safety and improving certainty in terms of travel time on the M50, particularly around Dublin.  However, there is a significant body of work to be done in the respect of communicating to the public how it will work.  The way the traffic light system will work is that there will be indications on the big signs that are in place and the speed limits will change in various locations, depending on traffic.  The key thing for people to realise is that when the limits change, that is because there is a problem and they need to slow down.  They need to realise that TII is trying to get people to their destination more quickly.  The limits will change because the traffic control system is indicating there has been a breakdown up ahead or there is congestion in a certain location.  That is very important.</p> <p> I note the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has stated that he is bringing forward legislation on the active travel side for infrastructure.  The question is whether that is coming through in this Bill.  We have not had sight of it.  It is a matter we will have to consider in depth at committee.  My concern relates to being able to give such a substantive body of legislation the scrutiny it requires.  That is something about which I feel very strongly.  We are a Parliament.  We are here to scrutinise legislation, working together to make something that functions effectively.  It is old-fashioned but, in my experience, if legislation is scrutinised at committee and in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, it is improved through that process.  The scrutiny debugs it.  It is a trial run.  Specific areas of legislation that may not otherwise be picked up are considered when that scrutiny is applied.  It serves a common purpose. </p> <p> I welcome the changes relating to scramblers.  There is a serious problem with scramblers in Limerick.  Many of them are being driven on private property.  It seems to me that under the legislation the Garda will be able to enter onto private property, although not into homes.  There have been situations in Limerick where people have been terrorised.  In many cases, it is young men or women who are driving the scramblers.  I very much welcome the provisions in that regard in the Bill but I am seeking certainty on how it will operate in practice.</p> <p> I refer to e-scooters.  It is very important that we get this right.  Deputies have been contacted on the issue by disability groups.  Will e-scooters be allowed on footpaths?  Will there be designated parking areas for e-scooters and e-bikes, rather than their being parked in a disorderly way?  There may be a wider issue in connection with the fact that under EU Regulation No. 540/2014 all manufacturers must equip new electronic and hybrid vehicles with an acoustic vehicle alerting system.  I have been in electric cars.  They make no sound.  That issue is being raised by members of the public.  It is very important that all electric bikes and e-scooters should sound almost like a normal car or bike because in many cases they creep up on people who are completely unaware of their approach.  It is very dangerous.  That is a very simple measure that would deal with an issue that members of the public bring to my attention all the time.  We want electric vehicles because they are good for the environment and on a myriad of levels but, in the interests of safety, people must be able to hear them approaching.</p> <p> To go back to the issue of age limits, I take the point by Deputy Berry regarding the age limit being 16 and how that works.  How will it be enforced?  If a person of 13 or 14 years of age is driving an e-scooter or an e-bike on a footpath, how will the rules be enforced in the context of their age profile?  In life, the great majority of people abide by the law.  It is a very small number of people who do not do so but they wreak havoc.  They take up infinite State resources.  We must ensure the law is enforceable but not so strict as to be draconian for the general population.  That is a difficult line to find but it needs to be considered.</p> <p> I very much welcome the measure relating to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, whereby insurers will have to give information within five days.  That should catch people who may have stopped their insurance.  How quickly will that be up and running?  Who will have access to it?  This relates to the wider area of insurance.  In life, knowledge is king.  The insurance companies should be working with all stakeholders, such as the State, the Garda and the Government, to improve safety and bring down premiums and this must work in favour of the consumer as well.  It is a very good measure.  When will it be up and running?  Who will have access to it?  </p> <p> To go back to the issue of powered personal transporters, PPTs, I and many of my colleagues have been told by many of the providers in the area that limiting the battery power to 250 W is insufficient on the grounds of safety.  The e-scooter or e-bike might not be able to go up a hill.  I am not technically competent to comment on that, but I know that it is coming at us like a steam train and we must ensure it does not get out of control.  As such, we should consider the issue of the wattage of e-scooters and e-bikes because the claims of the providers may be correct.</p> <p>  There is a need for this to be a structured operation.  Many of the e-scooters and e-bikes will be rentals and I do not think that is covered under legislation.  The Minister of State indicated they will be subject to regulations similar to those in place for bicycles.  How will that operate in practice?  There needs to be designated parking spaces for e-bikes.  There is a need to ensure they cannot be driven on footpaths.  I refer to the age groups and how the rules in that regard are enforced.  Is there a case for restricting the younger age group to a lower wattage?  Can we encourage people to use them to travel to school?  I reiterate that must be done in a safe way.</p> <p> People are talking about the rules of the road and whatever.  We need to carry out an overall review of the rules for car drivers and bike users in order to consider what we can do to make it safer.  What can we do to make it safer for cyclists and pedestrians?  Where designated cycle lanes are provided, what is the legal situation if a bike does not use that cycle lane but instead uses the road?  How do we ensure that car drivers are fully conversant with the rules of the road in respect of cyclists?  Many of them probably are not.  We want to encourage more people to use bikes and e-scooters.  That is good for the environment but it must be done in a safe and coherent way.</p> <p> In advance of the Bill coming before the Committee on Transport and Communications, I ask that the committee be given good notice of the amendments that will be proposed and that adequate time be set aside to look at this issue.  Obviously, it is confined in the context of the membership of the committee, but Deputies who are not members of the committee are very welcome to join the meeting and engage in debate on the specific sections of the Bill and the consideration of amendments.  What we want to do is to get legislation that is fit for purpose.</p> <p>Let us do it in the old fashioned way, namely, by going through the Bill section by section and debating them and by looking at the amendments and debating them.  We may not agree with them but aside from the work we do in our constituency, which is hugely important to me, we are elected to be parliamentarians.</p> <p> I am very excited by this legislation.  What we need to do now is to put in the time to scrutinise all aspects of it.  We welcome it coming forward on Committee Stage in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport.  </p></speech>

Beidh 15 n&oacute;im&eacute;ad agam agus c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad ag an Teachta Cronin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; go maith go bhfuil deis againn labhairt ar an mBille seo.

I do not want to try to prevent the growth of e-scooters or the likes in this city.  I understand fully the benefits that they have for commuters and society as a whole in terms of how people get to and from work and the like, and how they will benefit us in terms of climate change.  People will not be stuck sitting in cars with the engine running, as they will be able to get about a lot quicker on scooters.  However, I have niggling doubts around the issue of insurance, given the speed at which some of these vehicles travel, whether it is an e-scooter or a motorised bicycle, which we see a lot more of today.  Some people have converted such bikes themselves.  It is not just about motorised bikes; old pedal bikes are also an issue.  If a person on a bike hits a pedestrian who happens to step out in front of them, as far is I am aware, the law is very unsure as to who is to blame and who can make a claim.  When I was pulling into my drive, a bicycle hit the side of the car.  I had to cover the loss of the damage to the car; the cyclist had to cover the loss of the damage to his bike.  It is a lacuna in the law.  He should not have been on the path in any event but it is one of those issues.  </p>  <p>  I believe a lot more training must be provided on the rules of the road.  Many people speak of witnessing cyclists coming up to a set of traffic lights and swinging round to the left.  I am not just talking about such cases.  Yes, that should not happen.  Such behaviour is not as dangerous that of some of road users, who go straight through traffic lights, yellow boxes and the like with no regard whatsoever.  Not so long ago, I saw four people riding on an e-scooter.  Four fully grown adults went through the traffic lights on a scooter.  I cannot think of anything worse.  Dangerous and crazy stuff happens on the road.  That is why we need more garda&iacute; to police that aspect and dangerous driving.  That is what it is, whether it is on a bicycle, an e-scooter or in a car.  We do not have enough garda&iacute;.  If we do not have enough garda&iacute;, then we need to look at ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fully resourced, that the traffic corps or the roads policing unit has the required supports needed to tackle not just the antisocial crime that we see on the Luas, the DART or mainline trains, but also what happens on the road.  </p>  <p>  That is not part of this Bill; it is part of an overall package.  We are trying to win people over.  I have heard all those who have whinged about people on scooters and so on.  It is very easy to target one group or other or to dismiss them.  E-scooters are here to stay, whether people like them or not.  Like every other form of transport in this city or other cities, we need to educate those who are in charge of them.  I did not see it, and it might be included in the legislation, but we must highlight the need for visibility.  If you are using the road in the city, you must be visible.  I presume that not many would be travelling along rural roads on scooters outside of the city, but they may be.  Users of scooters should wear high-visibility clothing and use lights.  People might ask where you would put lights on an e-scooter.  There must be lights on scooters, because otherwise, you cannot see them.  If a person gets onto a scooter at night wearing dark clothing, you will not see him or her.</p>  <p>  Another point I wish to raise is the debate around helmets, clogad.  It is not compulsory for cyclists to wear a helmet.  In this day and age, that is mad.  It should be compulsory for anybody who is renting out bikes in the city.  The same goes for the users of e-scooters.  It is for the safety of the users; it is not for the safety of anybody else.  If you get hit by a person wearing a helmet, it is going to be sore for you, but it is for their safety if they hit the road.  I say that as somebody who has been in many an accident as a cyclist over the years.  I have cycled all my life and have had many a scrape with the roads and paths in those years.  I have survived to tell the tale where others have not, and that is the problem.  Others have fallen off their bikes and have been left severely brain damaged or worse.  We enforced the wearing of helmets on motorbikes many moons ago.  I remember the days when they were not there.  We also introduced the compulsory wearing of helmets in hurling.  You would not go onto a hurling pitch now without wearing a helmet.  I remember when that was introduced, people complained that we were a nanny State.  There are many people out there who are glad that they had the helmet on when they were playing hurling.  The same is true of those riding motorbikes.  I appeal to the joint committee and the Minister of State, when they are looking at the legislation, to seek to ensure that it forms part of the package of rolling this legislation out fully.</p>  <p>  I note that the last speaker, Deputy O'Donnell, mentioned spaces in the city centre, or wherever, to park bicycles and the like.  If you go to Amsterdam, you will see huge bike parks.  The bikes are parked right on top of each other.  It is great to see.  If you go into Dublin city centre, you will see very few bikes because they are robbed all the time, because they are not secure.  That is one of the problems.  They are not secure and we do not have the Garda numbers, the wherewithal or even sometimes the interest to chase up the theft of bikes.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has done great work in recovering some bikes, but others just seem to disappear into thin air.  There need to be more secure spaces to park bikes.  There are bike lockers, or the like, in some parts of the city.  Perhaps we should encourage car parks - which are half empty in many cases, and hopefully will be empty, as we are trying to discourage people from coming into the city centre with cars - to introduce bike lockers or lockers for e-scooters.  Perhaps they could make a few bob in the process, but I would not necessarily encourage that  The provision of such lockers would reassure people that their bike or scooter will be somewhere safe and will be dry when they come back to collect it, perhaps if it has been raining all day.  </p>  <p>  There is much to be welcomed in this Bill.  There are other things that need to be said as well.  People may have already done it, but every year, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a call to parents not to buy scramblers or quad bikes for their children. </p> <p>At least the Bill will make it an offence to sell them to those aged under 16 which I welcome.  I appeal again to parents not to buy them, given the torture that communities have experienced year in and year out.  They are not suitable for built-up local authority and other housing estates in the city.  I also appeal to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take action a lot quicker where a nuisance or danger is being created by these quads and scramblers.</p> <p>  There is another missed opportunity in the Bill.  This is an issue I and colleagues have raised with a number of Ministers with responsibility for transport.  It is a pity it is not being addressed given the scope of the Bill.  This is the issue of horse-drawn carriages and the fact there is no proper licensing system.  The legislation that covers them is the Dublin Carriage Act 1853.  To this day, people can be fined one penny or one shilling or face hard labour.  This is the extent of it.  Dublin is peculiar in this because it is the only area affected by the Act.  This means other local authorities can regulate but the local authority in Dublin cannot do so.  The council has asked, as have councillors from all parties, for the Minister to repeal it and put in place legislation that would deal with the carrying of passengers on horse-drawn vehicles which, in many cases, are not suitable and sometimes collapse.  There is no insurance on many of them.  There is no horse welfare associated with them.  In this city we have seen horses that are in danger because they are carrying a load and they are not fit for it.  It is tantamount to horse cruelty in these instances.  There is a whole layer in this.  I appeal to the committee to see whether there is a way to ensure this is slotted in because it deals with road users.</p> <p> Another issue is the roads themselves, given the dangerous state of a lot of them, especially on parts that are often left to one side for bicycle lanes.  Sometimes they are the areas that get the most works, such as sewerage works, carried out on them.  They are often left in a bad state afterwards.  This is also the case with some of the paths that we walk on in this city and other cities.</p> <p> I have raised the issue with the Minister of other road users, such as the blood bike service.  I have asked for it to get an exemption from road tax or a rebate.  They are motor cycles in the main that ferry blood, blood samples and breastmilk from, for example, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to hospitals.  It is regarded by all of the other emergency services as an emergency service.  It would not be a huge imposition that they be given a rebate or that they be allowed to use bus lanes.  There are very few of them and it would not interfere with other users of the bus lanes</p> <p> The next major point I want to make is with regard to the chaos in driving test centres.  Last night, I had communication from somebody whose daughter did her driving test.  Her permit was six days out of date but the inspector allowed her to go out and do the test.  Then, when she went to get her licence, even though she had been told it was grand, she was then told she would have to resit the test.  There is absolute chaos about how some of the testers are using the system.  I do not know whether they have a quota that they must achieve each day with regard to who sits and who does not.  There needs to be a change and a tightening up.  There also needs to be a speeding up to address the huge backlog.</p> <p> I hope the Bill does not get delayed on Committee Stage, although I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that there is a need for amendments to tighten it up.  I hope we can work quickly because people in this city in particular are crying out for legislation to allow e-scooters on the roads so that young people can buy them without the fear they would be confiscated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as has happened to a number of people who have contacted me over the years.  This is because of the confusion as to whether or not they are allowed on the roads and whether people have to wear a helmet or have insurance.  Some young people have suffered the consequences of a lacuna in the law on these issues.  There is also a lacuna in the law with regard to horse and carriage legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100051#BBB00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in will table amendments to certain aspects of it.  When it comes to the dangerous and antisocial use of scramblers and quads it is good to see the Government is taking Sinn F&eacute;in's lead and making provision for something that is a scourge on many communities.  On this side of the House we have been told for a long time it could not be done but here we are and it is welcome.  It has been a Damascene conversion but welcome all the same.  What has been proposed is very much like the legislation Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled in the past.  We will take progress when and where we get it.</p>  <p>  It is sickening to think that for the sake of a rider's adrenaline rush other people can be robbed of their lives or suffer serious injuries from scramblers and quads.  It is welcome to see the Garda getting the power it needs to tackle this reckless behaviour that has the capacity to inflict such devastating and life-changing injuries not only on individuals but, by extension, their entire families.  The communities affected will breathe a collective sigh of relief that at least the Garda will be able to act.  The important next step is that the Garda starts to implement the authority it has been given as soon as possible.  Essential to this is having the resources, finance and personnel to move as efficiently and effectively as it should want.  My party is seeking a meeting with Garda management to make sure it has the resources needed so the implementation can and will be done.</p>  <p>  The provision in the Bill for e-bikes and e-scooters is equally critical.  I have had quite a lot of contact from constituents on the use of e-scooters, particularly during the lockdown when people were keen to get in their daily walk.  There are a lot of shared spaces where paths have become cycle lanes.  Serious concerns have been raised about regulation, particularly by older citizens and citizens with visual impairment and disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Bill also addresses the often dire traffic situation on the M50 with variable speeds, and this is welcome.  Many of my constituents in north Kildare are veterans of the M50 and they could tell many a tale of woe, particularly during the Covid lockdowns.  Motorists are under huge pressure in the commute, and the situation that has developed with delays and hold-ups is bad not only for emissions but also for noise pollution, air pollution and our mental and physical health.  The variable speed changes will work, as anybody knows who has been on a motorway and overtaken by some eejit only to find themselves behind that person again as the traffic slows down.  Variable speed limits will help to reduce build up on the M50.</p>  <p>  As COP26 takes place in Glasgow, it would be remiss of me not to address the changes necessary in how we travel.  We need a radical and quick change in our approach to transport in all communities, particularly rural communities.  We need access to clean, green, high-quality, reliable and cheap public transport necessary in the 21st century as we face the climate crisis and meet our climate commitments.  Electric vehicles are to be welcomed.  They certainly have a role to play but they are not a panacea and they cannot be presented as such.  The bottom line is that we need vastly fewer vehicles on our roads and vastly more people on public transport.  The 20th century was the age of the individual in travel.  The car provided privacy and independence.</p> <p>Given the existential challenge that we face, travel in the 21st  century must be about society and the public good.  This means that we are going to have to perhaps relinquish some of our personal choices for a better societal outcome.  This might involve taking a train at 3 p.m. as opposed to getting into the car at 2.45 p.m. just because we can.  This is what we have to address now.  We also have to address how time-poor we are.  The reason so many of us use our cars instead of public transport is we are always in a hurry.  As a society, we have to address how time-poor we are and how we always seem to be in a hurry on to the next thing while working so hard, and where commuting takes up so much time.</p> <p> The change that is needed will involve all of us but its benefits will also be for all of us.  I welcome this Stage of the Bill.</p></speech>

There is a commentary in the explanatory memorandum on the changes in our use of vehicles of one kind or another and the use of public transport.  I have to make a case for rural Ireland generally where there is no transport system and where people cannot get about efficiently within their own counties or region.  That has to be changed and it will take considerable funding, but rural Ireland cannot be left out in respect of the changes that are coming because of climate change and for other reasons.</p>  <p>  All legislation is informed by our interaction with constituents and by our own experiences.  Some of those experiences relate to the courts, An Garda, insurance companies generally and so on.  The Second Stage debate is an ideal time to discuss some of the issues and the legislation, and to ask for some joined-up thinking on it.  A former Member of this House said to me that there is no point in all of us passing this legislation and putting the laws in place if we do not have sufficient manpower and capacity to deal with the policing of those laws.  I believe firmly in that.  There has to be a connection between this legislation, the experiences that some have had in road traffic accidents and the courts, and indeed, the insurance companies.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach regularly deals with insurance companies and attempts in every way possible to bring down the premiums for motorists.</p>  <p>  I would point as an example of complete failure of the system to the case of Shane O&rsquo;Farrell, which has often been raised in this House and has all to do with a traffic accident, a hit and run, murder, one might call it, on the roadside and the devastation for a family.  In fact, the previous D&aacute;il decided that there should be a public inquiry into that case.  When one examines the reasons for a broad well-meaning public inquiry, it has to do with how the courts function.  If someone appears in court - and it is ten years since Shane O&rsquo;Farrell&rsquo;s death - is convicted of a crime and if that person is to be jailed, then one would expect that the law would ensure that person goes to jail for that particular crime.  It is very difficult to understand in Shane O&rsquo;Farrell&rsquo;s case how the system dealt with numerous convictions in the courts against a man who eventually killed Shane on the roadside.  He should have been in jail.  There was a failure of the courts and of An Garda to implement the decision of the court.  If this legislation is to change anything, it needs to interlink with the courts system to ensure that the likes of that oversight or error does not happen again.  </p>  <p>  Likewise, there needs to be a connection between North and South because, referring to Shane O&rsquo;Farrell&rsquo;s case, the conviction of the man involved related to numerous offences in 2011 in the Border area.  We need to connect with the authorities in Northern Ireland to ensure that in future, should these road offences be committed, there is a flow of information between North and South.  My understanding is that on one occasion, the man who killed Shane O&rsquo;Farrell was to report to his local Garda station when, in fact, he was in jail in Northern Ireland.  The questions have to be asked in the context of legislation: how did that happen and why?  Will this legislation or any amendment that might be required to it be able to deal with that and with the relationship with the police Northern Ireland?  </p>  <p>  Likewise Part 4 introduces amendments relating to information about insurance.  This goes back to the policing of the legislation.  In Shane O&rsquo;Farrell&rsquo;s case, this man was stopped on the roadside, he was known to have had the various convictions, there was a question mark over the condition of the vehicle he was driving and whether it was roadworthy, tax and insurance, yet the vehicle was not taken from him, was not impounded and it seems as if there was no consequences in that regard.  This Bill needs to address that by ensuring there will be consequences and that An Garda are empowered, or if they need to be further empowered, to take these types of vehicles and to impound them.  I do not understand why that happened.</p>  <p>  The other issue is the national car test certificate, as it was referred to.  There was no certificate.  We can have all of the laws and the indicators on the windscreen as to tax, insurance and so on, but if these matters are not policed, then we will not get the results that we want.  If motorists are found by An Garda to have broken the law, we need to ensure that the Courts Service puts in place the proper tracking system so that the crime can be picked up and the person who might be sentenced goes to jail and is taken off the road to prevent the type of accidents that killed Shane O&rsquo;Farrell.</p>  <p>  I am using that case because so many things went wrong on the part of the State in it, even in the Director of Public Prosecution's, DPP's, office.  </p>  <p>  This legislation should look at how, for example, that man who killed Shane O&rsquo;Farrell got the type of legal representation that he received.  How did that man get the type of favourable consideration in the court that he got-----</p></speech>

We need to examine what happens to a vehicle that is impounded, how garda&iacute; carry out their assessment of such a vehicle and how available the report is to the other party who might have been involved in the accident.  My experience has been that people who seek reports from the garda&iacute; may as well be writing to Santa Claus because they are not going to get a direct written reply.  It is extremely difficult to extract the reports on road accidents from garda&iacute;, especially when an insurance case is involved.<br/><br/>Information on the length of time for which a vehicle was impounded, and on where the vehicle might have gone after that, should be available because there could be evidence in terms of a case being taken.  This needs to be examined, as well as the availability of information to the interested parties, so that the information is forthcoming without any hassle when it is asked for.  I do not think that puts pressure on anyone because the reports should be made available.<br/><br/>We need to look at the vehicles coming from Northern Ireland to southern Ireland and have the same standard of operation in Northern Ireland as we have here so that there is an expectation that tax, insurance, vehicle numbers, roadworthiness certificates and all of the rest are in place.  In the case of one accident, a truck came from Northern Ireland where an accident had occurred.  The truck was from the North and had no tax, insurance or NCT.  Garda&iacute; were to examine the truck after the accident, but lo and behold there was no report.  The truck was brought back to Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>In company law, when people are working for a company as a subcontractor there is an obligation on the person offering the contract to ensure the subcontractor has all of the appropriate tax and insurance available, be it employers, public liability or vehicle insurance.  When an accident happens, however, there is a reluctance to pursue the person offering the contract if the subcontractor has no tax or insurance, etc.  There needs to be a direct connection between that part of company law and road traffic law.<br/><br/>Responsibility must be taken by someone where a company is involved in a contract and subcontractor arrangement.  Not enough is being made of the responsibility of the main contractor.  Some of the mission statements of contractors have grand language and phrases to describe their responsibility, how they respond, what they demand of their employees, the company, its health and safety record and what it does with subcontractors.  However, the implementation of such mission statements falls far short of what the statement describes.  There is a need in company law governing that area to point out and strengthen the responsibility of a contractor when engaging a subcontractor.  That is essential.<br/><br/>In respect of premiums, in cases involving road traffic accidents insurance companies fight with each other all of the time.  Solicitors, barristers and senior counsel are all brought into the equation.  A big company often beats down the individual and pushes him or her off the pitch, and there is a large settlement or no settlement.  If there is no settlement, that means justice could not have been done because the might, power and money of the corporate has defeated the individual.  The legislation must reflect the rights of the individual and reflect or give a pathway to an individual who is trying to defend himself or herself against a large company that is prepared to put obstacles in the way and string a case out.  In the end, the person is defeated not in court but by being bullied off the pitch.<br/><br/> That is an experience I have had with a constituent.  I have discussed it with him.  It is unusual to see the person who was not responsible for having insurance being the one that carries the cost in court arising from a court case when, in fact, it is the company that employed the person that should have carried the cost.  The courts can overlook the detail of some of the cases before them in the rush to get sorted or can be impressed by a lawyered-out company that is taking a case against an individual.<br/><br/>I would like to see a greater connection between company law, companies' responsibility for insuring their vehicles and the listing of insurance.  It has been suggested during this debate that there should be a motor insurance bureau in Ireland.  I fully support that.  I believe every effort should be made not just to commence it from today, but to examine how we could bring some historical perspective to that type of list and build it up properly over the years.  Far too often, one sees that in accidents that those with money can spend it on their legal teams and get through the courts without any great fine at the end of it.  That is not justice, and it involves ignoring, bypassing and using the law to one's benefit.<br/><br/>I examined some of the statistics around Shane O'Farrell's case.  The person involved never served a six-month sentence.  Relating to this, some 31,422 crimes were committed by those on bail.  That equated to 604 per week, a figure which increased by 70% the following year.  If legislation is being properly policed and managed through the courts, that type of statistic should not exist.<br/><br/>The M50 is mentioned in the Bill.  I would like the motorway from Dublin to Kilkenny, the road I use, to benefit from similar signage mentioned in the Bill.  I have seen it used and it is very effective.  When one leaves Dublin city centre to get onto the motorway, the different speed limits are very confusing.  One can pass very easily from a speed limit of 100 km/h to 80 km/h.  One is watching the traffic and everything else.  There needs to be a review of the speed limits along that route.<br/><br/>In some of the areas where one can pull in to rest, park or whatever, there should be some basic facilities.  That is not part of the Bill.  </p> <p>The areas for pulling in and resting for trucks and cars are in place.  I am not referring to any elaborate facilities, but there should be basic facilities.</p></speech>

I preface my remarks by saying that this is not a criticism of the Office of the Planning Regulator as distinct from the manner in which the current officeholder has made recommendations to the Minister's office, which displays a fundamental lack of understanding of the relevant planning law.  The action of the Minister to reverse the decision of Cork County Council on foot of the advice of the regulator was something that would offend a first-year law student.</p><p>Cork County Council had no alternative but to judicially review the decision of the Minister.  The point to be decided was one that had been decided more times than most law students care to forget.  This case should never have darkened the door of the courthouse.  The judgment confirmed, as so many other judgments had confirmed previously, that local authorities must have regard to general ministerial guidelines.  They are not required to follow them slavishly.  It was implied by the regulator that these guidelines were mandatory.  Knowing this was wrong was the equivalent of knowing that one plus one equals two.  Mr. Justice Humphreys filleted the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Department.  An eminent planning senior counsel has described this planning judgment as one of the most accurate and scathing he has seen.  What is striking about the judgment is the frustration of the judge at the obvious fundamental lack of knowledge of the Planning Regulator of the basic principles of planning law.</p><p>Issues with the Department's planning policy department are not new.  For example, I have put parliamentary questions to the Minister and a reply I received was intentionally, Jesuitically misleading.  Subsequently, the Wexford county manager's report relied unlawfully on that reply to recommend an unlawful, inappropriate measure to the councillors in County Wexford.  On the basis of this judgment, we can no longer trust the responses that Deputies receive from the planning section of the Department.  We can no longer have confidence in the assistant secretary who is responsible for planning policy and who allowed the Minister to pursue an unlawful attempt to reverse the decision of the elected members of Cork County Council.  We can no longer have confidence in the Planning Regulator.  As Mr. Justice Humphreys pointed out in paragraph 70 of his judgment, the basic lack of legal knowledge displayed would have been sufficient grounds for the judicial review.</p><p>The Minister is now on notice that he has a significant problem in both the Office of the Planning Regulator and the planning policy section.  It is clear that the head of the Office of the Planning Regulator has not got the legal planning knowledge or the skill set to maintain his position.  He has had his homework corrected by the High Court and received no grade, NG.  The defence offered by him is that this case was the equivalent of &quot;the dog ate my homework&quot;.  The regulator occupies a quasi legal position and his continuing in his current position undermines the Office of the Planning Regulator and the performance of its functions.  It removes certainty from the planning system generally.  I say, with regret, that the Planning Regulator is not fit for his position.  The Minister must appoint somebody who has the skill set for the position.  If he does not, I fear the contamination effect might reach his office.  As a result of this landmark judgment the following question arises: who regulates the regulator?  <i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>I ask the Minister of State to make a statement.</p></speech>

That decision is already in the public domain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100054#EEE00700"><p>I should point out that this is still potentially before the courts, so I am restricted in what I can say about the specifics of the case.  I will reply with fact.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, my role of Minister of State with regard to the planning system is primarily to provide a policy and legislative framework under which planning authorities, the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la perform their statutory functions.  The legislative framework chiefly comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the planning and development regulations 2001, as amended.  Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas introduce and debate legislation which the OPR then enforces.  As we are elected by our peers and the citizens of this State, the primacy of Members of the D&aacute;il is appropriate.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 10 of the final report of the Mahon tribunal recommended the establishment of an independent planning regulator, which led to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator on 3 April 2019.  The Deputy will be aware of the outcome of the report of the Mahon tribunal and the corruption, which we have now tackled, that existed in our planning system.  Other recommendations included the introduction of a register of lobbyists, limitations on political donations and stronger whistleblower legislation.  While I will not comment on the particular aspects of the judgment on which it is open to the State to appeal, I will emphasise the importance of the role of the OPR as part of ensuring the effective implementation of the plan-making process.  Ultimately, where the OPR considers that aspects of a plan do not conform with national and regional policies or proper planning and sustainable development, the regulator issues a notice to the Minister recommending that powers of ministerial direction be engaged.  The decision on whether to issue a direction is ultimately a matter for the Minister and there are safeguards in the legislation relating to the accountability of the Minister to the Oireachtas.  This is a critically important underpinning of the plan-led approach which flowed from the Mahon tribunal.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, the Department has an oversight agreement with the OPR, the purpose of which is to ensure clear service ownership, accountability, roles and responsibilities of both the Department and the OPR with a view to ensuring that the OPR is discharging its statutory functions in an efficient and effective manner and commensurate with the resources allocated to it to enable it to discharge those functions.</p> <p>The agreement identifies the distinctive roles of both organisations, their mutual commitments and expectations, and provides the basis for ongoing engagement between them.  I am satisfied that there are good arrangements in place for accountability to the Oireachtas and governance of the Office of the Planning Regulator.  We continue to keep the legislative provisions under review, particularly in the context of the planning review currently being led by the Attorney General, which is due to report in September next year.  It will provide a fitness test for the whole planning area.  Any legislation required on foot of that review will be enacted before the end of the year, which is a very ambitious target, given the complexities of the planning system, which processes 27,000 applications per annum of which only 10% are appealed.</p> <p> I wish to make two further points.  The Planning Regulator has a job to implement and be guardian over a plan-led system that this Oireachtas has approved with a shared vision from a national planning framework right down to our local plans.  The current occupant of the Office of the Planning Regulator is a highly professional individual who discharges his functions with considerable thought and merit on a daily basis.  He does not take any decision lightly when recommending a direction ultimately to the Minister who decides in respect of the Oireachtas.</p> <p> The assistant secretary with responsibility for planning in our Department is a highly respected individual who has done great work and given great service to the State.  I had the privilege of being in County Wexford recently and saw the leadership that Tom Enright is giving there as chief executive.  There are many innovative projects which I have not seen in other local authorities.  They seek to future-proof employment.  Key infrastructure is being delivered in County Wexford, bringing many jobs to the county.  The work by the executive and the councillors in underpinning those policy decisions, including taking hard decisions on revenue-raising mechanisms, is exemplary.</p></speech>

I prefaced my opening remarks by saying that this is not a criticism of the Office of the Planning Regulator, as distinct from the manner in which the current officeholder is discharging his duties.  There was a basic failure by the Planning Regulator and the Minister of State's office to properly consider the established law in the area.  The law is not the issue here; it is the lack of understanding of those who are supposed to understand it.</p><p>A second-year law student faced with a straightforward question about the established law and precedent regarding section 28 ministerial guidelines and section 31 ministerial directives would revert in 20 minutes with the unequivocal answer.  Two High Court cases clearly established the following - in case the Minister of State is thinking of appealing.  Ministerial guidelines are not prescriptive or mandatory, based on the decision in Brophy <i>v. </i>An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2015.  Section 31 of the 2000 Act does not entitle the Minister to impose by direction his own views on the proper planning and development of the area over those who are elected members of a planning authority based on a decision in Tristor Limited <i>v. </i>the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2010.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to explain the rationale and motivation for proceeding with the section 31 directive when both he and the Planning Regulator were aware of the case law?  If they were not, they most certainly should have been.  The question I asked originally was who regulates the regulator.  The answer is that it is the Minister of State.  I think he should do his job for the sake of the county development plans being prepared and save the rest of us from judicial review proceedings to no end because of the basic lack of knowledge by the current Planning Regulator in advising the Minister of State incorrectly.</p></speech>

I robustly defend their actions.  I know how hard they work and how well they are doing in their roles.  In his annual report, the Planning Regulator's detailed explanation of planning decisions taken throughout the country is exemplary.  Safeguards are built into the system through the primacy of the Oireachtas.  We hold the Planning Regulator to account with the Minister deciding whether to pursue a direction or recommendation issued to him.  In any case we must take all the factors into consideration.</p>  <p>  The county development plan process is working well.  In general, local authorities are passing all their county development plans and meeting their obligations on them.  Under the national planning framework, there is significant capacity for housing delivery across the 31 local authorities.  Nine local authorities need to increase their housing delivery by 100% while another 13 need to increase by 250%.  There is significant capacity for us to build on the opportunity provided by the Covid-19 crisis.  At one stage we had a system that provided enough zoned land to cater for an additional 10 million people but without correct infrastructure to underpin that development.  Through the plan-led system the Oireachtas has put in place, the Office of the Planning Regulator is a guardian into ensure we never go back to that day again and that the right development takes place in the right place.  I am proud of the development of the OPR and the role of my Department in ensuring that.  Nothing backs up assertion like the fact of 27,000 planning applications approved every year.</p></speech>

I have raised this matter previously.  Ultimately, we need to build homes, but we also need to ensure the national density guidelines are in keeping with ensuring that we get sustainable development.  The national density guidelines recommend between 35 and 50 units per hectare.  In many cases they are well above that now.  At above 35 units per hectare, only apartments can be accommodated, in many cases very high-rise apartments in mature areas.  In many cases developers are submitting planning applications to local authorities and including as part of the mix five-storey or six-storey apartment blocks, which in many cases may not get built, in order that they can continue to build starter homes.  The issue of traffic management and the impact it will have on an area does not appear to be factored into national guidelines in how particular planning applications are assessed.</p>  <p>  I am based in Limerick city.  I very much welcome the development under way in the building of homes.  However, in many areas, homes are being built but are ending up being interspersed with five-storey or six-storey apartment blocks in order that developers can get the densities to get the planning applications approved to enable them to build starter homes.  In many cases the cost of building apartments is 30% higher than the cost of building individual homes because the model means they need to build large apartments.  This is becoming a feature in areas such as Castletroy, Monaleen, Caherdavin, Dooradoyle and Raheen on the outskirts of the city.</p> <p> We need high densities in city centres and I want to see people living there.  In many cases, the location is the issue.  I have no particular issue with high densities along main thoroughfares but I do where there are existing or mature areas, including those with houses.  For a developer to get planning permission, they must go for apartments to get the required densities.</p> <p> We need to build starter homes and apartments in a sustainable way.  I call on the Minister of State with responsibility for the local authorities and planning to give a commitment to look at reviewing urban density guidelines.  I ask that he consider different measures as one size does not fit all.  Densities suitable for Dublin, for example, may not fit down the country and what is suitable for city centres may not fit in suburbs or rural areas outside city centres.  What might fit on a main thoroughfare in a suburb may not fit in a mature area.  I ask the Minister of State to undertake a review of the urban planning guidelines and look at them on a specific basis.</p> <p> Local area plans may have a density of 35 units per hectare and planners in the local authority in Limerick say this cannot be dealt with locally because national planning guidelines supersede the process.  It is a contradiction.  A local area plan may indicate what is sustainable but national policy appears to contradict it.  I am looking for a commitment that the Minister of State will carry out a review of the national density guidelines for residential housing, taking into account different density requirements outside Dublin, including Limerick and the suburbs rather than city centres.</p></speech>

Deputy Stanton and Councillor Anthony Barry, who works very closely with Deputy Stanton, have raised the issue consistently.  Project Ireland 2040 is the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland.  It includes the 20-year national planning framework, NPF, and the ten-year capital plan to 2030.  The NPF and Project Ireland strategy includes very clear objectives to significantly grow the regions by focusing on Ireland's cities, including in particular the four cities other than Dublin and on regional growth drivers and other key towns.</p>  <p>  A key outcome of both the NPF and national development plan is the compact growth of cities and towns of all sizes to add value and create more attractive places in which people can live and work.  The preferred approach is to focus on greater reuse of previously developed brownfield land, consolidating infill sites, which may not have been built on before, and the development of sites in locations that are better serviced by existing facilities and public transport.  However, the NPF also acknowledges that there is a need for more proportionate and tailored approach to residential development, especially in the context of the growth of regional cities and towns.  This means it is necessary to adapt the scale, design and layout of housing according to the size and type of settlement in which it is located and its proximity to centres and public transport services.</p>  <p>  Statutory "section 28" ministerial guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable residential development in urban areas were last issued in 2009, having been first introduced in 1999.  A preliminary draft of sustainable and compact settlement guidelines, SCSG, is currently being prepared for the purposes of screening to determine if a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, is required.  Following the completion of the SEA process, the draft SCSG will be placed on display for a focused period of public consultation.  Although there is no statutory requirement for public consultation, it is considered best practice to seek the views of planning authorities, practitioners, industry representatives and other interested parties.  Submissions can be made in due course.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, my Department is undertaking a targeted review on the update of the sustainable residential guidelines.  In the meantime I have issued a circular that the Deputy will be aware of.  It states: "It is necessary for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and planning authorities to exercise discretion in the application and assessment of residential density at the periphery of large towns, particularly to the edges of towns with a rural context."</p>  <p>  We must be clear that it is not a one-size-fits-all approach and there are communities and towns that should not be required to have a very high density level when it is not suitable for the area.  On the other hand, in very large city areas like the centre of Dublin, we must take into account the land values that underpin cities and make the most of that in terms of compact growth and carbon footprint.  A targeted review is under way and we will work through that.  I am happy to take into account Deputy O'Donnell's views on that.  I share his opinion and understand exactly where he is coming from.  The last thing we want is any policy putting out development that is not viable and will not be delivered.  We want to try to have sustainable communities across all tenures.  That is very important.</p></speech>

When will the review be complete?  The Minister of State must write to local authorities, as from my perspective in Limerick, local authorities seem to be taking the view that if they give planning permissions in line with local area plans of the order of 35 units per hectare or less, it will be overturned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is a need for real clarity around the matter.</p>  <p>  I invite the Minister of State to come to Limerick to see what I am speaking about.  There is an area in Castletroy where there could be over 700 houses going in and there are two roads leading to a traffic management bottleneck.  It does not seem to be taken into account by local authorities in the granting of planning permission.</p>  <p>  We want sustainable development.  I want to see apartment blocks but I want to see them in specific and sustainable locations.  Laws are being interpreted at a local authority level and for whatever reason there may not be a full appreciation of what the Minister of State has indicated this evening.  I ask him to write to the local authorities and tell them they have discretion and must consider the qualities of areas.  We need high densities in cities, for example, but that is not the case in mature areas where young families may make their home.  Putting blocks of five or six storeys in their back yards is not sustainable.  The same is true when we put in large numbers of houses and apartments in an area with serious traffic problems.</p>  <p>  We want people to use public transport but if a bus cannot get around a corner and an apartment block is put on that corner, it is not sustainable development.  There is a lack of understanding of how plans are processed.  The problem is that when planning permission is granted and the units are built, they will be there forever.  We are only on this Earth for a short period and people want to buy homes in which to rear children or just for themselves.  They put hard-earned money into buying them.  Through no fault of their own they can be in a position where a block of five or six storeys is in their back garden and that is not sustainable.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State for information on the timing of the review.  I also ask him to write to local authorities to reaffirm this position.  I look forward to him coming to Limerick city.</p></speech>

The review is expected to be concluded midway through 2022.  We should expect a number of submissions and they may be complex but the target is to have it completed by mid-2022.</p>  <p>  The circular was sent to all the chief executives in the country and the chair of An Bord Plean&aacute;la for its attention.  As the review is ongoing, we must monitor what results on foot of the issuing of the circular and what way decisions have taken account of it.  The sustainable settlement guidelines for communities are important and the new iteration must take into account a range of factors responding to the more effectively defined settlement hierarchies, as the Deputy outlined, of cities, towns and villages, as well as the different types of neighbourhoods.  In particular there are the outer suburbs, which are critical, as the Deputy mentions.  We must look at that.</p> <p>In addition, we should consider linking development criteria and standards to different settlement hierarchies, with greater utilisation of urban design frameworks and master plans to promote quality-led designs to ensure we have sustainable communities.  I take on board everything the Deputy has said and look forward to his submission in due course when the consultation process opens.</p></speech>

This is a challenging area and I congratulate the Minister of State and her team on the work they have been doing since she took up office.  I am quite impressed.</p><p>When children leave special schools, they often go into adult services.  The transport arrangements to special schools are good.  They have escorts and services and so forth, even though sometimes the special schools are too far away from the young person's home and he or she must travel long distances.  When children become young adults, they may still be vulnerable and it may still not safe for them or they may not have the ability to travel on their own, but they must attend an adult disability service or training centre which quite often are also located a long distance from their home, and no dedicated transport service is provided for that.  This can cause serious stress to parents.  If both parents are working, they cannot bring their child, who is now a young adult, to the centre.</p><p>I have asked a number of parliamentary questions on this and the Minister of State has responded saying, &quot;Some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded agencies on a discretionary basis, and a variety of transport solutions are pursued in different CHO areas&quot;, including travel training, local transport, and some service providers provide transport, where capacity exists.  It is very much an <i>ad hoc</i>, take-it-or-leave-it system.  It is the luck of the draw in some instances.  I have one particular case, and the Minister of State knows of it, which we have been working on since last September.  It is only yesterday they finally got a service, thankfully.  It took a lot of work and effort, and that should not be the case.</p><p>Will the Minister of State have a look at this whole area and see if we can put a service in place so that when these young people become adults, have to strike out on their own, and have to go to a service which is very often very far away from their home, they would have that transport service provided?  Even better would be if she could ensure the training centres were closer to the homes of these young people.  Many parts of the country, including my area in east Cork, do not have a training centre.  Will the Minister of State carry out a national audit of these centres, if it has not already been done?  There should be a training centre within 4, 5 or 6 miles of a young person's home or in the nearest large town where he or she can go and with which he or she is familiar.</p><p>When a young person turns 18 and becomes a young adult and goes to a training centre, his or her vulnerabilities still exist and he or she will still need the support to travel.  That young person cannot navigate public transport safely and parents worry about this.  To get back in the evening, maybe in the dark, is the other challenge.  I know of some parents who have actually given up their jobs.  I spoke to a parent today who took leave from her job, which has cost her a lot of money, to bring her child to a special school.  I know this is a different area, but this is something they should not have to do.  God knows they have enough pressure and worry about who will mind their young adult children when they get older.</p><p>We have made a significant amount of progress in this area, but there is still a lot to do.  This particular piece could be fixed and needs attention.  I know the Minister of State is doing her best in this regard and I want to support her in that work, as we all do.  There should be a seamless transition from second level to adult level services in regard to transport.  I look forward to what the Minister of State has to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100057#HHH00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I like how he said he wishes to discuss this issue, and that is exactly how he laid it out this evening.  The response I have is totally different from the answer needed to how the Deputy has presented this topic.  He is right: we do not do enough transition planning for where young people transition from second level education, whether it be in a special class, special school or special unit, to adult day services.  They are coming from a space where they are well supported, well minded and really well protected to a space where, although we have brought in annual funding since 2015 for young people to be able to access adult day services under the school-leaver programme, and this year we have &euro;34 million left aside for the school-leaver programme, regrettably, transport is not considered a core part of the HSE response to the school-leaver programme under the Department of Health.  That speaks exactly to the point about parents being stressed and worried about that transition planning piece.  It is unfortunate that sometimes a young adult has to give up a day attending a training centre or a day service to ensure the cost of his or her transport is protected.  Saying it is not a core health piece sometimes leaves me astounded.  We spend in excess of &euro;50 million annually providing transport for people to attend day services.  Since 2015, however, we do not provide any funding to support people in regard to this issue under discussion.  I totally understand why families are anxious.</p>  <p>  The positive piece that has happened recently is there has been a Cabinet subcommittee established to shine a light on this exact topic.  I am fortunate the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, with the support of the Taoiseach, are prepared to shine that light on it, with the acknowledgement that we need to do better transition planning.  We need to start planning in transition year as to what the needs and wants of individuals are.  We also need to be ambitious for young people as opposed to just saying they need to go to a day service.  We need to see what their needs and abilities are and support them to have that independent piece in the community.  The most important piece is you need to give them that support to access the community as opposed to saying there is a train nearby or a local bus they can use to go to a training service, without ever perhaps teaching or supporting them to understand the basics of accessing transport - going in the morning and returning in the evening.  We need to front-load the supports to build confidence into the young people.  It is something I would like to ensure we get funding for going forward.</p>  <p>  This year, I introduced a deferral programme to ensure it was not just a case that there was no choice for young people other than going to adult services.  I gave a deferral to allow young people to have the choice to go into further education, maybe something to do with literacy and numeracy through the further education and training, FET, system or a social work scheme.  It was to give young people choices.  I have seen the wonderful work done in respect of apprenticeships.  We need to show parents there are choices and options available.  The most important piece in this conversation, however, is that we need to be able to fund that delivery and continuum of services, so that you do not fall off the cliff edge, as it were, the minute you leave the leaving certificate year or turn 18 years of age.</p>  <p>  I am happy to work with the Deputy on this and have him part of other conversations that are taking place to ensure it happens and to bring confidence to parents that, as it were, you do not fall off that cliff edge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100057#HHH00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her positive response and encourage her to keep working on this.  Disability and intellectual disability are a continuum, as the Minister of State well knows.  Some children and young people, as the Minister suggested, can be trained and taught how to use public transport and navigate the system and so on.  There are others on the other end of the spectrum, however, who cannot and will never be able to do that and who will need to be guided and brought from the door of their home to the door of their training centre and back again.  If that is in a remote rural area, it is very difficult.</p>  <p>  What I want to see happening from next September on is that parents know who to contact.  Quite often, if they contact the service provider, the school or the training centre, it seems to fall on those to provide the service.  They are at a loss and say they do not have the resources or the know-how, that they cannot do and it is not their role anyway.  We need to have a situation where, every September, when these young people transition from second level to the training centres and workshops, to go to work like any other young adult who goes to work or further training does, that it is seamless, clear and painless for their parents, in particular, and that they know who to contact to get support.  The Minister of State could consider a one-stop-shop or a hotline that parents could ring up and explain their situation, that they are living in one place and their child has a training place in another location 30 miles away, where they could find out how to get their child from A to B safely, and explain that the child cannot navigate public transport safely even though he or she free travel on public transport, and that the parents would be very worried about putting him or her on a bus, especially if he or she had to change buses or services, as can happen in some cases.</p> <p>I am glad the Minister of State is taking this seriously.  I will support her, as would all of us here, in solving this problem.  I am sure it is not rocket science to do so.  There just needs to be a focus on it.  It is really great to see young adults like these, who face the challenges they face, being able to leave their homes and go out into the world, to a training centre with their friends or to other education and training.  In the past, young adults like these stayed at home and never got anywhere.  We need to do more to support them in getting there and in reaching their full potential.</p></speech>

Under the national disability inclusion strategy, issues facing people with disabilities such as transport issues must be addressed on a cross-Government basis.  These issues do not, and should not, fit into the Department of Health alone.  There should also be conversations with the Department of Transport to ensure that, when a national transport policy is being rolled out, inclusion is part of it.  It should criss-cross right across the country to ensure that people can use it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also brought up the idea of a national audit.  In 2022, I plan to do a national mapping exercise to see where we have day services, rehabilitative training services and residential and respite services so that we can see where the gaps are.  This will enable us to ensure we can meet the needs of individuals.</p>  <p>  We do not have a one-stop shop for issues relating to disability nor do we have a one-stop website in that regard.  I would like to break down the barriers between community healthcare organisations.  If one lives in Cork but near Waterford, one might not get funding because of X and Y.  We need to break down those barriers because parents do not know how to navigate them, although they probably do by the time their children have reached 18 years because they have been battling for 18 years.  We need a one-stop shop that is accessible and that allows for integration.  Regardless of people's location, they should be assured that they can attend a training centre and can have access to transport.  We should support people who want to progress and who can be assisted.  We also need to support young people for whom day services are the best option.  I acknowledge the work the providers do in trying to cut what is already very thin cloth even more thinly.  They do this incredibly well but, since 2015, the funding has not been there to support them.</p></speech>

It also hosts an RNLI lifeboat station that serves the bay of Dungarvan and the surrounding coastal zone.  A build-up of sand and silt in the harbour has resulted in it becoming inaccessible and unnavigable at low tide.  Fishing boats can neither enter nor leave the harbour, except at high tide, and the lifeboat is on restricted service.  This means it cannot launch for 90 minutes each side of low tide, which equates to approximately three hours out of every six and a half hours.  Necessary dredging has not occurred because of the prohibitive costs on the local authority to self-fund preliminary surveys and environmental assessments.  Until dredging is carried out, lifeboat services will continue to be restricted.  In the words of one RNLI worker, it is only by pure luck that the lifeboat has not been tasked to an emergency by the Coast Guard during these restricted service times up to now.  Not only is the situation affecting the ability of fishers to earn a living and to carry out their work safely, but it is actively putting lives at risk at sea.  I do not want to have to raise this matter with the Minister of State again in the wake of a tragedy at sea where lives have been lost due to the inability of a lifeboat to launch.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can provide funding for dredging.  This is important and necessary funding.  I welcome the funding that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine made available for a number of different harbours in County Waterford over recent months.  All of that funding is necessary.  However, funding for dredging does not cover the preliminary work, that is, the surveys and the environmental impact assessments that are required to be carried out before dredging can commence.  The cost of this work can often be as high as the cost of the dredging itself.  This is placing local authorities in a catch-22 position.  The Government will fund them to dredge harbours but will not fund the preliminary works it requires them to undertake to be allowed to dredge.  </p>  <p>  I am sure, because I have been here before, that the Minister of State will say that local authority funding is a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and that funding for day-to-day activities such as surveying and assessment is also a matter for that Minister.  I have heard that before.  However, when I talk to the chief executives of local authorities, they say they do not have the funding.  As the Minister of State will know, they have very tight resources when it comes to their core funding.  They simply do not have the ability to fund the necessary preliminary works.  All of this ignores that those surveys and assessments are not budgeted for anywhere and must come out of the local authorities' overall budget.  I am sure Members of this House who were councillors before arriving here will know that, if the local authority in Waterford was to provide funding for these preliminary works without that funding coming from some other source, other very necessary services in Waterford would have to be curtailed to make way for funding for these surveys and assessments to be made available.  In other words, the funding would have to come out of the local authority's budget.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister amend the regulations and expand the funding stream to cover the pre-dredging surveys and assessments to allow local authorities such as Waterford City and County Council to carry out the dredging works that are so urgently required?</p></speech>

Responsibility for the development and maintenance of local authority-owned piers, harbours and slipways rests with each local authority.  The relevant local authority in the case of Helvick Harbour is Waterford City and County Council.  However, as part of its annual fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has, in previous years, provided funding to assist coastal local authorities in carrying out small-scale projects for the development and repair of piers, harbours and slipways in their ownership.</p>  <p>  Under this year's programme, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, approved funding of &euro;4.2 million to assist coastal local authorities to undertake and complete 79 development and repair projects on local authority-owned harbours and slipways.  The package provides funding for maintenance and repair works in addition to supporting the ongoing development and enhancement of harbour facilities, including some marine leisure developments.</p>  <p>  Waterford City and County Council secured funding of &euro;510,000 under this year's programme to undertake five harbour development projects.  I am pleased to advise that a project to undertake upgrades to the pier in Helvick Harbour was approved for the maximum available funding for an individual project under the programme of &euro;150,000.  This follows on from previous funding of up to &euro;530,000 having been granted for projects in Helvick Harbour since 2010.  The Department's scheme remains focused on supporting actual works.  It is a matter for Waterford City and County Council to progress any preparatory studies, permitting and design reports.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McConaIogue, recently received the final report of the seafood sector task force, which was set up earlier this year to examine the impacts on the fishing sector and coastal communities of the trade and co-operation agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  The task force has recommended an initiative for the development of publicly owned marine infrastructure, with an emphasis on providing stimulus for economic diversification in view of the impact of the loss of fishing opportunities on coastal communities dependent on the fishing industry.  I understand that the Minister has asked Department officials to urgently examine the report.</p>  <p>  Should any application be made for funding by Waterford City and County Council under any future funding programme for actual dredging works or other eligible capital works at Helvick Harbour, it will be given due consideration, taking into account the terms and conditions of the scheme, the priority attached to the project by the council, available funding and overall national priorities.</p> <p> I will raise with the Minister the issues the Deputy outlined regarding the works in advance of the capital allocation being completed.  As Minister of State with responsibility for local government, I assure him we are working constructively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to finalise a Supplementary Estimate for loss of income in that sector to ensure it will have the capital and the funding to carry out its services in the ten months ahead.</p></speech>

Whether it comes from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not the issue for them.  The problem relates to when Departments operate in silos and there is not a joined-up approach.  On the one hand, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has indicated that it will fund the dredging or at least receive and process an application while, on the other, the local authority has stated that it does not have the funding to carry out the preliminary works, which can cost as much as the dredging.  When the funding from the former Department is not there, we end up with a chicken-and-egg situation whereby the lifeboat cannot be used at certain times of the day and fishers cannot use the harbour at certain times because of the build-up of sand and silt.  It is a matter of knocking heads together between different Departments or, as I suggested earlier, amending the regulations to allow the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to fund all the works, including the preliminary works, which are necessary for the dredging.</p>  <p>  I have raised this matter previously, as have other Deputies, but the dredging remains necessary at the harbour and the build-up is getting worse.  I visited the harbour recently with my colleague Deputy Mac Lochlainn, our party's spokesperson in this area, and we met fishers and others.  They are getting very frustrated and want a resolution.  Will the Minister of State convey this matter to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  I do not care where the money comes from, as long as it comes and the work can be done in order that the lifeboat can do what it needs to do and fishers can do what they need to do.</p></speech>

Between 2010 and 2020, 15 coastal local authorities benefited from grants under the scheme.  Over that period, the Department provided &euro;31 million in grants for investment in local authorities and infrastructure.  Approximately 14 piers in Waterford have benefited from one or more project approvals, to the tune of almost &euro;3.15 million over that time.  As for capital finance from the Department, we have increased the allocation, as I said earlier, from &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 in respect of the maximum funding for a project that can be undertaken.  Furthermore, in 2020, &euro;2.4 million was allocated to local authorities, with &euro;345,000 for projects in Waterford city and county.</p>  <p>  I hear what the Deputy said about vulnerable users and the lifeboat.  The Government takes such remarks seriously.  I will convey them to the Minister and ask him to respond directly to the Deputy on the case.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100059#KKK00500"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall take note of the Report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine entitled &lsquo;Issues impacting the Forestry Sector in Ireland,&rsquo; copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 2nd March, 2021. </blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputy Sherlock.</p><p>As Cathaoirleach of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I welcome the opportunity to open the debate on the report.  The committee held four meetings with stakeholders.  Since the publication of the report, we have held a further series of meetings but, unfortunately, the crisis in the sector continues.  I thank the committee secretariat and all the stakeholders that attended the meetings, as well as all the committee members, who put great effort into compiling a vibrant report that has much relevance to the crisis in the forestry industry.  Full implementation of the Mackinnon report is absolutely necessary.</p><p>Licences should not be required for thinning.  There is a deep crisis in regard to licensing and all stakeholders in the sector have become very frustrated with the process.  Thinning is an operation that allows a crop to reach full maturity, and it is nonsensical that foresters have to seek a licence for thinning.  Roads are also a big issue at the moment.  While licences are being issued for felling, access to the sites is restricted by the lack of road licences that are available.</p><p>The forestry dashboard is a welcome development borne out of deliberations at our committee meetings, but it needs to be more detailed, with the times the licences have been issued and the periods they have been in the system.  It has to be visible to everyone how long these licences have been in the system before they are issued.  With that, we would have a visual method for measuring how the Department is performing.  It is essential that details of the length of time licences have been in the system be published.  We need a forestry charter similar to that which operates in the farming sector, with strict agreed timeframes between stakeholders and the Department, and it needs to meet at least every quarter.</p><p>The programme for Government set out that we want 8,000 ha to be planted.  Unfortunately, in recent years, we have failed miserably to meet these targets.  Approximately 25% of the target is as much as we will accomplish this year.  That has been the position for years.  In light of climate change and the need to reduce emissions in the agrifood sector, forestry is the key to achieving those targets.  It is the cornerstone of doing so.  We can achieve it through forestry, which can have not only an environmental gain for rural Ireland but also an economic gain.  It is criminal that we are failing so badly with our afforestation targets.  In 30 years, people will question why trees were not planted in Ireland.</p><p>We have to ensure also that land is available for forestry and designated as such.  We have managed to greatly depreciate designated land and it is worth only 20% of what it was worth pre-designation.  There is a strong view that habitats for protected bird species and so on can be enhanced by varying stages of afforestation, as well as providing a green area.  This blanket ban was a national decision and it needs to be revisited immediately.</p><p>We are in the final stages of preparing our submission in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, for the period 2023 to 2027, with a new and enhanced environmental scheme as a key part of this plan.  In 2015, 852 farmers planted trees, whereas in 2020, that figure had fallen to 100.  The main reasons for this relate to the blanket ban on designated land and the fact green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, participants were prohibited from carrying out afforestation.  The new environmental scheme has to wrap its arms around forestry.  Farm forestry has to be one of the measures allowing farmers to achieve the maximum payment under the environmental scheme.  Environmental forestry measures have to be included to persuade the 50-plus farmers who will be in this new scheme to consider planting a portion of their farm and to ensure forestry will once more become attractive to farmers from an environmental and economic perspective.  I cannot stress enough that this new environmental scheme under the new CAP for the period 2023 to 2027 has to embrace forestry.  It must also be a measure by means of which farmers can obtain the maximum payment available.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Forestry measures must be counted as part of it.  </p> <p> The Minister of State should use her influence with members of the Cabinet to again move the premium back to a 20-year timeframe.  Stakeholders have lost confidence in the industry and a revamp will be needed to restore it.  Restoring a 20-year premium would have a major economic benefit for forestry and it would also be the stimulus to once again push forestry at farm level and to make it a viable economic option for a portion of farmers' land.  This endeavour must be financed by the Exchequer.  This is an essential point.  We cannot go robbing the CAP programme for this money, but scope exists to finance this undertaking through the Exchequer.</p> <p> Turning to the matter of ash dieback, this issue must be adequately addressed but that has not happened to date.  In 2012, we had 20,000 acres of privately-planted ash trees.  Unfortunately, at least 95% of those ash trees are now diseased.  Grants must be provided to allow sites to be cleared of diseased trees.  A scheme exists, but it must be enhanced.  Fair compensation must be provided to the owners of ash tree plantations affected by the disease, and people who choose to replant their plantations should then be allowed to receive premiums for those plantations in future.  If these people were livestock farmers - and we have seen this with pig farmers - who were unfortunate enough to encounter a disease that was entirely outside their control, they would be compensated.  I see no reason farmers who planted forestry should be treated any differently.  The advent of this ash dieback disease was completely outside their control.  We can get into an argument about what caused the disease to be in this country, but that would not achieve any objective at this stage.  However, we can say that the disease came in on imported plants.  Ash was a valuable cash crop for farmers who planted it and they have now been left with nothing but diseased trees.  If people choose to replant the area containing diseased ash trees, then it would only be fair that they would have access to premiums in this regard.  It would be a significant gesture to show that this Government is serious about forestry and about helping forestry owners.</p> <p> I stress that this is the only time I have seen a farming sector, and that is what farm forestry is, afflicted by a disease beyond the control of the people involved in the sector when the Government has not stepped in with some meaningful compensation for them.  Access to the premium over several years would not place a significant immediate burden on the Exchequer and it would be reasonable and fair for those plantation owners if that were to happen.  It would be a recognition of the great financial loss they have suffered.</p> <p> We have a sector under pressure.  It is a sector in which all the stakeholders have, unfortunately, lost confidence.  It is also a sector that rural Ireland badly needs, but not only rural Ireland.  If we are serious about addressing climate change and reducing our emissions, forestry will be the key component that will let us achieve that objective, which will also be environmentally friendly and economically friendly for rural Ireland.  I urge the Minister of State, therefore, to take on board the recommendations in our report.  Putting all our shoulders to the wheel, we can again get a vibrant forestry sector in rural Ireland.  I am a livestock farmer, but I fully understand the need for a vibrant forestry sector and that is what I, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and all the members of the committee want to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100060#LLL00300"><p>I thank Deputy Cahill for sharing time.  I congratulate him, as the Chairman, and all the members of the Joint committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for bringing forward this report.</p>  <p>  In the short time available to me, I acknowledge the work of the Social Economic Environmental Forestry Association, SEEFA, which as an organisation has done much to raise consciousness concerning afforestation and felling issues.  As we speak, in the shadow of the COP26 meeting, we are felling more trees and granting more licences to fell trees than we are granting licences to plant trees in the Twenty-six Counties.  We have the forestry licensing dashboard before us to show us proof of that.</p>  <p>  The total number of afforested hectares is 3,598, but for felling it is 24,185.  We are cutting down more trees than we are planting.  That is a real-time analysis of where we stand regarding forestry policy in this country.  The situation must be reversed.  In her speech, the Minister of State will tell us that more ecologists have been appointed.  That is all well and good, and I do not doubt the bona fides of the Minister of State.  However, I had a call from a woman in my area of Cork today who is tearing her hair out because she has been asked for another Natura impact statement, NIS, even though she has proposed a forestry plan to her consultant.  Something is still wrong in the Department regarding how felling licences are being dealt with.  Notwithstanding the appointment of more ecologists, a massive gap remains and the metrics show that clearly.  If the Minister of State delves deeper into the licensing process in a way that will ensure it will be possible to get rid of the low hanging fruit, no pun intended, to enable all the smaller applications be dealt with for felling licences, then she would be doing a good day&rsquo;s work.</p>  <p>  On the afforestation side, we take our lead from people such as Jo O'Hara and Deputy Cahill, as the Chair of the relevant committee, and the Mackinnon report concerning what needs to be done to ensure proper afforestation and the proper management and felling of our forests.  That must be done to ensure, in the shadow of the latest COP meeting, that we can sequester carbon and put in place, as Deputy Cahill said, through the next round of the CAP programme, a system that embeds the idea that forestry will become an integral part of that programme.  Farmers will not mind if such a system is part of Pillar 1 or Pillar 2 of CAP.  Forestry, however, must be embedded into eco-schemes and agri-environment climate measures.  It should be self-evident to everybody in the Houses of the Oireachtas that forestry must get the prominence it deserves.  It is a vital sector, and we must ensure that not only do we have a sustainable forestry sector but that we also recognise the potential that afforestation brings in helping us to meet our carbon emissions targets.</p>  <p>  I would also support any measures put in place to address the issue of ash dieback.  Those farmers, foresters and landowners are doing everything they can.  Again, they are also tearing their hair out because of the inaction of the Department on this matter.  We again have a situation where the facts speak for themselves.  We are importing timber for our sawmills.  On one hand, we have ash dieback, but, on the other, we do not know what kind of policing there is of pests such as the spruce beetle.  The controls in place do not allow us to know what is coming into the country and, therefore, we do not know what is coming down the line in the context of what is being imported.  We need the afforestation programme to at least hit a target commensurate with the programme for Government targets at a minimum.  When I sought, in my modest way, to have sectoral targets for forestry included in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, let us call a spade a spade and say that the Green Party Minister refused to accept that amendment.  We have a massive opportunity in this area and I welcome this report.  This is a timely debate, and I thank Deputy Cahill for sharing his time.</p></speech>

I welcome the interest and engagement from the members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the other Deputies in the Chamber.  The committee's report of March 2021 on issues impacting the forestry sector in Ireland was a detailed and considered analysis, with recommendations, observations and conclusions.  The recommendations were in line with many of my views and, indeed, I expressed that to the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Cahill, in my letter of May 2021.  Many of the recommendations in the report are being acted upon.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier in the Seanad when I spoke on the issue of forestry, I have come directly from COP26 in Glasgow.  The discussions on climate change and the need to move towards carbon neutrality were thought-provoking and resonated strongly with me and, I am sure, with many of the Deputies here.  Climate change is, without doubt, the challenge of our era and the one future generations will judge us on.  In that context, forestry and woodlands have very much to offer.  If we harvest our wood resource and unlock our potential for tree planting, we will have renewable resources and a consistent rate of carbon capture and storage to help us on the pathway towards significantly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>  I wish to make it clear that this Government is committed to the future of forestry in Ireland.  We recognise its importance to society, the natural environment and the fight against climate change.  It is our goal to deliver on our ambitions for forestry in the future.</p>  <p>  The committee's report welcomed the establishment of the forestry policy group and referred to the implementation of the Mackinnon report.  I set up Project Woodland earlier this year as a mechanism to reach consensus among a wide range of stakeholders and to oversee the implementation of Mr. Mackinnon's recommendations, which aim to ensure the current backlog in licensing is addressed and to bring a new impetus to woodland creation in Ireland.  As Members may know, the extensive stakeholder membership of the forestry policy group now forms the membership of working groups set up under Project Woodland.  I acknowledge the work of those stakeholders who have given their time and expertise to advance proposals under the project.</p>  <p>  One of the key areas highlighted in the committee's report is that of guaranteed timelines for issuing licences.  While we have been making improvements on this issue, the reality is that before we can agree on specific key performance indicators, certain aspects of Project Woodland must first be completed.  We have started a full and independent regulatory review of the licensing of forestry activities.  It is being led by external consultants and we expect them to report back next February.  It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing system as it relates to environmental and public participation obligations.  The question of a single consent covering planting, road construction, management and felling will be considered as part of this review.</p>  <p>  We have also had an independent systems analyst look at our processes.  She has submitted an interim report to the Project Woodland project board on this end-to-end process.  Hopefully, this will yield some process improvement gains in due course.</p>  <p>  Complementary to that are two proposals to help to improve the quality of applications received, which is an important aspect of service delivery.  The two proposals for the payment of an environmental planning grant and for a pilot project for pre-application discussions are well advanced.</p>  <p>  Some people are of the view that Project Woodland is not delivering as quickly as it should.  However, this is not easy work and, as most Deputies here will know, there any diverse views in Ireland right now on current and future forestry policy.  I am determined to build a vision and strategy that provides a place for new woodland creation while highlighting the multifunctional benefits this can bring. </p>  <p>  I will turn to specifically consider licence delivery.  I know it is a key area of concern that was highlighted by the joint committee and is a source of deep frustration for those within the sector.  We are moving in the right direction but it is important that this discussion is based on facts and the latest figures.  It is untrue to say that very few licences are issuing.  In the past two months, we have issued over 1,000 new licences.  This rate of licensing means that licences are issuing at double the rate of applications received and every week means a net reduction in the number of licenses on hand.  By October this year, we had issued more licences than in the whole of last year and we remain confident that we will issue over 4,000 licences this year, which will be 50% higher than last year.</p>  <p>  The volume of timber licensed this year is on track to be the highest ever licensed in a single year.  By the end of this week, we expect to have passed the 7 million cu. m mark.  The length of forest roads licensed this year will also be the highest ever.  It is already well ahead of the target in the climate action plan.</p>  <p>  Notable too is the number of private felling licences approved, which is something forest owners and those in the sawmilling sector have been calling for.  To date, we have issued over 1,000 private felling licences to farmers.  Coillte, which supplies 75% of Irish timber, is fully licensed for 2021 and we expect that its 2022 programme will be fully complete by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will recall, I introduced emergency legislation this time last year to make the Forestry Appeals Committee more efficient in how it conducts its hearings.  This has been remarkably successful and the committee now has 30 appeals to hear, down from almost 1,000 at the peak.  Appeals are still coming in but are now being dealt with efficiently and effectively, which was the primary purpose of the legislation.</p>  <p>  I am not claiming that everything is resolved; far from it.  I am well aware that the output in terms of afforestation licences has not kept pace with felling licensing.  Getting afforestation licensing back on track remains our main outstanding priority.  We are addressing that and now have ten ecologists dedicated to afforestation.  By their nature, afforestation licences are more difficult to process as they represent a change of land use activity and there are strict requirements in terms of assessment.  As things stand, there are 5,700 ha of approved lands available for afforestation and I would encourage every landowner with an afforestation licence to make use of it.  </p>  <p>  There has been some critical commentary about how long it takes to issue a licence and I fully accept it.  Right now, the average time for a decision on a forestry licence is about 11 months.  This figure is reducing all the time and we are working hard to reduce it further.  Overall, our improved output reflects our investment in resources within the Department.  As Deputy Sherlock pointed out, 27 ecologists are now working exclusively on forestry files.  We have also increased the number of inspectors and administrative staff dealing with forestry.  This was needed, given the complexity of the licensing environment and the increased need for public participation.  We are keeping resource requirements under continuous review, in line with one of the recommendations in the joint committee's report.  However, I firmly believe that issues in forestry now will only be resolved through a collaborative approach involving stakeholders, communities, State agencies, NGOs and farmers.  We must take a longer-term view and put in place a strategy which aims for consensus and a national vision for forestry.  This is why I established Project Woodland.</p>  <p>  A phrase I heard during my visit to COP26 was that if you want to get somewhere fast, go alone but if you want to go the distance, bring the team.  That is what I am trying to do with Project Woodland.  I acknowledge the members of my forestry policy group, all of whom are going the distance.</p>  <p>  Of course, Project Woodland is not only looking at licensing; it is also looking at a vision for the future which will chart the way forward for forestry for the rest of this century.  This renewed vision foresees the right trees in the right places for the right reasons and under the right management.</p>  <p>  The committee raised the issue of ash dieback, as did Deputies Cahill and Sherlock in their contributions.  The Department is preparing a report on the origins of ash dieback in Ireland to assess lessons learned for similar issues in the future.  We will share the report with the committee in due course.  The question of liability that would arise from restarting premium payments on the affected sites was considered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but found not to be feasible.  Additional payments have instead been made for site clearance and for the establishment of a replacement crop.  I have visited many sites of ash dieback and fully understand the devastation it has caused.  Some of those owners have availed of the reconstitution and underplanting scheme, while others have not.  I note and welcome the committee's support for the research into breeding for tolerance to ash dieback which is currently under way, with a number of trials established in Ireland and Europe.</p>  <p>  The committee also called for a strategy for the reconstitution of elm.  </p>  <p>Teagasc is interested in finding out about trees growing in Ireland that may be resistant to Dutch elm disease, and it will collect samples to verify resistance if landowners contact it.</p> <p> As a nation, we must think about what we want from our trees.  Everyone will get a chance to have their say as part of an extensive consultation process to create a shared national vision for what our forests will look like in the future.  Public consultation will include a public attitudes survey, deliberative dialogue and engagement with young people.  This will inform the design of the next forestry programme, which will commence in 2023 and address the issues raised by the committee in respect of its strategy to increase native broadleaf afforestation, highlight the importance of forests as recreational spaces and address the need to encourage farmers to participate in afforestation.</p> <p> We must also consider small-scale planting.  I would like to see every farmer in this country, where possible, planting trees.  To encourage that, and tackle climate change, we are drafting legislation that will allow small-scale planting of native trees, whether in groves on farms or as riparian planting to protect water quality.  Between this and measures that will be incorporated into our agri-environmental schemes and a fit-for-purpose new national forestry programme, the objective is to have many more trees covering our land over the next few years.</p> <p> I am concerned, however, that the public narrative on forestry right now is both too narrow and too negative.  Farmers are disengaging, and, for sure, and licensing delays have played their part in that.  However, woodland creation needs to be viewed as an opportunity.  It is an opportunity for farm diversification as well as for meaningful environmental measures by farmers.</p> <p> I thank the members of the joint committee and the House for their engagement this evening.  All of us need to recognise the opportunity that the expansion of the sector affords us as a nation in respect of our economy, environment and recreational needs.  I fully appreciate that delivery on licensing underpins its future development.  I am firmly committed to continuing our progress in dealing with the licensing backlog.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  I am here this evening as a Deputy from Cork East, a constituency that has a very large amount of forestry and timber processing.  I have often discussed these with the Minister of State.  I compliment the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Cahill, and Deputy Flaherty, who are Fianna F&aacute;il members, on the work they have done to bring this report to the House for discussion.</p>  <p>  It is extraordinarily prudent to consider this subject given the crisis that faces forestry in Ireland.  Much of the timber imported into the Republic comes into Cobh, a major town in my constituency.  That timber is brought to processing facilities right around the county.  I am particularly concerned, however.  The issue I want to raise this evening is the requirement for clarity.  I grew up on a farm, just as the Minister of State lives on a farm.  There is a need for clarification for those who wish to get involved in forestry.  At present, many are listening to our ongoing debates and taking note of many things that are discouraging them from getting involved.  We need to have trees planted in this country for climate reasons and for the commercial activity it brings to rural areas.</p>  <p>  An interesting point made to me by Forest Industries Ireland, which I thank for its ongoing engagement with me as a Deputy, is that every hectare of new forestry and its timber will offset 150 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in its lifetime.  Therefore, for every 1,000 ha of new forestry, 150,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide are removed from our atmosphere.  That is a staggering fact.  It is a clear incentive for the State to try to promote commercial forestry.  I am aware that environmental issues are important to the Minister of State and her party but, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, I want to try to be a voice for commercial forest activity because of the level of investment in jobs and enterprise.  Even in Fermoy, a small rural town in my constituency, approximately 150 jobs are directly supported by timber-processing facilities.  It is crucial, therefore, that we try to address the licensing issues.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State committed to having her Department issue 4,500 licences this year but I am concerned that this target looks like it will be missed.  I ask the Minister of State to put her shoulder to the wheel this month and in December, and even in early January, to honour the commitments we have given as members of Government parties.  Above all else, she should address the need for clarification.  If people want to get into the industry and if we want more trees planted, we must deal with the issues in front of us.  The work that Deputies Cahill and Carey have done along with their colleagues is very much welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100062#NNN00300"><p>The first line of the committee&rsquo;s report captures the main issues we are discussing this evening.  It states that it is a challenging time in the forestry sector.  The committee has repeatedly heard that it is a time of crisis.  The sector is expected to respond constructively to the current backlog in forestry licenses.  Ireland has a native forestry industry but the backlog has effectively curtailed domestic activity, leading to a reliance on imports.  This is just unbelievable.  Although the report was published in March, the situation remains largely unchanged.  Like other Deputies, I am regularly contacted by local forestry businesses, landowners and communities that are all deeply frustrated by the backlog in our licensing system.  Not only is this affecting the economic side of forestry but it is also preventing communities such as Kealkill in my area from planting trees.  They want trees in public spaces and on publicly owned land for people to enjoy, but it seems they may have to wait for two years to achieve that.</p>  <p>  While the new system brought in by the Government last year is processing more licences, it still seems to be very insufficient.  If the community of Kealkill is facing two years, the figures the Minister of State gave are confusing.  Are they just for felling or do they also include planting?  When she states the period is down to 11 months, does she mean applications such as the one in question will see a reduction as a result?</p>  <p>  I had tabled amendments to the forestry Bill that would have allowed for a more efficient system that would have balanced the commercial and environmental dimensions.  I specifically included amendments that guaranteed the timely processing of licences and appeals.  It was rejected by the Minister at the time.  The report from the Government-majority committee recommends an agreed timeframe should be introduced for licensing applications and the appeals process to provide certainty to applicants.  This is the very thing the Minister refused last year.  While I am aware it is common practice to reject every amendment coming from the Opposition, it baffles me that we have waited until now to do what I proposed when we could have done it initially.  The fundamental problem that existed before the enactment of the forestry Bill still exists in that licence appealed are not being decided upon in a timely enough manner.  Until it is addressed, this disastrous situation will continue.</p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the committee&rsquo;s call on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deliver a specific strategy to increase the proportion of broadleaf afforestation.  Planting the right types of trees is just as important as drastically increasing forestation.  Native broadleaf species are considerably better for our environment and are part of our natural heritage.  Only a few centuries ago, most of Ireland was covered in native woodlands with incredibly rich ecosystems.  It is possible to recreate areas of natural forest across the country, and this type of approach is essential to tackle the climate and biodiversity crisis.  Our focus should be on preserving and expanding our natural biome of primary deciduous forests.  There must be rewilding strategies and incentives to convert portions of land to native forest.</p>  <p>  Planting along watercourses is a natural flood prevention measure, while forestry on every farm would help to generate a connected wildlife corridor throughout the country.  I hope the committee will focus on that.  Unfortunately, I could not become a member of the committee, despite my best efforts.</p>  <p>  Connected to my point on biodiversity is the report&rsquo;s recommendation for greater supports to encourage farmers to enter and remain within a forestry programme.  Almost 20,000, or 15%, of farmers have diversified into forestry, resulting in 270,000 ha of grant-aided forest land.  However, this figure could and should be much greater.</p>  <p>  Speaking at a meeting of the committee, representatives of the IFA and other bodies highlighted the need for more incentives to help farmers to move to this model.  The MacKinnon review mentions delays, uncertainties and perceptions of excessive bureaucracy as disincentives to farmers.  I can speak from experience in that my family planted half the farm with native forestry around the time small dairy farms became unviable after the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, lifted the milk quota.  During the general election campaign, I remember somebody saying to me that they would not vote for me because my family had ruined the farm with trees.  I am aware, therefore, that we still have cultural resistance to forestry in this country.  There was resistance from my family too in that we always had livestock all over the farm.  It was a difficult transition but the forest is now genuinely everyone's favourite part of the farm.  That needs to be realised more broadly.</p> <p>We need a clear strategy to address these concerns and put all of the programmes in place that encourage planting of native broadleaf trees and provide income to family farms.  It is important to note the importance of the knowledge transfer programme for forestry and its continuation.</p> <p> The report also identifies the recreational input of forestry as natural spaces for families and communities to be active and have improved contact with the environment.  Last year, Coillte announced that nine Dublin forests would transition away from commercial activities of felling and replanting cycles and towards planting native broadleaf varieties.  At the time, I wrote to the senior Minister and met Coillte to push for a national roll-out of that approach.  West Cork already has amazing recreational forests, such as Glengarriff nature reserve and the woods at Dromkeen near Innishannon, but the use of sites that are currently only commercial would increase our natural and tourism resources.  I again call on the Minister to work towards ensuring this model is applied throughout the country and not just in Dublin.</p> <p> On a related matter, there are local concerns in respect of the sale of forestry land.  For example, a substantial section of forest near Riverstick in Cork is currently for sale on the instructions of Coillte and the local community is rightly concerned that it will lose that lovely natural amenity.  I am pursuing the matter with Coillte but, in addition, the Minister needs to review the practice in respect of the sale of forestry land at a time we should be greatly increasing afforestation.</p> <p> One of the most concerning findings of the Mackinnon document was the consistent theme that emerged during the review of a lack of political commitment and priority from the Government for woodland creation.  Only a fraction of the afforestation targets this year have been met.  Although the Mackinnon review referred to previous governments, it also seems to apply to this Government.  I hope that will change.</p></speech>

In 2015, 852 farmers planted.  In 2020, that figure is approximately 100.  That will drive home to the Minister of State the message in respect of what has gone on.  A year ago, all present supported her in the context of the legislation that was being brought in.  When she came before the committee, there was a backlog of 5,000 licences.  She spoke about how the Department has gone through so many licences.  Today, there is still a backlog of 5,000 licences even though there are now X amount of ecologists involved.  Whether we like it or not, 49 licences have been granted in afforestation in the past five weeks.  That is a fact.  The facts do not lie.  The reality is that since 2016, this country has failed on this issue.  The target that was set was to sequester more than 2 million tonnes of carbon in those few years but, over the lifetime of it, 8.6 million tonnes have been missed in targets.  That might stop a bit of the kicking of farmers that has gone on.</p>  <p>  Nurseries are in trouble, as the Minister of State is well aware.  I commend Deputies Cahill, Carthy and Flaherty, who are members of the committee.  The Mackinnon report needs to be resolved.  The likes of the thinning issues need to be resolved.  Where in the world, whether under a Green Party Minister or any other kind of Minister, would people in the green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme, be told they cannot plant trees?  That is what is happening under the current rules for GLAS.  Will those rules be continued when we head into the results-based environment agri-pilot, REAP, scheme?  If the Department keeps doing that, things are not going to get better.  Unfortunately, forestry has become a dirty word in farming communities.</p>  <p>  I wish to correct the record of the D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State said it was the most timber this year ever.  Actually, 57,000 ha was given out in 2019.  It is not me saying that; it is on the dashboard.  We are currently at approximately 20,000 ha, 21,000 ha or 22,000 ha.  Unless there were tr&aacute;in&iacute;ns in the stuff five or six years ago, there is a big difference in comparison with the figures the Minister of State has put out.</p>  <p>  Does she have faith that Project Woodland will continue?  I will call a spade a spade.  I am hearing that the Department is doing an interim report at the moment.  The news is fairly widespread that many of the participants are talking about starting to boycott it because they are fed up with going to meetings.  It is meeting after meeting; policy after policy.  They want delivery now.  They are clear on that.  Is the Minister of State confident they will not boycott Project Woodland?  Basically, there are a lot of people who are fed up with it.</p>  <p>  This narrative coming from the Department that in 2012 the habitats directive came in and then the Department had legal stuff to deal with does not wash for the simple reason that it was there for every Department.  It applied to the national parks, the forestry sector, whatever.  It does not work.  As I have said time and again, it is my honest view that if we keep playing the piano in the same way, we will hear the same song.  Unless we decide that an ecologist looks first and screens something out, these issues may continue.  What needs to be admitted here is that if a forestry inspector is in danger of being brought to court - there is a possibility of that through the environmental lobby - he or she is not going to screen something out and risk being brought to court because the minute he or she goes into the witness box, there will be questions about what qualifications he or she has and whether he or she is an ecologist or a hydrologist.  If the answer is "No", then it is game over.  What has to be done is the structure inside needs to be changed.  I will call it now.   Unless that is done - I do not think it will be done - we will be here until next year and the year after that talking about what we are going to do.  COP26 is basically talking about the targets of 7,000 ha that we are going to do.  I heard it announced at COP26 the other day.  That will be like a fairytale if we do not address the nuts and bolts of what is going on in the forestry sector.</p></speech>

There is a significant lack of confidence within the forestry sector at the moment.  In the past five years, we have gone from 16 farmers a week planting trees to just two doing so each week.  The saplings produced here are being exported to Scotland and timber is being imported into Ireland for processing here.</p>  <p>  A stark example of the current crisis is the ongoing delay in processing forestry licences which is fair on neither the applicants nor the people who are genuinely affected by an application to plant or fell trees.  This is sending out a message to farmers seeking to plant to steer clear of the forestry sector.  The target set for this year is the issuance of 28 more licences each week compared with 2020.  However, that cannot be the measure of success.  It must be assessed on the rate of net planting.</p>  <p>  At the same time that we are demanding that agriculture do far more to address the challenges of climate change, the single most effective tool to meet that challenge, namely, the forestry sector, is being ground to a halt as a result of an inaccessible licensing system and the lack of any overall constructive and can-do approach to afforestation within the Department.  There has been a dramatic decrease in the number of farmers involved in afforestation, leaving Ireland far short of the required target of 8,000 ha annual afforestation set out in the climate action plan.  In fact, this year we will achieve just one quarter of that.  We need a radical overhaul of the system to clear the bottle necks and ensure there are maximum timelines for the processing of licences.</p>  <p>  However, we need to go much further than that.  Afforestation must become a fully integral part of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the agri-environmental schemes.  At present, if you are on the GLAS scheme and you plant, you will have to pay back every penny you have received under GLAS.  That is not the approach that needs to be taken in the context of an environmental scheme.  We need to ensure that agri-environmental schemes actively encourage the planting of forestry.  There is no doubt that in order to provide sufficient encouragement for farmers to enter, re-enter or remain within the forestry programme, we must have sufficient supports in place.  Those cannot just be economic benefits, but also clear assurances of a fair engagement within and with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise a proposal that has been brought to me by students at Col&aacute;iste &Eacute;inde Galway who are seeking a children's forest, or foraois na bp&aacute;ist&iacute;, initiative.  The idea is that a native tree would be planted for every schoolchild on the island of Ireland and that those trees would be planted on a single site to create a national park dedicated to children.</p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, there is huge anxiety out there among young people, at the moment, in terms of climate change.  There are just over 800,000 schoolchildren in the country.  Would it not be great for the Government to introduce an initiative to plant a broadleaf tree for every single one of those children across the country so that everyone can be seen to do their bit?</p></speech>

Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will shut me up after four minutes to ensure that Deputy Nolan has enough time.</p><p>I must say that these debates feel a little like <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  We have had quite a number of them in my short time in this House, in this Chamber, in the Convention Centre and in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Regardless of all the spin, there is no hiding from the truth that while the Minister of State and other Ministers were over at COP26, farmers and landowners were outside of the gates of this House protesting for the right to plant trees.  It is bizarre.  To me, it spelled what is a crisis.</p><p>There is a tale of two countries and two governments.  The Scottish Government employed the services of a consultant, James Mackinnon, to make recommendations in relation to resolving their forestry crisis.  An Irish Government did the same.  Following the completion of the Mackinnon report in Scotland, within 24 months the Scottish forestry sector saw the annual afforestation rate rise from 4,600 ha to 12,200 ha.  They are now setting targets of 50,000 ha by 2024.  The Irish Government compiled the commissioned report, received the Mackinnon report, and what did it do?  It carried out a review of the report, followed by an analysis of the report.  Now it is carrying out a review of the analysis of the review of the Mackinnon report.  I do not have a hard copy of the Minister of State's speech, so I cannot count the number of different reviews and assessments that she announced today.  I lost count after I heard about the independent systems analysis, which is among the different reviews that the Government is carrying out.</p><p>There is a crisis ongoing.  In terms of spelling it out clearly, the programme for Government outlined a target.  It was the only target in the programme for Government relating to the Minister of State's portfolio.  It stated that the Government would plant 8,000 ha per year.  The target was not reached last year.  Around a quarter of it was delivered.  This year it might even be less than last year.  When the climate action plan was published last week, it was interesting to note that in the 200 pages or whatever of targets and objectives, no reference was made to the hectarages of afforestation that the Government plans to plant.  The answers are in front of us; we know what they are.  They are in the Mackinnon report, the review of the Mackinnon report and in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was actually published back in March and related to deliberations that commenced this time last year.  The answers are there.  They have been spelled out.  We need to get to a point where they are actually being implemented.</p><p>Yes, sometimes there are improvements.  I accept that over the past number of months there has been movement in terms of felling and forest road licensing, but the afforestation rates are absolutely scandalous.  The CAP strategic plan that was published barely referenced forestry at all.  To reiterate what others have said, if we have an agri-environmental scheme that actually excludes forestry and organics, that will be an absolute travesty on part of the Minister of State's Department.  The Mackinnon report clearly sets out roadmap through which we can deliver what forestry is supposed to do.  I have said, on a number of occasions, that a forest should be something that people want to live beside.  It should be good for the economy, the environment and local communities.</p><p>Finally, the Minister of State mentioned the collaborative approach and all of the parties that need to be part of that.  Her own Department was not mentioned on that list.  That is where the change is required.</p></speech>

We have brought this issue up so many times at a cross-party level.  It is shameful what is happening in our country.  Timber is being imported.  The Government is missing its own climate change targets.  That is crazy.  The afforestation target was to plant 8,000 ha annually, and the Government is missing that target.  That does not inspire confidence in any farmer to plant trees.  The Minister of State needs to prove herself and listen to us.  The frustrating thing for us all is that many of us put forward solid and good amendments asking the Government to put timeframes in place in terms of the processing of licence applications.  It refused to do so.  It refused to collaborate and rejected all of those amendments.</p>  <p>  Today, I am asking again for a timeframe to be put in place for every licence application, whether it is for a felling licence or an afforestaton licence.  It is an important sector for us.  It contributes &euro;2.3 billion to our economy.  The Minister of State does not seem to grasp how important it is for farmers, foresters, sawmills and everyone in the sector.  Our sawmills are going through a difficult time again.  We have raised the issue with the Minister of State over the past year and a half, but she has not taken anything on board.  She made reference in her speech to teamwork and working as a team.  I sincerely hope she puts that into practice and starts listening to the stakeholders, who are telling me that Project Woodland is failing miserably because it has not done what it was supposed to do.  That is the bottom line.  The Government needs to take urgent action to save a sector that is on the brink and to save 12,000 jobs, a big proportion of which are in the Minister of State's constituency of Laois-Offaly, as she well knows.  </p>  <p>  We do not need any more reports.  I have said that in a number of conversations I have had with foresters.  A number of Deputies in the constituency of Laois-Offaly met the stakeholders.  We do not need more reports from the Government; we need action.  The Minister of State needs to prove herself and save the 12,000 jobs that are now on the brink.</p></speech>

They gave us the roads and the aqueducts.  What has forestry ever done for us?  It gives us the air that we breathe, sequesters the carbon, filters the water, regulates the weather, provides a place for animals to live, creates the biodiversity we need, gives us fuel if we use biomass fuel correctly and provides amenities.  I could go on.  In fact, forestry does everything for us.  Without forestry, there would be nothing.  It can help solve the existential crisis that we face in terms of the climate and it can provide jobs and a living for farmers and those working in the sector.</p>  <p>  That is the possibility that the students in Galway and the climate protesters grasp.  What is the reality of the Irish forestry sector?  It is totally broken.  It is a broken model of forestry.  The licensing debacle is a symptom - not the cause - of a broken forestry model.  Of course, it needs to be addressed.  We have been talking about the ecologists and so on for years, but it runs much deeper than all of that.</p>  <p>  In preparing for this debate, I went back to a motion that I brought to the House on 27 February 2013 to oppose the then plan to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte, which had been agreed by the Fine Gael-Labour Government at the time.  I argued for all the things that we are arguing for here, including a different forestry model, a focus on native woodland, a support for farmers applying to plant trees, and so on.  It really tells a story, because at that time, the targets for afforestation were 10,000 ha to 15,000 ha a year.  The objective was to get to the EU average level of 30% forest cover.  Now the targets are 8,000 ha - half that - to get to 17% forest cover.  This is against an actuality of around 2,500 ha being planted, woefully missing the targets, as we have every single year.</p> <p>Our forest estate is one of the only forest estates in Europe that is a net carbon emitter because we have a fundamentally misconceived forestry model, which is about monoculture and exporting pulp to the UK, with 90,000 truck journeys every year blasting out carbon instead of having a forestry model that is sustainable and can create employment.  To make a comparison with a country half the size of Ireland that knows how to do forestry, in Switzerland there are 100,000 people working in forestry.  In Ireland, which is twice the size of Switzerland with better conditions for growing trees, we have 12,000 people working in forestry.  It is fundamentally broken.</p> <p> As well as the fact we need to bring in payments for farmers so they have a viable income if they plant trees as part of CAP and they do not have all of this bureaucratic nonsense to deal with, a big part of the problem is that we need to change the mandate of the State forestry company.  In the past week, I discovered that while the Minister was in Glasgow and the Taoiseach was saying we are going to protect the trees and take climate action, the State forestry company was trying to sell off a forest in Enniskerry, just as it tried to do in 2013 with the entire forest estate.  Only because people acted did we stop it doing so.  We can go through the list of the forest sales by Coillte.  The sale to Apple in Athenry is unbelievable.  Coillte sold 200 ha for a data centre in Galway.  It is unbelievable.  In the Kilcooley Abbey Estate, 950 acres were sold by Coillte and the following day, the person who bought it for a reported &euro;1.5 million was boasting that it was probably worth &euro;10 million.  There is something fundamentally wrong.  We need to change the mandate of Coillte.  We need to support the farmers in expanding the forest estate and have a fundamentally different sustainable forestry model.</p></speech>

Zero progress has been made on afforestation, with fewer than ten licences issuing each week and a two-year waiting list.  I was probably naive when I became a member of the committee 15 months ago and I heard the scale of the problems in the sector.  I said it would be sorted out within a year.  Like many Members today, it is <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  We are still discussing the same problems.</p><p>The afforestation sector is on its knees and Irish farmers' confidence in forestry is completely undermined.  The single biggest issue is getting farmers to plant trees.  This is as a result of the delay in licensing.  There is too much uncertainty and bureaucracy for them.  Farmers are losing millions of euro in lost timber revenue because they cannot harvest when they want.A total of 700,000 tonnes of logs have been lost to licensing delays in the past two years.  This has hit forestry owners and sawmills.  As a card-carrying member of the Government, it gives me no satisfaction to say the forestry sector is rapidly losing people because of the Government's inability to deliver licences.</p><p>The Government prides itself on its green agenda and an ambitious climate action plan but unless we urgently address the forestry crisis we are no more than disreputable used car sales people if we try to talk about climate action.  The climate action plan will be undermined completely if we do not see a huge increase in new planting.  Each year, we miss out on millions of tonnes of carbon sequestration.  There is a yawning gap between our ambition for tree planting and what it is delivering.  The industry stakeholders and the joint Oireachtas committee which is so ably led by my colleague, Deputy Cahill, have not been found wanting when it comes to offering solutions.  As Deputy Carthy, my colleague on the committee, said, we stood at the gates of Leinster House last week with exasperated forestry producers.  These are people who would much prefer to be knee deep in a forest than standing at the gates of Leinster House.  They came there to stand, just as people involved in peat came to stand, because, unfortunately, the Government, and, I will add, my Government, is failing these people.</p><p>We need to completely revamp our regulation of forestry and fast-track changes to the system, specifically with regard to licensing.  The process is not fit for purpose and needs to be comprehensively reformed.  The Department needs to get serious about forestry and support the sector.  We need to find a way to meet the Government's ambitious tree planting targets and our climate goals.  We need a new forestry programme that will encourage and incentivise farmers to plant trees.  We need to re-energise and reward our forest sector.  We need to start supporting it rather than holding it back.  I plead with the Minister of State to take to heart the crisis in the sector.  We have too much to lose with inaction at this time.  I appeal to the Minister of State to please resolve the forestry issue.</p></speech>

I will not pile on because there has been a lot of criticism here this evening.  I must say the criticism of the system is justified.  We have many systems that need to be improved in this country but I cannot think of a system that operates worse than the licensing system at present.  It clearly has failed very badly and continues to fail.  There is no way we will meet the targets for the foreseeable future with the system the way it is.  I appeal to the Minister of State on behalf of the constituents I represent to please prioritise reform of the system.  Will the Minister of State publish a written plan for us on what will be done, what the targets will be over the coming 12 months and how she will address the huge backlog in licensing?  It really has frustrated so many people.</p><p>Some people are at their wits' end and are very distraught about this.  I am very frustrated.  I have tabled a raft of parliamentary questions on this over the past 12 months.  I have tabled countless questions trying to prioritise this issue and move it along.  It seems to be getting worse rather than improving.  It is a massive challenge for the Minister of State but I am confident she will do her very best to try to address it on behalf of the people who depend on the sector.</p><p>During the week, I was informed that 12,000 employees is more than Twitter, Facebook and Apple put together.  The Minister of State can be sure that if there was a regulatory problem of this nature affecting those companies it would be sorted very quickly.  For some reason, because it is an indigenous industry and a native industry, there seems to be less of a &quot;can do&quot; attitude.  Michael Collins was writing about the potential of Irish forestry 100 years ago in <i>A Path to Freedom</i>.  He wrote very well about how much potential there was.  We have not achieved that potential.  This is not all the fault of the Minister of State as there is a century of underachievement.  Surely what is happening now in forestry is the mother and father of all underachievement.  I appeal to the Minister of State to redouble her efforts to try to sort this out.  It is costing many people so much heartache.  As has been referred to, it is also inhibiting our chances to put up houses for people with regard to providing timber for the industry.  It is a massive disaster.  I ask for more flexibility in future for farmers in terms of land use for forestry to try to encourage it.</p></speech>

I have listened to all of the debate and I agree with many of the contributions that have been made, including the criticisms.  I know they are difficult and I do not wish to personalise it.  I do not hear a sense of urgency from the Minister of State.  It may be that it is like a swan gliding through the water and underneath something is furiously happening.  I hope this is the case.  We really do need a sense of urgency.  The only place I am hearing urgency is on the television with regard to COP26 and climate change.  There is no sense of urgency, and farmers are seeing no urgency, with regard to their applications to plant trees or to cut the forestry they have planted, perhaps to replace it with something more environmentally sustainable.</p>  <p>  I agree with what Deputy Boyd Barrett said about the type of forestry we are carrying out in Ireland.  It is not environmentally sustainable.  I invited the Minister of State to Cappabane to see what Coillte has done there and she did not come.  She visited Scariff and the Irish Seed Savers Association.  I applaud what they are doing and they are great people.  I ask the Minister of State to move outside her comfort zone.  Stop talking to the converted and talk to farmers, ordinary people and land owners.  They are the ones who are the future of afforestation in Ireland if there is going to be one.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Above all, the Minister of State needs to back up the talk with actions, which have been singularly missing up to now.<br/><br/>I hope we are about to see a change because all the talk in the world about afforestation in Glasgow - one can fly anywhere in the world and produce grandiloquent statements - is completely worthless unless it is backed up by what farmers are experiencing on the ground.  We need action now as we are nearly half-way through the lifetime of this Government and we need it soon.<br/><br/>I will hand over to Deputy Cahill now, as he was kind enough to give time to me, but we need action soon.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has heard the passionate pleas of Members here.  The Ceann Comhairle has commented on the remarkable number of contributors to this debate on a Thursday evening.  There is great concern for the forestry sector but there is also a great realisation of what the forestry sector can do for rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  I will mention forestry contractors, who are often forgotten in the debate about forestry.  Those contractors have come under significant financial pressure over the past number of years because of the low output of felling and afforestation licences.  I ask the Minister of State to meet and talk with their organisation.  Many of them have serious financial issues facing them.  They also have lost their skilled labour force, who obviously were not prepared to stand idly by when no work was there for them.  These contractors have serious issues at the moment and I ask again that she meet and talk with them.</p>  <p>  As a Government Deputy, I cannot accept her answer on ash dieback.  These forestry owners, through no fault of their own, have suffered significant financial loss and it would be a meaningful gesture from the Government to allow them to draw a premium on their re-plantations in the future.  As for saying that is not going to be accepted, I will continue lobbying as a Government Deputy to ensure that those plantation owners get some semblance of fair play as it is completely essential for that to happen.  It would show that the Government is serious about forestry and forestry owners.</p>  <p>  My final point for the Minister of State is that this industry is at a serious crossroads.  We have the review of the CAP and this plan for the next five years is being finalised.  Forestry has to be part of that plan.  It has been said by numerous speakers during this debate that it is completely nonsensical that a farmer in an environmental scheme cannot participate in forestry.  Those two things must be married together for the next five years.  If the farmer is therefore entering an environmental scheme, forestry should then be part of that if the farmer chooses.  When a farmer sits down with his or her consultant to draw an environmental plan for his or her farm, that farmer can introduce forestry measures into that, whether it is to plant into the corner of the field or more extensive planting and that that can be incorporated in the environmental scheme.   If we are going to make any serious attempt at reaching the target in the programme for Government of 8,000 ha, that is the avenue we must use.  If we close off that land availability this time around, as we did with GLAS, we will stay at 20% to 25% of our targets for afforestation.  This country just cannot afford that, whether it is for climate change and the reductions of our emissions or for the survival of our forestry sector.  I impress upon the Minister of State the need to ensure that the plan going to Brussels has forestry married into the environmental schemes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-11a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1661" speakername="" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100066#RRR00500"><p>If I have to be less calm, I can be but certainly, I wish to reassure all the Deputies that this is being taken highly seriously.  As I said, since taking up this role this issue has been on my desk and has been spoken about in my Department every single day.  Progress, despite what people might think, is being made.  This time last year, the crisis on the table was a supply of timber into the sawmills, where there was a deadlock in the appeals system.  That was the legislation that I brought in this time last year.  It only related to the appeals and had nothing else in respect of forestry licensing.  It was to deal with the appeals and it dealt with them swiftly and effectively and we are in a situation now where we do not have a backlog in respect of the appeals.  I accept that we have backlogs in other aspects but the situation for the sawmills is not as it was this time last year.  There is a fairly steady supply of timber into the sawmills at the moment and that has been the case.  </p>  <p>  I accept what a number of Deputies have mentioned about importation.  Ireland has always imported timber, albeit not as much as we have in the past number of months.  I understand, however, that that level has dropped off as the domestic supply has increased.  We are a timber exporting nation.  We import and process here and we re-export.  That is the business we are in, whereby we are a net exporter of our timber products.  </p>  <p>  There is a lot of hyperbole and strong language used and it is unfair to the wider sector to speak of it as one that is on its knees and collapsing.  It is not on its knees.  I accept there are issues with afforestation and that there are individual issues with licences for felling, thinning, for roads and so on.  Afforestation is a matter of great importance which we have to get right.  It is a priority.  As I indicated, we have moved resources into afforestation to drive that on.</p>  <p>  I come back to the fact that there are 5,700 ha of afforested, licensed land at this moment ready for planting.  Whether it is a lack of confidence or whether people have changed their minds, we need to understand why people changed their minds and why they do not want to plant.  It has been the case for years and years-----</p></speech>

That is an issue because the resources used to generate and issue those licences are essentially going to waste.  I encourage forestry companies to get in touch with their clients to try to encourage them to plant those trees because we need them planted in the ground.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carthy referred to the Scottish Government and there are many similarities between us and Scotland but there are also dissimilarities, which is certainly the case in terms of the average size of plantations in Scotland versus Ireland.  We are a percentage of what those are and we tend to have smaller plantations, each one of approximately 7 ha on average requiring an individual licence.  Clearly, the streamlining of the licensing processes has to be a priority because we need a fit-for-purpose licensing system.  If we are struggling to issue 4,000 licences here, we are going to struggle to try to hit our targets into the future.  That has to be looked at and is why we have an independent review.  Deputy Carthy can criticise reviews all he likes but they are necessary.  If we did it internally within the Department, we would be criticised that the Department is doing its own review which is no good.  That is why we are doing an independent review to look at the regulatory process and to see how we fit in with the environmental requirements from the EU level.  I am hoping that this comes back to us and informs us about how we drive on and deliver because we have to plant.  </p>  <p>  I also indicated in my speech that we are looking at smaller-scale planting of native species only.  It could be for the repairing of margins or those corners of fields.  As the Deputies may or may not know, we count anything over 0.1 ha, which is about 30 m x 30 m if one was to plant a block, as requiring a licence.  We only account in our forestry inventory for areas planted over 0.1 ha.  One could have 100,000 plantations of less than 0.1 ha across the country and they would not count for anything.  They are still trees on the ground and would offer value but we are looking to increasing that threshold so we can plant a bigger area of perhaps an acre or somewhat above the 0.1 ha level-----</p></speech>

They can, however, be accounted for in our carbon inventory and are good for biodiversity, water quality and so forth.  That is important.</p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett highlighted quite clearly the benefits of trees, as did Deputy Cairns.  </p><p>As to the nurseries I have met their representatives and the single biggest thing we can do for the nursery sector is to get the licensing process fixed and to encourage afforestation.  I certainly would like to think that a smaller-scale planting model might also help with the nurseries.</p> <p>I talk to farmers every day, and I know and accept the frustrations out there.  I take phone calls most days about licences and I am probably writing and signing endless letters for people.  Some people's cases get resolved, while others do not.  Deputy Cairns asked for specific details.  I do not have them, but the average time for a licence is 11 months.  It is still too long, but in terms of the certainty that farmers need, we are working on bringing that time down.  </p> <p> We have to instill confidence in farmers to plant trees.  That is why I worry about the narrative out there and the negativity associated with forestry.  It is hard enough to even think about planting trees, even back in the good old days.  In this country, forestry was considered a move away from farming and people were not seen as farmers if they were planting trees.  It was thought that they had abandoned their land.  That cultural aspect is still lingering at the backs of people's minds and we have to get rid of it.  In the past number of months I spoke with the ambassador to Finland and the Finnish Minister for agriculture.  People are not farmers in Finland unless they have trees.  It is the total opposite of the attitude here.  Collectively, we need to encourage our farmers to get involved in tree planting and support that.  The Government obviously has a significant role to play in supporting that.</p> <p> With regard to this being incorporated into CAP, there are tree planting measures in the next policy's strategic plan.  It is not afforestation under a strict definition, but we must remember that the CAP strategic plan lasts for five years and we support afforestation from Exchequer funds for much longer periods.  I wonder how we could incorporate that balance.  By all means, afforested land is still eligible for BPS and that is a good thing.  I do not know whether we could incorporate that into a CAP plan for such a short-term period.  We do not know what will lie ahead for the next round of CAP.</p> <p> Everything is being taken incredibly seriously by me and my officials in the Department.  If we could all click our fingers, wave a magic wand and fix this, we certainly would.  I do not believe that there are any silver bullet quick fixes.  We are examining every opportunity and exploring every possibility of streamlining the process to make it simpler.  We are obliged under EU and national laws to do things properly.  We must not forget why we are in this situation now compared to three years ago, and what has happened in between.  We have to navigate our way out of this in the best way.</p> <p> I have confidence in Project Woodland.  The people in my forestry policy group have been dedicated over the past year.  This is challenging and I know they are frustrated.  Some of them are very frustrated, but they are working together.  If people were to drop off, it would be a sad state of affairs.  Maybe people in opposition think it would be great to see the project fail, but I do not think it would be a good thing.  I want it to succeed.  I believe people are working well together and it will succeed.  I look forward to the day when we have a smooth functioning forestry licensing system, hit our afforestation targets for once and meet some climate change and climate action goals.</p></speech>
