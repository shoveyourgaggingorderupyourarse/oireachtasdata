Morale is very low across all grades and levels of people working in the health services.  Pressure undoubtedly is rising, as health needs and pressure on staff are becoming more acute.  The pressure is never-ending.  Retention of key staff has become very problematic.  Against this background, further significant disruption will occur tomorrow morning if the proposed strike involving attendants, porters, catering staff, and so on goes ahead.  It is clear that there will be serious disruption to day cases, outpatient treatment and elective inpatient procedures.  As Dr. Fergal Hickey said this morning, there will be delays and patients who are either in hospital or are trying to get into hospital tomorrow will endure great inconvenience.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed to this job evaluation scheme during the negotiations on the last public service stability agreement.  This was not foisted upon the Government by the Opposition; it readily entered into it.  The agreement confirmed that pay rises worth between &euro;1,500 and &euro;3,000 per employee per year were justified.  This was accepted by the HSE and by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The strike was averted last week.  The issue being highlighted in the D&aacute;il was constructive and a catalyst in that regard.  From the Taoiseach's reply's last week it seems that he and the Government agree that the pay increases recommended by this job evaluation scheme should be honoured.</p><p>He said: "The dispute is around the implementation of these pay increases."  Will he confirm that the Government accepts that the recommendations emanated from the job evaluation scheme reports?  Does he accept that this is a process that was agreed to in 2015 and that the Government agrees that the various increases will need to be paid?  The latest developments suggest the Government wants to drag out the process to 2022 with what the Minister, Deputy Harris, describes as a significant offer.  Will the Taoiseach clarify and state transparently that the Government's latest position on the job evaluation scheme and the pay increases recommended under it?  It seems that there has been a collapse of trust - a breakdown of trust - between the Government side and SIPTU.  SIPTU is arguing that the Government has abused the conciliation process and never meaningfully engaged with SIPTU representatives.  Is that the case?  Has the Government been foot-dragging on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500004#B00200"><p>I take the opportunity to offer my condolences to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on the death of Councillor Manus Kelly in the past couple of days.  He was a phenomenal motor sportsman and must have been enormously proud to have been elected to Donegal County Council for Letterkenny.  I offer our condolences to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on what must have been very shocking news in the past few days.</p>  <p>  On the dispute, as the Deputy pointed out, we have many people working in the health service.  About 115,000 people work across the public health service, which represents an increase of about 10,000 in three years.  Notwithstanding the genuine difficulties we have in recruitment and retention, we have still managed to recruit an extra 10,000 staff in the past three years.  It is a challenging environment in which to work, not least owing to rising demand as the population increases and ages and also the increasing expectations of patients and service users of the kind of service they should receive.</p>  <p>  There has been detailed engagement involving the parties to the dispute, most recently at the WRC, both yesterday and this week.  The dispute relates to a particular pay increase arising from a job evaluation process.  All 10,000 of the staff involved will receive a pay increase of 2.75% this year.  That is in the bag and half of it has been paid already, with the rest to be paid in September.  The vast majority will also receive an incremental pay increase.  It is about the timing of a third pay increase this year - the pay increase that arises from the job evaluation process.</p>  <p>  The Government accepts the outcome of the job evaluation process.  What is in dispute is how it will be funded, how it will be timed and, therefore, how it will be phased in.  The initial response from the Government side - the employer's side - was that it should be paid in 2021 when all of the evaluation process was complete.  It is not yet fully complete; I believe three phases of five have been completed.  However, to try to come to an agreement in the past couple of days, the employer's side - the Government side - agreed to begin to phase in the pay increases this year.  Even though there is no provision for it in the budget, out of good will and in an effort to resolve the dispute, an offer was made to begin phasing in the increases from 2019.  It will be a third increase on top of an incremental pay increase and the 2.75% being received under the public service stability agreement, PSSA.  Unfortunately, the offer was not accepted by the unions which have now decided to go ahead with the strike.  The offer made last Friday stands - for the dispute to go to the Labour Court for binding arbitration.  Where disputes cannot be resolved, where they are intractable, where it has not been possible to find a compromise at the WRC, in the past we have gone to the Labour Court.  The employer's side - the Government side - is willing to go to the Labour Court for a binding determination.  We regret that the union side is not willing to do so.  It is unusual for a union to refuse to go to the Labour Court.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500004#B00300"><p>I acknowledge and accept the Taoiseach's expression of sympathy on the shocking and untimely passing of Manus Kelly who would have been an outstanding public representative for us in the Letterkenny electoral area.  Our thoughts are with his wife, Bernie, family and friends.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that SIPTU is reluctant to go to the Labour Court because it has the sense that the Government has been dragging its feet and that it has not been serious about implementation of the job evaluation scheme recommendations, a process that has been dragging on since 2015.</p><p>The background is that the Government agreed the process that far back.  It is, therefore, striking that the Taoiseach acknowledged today that it has not been provided for in the budgetary figures.  He said, however, that the Government has accepted the outcome and that he accepts that the increases will have to be paid.  I take it that is his position, because last week the Opposition was berated for suggesting the very same thing and for even raising the issue.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach said that we are down now to the implementation phase of the recommendations but that there are has been a breakdown in trust.  The union side clearly does not trust the Government on this issue, and I would appreciate his comments on that fact, hence the reluctance, it seems to me, on the union side to go to the Labour Court.  Every effort must be made on all sides to avoid a strike tomorrow.  Last week, thankfully, the strike was averted, but we face three more days next week and significant disruption for patients, who must take centre stage in our considerations.  </p> <p> Many of these workers start out on &euro;24,000 per year, they have been promised this for five or six years and it has not materialised yet.  It was part of the public service stability agreement they signed up to and have honoured.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500005#C00200"><p>The workplace evaluation assessment is not complete: three of the five phases are complete, perhaps the third is complete and the fourth is ongoing.  The initial position was that payment would arise when the workplace evaluation scheme was complete.  However, in an effort to come to a compromise in the past couple of days, the employer or Government side offered to begin implementation from November 2019.  Unfortunately, that was rejected.</p>  <p>  As I said, this can be resolved, and the offer to go to the Labour Court stands.  If it is a matter of trust, the Labour Court is independent and will hear all sides of the argument in making a determination.  The dispute can be resolved in that way and we can avoid any negative effects for patients across these 38 hospitals.  It is unusual for the union side to refuse to go to the Labour Court and I hope that it will reconsider.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500005#C00300"><p>Before I begin, I take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies and those of my party to the friends and family of Manus Kelly, who tragically passed away in a terrible accident on Sunday.  The people of Donegal took great pride in Manus's many achievements and successes, not least winning the Donegal International Rally three years in a row.  His dedication and professionalism to his sporting achievements as a rally driver extended to other aspects of his life.  He employed dozens of people in Letterkenny and, as the Taoiseach referred to, was recently elected to represent the people of that electoral area.  My thoughts are with his friends, family and party colleagues at this very difficult time.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p>  <p>  Tomorrow, up to 10,000 support staff working across the State in 38 hospitals and healthcare facilities will strike, unless the Government lives up to the promises, commitments and agreements it has made.  That is the long and the short of it.  These workers include hospital porters, healthcare assistants, maternity care assistants and surgical  instrument technicians.  We can all agree that, without these workers, our hospitals would not be cleaned, our patients would not receive food and the health service would not function properly.  They perform invaluable work and deserve to be treated and paid accordingly.</p>  <p>  The job evaluation scheme, which ensured that workers were paid appropriately to reflect the changing skills and demands that their work requires, was suspended in 2009.  This was reversed as part of the Lansdowne Road agreement, and recommencement of the job evaluation scheme was agreed and signed off by the Government back in 2015.  In 2017, job evaluations were carried out and it was found that workers were being underpaid.</p><p>That is what tomorrow's strike is all about.  It is not about workers demanding more than their due or making blind pay claims.  It is about honouring agreements on which the Government signed off.  It is there in black and white and the Government has failed to honour the commitments into which it entered.  </p> <p> Despite the Taoiseach's usual efforts to portray workers and their unions as unreasonable and all the rest, these workers are not seeking enrichment; far from it.  For example, a healthcare assistant enjoys an entry level salary of less than &euro;28,000.  Even with the increase due under the job evaluation scheme, a healthcare assistant will still be earning less than &euro;30,000.  Nobody is getting rich here.  The demands of workers are more than modest and the strike tomorrow is going ahead not as a matter of urgency but as an option of last resort.</p> <p> We understand that the HSE has asked for this money to be provided from the Department but the Government is refusing to honour that agreement.  As the employer in this situation, the Government must live up to its side of the bargain and honour its word.  A commitment was made to these workers four years ago and again when the job evaluations were carried out in 2017.  These are low-paid workers who perform invaluable work in our health service.</p> <p> We all know that this dispute will be resolved at some point in time but there will be major disruption to patients, their families and the health service if this strike goes ahead tomorrow.  These workers deserve the honouring of the agreement that was entered into four years ago by the Government.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach act at this late hour and play his part in resolving the strike to ensure workers get their fair dues and ensure there is no disruption to our health service tomorrow?  The way to do that is to make a reasonable offer to the unions, to re-engage with them in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, process.  That is how we can resolve this and ensure that agreements are fulfilled and lived up to.  That way we can ensure there is no disruption in a health service that is already strained at the seams.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500006#D00200"><p>The HSE received a budget from the Government, voted by the Oireachtas, of nearly &euro;17 billion this year, an increase of approximately &euro;1 billion on last year.  It is not reasonable for an agency that is receiving such a big budget increase to come back looking for additional increases in spending during the year.  It is often the case that additional money must be found towards the end of the year but we cannot operate a health service or a budget on the basis of ongoing demands for additional spending throughout the course of the year and I must take into account the strong advice received about that from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and others during the year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500006#D00400"><p>I ask the Opposition to also take account of that advice.</p>  <p>  It is disappointing that the WRC talks, which were aimed at averting the strike by up to 10,000 SIPTU members, concluded yesterday without an agreement.  As we are aware, in early June, SIPTU announced that 10,000 members working as support staff in 38 hospitals and healthcare facilities would engage in industrial action for periods of 24 hours on six dates in late June and early July.  The WRC sought a deferral of the first two dates of strike action and invited the parties to resume talks on 20 June.  This was agreed by SIPTU and was very much welcomed.  However, SIPTU did advise that if a resolution was not found, it intended to take action on 26 June and again on 2, 3 and 4 July.  Regrettably, that is now happening. </p>  <p>  Constructive and positive engagement by the parties took place at the WRC.  An offer was made by Government that staff in the grades concerned would be moved onto the appropriate salary scale starting from November this year.  This would be on top of a 2.75% pay increase already guaranteed under the public service stability agreement, substantial benefits of the recent new entry deal and the payment of annual increments to most staff.  We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer that would have enabled the implementation of the job evaluation scheme.  Unfortunately, this has been rejected and therefore deemed inadequate to resolve the dispute.  </p>  <p>  The offer to go to the Labour Court remains on the table.  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the strike as a last resort.  It is not a last resort because the Labour Court is the next step and it is our deep regret that, on this occasion, the union concerned has refused to go to the Labour Court.  That is the way to resolve this dispute and ensure that no patients are affected tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500006#D00500"><p>That is a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Labour Court.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500006#D00600"><p>The next step is for the Government to make an appropriate, reasonable offer and to re-engage in the WRC process.  That should be done within the hour in order that we can ensure that patients who have appointments scheduled in our 38 hospitals and are being cared for in other healthcare facilities are not disrupted.  That is the next step.</p><p>We saw good faith demonstrated by the workers and the unions when the strike was deferred.  That happened because they believed there would be meaningful engagement by the Government side, but that did not materialise.  What materialised was a completely inadequate offer that was rejected on Friday.  It is my understanding there has been no engagement by the Government side with the unions since, despite what the Taoiseach has said and the blame-shifting to the low paid workers and their representatives.</p> <p> The fact that the HSE has requested the money from the Department indicates that there is no dispute over whether the workers should be paid appropriately or that the job evaluation process was signed off on four years ago, with the evaluations taking place two years ago.  It was deemed that the workers were underpaid.  The dispute lies in the fact that the Government is unwilling to live up to that side of the agreement.  On behalf of workers and the patients who will be disrupted, is it not sensible to resolve the dispute now, not tomorrow, the next day or the day after that?  Will there be an appropriate offer to re-engage with the Workplace Relations Commission and lift the phone to trade union officials in order to commit to meaningful engagement to find a resolution on behalf of workers and patients who are relying on the health service?</p></speech>

The plan clearly needs further discussion, given the vagueness of actions in a number of areas, not least of which are agriculture and transport.  Equally important are further necessary discussions on the required actions to ensure Project Ireland 2040 and the ten-year implementation plan can be climate-proofed against the plan.  In that context, I appeal once again to the Taoiseach to look at Galway, a beautiful bilingual city that is ostensibly thriving on so many levels but the success and development of which belie the reality for many people on the ground.  Unfortunately, the growth of the city is taking place in the absence of a city architect and master plan that would put the common good to the fore.  Growth is also premised on the private market providing accommodation units, as they are called, and the rolling out of more roads and consequent traffic congestion.  This is developer-led development which got the city and country into a bad position in the first place.  It is most regrettable that we are back to that position in Galway.  The Taoiseach's colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, agreed with me on two occasions that Galway was experiencing developer-led development.  This is not withstanding the repeated use of the words "sustainable development" in the national planning framework and the spirit of the recently published climate action plan.  Government policy has now led to cases where we house homeless persons in what was tourist accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, while tourists are housed in homes through Airbnb.  I am most reluctant to use the example of individuals, but I will quickly relate the case of a person for whom I made representations this week.  She has three young children and been on a waiting list for 11 years.  During that time she has never been offered a house and the only advice given to her was to go to the housing assistance payment place finder service, which she did, but there were no premises available for her in Galway.  The Simon Communities of Ireland has repeatedly told us and given us reports telling us that it is locked out of the market.  The person in question is one of 4,000 households on a waiting list. Government policy is worsening the crisis with the HAP scheme which is the only game in town.</p>  <p>  Parallel with that, last night at city council level the National Development Agency presented a feasibility study of the four-acre Dyke Road site in Galway.</p><p>It is quite clear from what I have looked at that the Government, through the LDA, has no interested in using public lands for the benefit of the maximum number of people for the common good.</p> <p> These problems are not inevitable.  The housing crisis and the traffic congestion in Galway have been created.  If we are seriously interested in our words meaning something in this D&aacute;il in terms of the climate action plan, the Government needs to focus on Galway.  We need a commitment to putting in place a master plan that will put the common good to the fore and, included in that, there must be recognition that the city will expand by 50%.  A feasibility study for light rail is needed as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I did not say that the declaration of a climate emergency by this House was merely symbolic.  The Deputy used the word "merely", so I guess that was merely disingenuous.  I said it was symbolic but that symbols and gestures do matter but they have to be followed up with action.  The climate action plan published last week outlines those actions clearly.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 designates Galway as one of the cities we want to see grow its population by 50% between now and 2040 into a city with compact urban growth, most of it happening around the centre, which makes sense for transport reasons and for reasons of climate action to move away from the sprawl of the past towards livable, densely populated urban centres.</p>  <p>  I am told that the port company is due to start a public consultation regarding its lands.  The Deputy knows those lands very well, and the inner harbour in particular where there is huge potential for new housing, employment and amenities right in the middle of the city centre.  NUI Galway has similar plans in respect of Nun's Island.</p>  <p>  The idea of a master plan is a good one.  Generally, such plans are local authority-led.  The Deputy will be aware that Cork, for example, developed the Cork area strategic plan, CASP.  I believe Limerick has done something similar with Limerick 2030.  The Government would certainly be happy to co-operate and be part of that but usually these plans are best led from the city or county rather than being imposed by central Government.  A master plan makes sense.  That is a very good suggestion.</p>  <p>  On the LDA, the purpose of the agency is to use mainly publicly owned land, and private land, to deliver more housing for everyone.  It includes social housing for people who have been waiting far too long on the housing lists such as the family the Deputy mentioned; cost rental housing for people who need affordable rent; and private housing for people who want to buy a home.  More than 70% of people own their home.  Home ownership is a good thing and we should not be embarrassed about using public land to provide people with their first home.  I want to make sure that people who are in their 20s and 30s can aspire to buy their own home.  I do not think it is wrong that Government policy, and public land in some circumstances, should be used to enable people to own their own home for the first time.</p></speech>

It is necessary for the Government to take a hands-on approach because Galway City Council has not done that.</p><p>I welcome compact, urban growth that is planned in a sustainable way.  Within that paradigm, a feasibility study for light rail is needed.  The city is destined to increase its population by more than 50%.</p><p>On the LDA, let me tell the Taoiseach what it states in its presentation.  I know he is extremely busy but he might take the trouble to read it.  It states:</p><blockquote>Residential Apartments [No.  Why?]  <br /><br />Build to sell: not viable given the construction costs and end use values<br /><br />Residential Apartments<br /><br />Build to Rent: not viable yet ...</blockquote><p>It is not viable yet because the rents are astronomically high in Galway so that land will be used to build a hotel, student accommodation that can be rented out at high rates during the summer, and many other buildings besides, plus retention of car parking spaces in a city that needs to be climate-proofed.</p><p>I am using the few minutes available to me to appeal to the Taoiseach to take Galway as an example to implement the climate action plan if he is seriously interested.  It is crying out for a sustainable plan.  We need light rail and sustainable development in the city.</p><p>There is no reason to have a housing or accommodation problem.  There is Ceannt Station, the Dyke Road site, the harbour and over 100 acres of land between the city and county councils at the old airport site and more land besides, yet we have a housing crisis in Galway because each is developing its own plan.</p></speech>

New councillors have been elected to it.  Perhaps this is their opportunity to develop a master plan for the city, one that would be climate-proofed, that would provide for good amenities, public transport and extra housing of all forms.  We need it to be of all forms: social, affordable, cost rental and homes for people to buy.  The Government is willing and able to engage with the city council in developing a master plan.  Elsewhere there is the Cork area strategic plan, CASP, and Limerick 2030.  I am sure that if Galway City Council wishes to approach the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, it will receive a favourable reply.</p></speech>

Regardless of which budget is presented, we cannot afford any more wasteful spending as a result of particularly poor economic decisions.  Unfortunately, disastrous economic decisions continue to be made.  It is no longer news that we are in the grip of a housing emergency, yet the housing delivery system continues to be one of the most expensive in the world.  Today <i>The Irish Times</i>tells us that the latest economic report shows that over half the country is unaffordable for the average house buyer.  The most recent report by <i>daft.ie</i>on the private rental sector showed that only 2,700 properties were available nationally.  The average cost of renting in Dublin is in excess of &euro;2,000 per month and prices have increased for 31 months in a row.  Average rents nationally are 8% higher than this time last year.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, recently described his plans for expensive co-living spaces, measuring 16.5 m<sup>2</sup>, as &quot;exciting&quot; and suggested younger people should be willing to make sacrifices.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware by now that An Bord Pleann&aacute;la has refused planning permission for such a co-living development on the grounds that it would fail to provide an acceptable living environment.</p><p>Serious concerns have been raised by several sources about the unsustainability of the HAP system which is estimated to cost about &euro;2 billion in the next few years.  Figures show that the Government's preferred turn-key option will cost &euro;70,000 per unit more than a new build.  It is not a stretch to say the Government's housing policy is an economic and social shambles.  Recently the Committee of Public Accounts learned that a hotel room to accommodate a typical homeless family for one year would cost the State &euro;67,000 compared to the average cost of servicing a mortgage or rental accommodation.  There is a serious disparity.  How can the Taoiseach stand over such economic madness?  That is without taking into account the social consequences of such economic policies, particularly for children.  </p><p>Clearly, this dysfunctional economic approach is working for some.  One of the world's biggest vulture fund management groups, Link Capital, has stated Ireland is the gift that keeps on giving, referring to the level of distressed mortgages from which the fund derives 62% of its annual revenue through the heartache of Irish homeowners in distress.  Government inaction on rental accommodation, distressed mortgages, vulture funds and most housing issues has only added to the problem.  Will the Taoiseach commit to legislate to end the special tax benefits for REITs and use legislation to ensure they will not be allowed to dominate the private rental sector?  Will he commit to an immediate rent freeze in order to protect immediately those at risk of losing their rented homes when the next rent hike inevitably comes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500010#H00100"><p>Any decision on changing the tax treatment of REITs is a matter for the budget and all proposals for the budget will be considered between now and decisions being made in October.  It is always the case that we regularly review tax incentives and tax expenditures in advance of a budget.</p>  <p>  Regarding a rent freeze, we would certainly do it if we thought it would work but we do not think it would work.  We think it would be counterproductive.  One of the biggest problems we have is the large number of people leaving the rental sector.  Even Opposition Members have highlighted the large number of people renting out a house or property now deciding to sell it on and leaving the rental market.  This is a real problem because if fewer properties are available for rent, inevitably it will make it harder for people to find places to rent.  We may find that a rent freeze would result in more people deciding to sell the house or apartment they were renting out.  While rents might be frozen, many people would not be able to find anywhere.  We could see an increase in homelessness as a consequence and none of us wants to see that.  We think what we have developed, which is rent pressure zones with increases of no more than 4%, is a better response because at least that way it allows new properties to come into the rental market and does not leave people with nowhere to rent.  Rent freezes might work for people whose rent is frozen but people who have nowhere to rent or need to move would probably find themselves more likely to be homeless and, therefore, that would be a counterproductive policy in our view.</p>  <p>  Affordability is a real issue in many parts of the country, not least in the Dublin area.  We saw interesting numbers in the past week or two showing the average price of a semi-detached house was approximately &euro;200,000 in Galway and Limerick, approximately &euro;150,000 in Waterford and even less than &euro;100,000 in some rural counties.  Of course, the picture in other parts of the country, including Dublin, is very different.  The affordability index the Deputy mentioned is based on the price of the median house in each county.  Generally, people buying their first home do not by the median house; they buy a house at entry level.  Using the median is not appropriate in assessing affordability in this regard.  It certainly does not tell the full story.  Very few people buy the average or median house and most people buying for the first time tend to buy a starter home.</p>  <p>  With regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I welcome the fact it has refused planning permission for that particular co-living development in Cookstown near Tallaght.  The reason there are guidelines on co-living is to ensure inappropriate developments do not get planning permission.  Just as there are apartment buildings and housing estates that do not get planning permission, some co-living developments will not and should not get planning permission.  The type of proposal made in this case is not what was ever intended and the guidelines make this clear, which is why it was refused.</p></speech>

Houses that used to be rented are now occupied by people on that basis.  The recent report on house prices in Dublin showed the average price of a three-bedroom house is &euro;433,000, which is many multiples of the average industrial income.  Rebuilding Ireland has missed its target in three successive years.  It was never ambitious enough to begin with.  At the heart of our unaffordable housing issue is the cost of building land.  If a constitutional amendment was required to address the issue in the context of the social good, would the Taoiseach be willing to consider such a referendum?</p></speech>

For example, if somebody as a consequence of that found their land was significantly devalued, would the taxpayer have to pay compensation?</p><p>All of those types of things would have to be considered.  Would it only apply to land that gets owned in the future?  Would it only be prospective and, therefore, would not have an effect or be of any value for many years ahead?  Those are the kinds of issues that would have to be teased out.  The wording would need to be known and there would need to be a full consideration as to how it might be interpreted by the courts and what the unintended consequences might be.</p></speech>

It has emerged that at a meeting last September that was attended by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, very serious reservations were articulated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Secretary General about the national broadband plan and the need for it to pause.  At the meeting which was held the day before the Granahan McCourt consortium submitted the final tender Deputy Naughten indicated that the bill had risen by more than &euro;300 million in one month.  The Secretary General wanted it to pause and said he had very serious reservations.  We have learned today that Eir is stating to the Oireachtas committee responsible for this issue that it could do it for &euro;1 billion.  For several weeks the Taoiseach has been tackling various people in the Opposition, saying they want to spend here, there and everywhere, but an increase of &euro;300 million in one month suggests not too many on the Government side are overly exercised about runaway expenditure on major projects.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the Secretary General at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the project needs to be paused?  Is the Government going ahead with the commitment it gave to the D&aacute;il last month, or is it open to pausing the plan, reflecting on it and talking to the people charged with managing public expenditure for the Government?</p></speech>

I argue that there was a considerable pause.  We spent many months deliberating on the issue and exploring alternatives before coming to a Government decision to award preferred bidder status to National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  Many months were spent in looking at all of the alternatives.  I am curious that Eir is suggesting the project can be delivered for &euro;1 billion.  I will be interested to hear what the firm's representatives have to say at the committee today as Eir pulled out of the process.  Before pulling out, it made an indicative bid which was slightly higher than that of Granahan McCourt at around &euro;2.7 billion.  It seems that the &euro;1 billion bid about which Eir is talking would involve passing homes but not connecting any of them and does not cover maintenance costs for 25 years.  Therefore, it would be pretty useless to anyone.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance is publishing the summer economic statement.  The line being bandied about in the media this morning is one of prudence and caution in the face of significant economic challenges and risk.  However, that does not tally with what the Taoiseach has been preaching.  Six months ago at his party's Ard-Fheis he committed to tax cuts of nearly &euro;3 billion, tax cuts that would not affect 80% of taxpayers in any way.  There is no doubt that families are facing a crisis, with living costs increasing all the time, and that the economy is facing significant risk.  It is clear that investment is needed, particularly in areas such as housing, healthcare, education and several others.</p><p>It is very difficult to do that in light of the election promises the Government is making.  IFAC states that the Government's published expenditure estimates are not credible.  Does he believe the Government's commitment to cut &euro;3 billion of taxes over the next five years is equally not credible in light of the significant challenges we see and the need to be cautious and prudent?  Increasing the tax band by &euro;6,000 every year for the next five years is simply not credible.</p></speech>

Anyone earning over &euro;37,000 a year would benefit from it.  The average person working full-time in Ireland now earns &euro;47,000 a year.  As such, it is not only middle-income people who will benefit; it will be people who earn less than the average income.  Certainly, higher income earners will benefit too but the vast majority will be middle-income earners on &euro;35,000 to &euro;50,000.  Those who gain the most in percentage terms will be in that category.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked how that can be achieved.  I appreciate that he may not have had a chance to read the summer economic statement yet, but on page 38 he will find Annex 1, which indicates how tax relief of approximately &euro;600 million a year could be achieved while allowing much more money to be made available for investment in public infrastructure and services.  The ratio is probably one of 3:1 or 4:1 and it can be accommodated within the fiscal space.  That is not necessarily to say it can be started in the forthcoming budget, which will depend on other factors.  I am curious to hear the Deputy use IFAC's criticism of the Government I lead.  Let us not forget his party's policy at the time of the 2019 budget was to spend more and finance it through additional borrowing.</p></speech>

Its policy was to increase spending by even more than we increased it and to finance that through additional borrowing.

There is a table on that in the document for the Deputy as well.</p></speech>

The people voted overwhelmingly in support of the thirty-eighth amendment to the Constitution on 24 May last and the President endorsed it on 11 June.  We have now amended the Constitution to provide the Oireachtas with the power to change the period for which a person applying for a divorce must have lived apart from his or her spouse.  I have had a number of contacts from people as to when this change will happen given that it requires only a minor adjustment to the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  The special rapporteur on child protection, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, has also called for priority for this amendment.  The people have determined the matter, there will be no opposition in the House and it is a simple legislative change.  When can we see it?</p></speech>

I anticipate the change will receive widespread support in the House.  All parties are on record as having indicated that, which I very much welcome.  My understanding is, however, that there are only three weeks left in the current session.  It is, therefore, unlikely that the legislation will be published, debated and enacted by the recess.  That said, it is a priority matter in the Department and I expect the legislation will be published during the summer months for debate through the autumn.</p></speech>

The programme for Government refers to Ireland playing its part in the EU on conflict resolution.  I have been visited by Sudanese people living in my constituency of Dublin West, which is also that of the Taoiseach, and they are extremely concerned about the rapes, torching of tents, floggings and dumping of bodies in the Nile.  The brutal repression of the revolution and uprising taking place against the dictator, al-Bashir, could not take place without funding from Saudi Arabia and arms from the UK and other EU member states.</p><p>Prior to the crackdown, the military leaders visited all of the reactionary regimes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia etc. to get advice on how to drown this revolution in blood.  It is a huge issue.  The young people who organised a protest at the Spire at 3 p.m. on Saturday are asking what the Government is doing about this murderous regime.</p></speech>

I have spoken to Chief Superintendent Dominic Hayes and Superintendent Willie Leahy.  At least 25 garda&iacute; are needed to bring the Clonmel district which covers Carrick-on-Suir up to normal numbers.  We have an acute problem with drugs and drug gangs.  We are looking perilously at Drogheda, Longford and other areas and going to be there if action is not taken.  I support what garda&iacute; on the ground are doing, but they just do not have the manpower, womanpower or drugs squad members to deal with the problem.  The wonderful communities in Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir are being ravaged by drugs, drug gangs, cartels and vagabonds of all kinds.  All measures of the law are needed to take these people off the streets and deal with them.  There is no point in talking about the resources being given to the Garda nationally.  We need more members of the force in the Clonmel district.</p></speech>

I know that the Taoiseach is familiar with this issue.  When I raised it previously, he said many homeowners in his constituency, like my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, were facing substantial bills due to defects.  Will the comments of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on the defects signal a move by the Government to examine possible supports for the homeowners affected?  Two years ago this month, a Green Party motion calling for assistance to be given to homeowners was passed unanimously by the D&aacute;il.  A year and a half has passed since the publication of the Safe as Houses report which made a similar call for relief to be provided.

He gave a commitment to do so.  He has said here on many occasions in the past year, including in debates with Deputy Catherine Martin, that the Government is happy to try to work with management companies to find solutions, certainly in apartment blocks.  The number one priority is to make them safe.  The fire authority in the area is also involved.  We are continuing to work on the matter.  The Minister has said on many occasions that if someone can produce solutions that will not expose the taxpayer, the Government will be happy to look at them.  We are engaging with the management companies to try to bring forward solutions.  That is what the Minister was referring to last week.

In the context of the ongoing Brexit negotiations, will the Taoiseach update us on the current state of the negotiations with the European Commission to ensure drivers who travel to the North, or from the North into this state, will not require an international motor insurance card, known as a green card?  The Vice President of the Commission confirmed recently confirmed that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, motorists would need to hold a green card to travel across the Border.  Tens of thousands of journeys are made across the Border each day, for example, by farmers in travelling to their own lands.  It seems that citizens travelling between Ravensdale or Sheelagh in County Louth and Jonesborough or Crossmaglen in County Armagh will need an international motor insurance card to travel each way.</p><p>Can the Taoiseach set out the current situation?  </p></speech>

We have been fighting for a number of cancer patients who are three or four months into their treatment in terms of getting in financial statements and documentation.  Are there enough medical assessors within the medical card section to make decisions about people who have had a very serious medical diagnosis and who have provided that documentation to the medical card section to get emergency medical cards?  Somebody who has received a cancer diagnosis should have an automatic entitlement to one.  Moreover, such people should be allowed to provide the documentation over the next while to support it but they should be given a medical card in the short term because they are experiencing desperately serious financial difficulties.</p></speech>

At a critical time in a person's life following a diagnosis of cancer, the least that we and the Government can do is ensure that he or she gets a medical card.  At one time, once a diagnosis of cancer had been made, the person automatically got the card.  That has not been the case over the past five or six years.  The Taoiseach is frowning as if he does not know that.  If he does not know that, as a Deputy, he should know it.  A county councillor would know it - never mind the Taoiseach.  It was a fact that when a person received a diagnosis of cancer, he or she got a medical card but it has not been the case over the past five or six years.

However, more than 100,000 discretionary medical cards are provided to people who do not qualify based on means and who often have a particular illness.  There was considerable variation from region to region in the past regarding how discretion was applied but that was standardised in more recent years.  We did a lot of work about five or six years ago under the chairmanship of Professor Frank Keane to see if we could designate particular illnesses that would automatically entitle someone to a medical card and designate other illnesses that would not.  Professor Keane's expert group found that there was no fair way to provide a list of illnesses that would entitle a person to a medical card and a list of illness that would not.  The report is a difficult read but one I would recommend.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach is aware, another temporary bathing ban was introduced at several of Dublin's beaches due to the overflow of wastewater from the Ringsend water treatment plant.  In February, the Environmental Protection Agency told the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government that raw sewage from the equivalent of 86,000 people was flowing into our waterways every day.  The State is facing infringement proceedings from the European Commission due to its failure to invest adequately in our wastewater treatment facilities.

What is happening in Dublin is a precautionary measure.  We are all conscious of what happened here with that extreme weather event on Sunday evening and into Monday night that caused the problem because storm water feeds into our sewerage system as well, which is an historic issue we are trying to address.  Again, capital works are under way that will help solve that but, naturally, the two local authorities involved are working together with the EPA to see whether any interim measures can be taken to prevent and deal with this.

We have also engaged with the pig industry in creating that awareness among its workforce.  There is a role for each and every one of us in that regard.  The Department is working closely with both farm organisations and individual farmers on this matter.</p></speech>

In that context, I want the raise the issue of social welfare appeals over the past several years.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question requesting the number of such appeals made in 2017 and 2018 and how many were successful.  Approximately 20,000 appeals are made every year, of which 67% are successful and 33% rejected.</p>  <p>  Why is there such a high number of successful appeals in the system?  One would think that, when dealing with the most vulnerable in our society, we could treat them equitably and deal with their original applications in a timely manner.</p></speech>

This amounts to less than 2% of the entire annual claims load.  The number of appeals is tiny compared to the overall number of applications the Department receives.  The reason a high number are successful is further information not given in the first instance, which could have meant an appeal would have been unnecessary, is provided during the appeals process.  Some 6,500 people work in my Department on behalf of the State.  Every day they treat all recipients and applicants for schemes with dignity and respect and do so in a timely manner, as long as the necessary information is provided.</p></speech>

First, they must see what they can afford, then get a solicitor, find the property, get it surveyed and seek mortgage approval.  In Dundalk, as I am sure is the case in every other town, a large number of families are stuck in the middle.  These families comprising a husband, wife and two children, can earn &euro;50,000 a year - which is nothing to be sneezed at &ndash; and can pay rent up to &euro;1,300.  By the time they have paid for food, transport, schooling costs and childcare, they do not have much left.  The Rebuilding Ireland loan is a fantastic scheme and is helping many.  However, there are many who cannot afford to save for a home loan deposit for the simple reason their &euro;50,000 income quickly runs out due to other costs.</p><p>These people cannot get on local authority waiting lists and they cannot get loans.  Is there any rule the Taoiseach can introduce to help the people who are caught in the middle, the people who are trying their best to work?  They do not want to take social welfare payments; they want to work and earn.  Can we start looking after the people who are stuck in the middle?</p></speech>

As the third year of Rebuilding Ireland draws to a close, supply is certainly on the up.  We should see more than 22,000 houses come into the system this year.  Many of these will be in County Louth because many houses are being delivered in the greater Dublin region.  That will help.</p>  <p>  We are also intervening to make houses more affordable through a number of schemes.  One such scheme is the help-to-buy scheme, which helps people to get their deposits together.  This was not mentioned in the recent report which we have been discussing for the last couple of days.  We have also provided the home loan, which the Deputy mentioned.  Many people qualify, including many of those in the most difficulty.  We are supporting infrastructure on a number of sites in order to open up lands and make houses more affordable.  State-owned lands are being managed by the Land Development Agency in conjunction with local authorities.  There are some large sites in Louth on which it would be very useful to develop projects that would deliver private, affordable and social housing.  There is a lot of opportunity in Louth in that regard.  </p>  <p>  We are also addressing affordability in other ways because we recognise that it is an issue.  The number one item on the agenda in creating Rebuilding Ireland was to increase housing supply through a sustainable construction sector.  That is now happening.  As we work through the third year of the plan there is time to intervene with affordability measures.  That is what we are trying to do and that will have an impact.  Analysis of first-time buyers last year will show that 70% of housing units were sold for less than &euro;270,000.  Nearly 50% were sold for less than &euro;250,000.  For most people who are working that is just about affordable.  It is always difficult.  We recognise that.  We will continue to intervene to make houses even more affordable.</p></speech>

The council analyses and reports on strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic, social, environmental and sustainable development.  The NESC is a valuable forum where economic, social and environmental issues can be discussed between a variety of actors and Departments.</p>  <p>  NESC's work focuses on the strategic and longer-term view, for example in the area of climate change.  In recent weeks the council has published two reports: "Climate Change Policy: Getting the Process Right" and "Transport Orientated Development: Assessing the Opportunity for Ireland".  As part of the Government&rsquo;s climate plan, a just transition review group will be established within the council.  Through this group NESC will review the ongoing transition, identify specific needs and challenges, and publish a periodic review and strategic advice.  Other work published by the council includes: "Moving from Welfare to Work: Low Work Intensity Households and the Quality of Supportive Services" and "Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland&rsquo;s Broken System".</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 I have certain functions such as appointing the members of the NESC and presenting reports to Government prior to publication or prior to laying before the Houses as in the case of the annual reports.  Since becoming Taoiseach, I have made nine appointments to NESC in line with the legislation and the guidelines on appointments to State boards.  The council is funded through my Department&rsquo;s Vote and my Department also has governance responsibilities regarding the council.</p>  <p>  The sole Bill being prepared by my Department will provide for the dissolution of the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, corporate framework, which is no longer necessary.  It also deals with related matters including the transfer of functions to the NESC.  Work is under way to prepare the heads of a Bill but it is not a legislative priority for Government as it is a technical change which does not impact on the essential or ongoing functions of NESC.</p>  <p>  The House may also wish to be aware that the current director of NESC, Dr. Rory O'Donnell, will be retiring next month.  I thank him for all his work over the years.  An open competition has been run to select his successor and the new director will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

In many instances the use of money messages is an abuse of power which undermines the democratic right of the Legislature, as distinct from the Executive, to pass legislation.  There is a valid debate to be had about the Government's veto power in respect of money Bills, but many of the Bills about which I am talking are not, in themselves, money Bills.  They are Bills that incur no more than incidental expenditure.  An example of such a Bill is legislation which Sinn F&eacute;in produced which sought to protect the traditional fishing rights of fishermen on our islands.  We were told that it would cost money to post out the licences, that is, to put stamps on the letters.  This is the type of mechanism the Government is now using to frustrate the will and the view of this House.  Is it not the case that the use of money messages has undermined the role of parliamentarians in this House and that the Government needs to think seriously about how this abuse of the system has taken place?</p></speech>

Not even the heads of the Bill have been produced.  I expect that will remain the case and that we will not see the legislation in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  Is it the Government's intention to proceed with it or not?</p>  <p>  With regard to the work of NESC, in 2018 Dublin was found to be the third most congested city in the world, ahead of major urban centres like Paris and London, in respect of transport congestion.  At the launch of NESC's report on transport development earlier this month, which was referenced by the Taoiseach in his response, the council's director stated that development in Ireland continues to be car centred.  As of this month, we are still car centred in this regard.  There is a lot of focus in the climate plan on the shift from combustion engines to electrically-powered vehicles but, as one commentator said, all this will do is provide cleaner traffic jams.  It does nothing to deal with congestion.  We still have no significant public transport project under construction right now.  That is amazing.  </p>  <p>  What are the Taoiseach's reflections on the views expressed by NESC in its commentary on the transport development plan published earlier this month?  Did he engage with NESC on its findings on the climate action and transport development plans when matters were being finalised in that regard?  Is it his view that we now need to increase significantly our investment in public transport in towns and cities throughout the land?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500018#Q00100"><p>I also wish to speak about the NESC report on public transport.  The Government's climate plan is pathetic when it comes to public transport.  We need public transport anyway to deal with dire congestion.  On many important bus routes, students and workers just cannot get on buses in the morning.  In the context of a climate change emergency, the Government is doing nothing in response to the call by NESC, for example, for high quality and frequency of transport services.</p>  <p>  I will outline how bad it is.  Both Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus have fewer buses in their fleets than they did in 2008, which is shocking.  We are going backwards.  In the same period bus fares have increased by 80%.  The demands on the public transport fleet have significantly increased in the intervening period.  We have fewer buses nationally and in Dublin, bus fares have increased and we have the lowest subsidies for public transport almost anywhere in Europe.  This contrasts with, for example, Luxembourg which is now introducing free public transport.  Dunkirk has already introduced free public transport as has Estonia.  Oslo has made a dramatic shift to cheaper better public transport.  Interestingly it is now moving against electric vehicles, which is the centrepiece of this Government's transport plan, because it is not working.  Instead Oslo is moving towards a dramatic increase in investment in the quality, frequency and affordability of public transport.</p>  <p>  What does the Taoiseach have to say to that?  In the last three budgets, we have proposed moving to free public transport, having subsidies for public transport at the level of the best in Europe and for a significant increase in the national and Dublin Bus fleet to improve the quality of bus services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500018#Q00200"><p>I agree with some of the previous comments about NESC and its various reports.  The last Government to introduce a substantive free-travel scheme on public transport was, of course, a Fianna F&aacute;il Government in the late 1960s, when Charles J. Haughey was Minister for Finance, for those in receipt of the old-age pension.  It has a radical impact on the quality of life and utilisation of public transport for those people.  An evaluation of that scheme would be informative in terms of expanding it out because there is certainly an issue with public transport.</p>  <p>  NESC has produced quite a few valuable reports on public transport, housing and climate change.  What matters in this work is not the holding of media-focused events, but a real two-way engagement.  A very clear piece of feedback from two years of the Government's new focus on marketing is frustration about how often State-funded events, billed as forums and consultations, are in fact little more than advertising roadshows with a preselected audience.</p>  <p>  Last year the NDP roadshow involved a long series of events throughout the country, with many claims about what would be delivered, but no answers when hard questions were asked.  No one was willing or able to answer the simple question about how decisions were made to choose between different options in expanding acute hospital services in certain locations and so on.  I invite people to look back at all the projects announced at that roadshow and go through the more detailed work of trying to find out their status now, as I have done with various hospital projects that were announced but have not gone beyond the preliminary planning phase.</p>  <p>  At national level we have a highly repetitive process where Government spends months trailing a new strategy in advance of its announcement.  It then arranges a series of leaks promoting the key elements, followed by a stage-managed Cabinet event somewhere, presented as deciding on the strategy even though the advertising material is already printed - last week the Cabinet went out to the Technological University Dublin on the hybrid bus.  There then follows a regional roadshow.  The climate one was down in UCC.  No one from the public can attend the UCC meeting; it is a selected audience.  The Cork Environmental Alliance has been holding meetings for the past three years inviting all political parties, but which party was noticeable by its absence from all of them?  The Fine Gael Party did not bother its barney turning up.  I could not understand why it did not, but it did not.  We then have showmanship in UCC.</p></speech>

A key consideration by Government as to whether one is granted is whether the proposal has been costed.  Do we have an accurate estimate of what it will cost, not just implementation costs, but also the broader cost to the Exchequer?  Then, can that cost be met?  Has it been budgeted for?  Has the money been voted by the Oireachtas?  We need to consider those matters.  A protocol on money messages was agreed several months ago and I think it is working relatively well, but it is always appropriate to review things again.  As we approach the end of a session, perhaps we should do that or do it again at the start of the next session.</p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin is right in saying that Ireland is very much a car-centric country.  That cannot be changed easily.  It is very much a feature of our spread-out settlement pattern, with many people living in housing estates and many people living in rural areas.  Countries in other parts of the world have denser cities and even in their rural areas housing is much more clustered around villages rather than spread along roads in the way it is in Ireland.  In truth we will remain very car-centric because of our settlement patterns and that is why electric and hybrid vehicles are part of the solution.  It will not be possible to provide high-frequency public transport to everyone in the country.  That is not possible.</p></speech>

We need to do a few things.  When it comes to future planning, many new houses will be built in Ireland over the next ten or 20 years.  We need to ensure the bulk of them are built in existing urban centres on brownfield sites to have the smart compact growth we refer to in Project Ireland 2040.  That is also much more efficient in terms of public transport and climate action.</p>  <p>  There is also investment in cycle facilities.  Record numbers of people are cycling into Dublin city centre, but it can be many more if better facilities are provided.  Last week a &euro;40 million investment in the greenway programme was announced and there is public transport as well.  Deputies will be aware of quite a few public transport projects that are in train.  There are MetroLink, BusConnects and the DART extension.  The procurement process for the hybrid carriages for the DART extension has begun.  MetroLink and BusConnects are throwing up many concerns in local areas which need to be taken into account and modifications may need to be made to those projects.  That is where we are with some very major public transport projects in train: MetroLink, BusConnects and the DART extension.</p>  <p>  If we look at the new projects in Project Ireland 2040 there is a 2:1 split in favour of public transport over roads, when we look at the new projects as opposed to maintenance.  I am concerned when I hear people calling for a review of the roads aspect of Project Ireland 2040 because the bulk of what is provided for is maintenance and restoration.  I would not like us to allow our roads to deteriorate again.  If maintenance is taken out, there is a 2:1 split in favour of public transport over the roads programme.</p></speech>

That would be a big mistake, and I am alarmed to hear some Opposition parties suggest it.</p>  <p>  The climate change papers produced by NESC fed into the climate action plan and were very helpful.  The transport papers are in line with the national spatial strategy and the climate change papers fed into the governance models in the climate action plan.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Martin mentioned, we already have free public transport for large sections of our society including senior citizens, many people with disabilities and young children.  That was expanded in recent years, but two factors would have to be considered before expanding free public transport to everyone: first, the cost, which I imagine would run into hundreds of millions of euros, and second, what the capacity constraints might be.  We all want to encourage more people to use public transport, and I have no doubt that public transport being free or much cheaper would do that.  However, the additional capacity would have to be provided in advance, if not in parallel.</p></speech>

It covers social policy and public services, including education, children, social inclusion, the Irish language, arts and culture, and continued improvements and reform of public services.  Although the committee covers a broad range of areas and topics, its overarching aim is to introduce or reform public policies and services that help create a socially inclusive and fair society.  With the economy doing well and returning to near full employment, it is important that the benefits of economic growth generate opportunities for everyone to progress and flourish, particularly those who are often marginalised or disadvantaged in society.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee has considered a range of social policy issues recently, including childcare and the early years strategy, child protection and welfare issues, social enterprise, immigration, the publication of the LGBTI+ national youth strategy, the action plan for online safety, ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and a range of gender equality actions.</p>  <p>  In addition to meetings of the full Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I meet regularly with Ministers on an individual basis to focus on particular issues in their brief, including issues relating to social policy and public services.</p></reply>

In recent weeks, there have been quite a few stories about the impact of personnel shortages on key services.  The failure to hire, and critically to retain, key people has led to a serious waste of public resources and is contributing to rising budgets.  The most obvious example of this can be found in the health sector, where basic planning and cost controls are much harder when the ability to roster and schedule activity is undermined by a failure to fill vacant positions.</p>  <p>  I presume that the Taoiseach is aware of the current campaign by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  However, that campaign is not needed; going through the data, we can see that there are significant shortages and vacancies in key consultant areas.  For example, in Cork city alone, 13 consultants have resigned in the past three years, and ten of those were involved in delivering cancer care.  Some of these key positions have been filled by locums but some remain vacant, and this is replicated across the country.  I know the Taoiseach can give us the macro figures and say that we are getting more people in than are leaving, but the bottom line is underneath the figures.  There is a real crisis in the retention of key personnel in our health services.  Given how central this has been to health budgets under this and the previous Government, has he received a report on the impact of vacancies on services?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will also remember that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said that, in the past, one of the most important reasons for the new phenomenon of significant overspends in the health system is the habit that developed in recent years of Ministers promising levels of service that have not been planned or funded.  This has led to a deeply wasteful stop-start approach to service delivery.  The Taoiseach has admitted that his decision, and that of his predecessor, to operate the HSE without a management board has caused serious problems in planning and cost control.  Equally, he has repeatedly promised that measures are in place to avoid the need for significant supplementaries in health.  He has said that repeatedly and told the House that any overspends would be identified and published without delay.  In that context, will he comment on the fact that spending pressure are already evident and that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, appears to be repeating last year's approach of denying any concerns until as late as possible in the year?</p>  <p>  Finally, on Sunday, the Minister reported that 800,000 extra home help hours will be delivered.  There is a serious and profound disconnect between official statements of that kind and the reality on the ground.  In each healthcare area, people are being told that there is no funding left and that there is a curtailment of home help services across the board.  The Taoiseach said last week that he was trying to get to the bottom of the issue.  More than 6,000 people are on the waiting list for home help and no cover is being provided for annual or sick leave.  The budgets appear to have dried up, and yet we get the mantra from central level that there is nothing to see here and everything is fine because there will be additional positions.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</p></speech>

Tomorrow, 10,000 of the lowest paid workers in the health system are going on strike.  They are the pivotal workers who provide for the basic running our hospitals, and they are going on strike because of a job evaluation scheme that was agreed to in a chairman's note under the umbrella of the Lansdowne Road agreement and formalised in 2017 in a deal with the HSE.  A timeframe was set out for that, stating that the initial phase would conclude by 30 June 2017, phase 2 by November 2017 and phase 3 no later than 30 May 2018.  The outcome of phases 1 and 2 was to be reviewed at the conclusion and no payment would arise at a date earlier than the conclusion of phase 2, that is, the earliest payment would be on 1 December 2017.  We are now well into 2019.</p><p>There is a legitimate expectation from these workers, all of whom stepped up to the plate in the worst of times.  I know that, because I was in touch with our unions throughout the most difficult phase of our economic history.  Uniquely across Europe, our public service balloted for and accepted significant wage reductions and curtailments in costs.  The Taoiseach knows that we would not have got through the crisis without that.  The <i>quid pro quo </i>is that we should honour the agreements we have entered into with them.</p><p>I am concerned by the comment made today by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and Deputy Brophy.</p></speech>

The evaluation agreed a cost of &euro;16 million, but &euro;1 million has been put on the table to date.  For 10,000 people, &euro;1 million is less than &euro;2 a week.  That is not a realistic offer.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that this goes back to the WRC and a realistic offer be put on the table to avert a strike and not undermine fundamentally confidence in the ability of the Government and the State to be honest dealers in industrial relations?</p></speech>

Last week it described Ireland as "the gift that keeps giving" in an address to its investors.  This was in anticipation of more mortgages being sold by the banks to the vulture funds.  Some of these banks are in majority shareholder ownership of the Irish State, the shares being held by the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  It is ludicrous that vulture funds are looking at Ireland as the gift that keeps on giving while distressed mortgage holders are worried and wondering what approach these vulture funds will take to their mortgages.  I have given countless examples to the Taoiseach and others as to how some of these vulture funds are calling in all of the debt, to be paid within a 30-day notice period.  That is organising a structural default and repossessing properties as a result.  Is it not time that we implemented the code of practice of the Central Bank whereby no mortgage can be sold without the consent of the borrower which has been on a voluntary basis since 1991?  I have tabled legislation which has already passed the D&aacute;il and is before committee.  Is it not time that the Government stopped Ireland being the gift that keeps on giving to these vulture funds that are treating borrowers in such an intolerable way?</p>  <p>  I also want to mention Cabinet committee B.  We face severe challenges in public services.  We have heard about issues for home help and Sinn F&eacute;in will be leading a discussion about that during Private Members' time this evening.  There are pressures elsewhere in health and in affordable housing.  A document produced by Government on climate action had absolutely no costings or commitments for Government investment.  The Government's summer economic statement completely disregards the critique of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  It told the Government that there is a return to boom and bust and that has been ignored.  It also told the Government that there was an over-reliance on corporation tax receipts, which are highly volatile and concentrated.  That has also been ignored.  There is nothing additional in the summer economic statement which deals with that issue.  The council told the Government that it has failed to account for the Christmas bonus, which costs &euro;300 million.  That is ignored in the summer economic statement.  It also said there is no allocation for a just transition in climate change policy, which was also completely ignored.  Instead there is fiscal space or an unallocated amount of &euro;700 million which must cover all of the different pressures I have outlined and uses up every single cent of corporation tax, outside of the rainy day fund, and the Government is committing to use that, as the Taoiseach earlier articulated, in a tax-cutting agenda that will not benefit 79% of income taxpayers in the State.</p></speech>

That is a gap of four months.  Public services require constant attention on the part of any competent Government because moving from the period of economic collapse to recovery includes very delicate negotiations and considerations as to how to recompense people who have lost out.</p>  <p>  I am concerned about school completion programmes and services for children with autism.  There is no collective Government policy about these issues at all.  It is spread over a whole lot of different Departments and the relevant Government committees do not seem to meet or, if they do, they meet infrequently.  We can see the gaps in policy and it is difficult to discuss them in the House.</p>  <p>  A movement started in Dublin 15 about autism spectrum disorder services with large public meetings of hundreds of parents of children on the autism spectrum over the past nine months.  Some 60 children in the area were identified as being without services.  We have moved to quite a good resolution where there will be a special autism school on a small scale for children who have both high-level needs in respect of autism and other problems such as behavioural issues.</p>  <p>  On the school completion programme, particularly those in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme, it is vital to keep children in school and for them to enjoy it, to prosper and be nurtured.  A situation pertains whereby the Department for Children and Youth Affairs, under the relevant Minister, is threatening that these broad general programmes will be cut back.  There are seven programmes, for instance, in schools in Dublin 15 and the Taoiseach privately visited Ladyswell national school, one of those affected, a couple of months ago.  Nobody from any other political party or public representative accompanied him so that he could have a private conversation.  I am using Dublin 15 as an example.  The Taoiseach is influential on other parts of the Civil Service but there were threats of serious cutbacks in the school completion programme in Dublin 15.  In order to save money, the whole-school approach will be changed to an individual, identified, targeted child who is deemed to be particularly at need.  That is a disorganised and disconnected way for the Government to formulate programmes affecting the most vulnerable children in our society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500020#S00600"><p>The Government has claimed it is supportive of a mix of social and non-social housing.  A mix of people with different family sizes and in different income brackets is a reasonable aspiration although the net effect has been to, effectively, prevent large-scale social and affordable housing developments on public land because they are tied up with convoluted formulas around social housing that never seem to get resolved.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that his stated aim of a mix of social and non-social housing is, in many cases, turning out to be something more akin to social cleansing or social apartheid.  A report emerged today which stated that half of the counties in the country are unaffordable for first-time buyers.  In those counties, and mine is one of them, people on low and middle incomes are being driven out.  They are being cleansed from the area.  These areas then only become places where very rich people can live.  That is what is actually happening.  There is a small number of developments where we are supposed to get a social mix on private developments with 10% social housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  That is not happening in a number of those cases, particularly and disgracefully in strategic housing developments which involved fast-track planning and were supposed to deal with the housing crisis.  What is actually happening in a development in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is that an extra 60 houses will be built and no social housing.  The law allowed for that through some convoluted arrangement with the developer.  </p>  <p>  In areas of high property value, social housing is being provided off-site so there is no social mix.  The social housing is somewhere else because we could not have people on low incomes living in certain areas.  Even in areas where that 10% is being provided, the social housing element is being segregated in separate blocks, usually with one or two-bedroom units and no family-sized units in many cases, and where the specifications of the social housing element are considerably lower than the houses built in the non-social part of the development.  That is social apartheid, not social mix.  It is institutionalising and underpinning segregation of people on the basis of their income levels.  Does the Taoiseach think that is acceptable?  What is he going to do about it?  What is he going to do about the fact that strategic housing developments are, in some cases, not delivering any social housing whatsoever?  Does the Taoiseach think that is acceptable?</p></speech>

Others may be advertised through the voluntary bodies but on <i>publicjobs.ie</i>only 20 posts are being advertised at present.

It has far too many layers, with posts left vacant for months or years but never advertised.</p><p>We have new contracts with nurses, midwives and general practitioners, GPs, and I imagine we could have a new contract with consultants as well.  I know the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will want to engage with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation on that.  The same principles will have to apply and we need to modernise our contracts if we are going to put taxpayers' money behind pay increases.</p><p>There has been a 50% increase in the budget for home help over the past three years, which is considerable.  I am advised by the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, that provision has been made for an extra 800,000 home help hours this year and the waiting list is slightly shorter than it was this time a year ago.  I have, however, heard anecdotal evidence from many Deputies and even from my constituency office that the position may be more difficult than suggested by the numbers.

I do not agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty's assessment on corporation tax; it is quite the contrary.  We have mitigated our exposure to risks from the very high levels of corporation tax we are receiving by setting up a rainy day fund.  There is &euro;1.5 billion in it already and an extra &euro;500 million will be added.</p></speech>

Again, it was prudent not to assume the graph would always go up and we are basing our projections on the graph turning and receipts going down this year.</p>  <p>  We have also increased capital spending, and there has been a 25% increase in capital spending this year, with a further 10% increase next year.  That equates to &euro;700 million.  Capital spending is different from current spending as once a school or hospital is built, it is built.  We do not need to rebuild these every year.  We are putting much more into capital spending and public infrastructure because it is needed but also because we understand that those receipts from corporation profit tax might not always be there so we should not spend it on things like pay increases, which must be paid every year.  We should spend it on one-off projects like capital projects, which is exactly what we have done.</p></speech>

It has been reported that 15 special needs schools have contacted the Department this year to inform it that they cannot afford to pay their insurance bills.  I raised this issue last year and was very disappointed to see that it was still on the agenda and had not been resolved.</p></reply>

The increases appear to be due, in some instances, to an annual increase in insurance costs generally and, in some cases, an increase in claims against special schools.</p>  <p>  Securing and maintaining adequate and appropriate insurance cover is a matter for the managerial authority of each school.  My Department is working as a matter of urgency with the NABMSE and relevant Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the State Claims Agency to seek a resolution of the issue of increased insurance costs in special schools.</p>  <p>  A number of options have been identified to address the issue.  They include the development of a group insurance scheme for special schools.  The NABMSE met boards and patrons on 6 June to discuss the matter and the options available.  An official from my Department attended the meeting.  </p>  <p>  At this stage, the group scheme proposal appears to be the most viable.  The importance of all schools signing up to such a scheme was emphasised at the recent meeting and all school representatives who were in attendance were in favour of exploring the group scheme option.</p>  <p>  Fifteen special schools that are experiencing difficulty in paying insurance premiums have contacted my Department directly.  They report increases in the cost of insurance of between 30% and over 700% in the past two years.  To date, my Department has advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to two special schools, amounting to &euro;36,860.  My Department is engaging with the other schools in that regard.  However, it is not sustainable for my Department to continue to advance capitation payments as a way of meeting vastly increased insurance premiums.  I know that this is a cause of concern for schools also and it is my hope a speedy and cost effective resolution can be secured for special schools which have been impacted on.</p></reply>

This issue was raised by me on 12 June last year.  I took it from the reply given by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, that he was dealing with it urgently, taking steps, meeting stakeholders and doing everything possible to deal with it.  One year later we find that the insurance industry is being allowed by the Government to run amok and the response of the Department of Education and Skills is neither good enough nor quick enough.  One school's insurance costs jumped from &euro;3,000 to &euro;26,300.  I have no idea why that happened in two years.  It is unsustainable and no school could ever meet that cost.  Furthermore, the Government has refused to grant the increases in capitation we sought last year in the budget.  I do not know what happened in that regard.  I believe the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, felt Fianna F&aacute;il would fight for and get this, but it seems that people at the higher levels of the Minister's party felt they did not want to be seen to give Fianna F&aacute;il a win on capitation payments.  The problem was left unaddressed and it appeared to be a case of "We will leave the schools without".  There was an uncaring attitude on the part of the Government which was not willing to accede to the demand of the unions, Fianna F&aacute;il and the D&aacute;il on capitation payments.  As a result, schools have been left in the lurch with these and other bills that they simply cannot afford to pay.</p></speech>

St. Teresa's special school in Ballinasloe was faced with an increased bill.  It was not being facilitated by being able to make staged payments and had to pay the bill in one go.  It did not have the money to pay it.  This is an issue we are taking very seriously.  There is a potential option that all of the special schools are prepared to buy into, namely, having one group scheme, rather than individual schools having to deal with insurance costs in isolation.  Of the 124 schools, seven are hospital schools.  I visited one of them recently in Crumlin.  It is very clear that the expenses associated with special schools are over and above those of an average school.  I agree with the Deputy that issue of capitation payments is outstanding.  I am committed to doing something about it, obviously within the parameters of the budget to be announced on 8 October.  I have no doubt that there will be a discussion between the Deputy's party and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in that regard, but as far as I am concerned, the issue of capitation payments is critical, not just for special schools but also mainstream schools.</p></speech>

There is another issue for the schools attached to organisations under section 38 of the Health Act.  There was supposed to be a general agreement in respect of them, namely, the State's general indemnity scheme.  I do not know if that issue has been sorted out for that cohort of schools.  What is the position in that regard?  We have got to take this issue much more seriously.  The solicitor Gareth Noble stated in the media this week that the Department of Education and Skills had stepped off the playing pitch in the area of special educational needs.  In my experience there is considerable truth in what he said when we look at this issue and a range of others which include children being denied their constitutional right to an education, children being denied the supports they need, constant announcements that have little or no basis in reality and an utter failure to use the special powers Fianna F&aacute;il inserted into the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill to force schools to open special classes.  They have not been touched and children have been left at home with home tuition grants, if they can receive them.  The Minister has to get to grips with the issues in the area of special education.</p></speech>

One euro out of every five goes into special education.  I refer to a sum of &euro;1.9 billion out of a budget of &euro;11 billion.  The sum invested in school transport is more than &euro;207 million, of which 50% is in the area of special education.  We have moved into a new era in the past ten years in special education.  There are things we are getting right and others that we are getting wrong, but there are ways by which we can improve.  The Deputy is correct to say there is special provision in respect of powers I can invoke as Minister.  I will talk about that issue when we come to deal with a later question in the context of my frustration and disappointment that some schools are not taking up the option of providing extra classes.  </p>  <p>  As regards where we are going in special education, the people who provide the inclusion model in schools are enriched by it.  The students also come out enriched by it in terms of the experiences they share.</p>  <p>  A question was asked about the HSE in the context of the general indemnity scheme.  A number of special schools under the patronage of organisations that are funded by the HSE to provide health and personal social services on its behalf under section 38 of the Health Act experienced increased insurance quotes when the funded bodies were delegated bodies in the context of the general indemnity scheme under the State Claims Agency.  The effect of the delegation was that the special schools under the patronage of the organisations concerned needed to seek separate insurance cover.  There is a discussion ongoing in that regard.</p></speech>

In April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools in the next four years - 2019 to 2022, inclusive.  The announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department to assess future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for Kilkenny city, although it does include a new 16 classroom primary school for Kilkenny to be established in September 2021, the requirement for new schools is being kept under ongoing review and, in particular, will have regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently met personnel from Kilkenny County Council when the council&rsquo;s plans for housing in the Kilkenny area in the coming years were outlined.  Further engagement is planned in that regard.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or the provision of a new school or schools.  In that context, as the Deputy will be aware, building projects for five post-primary schools located in Kilkenny are included in my Department's school building programme.  Building projects for Kilkenny will provide additional capacity in the order of 600 additional places above September 2017 levels: Kilkenny CBS - 73 places; St. Kieran's College - 35 places; Pobail Scoil Osra&iacute; - 166 places; and Kilkenny city post-primary chool - 334 places.  Significant works to improve and expand facilities at Presentation secondary school are also planned.</p></reply>

I raised this for several reasons.  First, there is a large population on the east of Kilkenny city.  The Minister raised housing, which is something that I was going to bring up.  The has been more development of houses there, which is very welcome and, hopefully, it will be allocated by September, but it will increase the population on that side of the city.  Many children there go to primary school on that side of the city but must then travel to the other side for post-primary schooling.  They do not qualify for school transport, which is an ongoing issue, because they are regarded as living within reasonable distance, although practically it is a long distance to walk.  I also raise the matter as we have an excellent Educate Together primary school but no Educate Together secondary school.  Parents who have chosen to educate their children in that ethos have no option to continue that at second level.  There are limited co-education secondary schools and, therefore, parents who send their schools to a primary school of mixed gender rarely have the opportunity to continue this at second level.</p></speech>

As we plan for the future, it is not about annual or two-year plans, but a ten-year investment of more than &euro;8.4 billion in capital expenditure.  We must consider whether capacity exists where schools have the opportunity to put in applications under the additional school accommodation scheme; whether there are solutions within existing infrastructure; and whether we are looking at a future where additional capacity will be required through new schools.</p>  <p>  Circumstances change, and do so quickly.  This happened recently in the Ashbourne area, as Deputy Thomas Byrne knows well.  </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's statement that it will be kept under review but we will keep raising it.  Schools in Kilkenny city are fully subscribed and even have waiting lists.  People are also having to travel outside the city and then encounter the problem of school transport where they are seen as having chosen a school that is not closest to them, and, therefore, do not qualify for free travel.  They must apply for concessionary tickets.  The Minister knows what a nightmare that is.  That is part of why this is a problem.</p>  <p>  The Educate Together system deserves a secondary school and parents and children who have had the experience at primary level deserve to continue that into secondary school, if they wish.</p>  <p>  It also gives an opportunity for additional autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes, which is something I raise here as often as possible.  There will be three new-build secondary schools - the schools themselves are not new - such as Col&aacute;iste Pobal Osra&iacute;, the CBS, and the technical school.  It should be impressed on them that they must have ASD classes.  Information on this seems to mixed.  The NSCE would have schools believe that they must have these ASD classes whereas the schools themselves seem to think differently.</p></speech>

We are in the same position with secondary schools now as we were when primary schools saw their demographics increase.  Unfortunately, while we managed to maintain the capital budget in education as best we could during the difficult years, there are always legacy issues.  The Deputy mentioned Kilkenny CBS, which sought an additional 73 places in its 2017 enrolment.  The appointment of consultants to progress the new building project will commence this week.  There is movement on several of these matters and I will be happy to share this information with her. </p></speech>

This requirement to consult will be underpinned in law once the student and parents charter Bill is enacted.  I will publish this Bill in the autumn.  Schools are not required to report to my Department on the implementation of circulars and my Department is not aware of any issues in the implementation of this circular in ETB schools.</p>  <p>  Decisions on the use of smartphones and other such devices in schools are taken at local level by the board of management, which have responsibility for the direct governance of a school under the provisions of the Education Act 1998.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the requirement to safeguard children from the negative impact of using digital devices.

I asked the ETBs, and, insofar as they have responded, the picture is pretty poor.  According to Longford-Westmeath ETB, approximately half the secondary schools have not undertaken the consultation.  The response in the Limerick-Clare ETB was patchy, and in Waterford-Wexford it is approximately half and half, some of which have done this.  In Carlow-Kilkenny ETB, one school has completed the consultation.  Kerry, Cork and Kildare-Wicklow are better than most ETBs and, for the most part, they appear to have implemented the circular.  In Tipperary, only one school has implemented the circular.  The Louth-Meath ETB, in my own area, has not given me the full information.  However, I know that in one school where this has become an issue, Ratoath, the circular was commenced this year, almost a year after it was issued.  Listening to people at a meeting last night, including the Minister's colleague, Deputy Regina Doherty, there was utter dissatisfaction over how this is being implemented.  </p>  <p>  Schools feel lost on this - they do not have the Department's support on implementation of circulars on digital learning - and parents feel utterly lost because they are worried about smartphone addiction.  We have seen what has happened in recent months with stories about phones and what is on them.  The Department is not helping.  Fianna F&aacute;il would ban smartphones in schools up to junior cycle.</p></speech>

That is why I continue to push ahead with the student and parent charter.  It is important.  The main reason for introducing this legislation is to give both parents and students a voice on their participation in the education system.

I have only been able to get the information from a number of ETBs.  Obviously, I cannot get it from the voluntary secondary school sector or the primary school sector.  Studies have shown that mobile phone use in school has a negative impact through cognitive overload, increased distraction and altered memory and learning patterns.  We have seen adopted in some schools a digital only approach whereby there are no school textbooks.  The problem in some of them is that there is poor implementation of the replacement, that is, notes.  This is a huge issue in schools and the Department has not got to grips with it.  Frankly, what happened last year was that the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, was looking for a headline for the newspapers during the teacher conferences and announced the circular.  Once the circular was published the following month, that was the end of it and nothing more was heard from the Department.  Some schools and ETBs literally threw the circular in the bin and the Department was not able to tell me this until I obtained the information.  I question the seriousness of the Department on the issue.  I also question its seriousness on the parent and student charter Bill which was announced as if it were law at the end of 2016.  A teacher came up to me at the meeting in Ratoath last night and told me that it was law.  It is not.  I had to tell her that it was not even written.  There is no use in announcing it again three years later.  It needs to be implemented and introduced.</p></speech>

The student and parent charter is something on which I have been working very intensively since I was appointed.  We will publish it in the coming months.  It is important that parents and students have a voice with regard to the circular that was sent.  It is not subject to law; it is just a circular.  I will contact the ETB about the school that was discussed by the Deputy and that was the subject of the meeting last night.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referenced my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, who will head an all-Government approach to the use of mobile phone technology and smartphones to try to introduce proper safeguards and safety measures to protect young people.  There is a responsibility on the Government, citizens and parents, as well as on the companies to act responsibly.  They are the ones with the algorithms, data and information to spot online bullying.  We have to ensure this will happen.  The world in which we live is different from the one in which the Deputy and I went to school.  He went to school a few years after me.  Everything in life is about balance.  Technology is part of the new world, but it is about balance.  I am a traditionalist when it comes to getting back to basics and books will continue to be a fundamental part of children's education.  Old teaching techniques will remain a fundamental part, but the world is changing.  In the work we do in this House we have embraced technology in the past decade.</p></speech>

Ensuring every child has access to an appropriate school placement is a priority for me and the Government.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in growing additional provision for children with special educational needs through increased enrolment in mainstream and special classes and special schools.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, plays a central role in advising on the nature and mix of provision required, co-ordinating and supporting the establishment of the necessary number of places to meet local need, including in the area referred to by the Deputy.  It is open to any school, including special schools, to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and, where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is available to the school.  My Department works closely with the NCSE in that regard.</p>  <p>  While progress has been made in recent weeks, further work is required to ensure every child has a suitable school placement for September.  Every school has a duty to open special classes and other specialist provision sufficient to meet the needs of the local community.  Following the commencement of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, a power has been created to allow me to compel a school to make additional provision for special education.  As the Deputy is aware, the power has yet to be invoked, but if we meet challenges, we will have to keep a very close eye on this issue.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised my officials that there is a need for some additional specialist education provision in the Dublin 12 area for the upcoming school year and that it is continuing to work with parents and local schools to ensure there will be sufficient special school and special class places for pupils who will require them in the Dublin 12 area in September.</p></speech>

In Dublin 12 there are nine ASD classes, with a maximum of six children attending each class.  The classes range from early intervention preschool classes up to and including sixth class.  The children remain in the ASD class until they are integrated into a mainstream classroom, where they have the benefit of learning among their peers, while having the security provided by the ASD class and experienced staff.  Unfortunately, not all schools cater for ASD classes from junior infants to sixth class, which can be very stressful for the children involved.  There are long waiting lists to access ASD units in Dublin 12.  Children with moderate to severe autism are unable to access mainstream classrooms and require autism specific schools where they can have their individual needs met.  Scoil Colm on Armagh Road in Crumlin would be a perfect setting for an ASD specific school.  Dublin 12 has an established special school, Scoil Eoin, which is situated beside it.  There are 134 children in the school which, unfortunately, does not take autistic children.  The school could link closely with Scoil Colm to provide a specific school.</p></speech>

This type of information on the ground is invaluable to the officials who work on the issue.  The Deputy is correct that there are nine autism classes, one early intervention class, eight primary autism classes and five post-primary classes.  Out of a budget of &euro;1.9 billion, &euro;300 million goes directly to support services for young autistic children in primary and secondary schools.  I encourage the Deputy to continue doing what she is doing and give us information.  She has personal contacts and knowledge at local level and may believe schools need more information.  Every special school and school with special classes are further enriched by providing for inclusion.  If more information is needed for these schools to let them know how invaluable it could be in a local area, I will be happy to do it with my officials.</p></speech>

One parent cannot even get his child into a school.  For children with moderate to severe autism who are unable to cope in a mainstream setting, an ASD specific school will fulfil their educational needs.  Scoil Colm is run by the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  The parents have met the trust to discuss the possibility of the school becoming an autism specific school and it is very open to considering it.  The door is open and we will keep pushing it as much as possible.  There is plenty of land available to build a new ASD specific school, but we have identified Scoil Colm, a large area behind which could be developed as a sensory garden.  There are many opportunities.  It is situated right beside a health clinic with GPs, public health nurses, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  There is a huge opportunity to develop the school which is not operating as an autism specific school with the support of Scoil Eoin.  I have also tabled Parliamentary Question No. 65 to ask the Minister to meet the parents to examine this issue.</p></speech>

We have to examine existing capacity.  Are some schools willing to invest more and put in additional classes?  That is an ongoing challenge.  We have 124 special schools nationally and seven hospital schools.  We have choices to make all of the time regarding where investment will go.  I reiterate that the NCSE is the agency on the ground identifying needs.  There will be a constructive response if a need is identified.  Regarding a national breakdown of students attending mainstream schools, 63% of young children on the autism spectrum attended mainstream schools, 26% attended special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools and 11% attended special schools.</p></speech>

It is our job to try and alleviate some of the additional difficulties and stresses and to not add to them.  The NCSE, wrote to me on 18 April pursuant to provisions now contained in the Education Act 1998 through which ultimately a ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available.  The NCSE identified that provision is required for 40 special school places for students with complex needs, including ASD in Dublin 15.</p>  <p>  As existing special schools could not provide the necessary number of places within the timescale, it is necessary to establish a start-up special school in the area.  Given the timing issues, it was essential to appoint a patron of scale with the experience necessary to immediately action and progress the necessary arrangements.  Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB has agreed to act as patron for this start-up special school and it is progressing recruitment and other arrangements with a view to ensuring the school opens in September.  Temporary accommodation has been secured to facilitate the school's start up then. </p>  <p>  The advertisement for the role of principal was issued in the first week of June and interviews are to take place shortly.  I am anxious that the principal, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, in the new school be appropriately supported.  My Department, through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the NCSE and with input from the Middletown Centre for Autism, will develop a programme of professional learning for school staff.  This will include upskilling, before the students commence school, on a phased basis and ongoing mentoring, coaching and in-school support during the challenging start-up terms.  The NCSE is keeping in regular contact with the parents of the children concerned and will continue to advise them of progress.</p></speech>

The more general issue arises repeatedly in the House.  We have seen a couple of important protests organised by Enough is Enough!.  Parents are getting organised in respect of this issue.  Does he accept that this is not just a local problem here and there and that there is a nationwide problem regarding an absence of all of the supports necessary for children on the autism spectrum?  Does he also accept that the State is substantially failing these children?</p>  <p>  I will give an example from Dublin 24.  Responsibility for part of this problem lies with the Department of Health and concerns people waiting five years to get access to required therapy.  There are also, however, hundreds of children who do not have any school place or, in most cases, do not have a school place in an appropriate school given their needs.  A radically different approach is needed as opposed to dealing with this issue only if it emerges as enough of a problem.  Substantial financial investment is needed.</p></speech>

We need to keep this issue live on the agenda and we need to continue to debate it in this House.  We are putting a great deal of resources into special education.  It is now one out of every five euro.  We also need, however, to look at how we can provide a more holistic education to people who would not have been getting that in the past.  That is why I have set up a social inclusion pilot which will cover west Dublin, Kildare and parts of Wicklow.  We have chosen 75 schools.  If complex special needs are involved, we will examine the need for a specialist nurse and incorporating the HSE into the pilot as well.  That could involve speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or behavioural therapy and having that therapy delivered in a school setting.  We have a duty to ensure that follow a totally inclusive approach with every single young person, no matter what disadvantage he or she might be experiencing, whether a physical or otherwise.  That is why I have used the word "cumas&uacute;", which means "empowerment", at the heart of my education policy to ensure that every single young person is subject to that inclusive approach.  We, however, have to continue this debate in this House and it is important we do that because this is a changing world.</p></speech>

It is striking that these parents are dealing with very difficult situations and they are not being assisted by the State.  They are then forced to go out and struggle and fight for what is necessary for and the right of their children.  I had a meeting last week with parents involved in different groups in my area.  They were from the Tallaght Parents Autism Support Group, Social Circle and Enough is Enough!.</p>  <p>  They told horrifying stories regarding the failure of the State and the number of children faced with being taught at home because they are not getting the appropriate supports that they need.  There were also stories of children who had access to ASD units in the first half of primary school but were then forced to move into a different school.  That causes significant disruption in their lives and their education during the second half of primary school.  I heard reports of SNAs who have effectively been turned into classroom assistants because there is only provision for one SNA per classroom.  There might, however, be three or four children needing access to that service.  It means that the system is completely failing. </p></speech>

I visit many primary and post-primary schools and I see the value of that focus on inclusion and the value of SNAs.  That is why I am going to work hard regarding the recommendations on behalf of SNAs.  I met with the F&oacute;rsa trade union last week to discuss the status of SNAs, their training and ongoing professional development.  That is because SNAs have led the way.  They were in those classrooms before we started talking about the social inclusion pilot and an all-inclusive classroom setting with behavioural therapists and speech and language occupational therapists.</p>  <p>  I went into a small primary school in Donegal on Monday and I came across a young child named Paul.  His mother was able to tell me that there is an additional need beyond speech and language occupational therapy.  She was referring to physiotherapy.  We are, therefore, learning all of the time and picking up new things.  Deputy Paul Murphy is correct in stating that we have to continue to listen to the voices of parents.  They are the people who have this lived experience.  There is no doubt that the student and parent charter, when it becomes law, will be another vehicle to ensure that those voices are heard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500025#X01300"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.</p>  <p>  It relates to my recent education trade mission to the UAE.  While there, I engaged with 450 Irish teachers at two meetings in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  I thank all the teachers who turned out on both nights.  These meetings gave me the opportunity to hear the challenges facing these teachers and gave them a chance to offer practical solutions to some issues.  The meetings allowed me in my role as Minister to meet with these teachers and discuss first hand with them the challenges they face in returning to Ireland, and to consider ways that we can work together to support them when they decide to return to work in Ireland.</p>  <p>  To facilitate this, teachers volunteered to form a group to liaise on the identified issues with the embassy and my Department.  Arrangements are being made for the first meeting of this group in the autumn.  During my visit, I also had a number of productive meetings that will further develop and enhance the co-operation that currently exists between Ireland and the UAE in the higher education area.</p><p>Today I had a follow-up meeting as a result of that engagement in the UAE.<br/><br/>The education system plays a key role in forging crucial global relationships and building an international outlook and awareness.  One of the core ambitions of my Government&rsquo;s international education strategy, Irish Educated, Globally Connected, is to support the development of internationally-oriented and globally competitive institutions.  The visit has assisted us in delivering on this ambition.  I met my counterpart, the Emirati Minister for Education, H.E. Hussain Ibrahim Al Hammadi.  We discussed some of the common challenges we faced in our respective education systems and agreed that we would work together to address these challenges through the exchange of information and collaboration.<br/><br/>I also visited a number of Emirati higher education Institutions such as Khalifa University and the City University College of Ajman, where I had the opportunity to promote the Irish higher education sector and very fruitful discussions on how to increase the number of academic, research, staff and student exchanges between higher education institutions in both countries.<br/><br/>While in Dubai I attended a business breakfast of the Irish Business Network to highlight possibilities for partnerships between Irish and Emirati educational institutions and to meet key Irish business community members. <br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>I also visited RCSI and Mohamed Bin Rashid University in the Mohamed Bin Rashid Academic Medical Centre.  The RCSI has been present in Dubai since 2005 offering postgraduate education, training and consultancy in leadership, management, patient safety and quality.  There is already a strong connection through the RCSI alumni network and my visit as Minister for Education and Skills aimed to strengthen that relationship.<br/><br/>I thank the Irish ambassador and his staff in the Irish Embassy, the local Irish groups, including the GAA, and the Irish living in the UAE for the work they did to make the visit a success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.259" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500026#Y00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  I nearly feel like suggesting Dubai and the UAE should be making some contribution to the education system since they are getting the benefit of our graduates who come through really good teacher training programmes in the teacher training colleges.  It is positive that the Minister went there, but those of us who are involved in education or know about it could tell him what the challenges are.  Pay inequality is one and housing another.  I know young teachers who have gone there.  They say that if they go for two or three years, they will come back with at least the deposit for a house, if not the full price.  That is fair enough for graduates who go directly after graduation.  However, the phenomenon of teachers travelling abroad on career breaks has an impact on schools here.  We have had terrible situations.  It has got to the point where boards are having to refuse applications for career breaks because of the impact they are having.  In fact, I know of a case where a person resigned rather than come back sooner than they had intended.  Did the Minister meet any principal who was on a career break, or any teacher on a career break who was interested in a principalship?  Are these vacancies part of the agenda, or will they be?</p></speech>

I knew a lot of them - the pay equality issue, problems in teacher supply, the price of accommodation in Dublin and the uncertainty facing substitute teachers when they came back.  It was an opportunity for me to highlight what we had done in the past few months to set up teacher supply panels for substitute teachers in counties Dublin, Galway, Meath, Kildare and Cork.  The most important part - believe it or not - was the engagement that took place after the meeting during the one-to-one discussions.  It was an opportunity to acknowledge the work the teachers were doing internationally.  They are acting as Irish ambassadors and doing so well in terms of career progression.  They are heads of departments, principals and deputy principals.  They have a skill set and there was a conversation about how we could value it when they returned.  If someone has been a head of a department for four years in the UAE, how can we inform boards of management of how beneficial that experience would be to their schools?  In a nutshell, I felt there would be a positive outcome.  I got a sense that we needed to have a better communication system between the Department and all of our teachers abroad, not just in the UAE but also in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and all over the world.  I see them as a tremendous asset.  Like most Irish people who go away, they want to come back home at some stage.</p></speech>

He did not answer my question about principalships, although he might when he replies again.  Some two or three years ago it was a nightmare to find teachers to replace those who had gone on a career break.  This week we were supposed to interview nine on a panel for two permanent jobs, but by the time they had received notice from the school eight had found permanent jobs.  I acknowledge that there has been some movement.</p>  <p>  I have a further question two places down the list.  I will also bring up this issue when we reach them.  I refer to middle management and the extent of the paperwork that must be done.  To me, middle management should be about more than paperwork.  It should be about enhancing the quality of teaching and the relationship with the students.  The extent of the paperwork which must be done is affecting those who are not applying for principalships.  What is it actually adding to the educational process?  How is it making life better for children in schools?  I agree that when people come back from abroad, they bring experience and a skill set.  I just want them to come back at some point.</p></speech>

The Minister has said he knows what the issues are.  I quote from a report on his visit:</p><blockquote>Denise Somers, who has just completed her first year in Abu Dhabi, is the type of person McHugh is hoping to convince to return home.  She graduated in 2016 and moved for job security after struggling to make ends meet in Ireland, where she did insecure short-term cover work.</blockquote><p>Ms Somers is quoted as saying she worked as a substitute in Ireland and that now she is getting full-time work over there.  She earns nearly one third more than what she would be paid here.  Her job is permanent and her housing and medical insurance are paid for.  Coming back to Ireland, where she would be put at the bottom of the queue and possibly on substitute panels, is not an option for her.  The same report describes a couple who went to Abu Dhabi and came home to try to work here.  They decided that it would not work out because they could not afford to live here.  They went back to Abu Dhabi to save money for a house.  The Government must ensure there is housing available, decent pay and permanent work of a standard that these teachers will want to come home as otherwise they will not.</p></speech>

I do not think I met any principal.  There were teachers on a career break and a lot of young teachers who had gone out in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.  I was aware of this before, but the pay equality issue is big.  Those teachers have advocates all around them, not just those who were recruited from 2011 to 2014.  People have different motivations for going abroad.  We will never be able to compete with the UAE where teachers do not pay tax and their accommodation is paid for.  We will not compete as people understand when they go away.  The question is how we can make things easier.  I acknowledge the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, the Joint Managerial Body, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools.  They have produced a one stop shop portal.  If a vacancy to teach a subject is available in certain schools, teachers can apply online and interview by Skype.  That is happening.  We have to think about how we can make things easier and communicate with teachers.  I also acknowledge the strong input they are making on the international scene.  I met a lot of former teachers who had moved into the UAE's ministry of education.  That is a very important link for us.  Several other issues were mentioned, but I do not have time to address them.</p></speech>

It prompted me to look at the number of school projects at stage 2(b), architectural design and planning stage.  Several seem to have been at this stage for a considerable period.  Will the Minister and his Department take steps to address the delays and issues facing the schools that have projects at stage 2(b) for the longest periods?</p></reply>

Stage 2(b) - detailed design - is arguably the most complex and detailed of all the stages of architectural planning.  In addition to securing the necessary statutory approvals, it includes preparation of complex and detailed tender documents.</p><p>In completing stage 2b, design teams are now required to upgrade design details to ensure that new school buildings are near zero energy buildings, or NZEBs, in compliance with the 2017 amendment of Part L of the current building regulations.  In many cases, this has involved a second planning application to allow for the installation of photovoltaic panels on the roof following receipt of the initial planning permission.<br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that all major school building projects under the Department's construction programme are progressed through the various stages of architectural planning in accordance with the Department's design team procedures, building control regulations and public works contract requirements.  He will also accept that as the funding is Exchequer funding, the process and costs associated with any major project must be fully accounted for.  Design teams must therefore be diligent in their preparation of the stage 2b tender documentation to satisfy all regulatory bodies and my Department's design team procedures.  This results in minimising delays during further stages of the project.<br/><br/><b>Major school building projects at stage 2b for one year and over:</b><table><tr><th>Project Type</th><th>Project Name</th><th>Date Progressed to Stage 2(b)</th><th>At Stage 2(b) &amp;gt;

However, it is interesting that of the 70 major schools building projects at stage 2b, seven have been at that stage for a year, 19 for two years, 19 for three years and nine for five years.  What is going on that these they are taking so long to get through stage 2b?  The particular concern school principals raise with me is whether priority is being given to new builds rather than to substantial refurbishments.  It is causing significant difficulty where schools avoid availing of summer works or upgrading notwithstanding their poor condition and this is going on year after year.  Capital expenditure in the Department of Education and Skills is ahead of profile.  Is that a contributing factor?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500027#Z00400"><p>There are a number of reasons for delays.  For example, the NZEB regulations were introduced in 2017, which meant many school projects in the 2016-2021 capital programme had to be revised.  A number in my own constituency had to go back through the process to ensure the designs met the NZEB provisions.  The major question among schools and students themselves relates to environmental standards.  When I go to schools that are more than 100 years old, the students ask me how they can be made more environmentally sound and habitable.  They ask why they do not have solar panels and why we are not retrofitting them.  These are legitimate questions and young people are challenging us on them.  It is difficult for students in older schools to watch new schools coming down the line.  It raises questions of fairness.  There are many competing pressures on the budget and investing to make schools sustainable.  There is also the ongoing demographic challenge of increases in population.  One can list the reasons.  It was not just NZEB.  Schools might not have received fire compliance certificates or other issues may have arisen along the way.  If the Deputy feels there are schools that are not being progressed properly, I would be very interested to hear about it.</p></speech>

I might help him by providing a couple of those examples.  Lucan Community College has been looking for its extension which has been going through the process at this stage for more than a decade.  Holy Family Community School in Rathcoole was identified in 2004 as needing a new 1,000-student building within seven years.  According to the most recent reply, it is at stage 2b.  The irony is that its identification as requiring a new school and significant upgrades means it has not been able to avail of the summer works scheme since 2004.  Divine Mercy senior and junior national school in Clondalkin had a design team appointed in January 2004.  The most recent reply from the Department states that it remains at stage 2b.  The concern is clearly indicated by the principal who wrote last winter as follows:</p><blockquote>After the past two days rain, the roof in the prefabs has five serious leaks.  I have had to evacuate and relocate a class of eight and nine year olds to another substandard classroom as the caretaker endeavours to fix the problems.  As we are only at the start of the winter, I am at a loss to know what to do.  Should I have the whole roof repaired at a substantial cost or is it to be razed to the ground.</blockquote><p>These are the ongoing problems schools face while waiting to progress.  If what was involved was a new build, most principals believe it would have happened already.</p></speech>

A major building project was authorised to proceed to stage 2b on 14 March 2017.  A brief-change report was submitted to the Department in October 2017 to seek approval for a full replacement of or repairs to the existing roof.  The Department required a further breakdown of the costs and scope from the design team and that was received in July 2018.  The Department approved the full replacement of the existing roof in October 2018.  The design team quantity surveyor withdrew from the project in late October 2018 and a replacement tender process was carried out by Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB, the client for the project.  The replacement quantity surveyor appointment was ratified in April 2019.  The design team is completing stage 2b, including by ensuring the submission is NZEB compliant.  That is just one example of the issues we cannot control.  If that was one of the schools that has been waiting ten years, I appreciate the deep frustration on the part of the board of management, principal, teachers, students and wider community.  We are in the right place now and, hopefully, we can make progress.</p></speech>

It keeps them on the radar, which does no harm at all.  I will outline the position on the projects referred to by the Deputy.  The major building project for St. Eunan's College, Letterkenny, is included on my Department's ADAPT programme.  My Department is currently in the process of finalising the appointment of a project manager for this programme.  The process to appoint a design team for this project has also recently commenced and is under way.  The major building project for Gaelscoil na gCeithre Maistr&iacute; is at stage 2a, developed design.  At this stage the preferred option design is developed to a stage where the project is fully cost planned and can be prepared to lodge for statutory approvals.  The major building project for Little Angels special school is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, stage 2b, detailed design.  The stage 2b submission has been reviewed by my Department and comments have issued to the school and its design team.  The design team is currently working on a submission to my Department outlining the steps required to achieve compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2017 on NZEB.  The major building project for Scoil Mhuire, Stranorlar, is also at stage 2b.  The pre-qualification process to select a shortlist of contractors for tender stage has been completed and the design team is currently completing work on its NZEB submission.  When the design team's revised NZEB submission has been considered, my Department will be in contact with the board of management with regard to the further progression of the project as it then goes to tender.</p></speech>

It was included in the capital plan in 2011 but was removed by the Minister's predecessor.  It did not appear in any plan between 2011 and 2016.  In 2016, it was included in the capital plan again.  What worries me, as the Minister well knows, is that we had to get an extension of time for the planning permission already.  If this goes on much longer and if we are not on site to carry out substantial works to get another extension, I am very worried about the result.  I ask the Minister to take into consideration the fact that time is of the essence in Stranorlar.  Whenever he passes the school, he sees the dangers faced by children posed by prefabs and flooding.  It is a serious matter and one on which we must make progress.</p><p>I am pleased that St. Eunan's College in Letterkenny is in the ADAPT programme.  I hope a project manager and design team will be appointed quickly to allow the project to go ahead.  The Minister and I were there approximately two years ago in the company of the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  Progress has been slow.  I will deal mention some other schools when I ask my next supplementary questions.</p></speech>

My ambition is ensure this goes to tender as soon as the NZEB requirements are satisfied.  Parents will not be satisfied until they see diggers on site.  It is important for us to keep the timing on the radar here.  I acknowledge that the board of management at Scoil Mhuire in Stranorlar has had a long battle.  The safety of the children has been at the heart of the board's concerns when it has been dealing with flooding issues and the school's proximity to the church car park.  I know the Deputy will join me in wishing the outgoing principal of Scoil Mhuire, Fintan Keating, well on his retirement.  He kept the shoulder to the wheel as well.  The least we can do is ensure we get the timing right.  The design team process at St. Eunan's College in Letterkenny has started.  I agree that a project manager needs to be appointed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We must ensure his legacy is the commencement of this project by the end of this year or early next year.  I am aware that the vitally important project at Gaelscoil na gCeithre M&aacute;istr&iacute; is at the 2A design stage and is going for full costings.  I am extremely anxious for the Minister, as a Deputy for the Donegal constituency, to do whatever has to be done to make progress with this project quickly.  I think the project at Little Angels special school has been at its current stage for too long.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to expedite it and ensure the final stages are reached as quickly as possible so that tenders can be invited and machines can be brought onto the site.</p></speech>

I hope progress can be made in respect of the NZEB submission.  The progress in relation to that needs to continue.  I have mentioned a principal who is retiring.  I should also mention Chris Darby of St. Eunan's College.  I know Deputy Gallagher will join me in wishing him well.</p></speech>

In 2019, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will increase by &euro;674 million, which represents a 6.7% increase on last year's budget.  In total, the education budget will have increased by &euro;1.7 billion compared with 2016.  I am holding a symposium tomorrow to engage with people and organisations who work in and with small schools.  I am interested to listen to the views of the experts, but more importantly to engage with ideas and proposals on how to support and sustain small schools as a key component of the primary education system.  I know my colleagues around the House will be very interested in that.  I am working on the assumption that they have been notified about the symposium by email.  If they have not been notified, I would like to let them know publicly now that the symposium is taking place in the Hugh Lane Gallery.  If they need any information about times etc. they can contact my office.  The purpose of the symposium is to focus on how to strengthen and sustain our small primary schools that have one, two, three or four teachers.</p><p>With regard to class sizes, it is important to point out that over 1,300 additional posts in schools will be funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes.  The numbers employed in our schools will reach the highest ever level in the coming school year.  This builds on the budget 2018 measure which provided a one-point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools, which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.</p><p>I am aware of the workload burdens placed on schools.  The primary education forum was established in September 2018 to support the planning and sequencing of change in the primary school sector and to exchange information on the intentions and impacts of the actions in the action plan for education to look for synergies and opportunities to streamline implementation and address workload issues.  In adopting this approach, my Department and its partners have agreed to make several changes to the pace and sequence of the planned reforms, including the implementation of the primary mathematics curriculum and, second, to sequence the commencement the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>In addition to managing the sequence of change, the leadership framework introduced in 2017 allows for flexibility in identifying and prioritising the evolving leadership and management needs of schools and in assigning and reassigning post holders to specific roles and responsibilities to meet the evolving needs of schools.  Some &euro;2.75 million was allocated in budget 2017 to restore middle management positions.  Today, more than one in three primary school teachers holds a management position.  In addition, schools with teaching principals saw an increase in the number of principal release days in each of the last two budgets.</p><p>I am pleased to have been able to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools.  This will apply from the start of the 2019-20 school year.  Over the course of the 2019-20 school year, an additional &euro;10 million will be allocated to primary and post-primary schools, of which &euro;4 million will be allocated in 2019.  I fully acknowledge that the issues raised by the Deputy in her question are important for future investment.  I will take account of the budgetary submissions from all the relevant education stakeholders.</p></speech>

It is kind of ironic that on 4 July last year, I raised the exact same question with the Minister's predecessor following the INTO briefing, which many of us attended again this year.  We know the pupil-teacher ratio has been increased twice.  That is all very welcome.  The ratio in some of the DEIS schools in the north inner city is very good, but our primary classes are still the largest in the eurozone.  We have to reduce them.  The capitation grant was &euro;178.50 in 2008.  It went up to &euro;200 in 2009 and 2010.  Since then, it has been falling each year.  In 2019, it went back up to &euro;178.50, which is the rate that applied in 2008.  Even though schools do a marvellous amount of fundraising, the capitation grant continues to be very important.

The Deputy is correct when she says we have a long way to go.  I am reminded of the seanfhocal, mol an l&aacute; um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na, we praise the day in the evening.  We will not ease off on this important issue at EU and OECD levels.  There was a reduction of 11% in capitation funding in 2011.  This massive reduction was introduced as part of the wider reductions that were being made right across the Government at the time.  It was a very difficult one for communities.  School communities are always on hand to help to support local primary and secondary schools.  Putting fuel in the tank and ensuring the school carries on each day are bread and butter issues.  There has been an increase of 5% this year.  I am conscious that there is some way to go when it comes to capitation, which will be at the heart of the conversation when I sit down with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.</p></speech>

Approximately 1,300 of these positions have been restored.  There has been no further advance since 2017.  This issue needs to be considered.  I have spoken about the paper overload for principals.  I think there is a particular burden for teaching principals.  I know that some efforts have been made in this regard.  It has been suggested that a supply panel is needed.  The payment of commercial rates by schools, which are technically charities, is another issue that has been raised with me.  I do not know whether this can be looked at.  Another point occurs to me when I think about the need to move away from all the paperwork and onto other issues.  Like the Minister, I have taught at second level.  The issues that have always presented at second level, including anxiety, depression, anger and violence, are now presenting among much younger pupils.  That is a major challenge for many primary schools.  I suggest that middle management roles, rather than being focused on policies and plans, need to be directed towards dealing with the real issues that are evident in primary schools.  When an issue arises in a school, it is dealt with.  Those involved will not go up to the office to read the policy before dealing with the issue.</p></speech>

The issues that present themselves in our primary schools are much more complex than they used to be.  Teachers are aware of that.</p><p>Continuous professional development training is important, as is equipping them with the skills and capacity to deal with these emerging issues.  I see a lot of schools acting as support for one another, which involves schools principals meeting informally.  More than ever, teachers and principals are rising to the challenge.  </p> <p> The Deputy mentioned island schools, which are really important.  We introduced a policy measure that will retain the two-teacher provision for island schools irrespective of a decrease in the numbers.  There are 26 one-teacher schools, 537 two-teacher schools, and 376 three-teacher schools in the country.  In 2018 and 2019, the number of schools in the one, two, three and four-teacher category is 1,367, which is 44% of the total number of schools, which is 3,100.  </p></speech>

I am pleased to have been able to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools that will apply from the start of the 2019-20 school year this autumn.  Over the course of the school year 2019-20, an additional &euro;10 million will be allocated to primary and post-primary schools, of which &euro;4 million will be allocated in 2019.  I must be prudent.  In the context of ongoing budgetary pressures, it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year.  It is my intention to seek funding in the next budget for further capitation increases for schools.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that many of the costs schools experience, particularly energy, heating and lighting costs, have soared in recent years.  I know the Government talks a lot about the cost of insurance but the cost of insurance for schools has risen significantly and continuously over the past number of years.  In addition, many schools are finding it more and more difficult to get cover unless they literally confine the children to walking with their hands by the sides and keep them out of what insurers like to see as danger areas.</p>  <p>  How does the Minister expect schools to manage?  Across the country, primary and secondary schools run lots of functions.  I have attended lots of summer fairs in schools across my constituency.  The one thing everybody mentions, be they people on the parent-teacher association, PTA, or teachers, is the enormous burden on the schools caused by the lack of restoration of the capitation grant.  In modest demands presented to the Minister in respect of the budget, the INTO listed capitation as being critical.  </p></speech>

There are many demands on this Department.  When one considers a budget of &euro;11 billion, the first question one asks is about how surely there is enough money in there to do everything we seek to do but the basics are really important.  The Deputy is correct in pointing out that capitation is the bread and butter that keeps schools moving.  The fact that there is a bit of flexibility around using ancillary and capitation funding together for expenditure is really important.  Boards of management and parents' associations always go back cap in hand to the community and parents and the water eventually runs dry but I know that schools are such a fundamental part of the community.  The day of the school gate being a dividing line between the school and the community is gone.  I see the role now played by the private sector, for example, in secondary schools where it is looking to help out with computers.  The community will always want to be part of the contributory process but we must also get the balance right and if capitation funding is needed, it is something on which I will focus.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Minister has asked his officials to carry out a study into insurance costs for schools or a study into energy costs for schools but both are particularly onerous.  If one takes the kind of schools with which the Minister was commiserating just a while ago, which were promised significant upgrades or rebuilds in 2004, he will know that those schools are likely to be the ones that have had the least amount of retrofitting with regard to energy conservation.  In a way, the burden of the failure to improve and restore capitation falls on them.  Remember that we have been in a restoration process for many things following the difficult years of the crash.  Many schools built 40 or 50 years ago are basically heating the air when they operate their heating systems.  Has the Minister asked anybody in his Department to have a look at this in a serious way?</p></speech>

This is why we have launched an initial pilot between my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in conjunction with the SEAI.  One cannot use the word "modest" when one is talking about &euro;30 million, which is a lot of money, but in the bigger scheme of things where one has 4,000 schools, &euro;30 million will only do X number of those schools but we are looking at ways of ensuring that we do the proper deep retrofitting of schools because as I said earlier, students are demanding.  Young people in these older schools are asking questions around climate change, are looking to their immediate environment and are asking why they are sitting in an environment like it.  It goes back to choices.  It goes back to the choices we must all make as politicians and the Deputy will recall the difficult years from 2011 through to 2016.  Trying to deep retrofit all these schools in one go cannot happen but we must provide a pathway and instill confidence in young people that we are committed to it.</p></speech>

The review report, which was launched on 17 June, provides a comprehensive evaluation of the national Youthreach programme and demonstrates the positive impact of Youthreach for learners.</p>  <p>  The evaluation noted that demand for Youthreach across both Youthreach centres and community training centres, has fallen by 11% in the period 2015 to 2017, with a further fall in demand in 2018.  Some of this decline is related to the improved economic circumstances and availability of jobs.  In addition, the school retention rate continues to improve with 91% of students completing their leaving certificate examinations.</p><p>The evaluation also found there is an uneven geographical distribution of Youthreach places.</p> <p> SOLAS has considered the key review findings and has developed a response document that sets out 17 recommendations to further improve and develop the Youthreach programme.  These recommendations are framed in the context of the broader reform and integration of further education and training, FET, provision in general and the evolving strategy for the FET system.  The recommendations include considering the issues of uneven geographical distribution in annual local and national system planning, as well as ETBs, reviewing the sustainability of all centres.  In doing so, SOLAS and ETBs will be ensuring there is an appropriate balance of provision across levels one to six of the national framework of qualifications in providing both employment and progression opportunities to learners.</p></speech>

The saddest predictor of somebody being poor in later life is if he or she leaves school at an early stage without qualifications.  The numbers of those who want to access Youthreach has been falling but they are still significant.  They include children who have been affected by various family issues and children from different ethnic backgrounds.  For instance, Traveller children are significant participants in Youthreach.  A good Youthreach programme can make all the difference to somebody being successful, going on to a trainee or apprenticeship programme or to college.  There are success stories from Youthreach across the country.</p>  <p>  Which part of the recommendations will the Minister implement?  Will he take action to make the programme more accessible?</p></speech>

There will be a mechanism to consider all the recommendations and see how we can progress these.  We will not single out one or another.</p>  <p>  Youthreach is an invaluable pathway for young people who are struggling with mainstream education.  I recognise the benefit of the relationship between the principal of the mainstream school and the Youthreach team.  When there is a good relationship, it works well.  It is about creating the awareness of the benefit.  At the launch in Dublin in the past week, I met a wonderful young woman who had been in her sixth year in mainstream education but it was not working for her.  She subsequently went into the Youthreach programme and received the support and education she needed.  It was transformative and she is now in third level studying art and design.  We have to continue to channel that awareness but also to accentuate career progression.  While that sounds a bit mechanical, we also need, through the programme, to help young people prepare for life and give them the skills to equip them for life.</p></speech>

For instance, a child may be on the autism spectrum and find life difficult in a general school for a variety of reasons.</p>  <p>  Youthreach participation can be a postcode lottery.  It depends on where one lives.  What arrangements will the Minister make to deal with this?  The Youthreach model could be used in existing primary and secondary schools in rural and medium-sized towns where the population might be small.  It could be used like an ASD class as a special provision, which could give them an extra boost.</p></speech>

There are still, however, gaps among young Travellers and migrants.  Are we equipping them with the proper education to given them the skills to advance to third level or apprenticeship programmes?  SOLAS has a key role to play in all of this.  It is working with the third level sector and mainstream secondary school sector.  It will have a key role in these recommendations.  Practising politicians have an idea that the solution is to send everybody to third level.  That is one part of the solution.  We have to create positive awareness of apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  I recently visited the Combilift company in County Monaghan.  It was like being in a university complex, seeing young women doing apprenticeships there and their feeling of satisfaction with them.  We will have to continue with the engagement by industry with the second level sector and Youthreach.</p></speech>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case.  It may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools and the provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  The Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, 2019 to 2022, including a new eight-classroom primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area.  This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  My Department approved two temporary classrooms and a special education teaching room for Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in national school, Rathcoole, in 2018.

Several parents from Rathcoole, County Dublin, whose children go to preschool there have been unable to secure a primary school place for this September in either of the two schools in the village.  I am not aware of the full extent of the issue but the Department needs to make inquiries.</p>  <p>  The Minister previously indicated in a similar reply that there was to be a new eight-classroom school on Fortunestown Lane to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart area.  I respectfully suggest that departmental officials need to revisit that decision.  That new school will predominantly serve the population of Saggart and Citywest with little or no additional capacity for Rathcoole.  It will have little impact on the population of Rathcoole.  Will the Minister review the adequacy of the answer he has given and acknowledge that the new school proposed in Fortunestown Lane will do little to address current needs in Rathcoole?</p></speech>

My Department continues to engage with officials at local authority level on housing data and population growth.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently approved two further mainstream classrooms for Scoil Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in to cater for additional primary school places in Rathcoole for September 2019.  The responsibility for the installation of these classrooms has also been devolved to the board of management.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, would have regard to the impact of the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded to meet the needs of the local population.</p></speech>

I still contend that he needs to revisit this issue.  The existing schools are at capacity while housing development continues in the Rathcoole area.  If a family moves to the area with a child who is eight, nine, or ten years of age, the probability of getting into one of the two schools is zero, because they are full.  That is to say nothing of the junior infants.  If the Minister does not know the area, Fortunestown is quite a bit away, in the Citywest area.  An eight-classroom school in Fortunestown will have little impact on the population in the Rathcoole area.  That decision needs to be revisited and an additional school or additional capacity other than the Fortunestown proposal needs to be provided.</p></speech>

Is the Minister of State confident that sufficient funding has been allocated to drug and alcohol task forces to allow them to achieve the better outcomes envisaged in the national drugs strategy?  As the Minister of State is well aware, drugs are a massive plague in many communities across the State.  Not nearly enough is being done or invested to tackle the root problems behind this epidemic.  I am a member of the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum and I know that my city of Limerick has a worsening drugs problem.  Heroin, cocaine, the excessive use of alcohol, gambling and the misuse of prescription drugs are causing huge problems right across the city.  Unfortunately, class A drugs such as cocaine are becoming all the more common, particularly among middle-class people.  The use of cocaine is rampant in nightclubs and pubs across the country and this has escalated in recent years.  In addition, it is estimated that hundreds of people in Limerick are now addicted to heroin alone.</p>  <p>  The normalisation of drug use, and particularly of class A drug use, is of deep concern to me and others and it is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The misuse of drugs in Limerick is increasing on an almost daily basis.  The outcome of that can be seen on the streets.  Polydrug use, including the misuse of prescription drugs combined with alcohol, is having a devastating effect across Limerick city.  The continued failure to resource properly those who are working on the front line against the scourge of drug addiction is simply not acceptable.  It is unsustainable and, for that reason, the problem is getting worse.</p>  <p>  I have said this in the Chamber on a number of occasions and it depresses me to say it again, but the national drugs strategy will fail if the funding for it is not increased.  Without additional resources, there is no hope of it achieving its aims.  I really do wish it to succeed but, without funding, I have no confidence that it will.</p>  <p>  Another massive problem in this area is that families are being left to pay the drug debts of their members.  Some people are being forced to take out large expensive loans from moneylenders, which only creates further problems.  Will the Minister of State outline what extra investment and resources she will be seeking in the upcoming budget to tackle these issues?  Will she outline the action she has taken to address the normalisation of drug use and the issue of moneylending and family drug debts?</p></speech>

Drugs and alcohol task forces had their funding cut every year between 2008 and 2014.  Funding has effectively been frozen since 2014, despite the escalation of the drugs crisis.  This has had a devastating effect on the delivery of proper services for communities and on the drugs and alcohol task forces, which have lost experienced personnel.  In addition, drugs projects now have to tackle the alcohol crisis as this has been added to their remit without any extra funding or resources being allocated.  Funding needs to be reinstated to 2008 levels with an increase in funding to reflect the addition of alcohol issues to their remit.  Staff should have their pay restored and those who are entitled to increments should also have these restored.  More emphasis on health-related solutions and programmes is needed and our children need to be educated about drugs from an early age.</p>  <p>  There are new challenges every day.  For example, taking cocaine is, shockingly, being seen more and more as a recreational activity.  There were 736 drug and alcohol-related deaths in 2016, which is a far greater number than those who died on our roads.  Parents, children and whole communities are being terrorised and intimidated by those involved in the drug trade.  Another worrying trend is the grooming of children for use as drug couriers.  Task forces need to be given responsibility for drafting and implementing local strategies to combat the drugs crisis.  Task forces must be supported by the State and Government agencies including the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities.  Drugs and alcohol task forces need their funding restored because they are best placed to work with communities and with those with addictions and to fight against the ever-increasing drug problems in our communities.</p></speech>

I will come back to some of the issues that were raised in my second contribution.  The national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, is our whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland for the period from 2017 to 2025.  Drug and alcohol task forces at local and regional level play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in local communities.  They also ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken across all sectors to address substance misuse based on the identified needs and priorities in their areas.  The Department of Health provides in the region of &euro;28 million to support task forces annually through various channels of funding, including the HSE.  Individual task forces receive, on average, &euro;1 million, which can be used to respond to local needs.</p>  <p>  Measuring the overall effectiveness of the response to the drug problem is an important objective of drug policy.  Resources should be directed towards interventions and strategies which are most likely to lead to a reduction in problem substance use and an improvement in public health, safety and well-being.  The level of progress achieved in delivering on the actions set out in our national drugs strategy will be determined using performance indicators.</p>  <p>  In March 2019, I announced additional funding of &euro;1 million for the implementation of Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.  This funding, which will be provided on a recurring, multi-annual basis, will address the priorities set down in the strategy including early harm-reduction responses to emerging trends in substance misuse and improving services for groups with complex needs.  The funding will complement enhancements in drug and alcohol treatment services relating to mental health and homelessness under the 2019 HSE national service plan.  On foot of a consultation process with drug and alcohol task forces and the HSE, I approved a three-strand funding model for the allocation of this funding in May.  As part of strand 1 funding, each task force will receive &euro;20,000 in 2019 and then &euro;10,000 on a recurring annual basis from 2020 onwards.  This funding can be used to enhance services and meet operational costs.  I have made arrangements for these additional resources to be transferred to the task forces as soon as possible.  I hope this will happen in the coming weeks.  I will address some of the issues the Deputies have raised when I come back in.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, she is being strangled by the lack of resources.  My understanding is that the &euro;1 million she announced in March, on the day of the Private Member's motion on the issue, is to be spent by task forces over the next three and a half years.  That is quite disappointing.  I thought that money would be ring-fenced and poured into drugs task forces this year.  As I said earlier, the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum has taken cuts of more than 50% since 2008.  This has not been restored and the problem has worsened.  Over the years these cuts have negatively impacted on and prevented the delivery of drug and alcohol services that are urgently required in Limerick and across the entire mid-west region.  The Criminal Assets Bureau also needs to be resourced so that the proceeds of crime can be taken from local drug dealers and gangs.  Young people would see that the lifestyle of drug dealers is not what is portrayed on television or in movies if the response from the CAB was better.  Does the Minister of State intend to look at this particular area or to look for additional funding in the budget?</p></speech>

It is evident that the task forces have lost a significant number of personnel.  This money will not go near helping to keep those people on board because since 2008, the funding has been cut by up to 38% and we are nowhere near restoring that.  While the increased money is welcome, the Finglas Cabra drugs task force is probably the least well-funded task force in Dublin.  Most of them received &euro;10,000 each last year.  The problem is that it nearly took more to administer that.  We needed much more to cater for the different problems we had with staff and getting new projects up and running.  We have lost projects as a result of the lack of funding in recent years.  We need a major injection of funding.  While the amount the Minister of State mentioned is welcome, it goes nowhere near solving the problem.</p></speech>

We are all very clear as to what happened in recent years with funding.  We have &euro;1 million.  We have started to meet those involved in the services.  We have met the co-ordinators and the chairpersons.  We are developing a three-strand model for the recently-announced funding of &euro;1 million.  Strand 2 on this funding was 12 strategic health initiatives.  Task forces can include in this, health initiatives on early warning for alcohol and cocaine abuse, and getting into the heart of communities, particularly with young people.  Each community healthcare organisation, CHO, has a number of task forces.  Each initiative will receive &euro;190,000 over 36 months with &euro;40,000 in 2019, &euro;60,000 in 2020 and &euro;30,000 in 2022.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks the Department and the HSE have organised four workshops for task forces and CHOs on the application process for the strand 2 funding with workshops in Dublin, Cork and Carrick-on-Shannon.  The deadline for applications is 29 July.  There is plenty of time for task forces.  This was not just announced last week.  It was announced a couple of months ago that this money was coming on stream.  I have been meeting and speaking to co-ordinators and chairpersons.  As they work on the ground, they are fully aware of the needs in communities.  I am sure there will be plenty of applications outlining what they will do with the funding.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to approve all the allocations of this additional funding by the end of August and I am committed to implementing an integrated public health response to substance misuse with the twin aims of reducing harm and supporting recovery.  Working in partnership with the task forces and the HSE, I am confident that the allocation of the additional resources in 2019 will make a significant contribution to achieving this objective.</p>  <p>  As in previous years I will engage with the 2020 Estimates process in my Department to ensure that additional resources are to be implemented in key actions in the national drugs strategy.</p>  <p>  The mid-west task force was allocated &euro;1,497,989 and will shortly receive the previously mentioned additional &euro;20,000 for 2019.  I understand the frustration on the ground over the allocation and retention of staff.  I have also spoken to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about it.</p></speech>

I have met many cancer patients and their families, which has given me a profound appreciation of how difficult and varied the effect of cancer diagnosis can be.</p>  <p>  The provision of funding for transport is a common-sense provision.  A cancer diagnosis can be a very difficult time for cancer patients and their families and can often involve considerable travel for patients.  Radiotherapy can involve the patient going to hospital for a series of daily treatments over a number of days or weeks.  On average they receive 25 sessions.</p>  <p>  For cancer patients in the north west, treatment involves a very long road trip.  Some will travel 600 km in a week to get to the nearest cancer centre and back home again.  Most patients travel to University Hospital Galway but others need to travel to Dublin.  Cancer patients need transport to be provided for many reasons.  Their doctors may have advised them not to drive due to the aggressive nature of the treatment.  The patient may have no family in the immediate vicinity or family and friends may be unable to take time off work to transport them to weekly or fortnightly treatments which can last many months.  They may need specialised or extra treatment.</p>  <p>  I sent an email to the office of the Minister, Deputy Harris, highlighting the case of one such person who requires transport from Sligo to receive his chemotherapy and radiotherapy in St. Vincent's hospital in Dublin.  To date this young man has been supported with transport to and from Dublin through the goodwill of many people.  Many people on the ground have worked extremely hard in ensuring this happens, like the many individuals around the country who go above and beyond the call of duty for the needs of others.</p>  <p>  Existing support services offer as much help as they can to cancer patients and their families.  However, transport is not normally one of them.  In my experience more and more charitable organisations and volunteer associations have been approached for support to help with transport problems.  In recent weeks the young man I mentioned has been told that he needs extra chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which puts an extra burden on all services to try to get this person to Dublin on various dates between now and September.  The gentleman has no transport of his own and has a young family.</p>  <p>  While the Irish Cancer Society offers the care to drive scheme, this only operates within a 50 km radius.  It is important to acknowledge the benefits of the care to drive scheme nationwide with volunteers collecting patients from their homes and driving them to their hospital treatments and back home again from those appointments.  By removing the burden of continually having to organise transport, the scheme has transformed people's lives.  Life would be very complicated for those people without that service.  It has removed some of the barriers associated with accessing care.  We must acknowledge the generosity and goodwill of the 12,000-plus volunteers.  Those involved often have a family member who is unwell or had previously used the service themselves.  Unfortunately the care to drive scheme offers little advantage to people from Sligo who have to travel to Dublin, a round trip of 420 km.</p>  <p>  Patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment are often exhausted.  Someone who is ill and has had treatment will be feeling very vulnerable and having to hang around waiting for and being dependent on taxis or public transport is not good for the patient.</p>  <p>  It is not uncommon for cancer patients who cannot afford to travel or cannot access transport to Dublin hospitals for vital radiotherapy to be directed to charity organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society, the Friends of St. Luke's and the Marie Keating Foundation to apply for financial assistance, but these agencies are already struggling with the limited funds available.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that a cancer diagnosis is a difficult time for patients and for their families.  There are also costs associated with a cancer diagnosis, as with any serious illness.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme have worked together to improve the quality of cancer services through reorganisation and expansion.  We have moved from a fragmented system of care to one that consolidates cancer treatment in larger centres, with multidisciplinary care and decision making.</p>  <p>  Cancer care in Ireland is provided across the continuum of primary care, acute hospitals and social services.  In line with international best practice, acute hospital cancer care is centred in eight designated centres.  There is clear evidence that patients who receive treatment in hospitals with a high patient volume, from doctors who themselves see a high volume of cases, have better outcomes.</p><p> At the same time, care is delivered to patients as close to their homes as possible.  For example, medical oncology is delivered in 26 hospitals under the direction of the designated cancer centres.</p> <p> There are various transport options available for patients travelling for medical care.  These include HSE directly funded transport, voluntary schemes and community transport, as well as specific cancer-related services supported by the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP.  Travel2Care is a transportation assistance fund which has been made available by the National Cancer Control Programme to patients travelling to a designated cancer centre, approved centres or an approved children's hospital for assessment, diagnosis, surgery or active treatment.  It is administered by the Irish Cancer Society.  This nationwide transportation assistance fund is specifically aimed at supporting people who have a financial difficulty in meeting some of the costs of travelling to appointments.</p> <p> Some 13 hospitals across the country are covered by the service, including Beaumont Hospital in my constituency, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, St. James's Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Cork University Hospital, University Hospital Waterford, Galway University Hospital, University Hospital Limerick, Letterkenny General Hospital, Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin, St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin, the Whitfield Clinic in Waterford and Altnagelvin Area Hospital.  The NCCP makes a specific grant of &euro;0.35 million annually to the Irish Cancer Society to assist with the cost incurred by the Travel2Care programme and such funding will continue this year.</p> <p> Separately, the Irish Cancer Society operates a volunteer driver service, which provides transport for cancer patients to and from their hospital chemotherapy treatments.  Nationwide, 21 hospitals participate in this programme, to which patients are referred by hospital voluntary cancer support centres.</p> <p> The focus of the Department of Health and the National Cancer Control Programme is on the provision of health services, including cancer services, and this is in line with the approach across Europe.  The national cancer strategy for 2017 to 2026 sets out a roadmap for the continued development of cancer services over the ten years of the strategy.  Patient involvement was a key feature in the development of the strategy, in line with the increasing emphasis on understanding the patient perspective.  This has been continued through the establishment of the Cancer Patient Advisory Committee, which comprises 15 people who have been affected by a cancer diagnosis directly or through a family member.  The committee has already provided a valuable contribution to initiatives related to the implementation of the cancer strategy.</p> <p> The Department will continue to work with the National Cancer Control Programme and with voluntary organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society to address the needs of cancer patients in a holistic manner.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that cancer patients are receiving excellent medical care in our hospitals and more patients than ever are surviving cancer.  I was very much aware of the excellent transport schemes provided by volunteers, but I was not aware of the Travel2Care scheme, and some of the organisations I have dealt with recently are not aware of it either, under which funding can be applied for to take patients from anywhere in the country to the hospitals listed by the Minister.  Quite a number of organisations are not aware of the scheme and I was not aware of it.  It would certainly alleviate a lot of difficulty.  Two weeks ago, a group rang me to see whether I knew anybody coming from Dublin on a Wednesday night who could take a patient down, or anybody who might be travelling back to Sligo.  That should not be happening.</p>  <p>  People in the north-west have to go to Galway or sometimes Dublin for radiotherapy services.  Technology is now in place which was not there ten years ago whereby radiotherapy services can be provided in outreach centres.  Is the Government looking at that?  I am talking about Sligo and the north-west, where people have to travel to either Galway or Dublin.  I have discussed this with consultants who provide cancer treatment and the technology is there.  Is the Government looking at this possibility to save people the hardship of having to travel all those miles?</p></speech>

I appreciate his contribution and the discussion on this important issue.  The focus of the Department of Health and the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme is the provision of cancer services and specifically the implementation of the national cancer strategy.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point on the Travel2Care transportation assistance fund.  It has been made available by the National Cancer Control Programme to patients travelling to a designated centre, approved centres or an approved children's hospital for assessment, diagnosis, surgery and active treatment.  It is administered by the Irish Cancer Society, and if enough of the public do not know about this service, we absolutely have to deal with that.</p>  <p>  The focus is on centres of excellence.  I am open to correction on this, but as far as I know the nearest hospitals for those in the north-west are Altnagelvin Area Hospital and Galway University Hospital.  Those are the designated centres of excellence.  The Deputy makes a valid point about travel costs.  It is a difficult time for families, and perhaps we will have to look again at whether the annual &euro;0.35 million in assistance to the Irish Cancer Society is enough to support cancer patients.</p>  <p>  I will bring back all the issues raised today to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and get a more detailed response.</p></speech>

I commend those parents, who have been superb advocates for their children and for the disability family.  The Minister of State will know that they are under pressure on a daily basis, 365 days a year.  They did not need the additional frustration, worry and annoyance of the past year.  These parents are entitled to and due an apology.</p>  <p>  For years, those parents and we as TDs called for summer respite services.  Thankfully, that was eventually established in 2018, and last year's summer camp was professionally run, hugely successful and very valuable to both the children and the parents.  Some 20 families were supported at very reasonable costs.  Parent power has now saved that summer camp.  I again commend the parents for the campaign they have launched over the past week on the radio and by contacting their public representatives and the wider public.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to explain the exact situation in relation to this year's summer camp.  Has the decision to cut this service been fully reversed?  Have the Brothers of Charity been notified of this decision?  Will the same level of service be available this year as last year?  Will the same level of funding be available this year as last year?</p></speech>

I was contacted by families and individuals, including Lynn Simmons, Sandra Gibson and George and Barbara Kovach.  Although I understand that positive progress has now been made, I would like the Minister of State to confirm that as being definite.  I will not take the route of my colleague going on the airwaves blowing his coal about it.  As Deputy Healy said, it was people power that stopped this happening.  These families should not have been dealt with in this way.  It is extremely distressing that these parents and their children had to go through such stress and uncertainty.</p>  <p>  Representatives from the voluntary and disability sectors were before the Oireachtas Committee on Health last week.</p><p>They described the service as a house that is falling down.  They said that, while scaffolding is being provided, the house could still fall and that is entirely unacceptable.</p> <p> The independent voluntary disability service providers said that they operate in the absence of a Government strategy for their role in the future and in the absence of adequate funding for services.  That cannot happen.  The warning is that this will soon be unsustainable, and it is unsustainable.  Those impacted because of their uncertain futures are the people in residential respite and recipients of day services who deserve to live full lives as citizens in the State with the support they need.  </p> <p> As I understand it, the Who Cares? report and the report of the independent review group both concluded that the relationship between the State and the independent voluntary sector has deteriorated and there is an urgent need to place it on a new footing.  I am demanding the Minister of State does that.  The HSE is not paying the full economic costs for services delivered and it cannot deliver them.  I salute the Brothers of Charity and other voluntary services that do this.  Organisations have exhausted their own economic reserves and board members are going to refuse to take part because they are not being treated fairly and in an upfront manner by the HSE.  The Minister of State should clarify if funding has been restored and if it will continue and be ring-fenced for the next number of years.</p></speech>

One of the issues that I put on the Estimates debate last year was an extra &euro;10 million for respite services and I opened the 12th respite house in recent weeks.  There is investment going on in respite services but I will deal specifically with St. Rita's in this debate.</p>  <p>  This Government&rsquo;s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.  This commitment is outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government and I was the one who inserted it.  It is guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  Respite services are an important part of the range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families.  Short breaks can also provide an opportunity for individuals to meet new people, widen their social circle and gain new experiences.</p>  <p>  I accept the Deputies' arguments because respite care is crucial in helping to reduce family stress, to preserve the family unit and to provide stability.  The need for increased respite services is acknowledged, I acknowledge it, and the HSE continues to work with all service providers to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.  As part of its ongoing service provision, this year the HSE will provide more than 182,500 respite nights and 32,662 day respite sessions to families in need across the country.</p>  <p>  In 2018, there was a significant improvement in respite provision.  An additional &euro;10 million was provided to fund 12 new respite houses.  That is one in each HSE CHO area, plus an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite from this area.  These additional houses are providing additional respite for families that need it.  All 12 houses are now open and fully operational and I am proud of that.  </p>  <p>  Of that extra money, &euro;2 million is being targeted at alternative respite services.  These are practical and important solutions.  Alternative respite is working well locally, with good examples of summer camps, evening and Saturday clubs having taken place, benefitting hundreds of adults and children.  Further additional respite initiatives are planned for 2019 in each HSE CHO area.</p>  <p>  South East Community Healthcare, SECH, provides children&rsquo;s respite services in two locations in south Tipperary including the Brothers of Charity camp in St. Rita&rsquo;s respite services.  In addition, SECH provides outreach and home-based respite to children with challenges accessing centre-based respite for a number of reasons including those confined to home for complex medical reasons or difficulty socialising safely with other children as a result of emerging diagnosis and responsive behaviours.  The HSE is fully committed to maintaining the same level of service this year as in 2018. </p>  <p>  The additional funding provided last year will continue in 2019 and, in particular, the &euro;2 million allocation to be spent on alternative respite services remains a high priority for the HSE.  SECH acknowledges the quality service provided by St. Rita&rsquo;s and will ensure that the necessary resources required for the summer respite programme in St. Rita&rsquo;s will continue to be provided to the Brothers of Charity in 2019.</p></speech>

That will be a relief to parents.  It is a pity it had to come to this and the turmoil parents have been put through over the past week.  It should never have been allowed to happen and I certainly hope it will never happen again.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that this respite service will continue next year and into the future.  This service is essential for children with special needs and their families.</p></speech>

It was fought for last year.  The Brothers of Charity provided St. Rita's and the families were happy.  The families tell me - not the Minister of State or anyone else - that St. Rita's and the Brothers of Charity applied for funding this year and got no response.  They were told, approaching the deadline, they would not be getting the funding.  There has been a reversal here because of people power and families.  This is appalling.</p>  <p>  I supported the Minister of State during the talks on the programme for Government to try and get this funding ring-fenced.  The HSE is blackguarding families, people, centres like this, the Brothers of Charity and the boards of management of these places.  This should not have happened.  I plead with the Minister of State to ensure that whatever mandarin in the HSE decided to be so cruel, disingenuous and callous as to say this was being pulled will be reprimanded.  This is not good enough.  These people are looking after their children with special needs and do a great job, as do the centres, the Brothers of Charity groups and many others.  They need to be supported, not blackguarded, misled, frightened and scared.  There is something more sinister to this than the Minister of State is telling us.</p></speech>

When I leave this Chamber, I will be asking who put the parents through that particular situation.  I am very much aware of the importance of access to planned respite, which ensures that people with disabilities receive opportunities to socialise and facilitates families to receive a break from caring, to preserve the family unit and to provide stability.  These are important arguments in this debate.</p>  <p>  Respite services are an important part of a range of services supporting people with disabilities and their families.  They are crucial to reducing family stress.  Short breaks can also provide an opportunity for individuals to meet new people, widen their social circle and gain new experiences.

As I stated earlier, SECH acknowledges the quality service provided by St. Rita&rsquo;s and will ensure that the necessary resources required for the summer respite programme in St. Rita&rsquo;s will continue to be provided to the Brothers of Charity in 2019.  As far as I am concerned, this is only the start of the investment in respite services.  I gave a commitment three years ago that I would reform the disability services, invest in them, and put the person at the centre of those services.  We need to expand those services and that is my objective.</p></speech>

I had also seen that in the newspapers.  On 14 June, the Central Bank announced plans to increase the industry funding levy on credit unions from approximately &euro;1.5 million per annum to approximately &euro;7.8 million by the end of 2022.</p><p>This increase was approved by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has sought clarification from the Minister on whether he consulted the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the statutory body established to advise the Minister on credit unions, in advance of the announcement.  I want the Minister of State to answer that question.</p> <p> The Irish League of Credit Unions is deeply disappointed that despite his stated support of credit unions, the Minister has brought in an exclusively monetary analysis of the co-operative credit union movement.  It places little value on its social capital, volunteers, community base or democratic structure, all of which deliver a very positive social benefit to Irish society at zero cost to the Exchequer.  The Irish League of Credit Unions wrote to the Minister about the matter in April and it is regrettable that he chose not to engage with it.  Why did he not engage with it on this issue?</p> <p> The Central Bank conducted a public consultation process on increasing industry funding levels in 2012, but it did not take on board a submission made by the Irish League of Credit Unions, in which it indicated that credit unions were different and that their societal impact should be taken into account when calculating the industry funding levy.  Credit unions are not-for-profit, community-based and volunteer-led.  The misguided equating of credit unions with banks and a hike in the levy by a projected &euro;6.3 million underline the cultural misfit between the credit union movement and the Central Bank.  It is a further shift in the wrong direction.  Credit unions are a social force operating in this country on a not-for-profit basis.  The Charities Regulator is fully funded by the Government and society at large supports the regulatory cost because of the enormous social capital it oversees.  The reason is simple and rational; it is a reciprocal co-investment for the time given and commitment made by so many people who are contributing to the country's social capital and cohesion.</p> <p> The Irish League of Credit Unions made an analysis of how much credit unions, ranging from the very large to the small, would have to pay towards the levy.  The very large credit unions would pay &euro;143,000 by 2021, while the smaller credit unions would pay &euro;7,271.  This increase is unfair and the levy should not apply to social capital.  It is a levy on volunteers and a further drain on already squeezed credit unions when their loan-to-asset ratio is historically low and returns on investment have tanked.  The increasing equating of credit unions with banks by the Central Bank, with the approval of the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, is a fundamental problem of attitude and understanding.  I ask the Minister of State, in the strongest terms and on behalf of the Irish League of Credit Unions, to address this matter.  Nearly every Deputy would have received this email from credit unions and we are asking for the reversal of what is a wrong and damaging policy.</p> <p> The Irish League of Credit Unions has 3.6 million members, of which I am one.  I am disgusted that the levy is being applied to credit unions.  In Ireland RepTrak, the reputations agency study, credit unions came out top with regard to respect, trust and esteem among the public.  Are we to put a levy on credit unions and treat them like a private bank?  I ask that the application of the levy be withdrawn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500035#HH00200"><p>As the Deputy is aware, credit unions are regulated and supervised by the registrar of credit unions at the Central Bank which is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions to maintain sector stability and protect the savings of credit union members.  Section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, provides that the Central Bank of Ireland may, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, make regulations prescribing an annual industry funding levy to be paid by regulated financial service providers to the Central Bank of Ireland.  The industry funding levy is not specific to credit unions and there is no requirement under the regulations for the Minister for Finance to consult the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC.</p>  <p>  Since 2004 the amount of the industry funding levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets.  Consultation paper 95, Joint Public Consultation Paper - Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland - Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation, CP95, was published in 2015 and set out proposals to move from partial industry funding of financial regulation towards full industry funding, noting the proposal set out in an earlier consultation process conducted by the Central Bank - CP61, Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters - to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  Importantly, the Central Bank's feedback statement on the consultation process for CP61 noted the feedback received from the credit union representative bodies.</p>  <p>  In its Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy the Central Bank set out its intention to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs for industry to increase the overall recovery rate and address funding gaps in specific areas of the Central Bank's regulatory activities, with a view to achieving full industry funding in the medium term.  In terms of credit unions, the Central Bank set out an initial target of 50% to be implemented on a phased basis by 2021 to 2022.  The Minister for Finance, having taken into consideration the unique and important role credit unions played, recommended to the Central Bank that credit unions be provided with a specific exemption from the 100% target.  It is the only part of the financial services sector to have such an exemption.  Instead credit unions will be set a target of 50% by 2021 to 2022.  It is projected that it will be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis, with recovery rates to increase to 20% of the costs of regulating the credit union sector for the 2019 levy cycle, 35% for 2020 and 50% for 2021.  Credit union recovery rates from 2022 onwards will be subject to review and a public consultation process to guide strategy once 50% recovery rates have been achieved.  The Central Bank has advised that the increase in the proportion of funding to be provided by the credit union sector relates to the estimated cost of regulating the sector.  In contrast, the main Irish banks have been subject to 100% of financial regulatory costs since 2012.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, has now issued a public consultation paper on potential changes to the credit institutions resolution fund levy which is expected to reduce materially from 2020.  The consultation paper is available on the website of the Department of Finance and open to all persons.  The deadline for the receipt of submissions is Friday, 9 August.  Once the deadline for submissions has passed, the Department, in collaboration with the Central Bank, will consider the feedback received as part of the consultation process prior to finalising changes to the resolution funding regime for credit unions.  Following on from this, a statutory instrument will be published in October detailing the 2020 resolution fund levy for credit unions.</p></speech>

One of the key points is that section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, provides that the Central Bank of Ireland may, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, make regulations prescribing an annual industry funding levy to be paid.  The Minister did not have to give his approval, which is why the Irish League of Credit Unions is asking, in strong terms, for the reversal of a wrong and damaging policy.  Credit unions are not banks.  I know that the Government has tried to put them in that category, but they did not cause the crash.  It was caused by for-profit banks.  Credit unions should not be treated in this way with an industry funding levy.  It is outrageous and I hope there will be more of a backlash against the Government about it from other Deputies and parties.  I hope they will take this head on with the Government and the Minister for Finance.  It should not be happening.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has indicated that the legislation means that the Minister does not have to consult the Credit Union Advisory Committee on the matter.  The Minister of State is probably a member of a credit union like me and we know what they were set up to do.  We know that they are not-for-profit and do not pay their chief executives &euro;140,000 or &euro;150,000.  They certainly will not see any change from the Minister's support of a review of the cap on banker pay.  The credit unions will certainly not benefit from it.  That is not the nature of the movement.  Will the Minister of State take this point back to the Minister and ask him to reconsider what he has done with the industry funding levy on credit unions?  It is outrageous and should not happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500035#HH00600"><p>The industry funding levy is not solely applied to credit unions.  There is no requirement under regulations for the Minister to consult the CUAC.  The Government recognises the important role credit unions play in Irish society as volunteer co-operative financial institutions.</p><p>Credit unions help to sustain the economy, with more than &euro;2 billion of new lending every year.  That is why the Minister for Finance requested the Central Bank refrain from increasing the cost of the industry funding levy on credit unions beyond 50% until the levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate by 2022, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and a public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment on such a change to the sector.</p> <p> It is worth repeating that the credit union sector is the only financial services sector currently exempt from the Central Bank's 100% target for funding the cost of regulation.  This Government is determined to help support the strengthening growth in the credit union movement.  This is evidenced by the recent introduction of the credit unions (interest on loans) Bill 2019.  This Bill will permit credit unions to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the current ceiling of 1% per month.  It will amend the interest ceiling to 2% per month.  This amendment would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and, in so doing, may create an opportunity for credit unions to provide new product offerings.  The Bill followed the recommendation of the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, made to the Minister on the basis of a CUAC survey conducted in the credit union sector.</p> <p> Another change introduced to help grow the sector was the revised investment regulations allowing credit unions to invest in tier 3 approved housing bodies, AHBs.  The regulation came into effect in March 2018.  At a sectoral level, the concentration on this can now facilitate a sector-wide investment of more than &euro;700 million in tier 3 AHBs.  </p> <p> In addition, the Central Bank is currently reviewing the credit union lending framework, CP125, and it is expected to be concluded by the end of this year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500036#JJ00300"><p>Today, the Government published its summer economic statement which is, as the House knows, a key element of our reformed budgetary process.  Before I outline the key points from this statement, it is appropriate to take stock of where we are now in terms of the economy.</p>  <p>  Our economy is now very different from that which prevailed a decade ago when Ireland entered the most acute phase of the financial crisis.  It is more diversified.  Economic activity is more balanced.  Living standards have improved.  The public finances have finally returned to surplus.</p>  <p>  Unemployment now stands at just 4.5% compared to a peak of 16%.  Gross domestic product, or national income growth, of 3.9% is projected for this year and 3.3% for next year.</p>  <p>  However, the risks to our economy have self-evidently intensified.  There is now a greater likelihood of a no-deal Brexit outcome.  A risk of overheating in the domestic economy exists as it closes in on full employment and mounting wage changes.  There is the possibility of a deterioration in the international trade policy environment.  Finally, as I have acknowledged, there are vulnerabilities in the future in regard to corporation tax revenues.</p>  <p>  The key principles underpinning the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy are, first, a steady and sustainable approach to improving living standards in our country; second, a sustainable budgetary policy; and, finally, with reference to budget 2020, an approach that protects domestic living standards to take account of differing Brexit outcomes.</p>  <p>  The Government must formulate the appropriate budgetary policy on the basis of what is right for the economy in order to ensure continued, steady improvements in Irish employment and living standards.  As such, our budgetary policy must lean against the wind, first, to try to avoid a scenario where our economy might grow too quickly in the future and, second, at this stage to build up our buffers and economic resilience in order that we can stabilise the economy in the event of shocks.</p>  <p>  Against this unique backdrop, the task of framing the budget this October, weeks before the UK is due to leave the EU, will be more challenging than usual.  Our obligations to the European Union mean that we must submit a draft budgetary plan to the Commission by the middle of October.</p>  <p>  The approach of the summer economic statement is therefore one budget, two scenarios.  The economic statement sets out two budgetary scenarios.  The first involves an orderly Brexit, while the second involves a disorderly Brexit.  Both are indicative and unprecedented levels of uncertainty mean that there are many possible economic outcomes.</p>  <p>  Either scenario suggests a careful budgetary stance is needed in preparing for budget 2020.  This is in line with the policy advice that has been made available from the IMF, the European Commission, the OECD and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p>  <p>  In the event of an orderly Brexit and given that we are at the top of the economic cycle, the appropriate budgetary policy is to stay inside the parameters outlined by my Department in the stability programme update in April.  This involves a budgetary scenario and strategy of &euro;2.8 billion for 2020.  In an orderly Brexit scenario, this is consistent with a 0.4% headline surplus as a percentage of national income for next year.</p>  <p>  With current and capital expenditure commitments amounting to &euro;1.9 billion, including a planned increase of &euro;700 million in our capital investment, and with the additional commitments that we have - the demographics - to meeting our commitments to public servants, and an expenditure reserve of up to &euro;200 million being established to accommodate funding requirements for the national broadband plan and the national children&rsquo;s hospital, this leaves &euro;700 million to be specifically allocated as part of this budget.</p>  <p>  Over the medium term, the strategy envisaged under this scenario would see an improving headline surplus, with expenditure growing below the projected growth in the economy.  This is appropriate given the uncertainties arising in the external environment and the current position of the economic cycle.</p>  <p>  It goes without saying that a disorderly Brexit will put pressure on the public finances and presents a clear and present challenge to domestic living standards.  Under a disorderly Brexit scenario, this could involve a headline deficit in the region of 0.5% to 1.5% of national income for next year, depending on the magnitude of the economic shock.</p>  <p>  Under a disorderly Brexit scenario, in addition to the strategy outlined for the orderly scenario, a disorderly response would consist of the following measures.  First, by allowing our social welfare and tax systems to provide counter-cyclical support for our citizens, we would ensure that for those who found themselves suddenly without work or with lower incomes we would have the resources in place to provide the supports back to them through our social welfare systems in particular.  Second, there would be temporary, highly targeted and meaningful support for the sectors most affected.</p>  <p>  In September, the Government will decide which scenario will form the basis for budget 2020.  The approach being proposed is the correct one to ensure on the one hand that we do not generate further inflationary pressures within the economy and, on the other, to build up appropriate resources in order that budgetary policy can support the economy in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p>  <p>  By taking these decisions now, it will help with the choices of the future.  For example, it would allow continued support for our national development plan and allow us to maintain and improve public services in the future.</p><p>Budgetary measures must be financed by revenue streams that are sustainable into the future.  I have previously flagged the risk arising from this, and this was one of the drivers behind the decision on the VAT rate for the hospitality and services sector last year.</p> <p> I have asked my officials to develop proposals to manage windfall corporation tax receipts to ensure the sustainability of the public finances and to ensure that the fiscal rules do not contribute to budgetary imbalances.  I will publish a discussion paper on this topic in the coming week.  I will also publish and build on a commitment in the summer economic statement to examine a process the Department of Finance will put in place to establish the sustainability of corporation tax receipts into the medium term, conscious of the work that is under way in the OECD, with the objective of completing the work by March.  </p> <p> The rainy day fund is another policy response to mitigate over-reliance on revenue over-shoots, including corporation tax receipts.  In addition to the rainy day fund, the best solution to an excessive reliance on any tax head, including corporation tax, is to run budgetary surpluses.  This year a surplus of 0.2% of national income is in prospect with a further improvement next year to a surplus of 0.4% of national income.</p> <p> The economy is in good shape but we face uncertain times.  Now is the time to look at the decisions we can make to ready ourselves for what the end of 2019 and 2020 might bring for our economy, country and society for all on our island.  We have important choices to make and we will have to frame this budget, even in an uncertain time, with more of an eye to the future.  I look forward to working with the D&aacute;il to frame such a budget and see it pass on 8 October.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500037#KK00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to make some remarks on the summer economic statement, which was published earlier.  My main takeaway from the document is that we now have a better sense, although only an estimate, of the likely impact of a no-deal Brexit were it to materialise at the end of October or in subsequent months.  The figures illustrate a stark picture.  A projected surplus next year of in excess of &euro;1 billion would become a deficit of between &euro;4.5 billion and &euro;5 billion in one calendar year, which is a dramatic change of fortune.  Over the five-year period to 2024 public finances could worsen by close to &euro;30 billion in the event of a disorderly Brexit, compared with an orderly Brexit underpinned by a withdrawal agreement.  Those stark figures need to be read in conjunction with previous estimates and reports from the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the joint paper, the Central Bank's analysis and the stability programme update from this year, which showed that economic growth over a two-year period that the Minister indicated this afternoon would be largely front-loaded to year 1, would fall by approximately 3%.  That would mean little or no growth whatever next year.  It may not be that bad but some say the impact could be worse.  If it is worse, we face negative growth.</p>  <p>  This is the environment into which we are entering prior to budget 2020.  My understanding of comments made by the Minister and the Taoiseach in recent weeks was that there would be two quite radically different alternative budgets under preparation and come September, the Minister would decide which was the more appropriate given the assessment at that time of whether a no-deal or orderly Brexit was likely at the end of October.  However, that is not what we are getting today.</p>  <p>  The Minister's policy decision is that come what may, the budget day package will be &euro;2.8 billion.  We have two very different estimates of what the outcome might be depending on the Brexit scenario that transpires.  However, the budget package is &euro;2.8 billion, of which &euro;2.1 billion is set in stone.  The flexible element of budget 2020, therefore, is &euro;700 million.  If my interpretation of what the Minister is saying is correct, his assessment of where Brexit is likely to settle will influence how he is likely to use that &euro;700 million.  He is saying that the automatic stabilisers, which are essentially demand-led, will kick in, and if people lose their jobs, welfare supports will be available and, therefore, welfare spending will increase.  Equally, less economic activity than was forecast will mean that tax receipts will come in lower than expected.  Those are the automatic stabilisers.  However, there seems little headroom for what the Minister calls the temporary targeted funding for the sectors most affected.  It appears that all that must come out of the flexible envelope of &euro;700 million.  The Minister might elaborate on that later in more detail.</p>  <p>  It seems that he decided in June that the budget day package in October will be &euro;2.8 billion, irrespective of what form of Brexit, if any, we face later that month or beyond.  I am not sure that it is wise to lock in that budgetary strategy right now.  I do not see that it is necessary, as much can change in the coming months.  Much of the data on which this is based may change and the economic picture might change.  Aside from Brexit, there are many moving parts.  The Minister has touched on some, and many other risks are outlined in the summer economic statement such as the economy overheating.  We are seeing elements of that working through in the extra cost of delivering capital projects, for instance, and in the construction sector.  There is also corporation tax, and a much more uncertain and volatile international trading environment.  Sometimes we do not fully appreciate and accept just how open an economy ours is.  It would not take much by way of external factors to have a material affect on our economy's performance.  That is an important point.  I hope the Minister will come back on the amount of resources he will have in play to do anything tangible to support the sectors we all accept will need special supports in the event of a no-deal Brexit.    </p>  <p>  Apart from that, the core priority going into this budget must be to protect the essential, basic front-line services on which people rely as they are under strain.  It is fine for the Government to criticise the Private Members' motions that come before the House week in, week out but they do so because of our experience as practicing politicians.  We talk to people on an ongoing basis, as does the Government.  Services, particularly in parts of our health service such as homecare, on which the House will focus during the week, are particularly strained.  Young children are awaiting assessments of need, and have waited two and three years in my part of the country.  There is a long and difficult wait for parents who do not have the money to pay for a private assessment but then there is nothing at the end of it.  They get a diagnosis but there are no services.  Apart from Brexit, the Government will have to focus on what the priorities are for us as a country going into the next year and beyond over the coming months.  Apart from the economic backdrop, which must be accounted for, the other core priority must be protecting our citizens and ensuring that those basic services are in place when they need them.  They are under serious strain now.  It is particularly the case in health and I do not doubt that the Minister is frustrated that health spending has increased by so much yet the return is not there in any improvement in waiting lists, particularly with outpatients, which continue to worsen.</p><p>The Minister cannot do everything.  He cannot promise a &euro;2.3 billion tax cut and deliver on the full capital programme despite the overruns that are there and, at the same time, protect vital public services.  Decisions will have to be made against the benchmark, as far as we are concerned, of what are our values, what are our priorities as a country and who are we seeking to protect.  For me, this is the key issue.</p> <p> I welcome the fact the Minister is initiating a review of the sustainability of corporation tax.  I would have preferred if there was an external input into it.  I have height of respect for the Department and its officials but they are the same people who are advising the Minister day in and day out.  I would have thought a fresh perspective on Ireland's corporation tax receipts would have been the way to go.  Perhaps this is something on which the Minister can come back and engage with us on the precise methodology that should be used in conducting this review.  I know the review is not just into the sustainability in isolation, given the volatility in corporation tax but is also in the context of the international changes led by the OECD.  Those issues are also very important.</p> <p> The Minister is duty-bound to give a comprehensive response in a very public way to the Fiscal Advisory Council's latest report.  The criticism of the Government was stinging.  It was quite damning.  It is questioning the fundamentals underpinning the budgetary numbers over the coming years, for example, stating the medium-term budgeting forecast on the spending side is not credible.  This is the independent watchdog.  Those arguments and perspectives need to be assessed and we need an open and honest debate about the demographic pressures we know we are facing.  We know we have an ageing population.  Every year, we can see the extra demands that arise for elderly care and the pressures on our hospital services.  Have we really factored in the known costs that are there?  I very much doubt that we have, based on the assessment I have seen so far.</p> <p> I welcome today's publication.  It is a sobering backdrop to the period ahead as we approach the preparation of budget 2020.  Once again, it underlines the need for political stability in our country.  When we look at the chaos continuing to play out in the UK, if in this country, against all of the unknowns that undoubtedly exist, we provide the stability to ensure that as best we can we guide our country through an incredibly fraught and challenging period then we will have done some good service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500038#LL00200"><p>I apologise for being a bit delayed coming to the Chamber.  I was at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight where we were hearing from Dr. Stephen Kinsella and Mr. Colm McCarthy on a number of issues, including some discussion on the summer economic statement.  I welcome the opportunity le c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an &aacute;bhar seo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  T&aacute; na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; seo t&aacute;bhachtach.  It is important that we have these debates but it is also important that we have them on a factual basis and on the basis that the information provided is credible and robust.  Unfortunately, we do not have this today because in the summer economic statement we have statistics presented in terms of medium-term expenditure that lack credibility.  These are not my words and I will go into them in some detail in a moment.  The problem is that if we have statistics that lack credibility then we have a document that is fantasy.  The expenditure projections are not real and credible and will not be met.  We are having a discussion about some of the serious risks that face the Irish economy, whether Brexit, a trade war in the United States, changes to the international tax regime or changes being discussed at European level.  All of these challenges and threats, such as overheating in certain sections of the economy, must have sensible, detailed and proper analysis but when the statistics presented in the summer economic statement have already been called out by our own independent fiscal watchdog as lacking credibility and being implausible then we are not having a debate that is rooted in reality; we are having in part a bit of a fantasy debate on what is really there and what is not there.  This is the problem.</p><p>The Minister announced in the summer economic statement that the unallocated expenditure for next year is in the region of &euro;700 million in either additional spending or tax cutting measures.  As I pointed out to the Taoiseach earlier, the commitment he gave at the Ard-Fheis last November will not get very far, given that it would cost &euro;500 million or more to start to implement that tax pledge.  The reality is that even as the Minister presents the figure of &euro;700 million again today, he has not taken account of the fact that the Christmas bonus is not factored in.  It makes no sense, and this is why I speak about fantasy figures, in this day and age, when we know the Christmas bonus will be paid, that the &euro;300 million needed to pay it is not factored in.  Immediately the &euro;700 million becomes &euro;400 million.  The Minister has not factored in the fact that all the indications are that we will see another health overrun and overspend.  I would rephrase it and state there was an unrealistic allocation for health in the first place with regard to some of the reforms that need to be made to ensure we do not waste money in the health budget.  Therefore, this overrun in itself, coupled with the Christmas bonus, takes away the &euro;700 million almost immediately.</p><p>This is the problem with the figures that have been presented.  One of the differences that exist between these figures and those in the stability programme update published in April is that at least the Minister has accommodated for the fact that some of the runaway projects in capital expenditure, namely, the national broadband plan and the children's hospital, will need an additional &euro;200 million next year.  This has been factored in.  With regard to the core problem, I will read from the Minister's summer economic statement.  Table 3 in paragraph 4.2 shows budgetary projections for 2018 to 2024.  It sets out the key fiscal metrics consistent with the stability programme update in 2019.  These projections represent the basis of the summer economic statement, therefore, the summer economic statement is based on the fiscal metrics consistent with the stability programme update in 2019.  What did our fiscal watchdog say about these fiscal metrics?  What did it say about the figures in the stability programme update in 2019?  It states in its report:</p><blockquote>The expenditure forecasts [in the stability programme update] are not credible: they are based on technical assumptions which do not reflect either likely future policies or the future cost of meeting existing commitments.  The technical assumptions used imply an implausible slowdown in expenditure growth, overstating the likely budget balance.</blockquote><p>This is not coming from me.  It is coming from the Fiscal Advisory Council appointed by the Government, that is independent and provides us with the basis of what we need to work on, and from there we can look at the different ideological positions we have, where we believe investment needs to take place in the economy and where certain sectors need to be supported.  When we are doing this on the back of implausible and unreliable statistics that are not credible, then what is the point?  There is a real responsibility and an onus on the Minister to stand up when the debate concludes and explain to me, other Members and the Fiscal Advisory Council why he has just dismissed its warnings and comments that the projections are not credible.  Why has regurgitated them in this report?</p><p>We see very clearly the negative impacts of Brexit.  As has been mentioned, the position will be &euro;28.5 billion worse over the next five years in the context of a disorderly Brexit.  What is not clear is that the Minister makes the point in the summer economic statement that if a disorderly Brexit is the likely outcome then what he will do is employ the budgetary strategy parameters set out in option A, which is the baseline transition period and no crash out, with a number of other measures.</p><p>Those other measures are automatic in some cases, as has been said, such as social welfare protections for those who will be made unemployed.  What really scares me is that there is one line referring to "temporary, targeted funding for the sectors most affected".  We have a one-line response, therefore, concerning the effects of a disorderly Brexit scenario which would have a &euro;28.5 billion impact on the economy over a five-year period.  That is not good enough.  We need more than that.  What does that line mean?  Surely the Departments, including the Minister's own Department, know what that line means.  There is a need to spell out and flesh out what we are going to do in the case of Ireland being faced with a nearly &euro;30 billion hit over a five-year period.  That deserves more than a one-line response in this document.</p> <p> We have argued, as the Minister knows, for a Brexit stabilisation fund.  We have argued as well that that fund needs to have an initial injection of &euro;2 billion and that the moneys going into it should come from the resources being put into the rainy day fund.  Those contributions to the Brexit stabilisation fund should come from this year's and next year's contributions to the rainy day fund and also from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  As the Minister knows, we have been very critical of the design of the rainy day fund.  We echo the comments of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC on this matter.  The Minister will be aware that IFAC has called out the design of the rainy day fund.  The problem with the rainy day fund is that it is counter-cyclical at this point in the cycle, in that it takes money out of the economy, but it will not be in a downturn.</p> <p> I am reminded of the advertisement for paint which states that it does exactly what it says on the tin.  The problem with the rainy day fund is that it does exactly the opposite of what it says on the tin.  It cannot be employed when it is raining.  It can only be employed for structural reforms, for bailing out banks or for natural disasters.  It is very clear under the current rules, however, that it is not there to support, for example, additional social welfare payments.  That might be one of the measures we might need.  The rainy day fund is also not intended to support the agrifood industry, which would also be seriously affected, and it does not allow for support for small towns or small and medium-sized businesses, SMEs, impacted upon by Brexit.</p> <p> The Minister has also ignored the IFAC and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, pointing out an over-reliance on corporation tax receipts.  That over-reliance is increasing and becoming more concentrated and volatile.  The figures presented as the basis for the Minister's budget, therefore, use resources which are volatile.  We need a real vision regarding how we deal with some of the areas of our economy in need of additional investment, such as childcare.  Such an investment would support labour participation rates.  Those rates are slipping at a time and we need to maintain them at a time when unemployment is low.  We also need investment in third-level education so that we have our foundations right.  We also need supports for families struggling to meet the crisis in the cost of living.</p> <p> None of that is spelt out in this document.  I am very disappointed that the Minister has used figures that are unreliable and which have been critiqued by the IFAC and the ESRI.  I am also disappointed that he has not responded adequately to the major challenge posed by a disorderly Brexit.  Hopefully, we will never see the impact of that challenge come to pass and visiting these shores.</p></speech>

This summer economic statement meets neither of those requirements, unfortunately.  In fact, rather like last year's summer economic statement, this statement is seeking to present the best possible aspect of the situation we are in.  The situation, however, is outside the competence and control of the Minister at the moment because of Brexit and it poses serious challenges to Ireland.</p>  <p>  We do not know whether Ireland is going to get lucky and there will be some form of soft Brexit.  It is no more possible to know that than to forecast the leading contender in the race for British Prime Minister and what his love life is like.  We cannot make out what is going to happen to Britain and what decisions that country will take on Brexit.  This is a budget package that looks forward to a sum of &euro;2.8 billion with &euro;700 million for new measures.  We have no commitment from the Minister for Finance as to how much of that he foresees as being available for tax cuts.  I do not even know if the Minister actually wants tax cuts.  I know the Taoiseach wants tax cuts because he keeps referring to them here as his go-to economic lift in the budget.</p>  <p>  There is also no detail in this statement on how much additional funding will be spent if there is a no-deal disorderly Brexit.  We have no information, or speculation, regarding likely commitments from the European Union for additional funding to support Ireland in the event of a hard Brexit.  It is clear that income tax cuts in this scenario should be ruled out and the &euro;700 million in additional measures should be committed to public services.  That would be prudent and appropriate.  There are great pressures in the areas of health, homecare, supports for carers, education and childcare.  Above all, we have an ongoing crisis with housing and the affordability of rent.</p>  <p>  I have the 2019 minimum essential standard of living, MESL, report from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  It is a key document concerning what families require in rural and urban Ireland.  The reports records that a one bedroom flat anywhere in Dublin, even in the cheapest area, costs more than &euro;1,000 a month.  It will cost about &euro;1,125.  That is the crisis we are living with and this summer economic statement is not even prepared to consider that crisis.  The statement is surprisingly light on detail.  I described last year's statement as being a novel.  The subsequent ending of that novel was not great.  As we know, by the time the budget arrived, the Minister had to resort to finding money down the back of the sofa to bail out the health service yet again.  That was because the Government is unable to manage the finances of the health service.</p>  <p>  The Minister is being more honest this year because he is already telling us that the plan will change substantially in September.  We know that will happen based on what occurred last year.  The announcement today suggests that no matter what type of Brexit we face, we are going to proceed with the budget plan.  We do not know, however, if there will be a Supplementary Estimate or a special budget for exceptional measures if the UK crashes out of the European Union.  I think this is a simple question.  Nobody here wants the UK to crash out.  It is, however, a real possibility that it will and this is a reasonable question to ask the Minister.  What happens if that occurs and what will be the parameters of the figures?</p>  <p>  The Minister is saying we should wait until after September.  Perhaps he should wait until he has stood up on budget day.  I cannot see why he should not deal honestly with the D&aacute;il.  He should not rule out a special Brexit budget.  If there is a decision to spend more money, additional Supplementary Estimates will be needed.  What is Fine Gael trying to pretend?  We know &euro;500 million was allocated to the rainy day fund this year and another &euro;500 million will be put in for next year.  What happens to the rainy day fund in a hard Brexit scenario?  A hard Brexit would be a rainy day for Ireland.  The way the legislation has been created means that it is not clear in what context the rainy day fund will be available.  Would we need the European Union to declare it a rainy day?  I am not sure what would happen.  Will the rainy day fund be used in a disorderly Brexit?  That is a reasonable question and the Minister for Finance should show responsibility and answer it.</p>  <p>  I will turn now to the extra cash needed for the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan.</p><p>Here is a little clever accounting that accountants do all the time.  The Minister has made Orwellian use of something called an "expenditure reserve" to allow for spending that he knows will happen.  He is setting aside &euro;200 million a year from now on for a special reserve to meet the holes in the financing of the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan.  The Government will sneak this extra &euro;200 million a year in to avoid the constant embarrassment arising from the overruns in both.  This will ultimately be capital investment, but that has not been made clear today.  We have gone back to the habits of Brian Cowen, the former Minister for Health and Children.  He could not distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure for quite a while because of financial embarrassment.  The health service of the time did not seem to be able to do it either.  We are going back to that. </p> <p> There is no commitment to a Christmas bonus in the summer economic statement.  Some people might say this is quite a technical item.  The Christmas bonus is traditionally provided for out of current resources because budgets traditionally fall either at the end of the year or early in the new year.  The IFAC took issue with this.  It stated that this is an in-year spending increase and, therefore, it should be properly provided for with regard to the relevant time spans.  Last year it was provided for in a Supplementary Estimate.  Supplementary Estimates amounted to &euro;1.3 billion overall.  However, there is no provision for the Christmas bonus in the summer economic statement.  It is silent on that issue. </p> <p> There are two possibilities.  I think the Minister is going to pay the Christmas bonus, which I hope and recommend that he does.  Alternatively, he will abolish it like Fianna F&aacute;il did ten years ago.  We had to reinstate it.  Which will it be?  That is a profoundly reasonable question to which the D&aacute;il deserves an answer.  I assume the answer is that the Minister will find that money out of what will be available in November, when a surge of self-employment tax payments will be received.  Why not just share that with us now and be honest about it?  It is an incompetently devious attempt to pull the wool over some people's eyes pretty much all the time.  The Minister is trying to give the average taxpayer a little pat on the head and say everything is all right, and in any event he has the rainy day fund in his back pocket so if anything goes wrong it will all turn out all right on the night.  </p> <p> It is the intellectual equivalent of the famous soft landing that Fianna F&aacute;il promised as the boom turned to dust.  We heard about the soft landing everywhere.  In fairness, everybody wished for a soft landing.  Several people said differently, predicting there would not be a soft landing and it would be a total disaster for the country if the banks failed in Ireland.  Will the Minister level with the D&aacute;il?  He writes book reviews a lot.  Some of the book reviews he writes in various papers suggest he has an intense and detailed interest in economics, both practical and theoretical.  I make a point of reading them and I commend him on them.</p></speech>

The issue of the likely cost overruns in health has been pointed out.  The Minister has questions to answer.  The Christmas bonus was raised by Mr. Colm McCarthy at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We must also consider the possibility of a hard Brexit and the costs that could impose, the volatility of the corporation tax receipts and possible downturns.  Those are all uncertainties.</p>  <p>  Whether we have a hard Brexit or any of these difficulties materialise, there are many areas where we need dramatic increases in investment and spending.  Affordable housing and council housing are most obvious area.  We are not doing enough.  The Construction Industry Federation told the committee that the private sector will not meet the output targets the Government hopes it will hit, and the situation in public and affordable housing is just dire.  The leakage of wastewater into Dublin Bay is another example of a creaking water infrastructure that needs dramatic increases in investment.  If climate change targets are to be met and congestion dealt with, a dramatic increase in investment in public transport is needed to reduce fares, improve the quality of public transport and start new projects.  We have a serious problem with childcare.  We need to invest to provide affordable childcare on a greatly expanded basis.</p>  <p>  In the area of education, we need many more apprentices.  That means investment in that area.  The financial obstacles facing people going into apprenticeships and higher education must be removed.  Particularly given our skills and labour shortages, any possible additional labour force participation needs to be activated.  That means investment in areas such as education, apprenticeships, childcare and so on.  Then there is the need for climate action and a range of areas where we need significantly increased investment and spending.  Moreover, wage demands from health workers and others who have suffered pay restraint and pay cuts for the best part of a decade are legitimate and justified.  We need to find money for everything.  </p>  <p>  Unlike other people, we are not hypocritical.  We do not call for fiscal rectitude on one hand and lots of extra expenditure on the other, nor do we believe that extra investment and expenditure should be financed through additional borrowing.  That is a dangerous game.  We should not worsen the poor debt position.  As the Minister will be aware, our question to him is why he does not look at other potential sources of revenue.  The elephant in the room is now being discussed even in the United States, and by some very unlikely people.  Some of the richest people in the US are talking about wealth taxes.  Why do we not look at those taxing that revenue as a source of wealth?  Employers' pay-related social insurance, PRSI, is at one of the lowest rates anywhere in Europe.  We could tax financial transactions.  Dr. Stephen Kinsella was before our committee earlier.  He said that the financial flows in and out of this country are astonishing.  They are way out of proportion to an economy this size.  The State should have a financial transactions tax, which could generate lots of revenue.  The myriad tax loopholes that benefit property speculators and big multinationals should be examined.  Why does the Government not look at redirecting some of those resources into key areas where investment is needed  such as infrastructure, services and strategic industry?  We need a more sustainable and diversified economy.  The best buffer against uncertainties is not to have an economy that is so vulnerable to a small number of corporations and a couple of sectors.  Why not look at those options?  We need investment and money for services, but the Government never ever considers taxing wealth and profits, which have increased exponentially. </p></speech>

While its exact timing is difficult to predict, the indications are not good.  The institutions of world capitalism, including the IMF, the European Union and the World Bank, all predict lower growth rates for the first time in close to a decade.  Most of it is fuelled by fears of a global trade conflict between the USA and China, in particular, as part of a trend towards deglobalisation that is definitely present.  There is also the recently highlighted danger of the bursting of the property bubble here and around the world which has been fuelled by cheap money and the financialisation of property.  There is the question of Germany which was the engine of growth in the European Union but which is now close to a technical recession.  There is also, of course, the rising prospect of a no-deal, chaotic Brexit which would have a particular impact on Ireland.  We face these things in circumstances in which capitalism has exhausted some of its monetary reserves in the already very low interest rates and cheap money available.  Martin Wolf says if it is hit by a new economic crisis, an equivalent reduction in interest rates means bringing them down for short-term loans to -2.5%.  Capitalism has also exhausted a lot of its political reserves.</p> <p> In the circumstances, it is correct to have a discussion about preparation.  In some senses, the Minister recognises the dangerous situation and talks about preparing for it.  He even notes the over-reliance on corporate tax receipts, which is a welcome observation on the reality.  However, his prescription fails to recognise the severity of the problem facing us because it is trapped within the neoliberal mindset and the particular development model for Irish neoliberal capitalism from which the Minister is unwilling to break because of the party and class interests he represents.  Fundamentally, what he is talking about in terms of preparation for a no-deal Brexit, the budget and so on is minimal change and ordinary people tightening their belts further.  That is also the answer from Fianna F&aacute;il, given the indications from Deputy Michael McGrath that in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit, people should not receive an extra &euro;5 in social welfare and that somehow that will avoid the disaster.  It is the model of development for capitalism in Ireland that is the problem.  It involves reliance on foreign direct investment, a massively outsized financial sector which the Government is intent on blowing up even further in the context of Brexit based on Ireland's position as a corporate tax haven and a model of agriculture which is completely unsustainable economically and environmentally.</p> <p> What is needed is a radical socialist plan to transform the economy.  The key words which appear once but which are otherwise missing from the summer economic statement in which they should appear more often are "climate change".  They appear once in a vague reference to global problems.  Climate change is not something with which one deals one week as part of a climate action plan, whereas the next week it does not feature in a plan for the economy and the budget.  That it is not present shows that the Government is not serious.  If there was a left government today, what would have been announced was a green new deal with socialist policies.  That is what Ireland needs to respond to the economic and environmental unsustainability of the current economic model.  We must end Ireland's status as a tax haven, have massive public investment in renewable energy measures to make Ireland a leader in that field, escape from the current agriculture model by nationalising big agribusiness, provide supports and grants for small farmers to reduce the size of the herd substantially and create environmentally sustainable forms of agriculture, engage in afforestation, invest in free public transport for all, while expanding transport massively, and bring the key sectors of the economy into public ownership.  That would allow us to plan the economy in the interests of meeting the people's needs and those of the planet, as opposed to relying on multinationals which can pull out at a moment's notice.  These are the same multinationals which in many instances are responsible for the carbon emissions which are destroying our planet.  That is the kind of plan we need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="19:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500041#OO00200"><p>The most striking aspect of the summer economic statement is the profound shadow cast on the country by the 31 October deadline for Brexit.  The statement sets out two radically different budget scenarios, namely, scenario A on page 25 and scenario B on page 26, which is unprecedented.  The priority in scenario A - an orderly Brexit outcome - remains the avoidance of overheating.  The report refers to avoiding adding fuel to the flames.  However, one wonders how we can continue to ramp up housing output if this is the primary requirement in that scenario.  The level of growth in this scenario is expected to be 3.3%.  The report shows the Department targeting a surplus of 0.4% of GDP by 2020.  It is notable that a &euro;200 million expenditure reserve is proposed in 2020 to accommodate the funding requirements of the national broadband plan and the national children's hospital.  Perhaps the Minister might confirm whether approximately &euro;65 million of that sum is intended for the national broadband plan, notwithstanding the significant question mark over it.  Scenario A targets a headline surplus of 0.4% of GDP in 2020, taking into account carry-over costs from 2019, public sector pay increases and provision for capital expenditure and demographic changes.  Will the targeted package of &euro;2.8 billion in 2020 be remotely sufficient in the event that there is an orderly Brexit?  In recent weeks Deputies, including on the Government benches, have met workers and trade union members and officials across a wide range of sectors, including education, health and childcare.  In fact, a lot of the meetings took place only last week, while more are scheduled to take place this week.  Clearly, significant additional State resources are badly needed across these sectors of the economy and society.  However, the overarching aim of the authors of scenario A is simply to avoid overheating the economy.</p>  <p>  The estimates of the severe impact on the economy included on page 26 in scenario B - a disorderly Brexit - may well be far too sanguine, notwithstanding the &euro;6 billion figure quoted for the fall in Exchequer revenues.  A crash-out from the European Union by the United Kingdom on 31 October would have a profound impact on the whole economy.  The strategy of the summer economic statement report in scenario B is to implement the scenario A budget, with so-called "temporary targeted funding" for the worst affected sectors, while allowing the automatic stabilisers to kick in.  Is this remotely sufficient?  It is a basic approach, plus a scenario B approach.  Is it not crucial to have a whole-of-society approach to provide whatever additional supports are necessary for workers, families and all lower income households?  The question that has been posed is whether we will need another far-reaching budget if this comes to pass.  I notice that 8 October will be budget day.  Given the history of the European Union in respect of last minute decisions, will the Minister be in a position even then to respond adequately to the circumstances that may well confront us if the leading contender for the Tory leadership becomes Prime Minister?</p>  <p>  There is little in the summer economic statement on broadening the tax base, which is disappointing.  It is not even contemplated to provide a further buffer against Brexit.  As other colleagues mentioned, Professor Stephen Kinsella of the University of Limerick was at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight today where he referred to Ireland as a dual-economy.  There is the economy of the multinationals which employ 300,000 workers and produce massive but unstable corporation taxes and the real economy which is nearing full employment, with some growth in household income and consumption.  One of the helpful aspects of the summer economic statement is box 3 on page 16 which looks at the extensive links between the economy and that of the USA.  The &euro;60 billion worth of imports and exports going in one direction or the other only highlights our vulnerability, in particular, during the administration of President Trump which has, unfortunately, 18 months left to run.</p><p> Chapter 3 of the report, Then and Now, compares Ireland as it was before the Great Recession with the Ireland of 2019.  It has been included to give us some reassurance.  Chapter 3.3 refers to initiatives such as the summer economic statement and the spending reviews and the work of the Tax Strategy Group, the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member.  It has to be said the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform seem very lethargic in meeting the need to provide even more transparent information and responding to the various critiques of their performance during the years.  Many Deputies have mentioned that, for the second year running, the IFAC has reported that increases in current spending are totally unsustainable without additional revenues.  This key point has also been made by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy.  The Government's medium-term strategy is not credible.  As the Minister knows, there is a motion on the cl&aacute;r of the D&aacute;il in my name about last year's IFAC report.  This year's report is very similar.  It is hard to know why the Minister cannot respond in a very full manner to the challenges that have been put to him by the IFAC.  While I accept Deputy Noonan's point that there is no use having a dog if it does not bark, a response is necessary.</p> <p> Chapter 5 of the report, Public Expenditure Strategy, mentions a number of expenditure reforms, including the 2017 and 2018 spending reviews.  We hope these reforms are happening in the overall budgeting process.  A spending review is promised for this year.  Clearly, the existing supervisory mechanisms for expenditure failed very badly in the case of the national children's hospital project.  The Minister, the Minister for Health and their predecessors were seriously negligent in agreeing to the two-stage tendering process and failing to alert the Oireachtas last summer when the cost of the project careered out of control.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and his staff have to be commended on their opposition to the inflated costs associated with the technological problems being encountered with the national broadband plan.</p> <p> Chapter 5 focuses on expenditure overruns in the Department of Health.  It refers to "the creation of a new oversight group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and reform, to monitor spending" and mentions that "monthly spending reports [will] be submitted to the Cabinet Committees".  We are aware of the work that has already been done by the new director general of the HSE in recent months.  He obviously sees a need to control spending.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight examines each year's Votes and Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Health.  The total failure of successive Governments to fund the HSE in a remotely adequate manner since 2011 has been identified as a key issue by contributors such as Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy of Social Justice Ireland.  There is a lack of co-ordination between the HSE's annual operational plans and the headings in the Vote of the Department of Health.  In the past eight and a half years Fine Gael, aided and abetted by Fianna F&aacute;il since 2016, has failed fundamentally to reform and fund this sector adequately.  We heave heard shocking statistics for hospital waiting lists, early intervention assessments and the provision of many key health therapies for citizens.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael is not prepared to create the necessary revenues to develop a national health system that is fit for purpose.  The reliance on expenditure ceilings in the health, social protection and education budgets from 2019 to 2021 also seems to be problematic.  The budgets seem to be based on changes driven by demographic factors only.  They do not seem to address the need for significant improvements in the actual services being offered.</p> <p> The Minister has told us today that he intends to come forward with proposals to ensure the sustainability of corporation tax receipts.  Is he thinking about the kind of prudence fund that has been recommended by the IFAC?  We have the rainy day fund.  I presume we have other buffers.  The Minister reminds us in the foreword to the summer economic statement that despite all of these structures, the national debt remains high, with a ratio this year of more than 100% of GNI*.  As the foreword makes clear, "on a per capita basis, this amounts to &euro;42,500 for every person in the State".  The Minister, his predecessor and the late Brian Lenihan foisted most of this debt on the people.  I am one of many Deputies who are greatly concerned to ensure that in the coming months, at a critical juncture for the country, ordinary citizens will not have to bear the brunt of any remediation or measures aimed at protecting the country's economy.</p></speech>

If the Minister has been listening, he will be aware that his reputation for fiscal prudence has taken a hammering in the past 18 months.  We have all read the recent reports in national newspapers suggesting he has not been his cheery self recently.  It seems that he is beginning to feel the pressure of out-of-control spending.  He can shrug if he likes, but that is what <i>realpolitik</i>is like.  He is not in control of his job.  He should pony up and accept that he is unable to do it.  Perhaps he should ask all of us to give him a dig-out.</p><p>The first fiasco was the out-of-control spending associated with the national children's hospital, while the second was the &euro;3 billion cost of the national broadband plan.  One could not buy such incompetence.  If one went into a national school and picked out some junior infants, they would do a better job than the one the Minister is doing in charge of these important infrastructural projects.  It is open season for people to plunder.  To be honest, it is robbery without violence.  The Minister allowed people to enter into these contracts.  His whole approach seemed to involve not listening to officials in his Department.  To be honest, it beggars belief.  As I have said previously, he would not run a sweet shop.  It would be a very bad one.  He might survive for a week in a second-hand clothes shop because he would get all the stock in for nothing and the staff would be volunteers.</p><p>We read this morning that the national broadband plan will require &euro;774 million in capital expenditure between 2019 and 2022.  This is an additional &euro;455 million over and above the existing provision in the national development plan.  A further &euro;1.58 billion will be required between 2023 and 2027, bringing the total cost to &euro;2.3 billion.  One would think we were talking about snuff at a wake, but this is real money.  According to the latest data from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, a further &euro;645 million will be required between 2028 and 2043, which will bring the overall total to &euro;2.977 billion.  All of this is compounded by the dire warnings issued by the IFAC which has informed us that the Government's management of the economy is creating risks and dangers that need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The IFAC has made it clear that spending in the Department of Health alone is threatening the sustainability of the entire economy.</p><p>Earlier today Deputy Healy and I raised in the Topical Issues debate the cut in funding for vital respite care summer camp facilities at St. Rita's in Clonmel which is run by the Brothers of Charity.  The Brothers of Charity, the operating staff and management at St. Rita's and, above all, the families and service users have been affected by this downright blackguarding.  The successful respite care service that they finally brought over the line in 2018 helped 20 families by giving them a modicum of respite.  The question of this year's funding came down to the wire in the Chamber earlier this evening.  The families who endured this uncertainty and trauma had to stream into my office and those of other politicians before the HSE and the Government finally and grovellingly admitted that it would continue to provide respite care this year.  It beggars belief that the Government would treat people with disabilities in such a manner.  It dishes out money on contracts and spends it recklessly in other areas, but in this case we are talking about a mere &euro;25,000.  It is not an insignificant amount of money, but if there was to be an audit of this expenditure, it would be unbelievable.</p><p>On a more technical note, I was interested to read the excellent briefing document supplied by the great team in the Parliamentary Budget Office on tracing Brexit-related Exchequer expenditure in budget 2019.</p><p>I salute the team in that office.  This note considers the Exchequer impact of Brexit contingency measures, including expenditure on Brexit readiness programmes, customs charges and additional staffing requirements that were unlikely to have occurred in the absence of Brexit.  We know that.  We have heard the announcements of staff being put in place.  I find it alarming to read that in general, it is difficult to determine the overall Exchequer impact of Brexit-related measures with apparent discrepancies across different Government publications on the likely cost of relevant programmes and indeed their allocation in the Revised Estimates Volume.  That is a striking statement and one that must be given more attention than it has received to date.  </p> <p> The briefing note goes on to state that it is unclear if expenditure arising from Brexit contingency measures is being met by reallocating money from existing programmes or increases in voted expenditure as a direct response to Brexit.  It is very hard to decipher what it is.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on that point because in many respects, that is a very serious charge to make.  I hope the Minister does respond to it.  While the authors of the note do not say it outright, there is a definite sense that transparency is not very clear.  In fact, the figures may have been presented in such a way as to make us think that extra funds are being allocated when they have just been taken from existing programmes.  </p> <p> These are important questions that need to be answered before we can provide any kind of meaningful analysis or assessment of the summer economic statement.  The Minister, or at least the Minister for Health, found out last September about the runaway train that is the national children's hospital.  Of course, we know it is the wrong site.  We knew that all the time.  It has never been the right site for the sick children who need it.  They cannot even access by helicopter, not to mention by road.  We then see the lovely wording and terminology used by the Minister.  He uses the term "re-profiling".  Nothing will be axed or cut.  It will all be re-profiled.  The Minister must think we all came down in the last shower.  There were thunderstorms in parts of the country today but, thankfully, they did not happen everywhere and we did not all come down in that shower.  We are the representatives of taxpayers and we want to hold the Minister to account.  Flowery language will not allow that to happen.</p></speech>

I do not know if money is the answer because so many things have gone wrong.  Respite care was mentioned.  Telling elderly people that they must wait until the middle of November for home help is ridiculous and nonsensical.  Carers are waiting a long time to get a payment.  Some people for whom they are caring have actually died before the carers got paid for caring for them.</p>  <p>  On agriculture, farmers are wondering what is going on with this &euro;100 million or is it &euro;50 million?  Must they reduce stock to qualify for this funding or is it intended for farmers who are genuinely suffering and have lost money?  I must remind the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, that in 2013, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told farmers to increase production.  The current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and Commissioner Phil Hogan are telling farmers that they must reduce production.  I have to remind the Government that in the meantime, farmers have spent millions - money they had and money they did not have but borrowed.  They are now being told that they must reduce production when they might have no way of paying back that money and that they should plant some of their land.  For the Government to dictate to farmers in this way rather than working with them is very unfair.  It is ridiculous to think that after a short space of years, the Government is now telling farmers that they must reduce production and not grow any more.  </p>  <p>  The threat of carbon tax is another issue.  I would tell the Minister and Minister of State and even Fianna F&aacute;il that all they are doing at the moment is trying to be greener than the Green Party.  They will have to be practical and bring forward practical solutions.  The Government is imposing deadlines on working-class and poor people and suggesting they must get out of their cars when they cannot manage without them in rural Ireland.  There is no place to plug in and charge an electric car.  It is like putting the cart before the horse because that is what the Government is doing.  It is hurting the people and the people are scared.  There will be a general election.  The Government must realise this and it will get its answer on the doorstep when it goes to the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="20:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500043#QQ00300"><p>We are on a remarkable economic knife edge.  I cannot remember a precedent where the path between overheating the economy or, unfortunately, what looks more likely, a very sharp downturn on the back of what the UK Government does or does not do has presented such a remarkable black and white scenario.  If we are expecting the latter, we must prepare for it.  If we must adjust in September, so be it.  Regarding the two responses set out by the Minister, I heard a similar approach enunciated by John McCarthy, chief economist, at the ESRI Budget Perspectives conference involving the use of the automatic stabilisers or temporary targeted support.  This is the critical thing for us to focus on.  Regarding those automatic stabilisers, it is written in the economic statement today that they are increased social welfare payments because of more unemployed people and they stimulate the economy because we will be taking less tax in because of what I presume are lower wages from a downturn.  It does not sound as if they are particularly effective stabilisers.  They are like two stabilisers on a small bicycle when we are on a much bigger bicycle.  I think we need to do far more than that.</p>  <p>  I have not heard the details but my concern which I have heard in certain sectors where I have engaged in this debate is that the temporary targeted support might just be another cheque to the meat or dairy industry in a way that does not bring about some of the fundamental long-term changes we need.  We should be preparing for a green new deal - a stimulus plan.  We need to do it anyway but in the event of a crash-out no-deal Brexit, we could use that economic tool - Roosevelt used it and it worked - to do more than those economic automatic stabilisers would deliver.  It is difficult because the timelines are so tight.  What could we do in a very short timeframe that might help stimulate the economy?  I will set out some very simple examples but we should use the coming months to think them through.  I would love to see a massive payment going to Irish farmers to start protecting hedgerows.  That would not require a significant capital investment.  The resources and knowledge are already available.  However, it would have a significant benefit in terms of our climate and biodiversity story and would be direct payment to farmers with regard to the kilometres of hedgerows that would be restored.  It would have long-term benefits for the country.  </p>  <p>  I think we should target rural Ireland because it is likely to be most affected in a downturn and it is easier for us to get building workers working in rural Ireland than in Dublin.  Even in a Brexit downturn, we are likely to have shortages of building workers in Dublin for the immediate future.  We should be looking at that rural regeneration and development fund and expand it into retrofitting buildings, particularly those in the centre of towns and villages.</p><p>It would start to deliver on the national planning framework which states we have to bring life back into the core.  However, it has to be in the context of a green new deal.  Earlier the Taoiseach defended the existing national development plan by claiming no one else was willing to state where cuts would be made.  We would make cuts.  There are 51 national road and motorway projects in planning and under construction.  There is not one single public transport project in either phase.  We cannot keep doing this.</p> <p> At the Velo-City 2019 international cycling conference in Dublin international delegates were in a state of shock when they saw how poor cycling infrastructure was here.  They could not believe what Dublin was like.  Can we not tell the local authorities that we will have a major expansion of pedestrian and cycling facilities?  The Minister would be able to ramp it up in a way he might not be able to do with large public transport projects.  We must start by making cities, towns and villages safe places in which to walk.  That would not require significant planning permissions or the use of large machinery.  All it would require is the input of direct labour and the local authorities starting to do it as part of a green new deal.  It would be practical, quick and help to stimulate the economy in a way higher unemployment benefit payments would not.</p> <p> I have just come from the communications committee where we heard from Eir.  There are real questions about the national broadband plan project.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach said today, Eir claimed it could complete the same project, on time and with only a slightly different level of service provided, for &euro;2 billion less.  That sum of &euro;2 billion is as much as we have in the rainy day fund.  It would be useful if we were heading into a downturn.  Our basic approach should be not to cut capital expenditure but to use the money well.  There is an increasing number of questions coming from the communications committee and the national broadband plan needs to change.</p></speech>

We were presented with black and white options for several scenarios.  The one with the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union is pretty dire, not just for next year&rsquo;s but for subsequent years&rsquo; budgets.  The loss of 50,000 jobs in such a scenario is conceivable.  Social welfare payments and tax revenues would not just be impacted on, as it would affect the domestic economy, as well as creating a negative economic mood.  There would be a cohort of people for whom it would be quite difficult to create alternative employment.  Obviously, the agrifood and small and medium-sized enterprise sectors would be the most exposed.  It is about using our imagination in advance to determine the best way to mitigate the worst excesses of such an event.</p>  <p>  From today&rsquo;s statement, up to &euro;200 million will not be available.  In the context of Brexit, it may seem to be a small amount of money.  However, it is a sizeable amount because the Government has failed to do its job by keeping costs under control.  In allowing such eye-watering cost overruns, with the flawed tendering process for the national children&rsquo;s hospital and the national broadband plan &ndash; I agree that the latter needs to be revisited &ndash; the Government has essentially stripped &euro;200 million from next year&rsquo;s and subsequent years' budgets.  It will also affect opportunities and underlines how the national development plan needs to be revisited.  At this point, it is a work of fiction when such significant readjustments need to be made.</p>  <p>  We must also take account of the declaration of a climate emergency.  That must involve the reconfiguration of some of the projects included in the national development plan.</p>  <p>  The debt-to-GDP ratio, when GNI* is used, means that we are in serious territory, particularly if we add &euro;5 billion a year in borrowings for several years.  There are several other dynamics, including going back to the national development plan and removing other projects because we would not have the ability to borrow.</p>  <p>  I must question the figures included in the summer economic statement.  At the Committee of Public Accounts several weeks ago we heard about a liability not included in the HSE&rsquo;s accounts for 2019 but one which had been pushed forward.  That liability should be shown now.  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the Christmas social welfare bonus not being included.  One wonders exactly how much space there is for vital public services.  We must get serious about the cost of delivering housing.  It is not happening for the common good when the cost of building land adds to the cost of housing.  These issues are critically important when examining the national development plan.  They are also important when future-proofing in a scenario where there will be less money available but when we will still have to provide better infrastructure, whether it be public transport, housing or facilities to provide better healthcare services, as well as dealing with threadbare services.  It is not just a question of looking at the black and white on paper.  There must be a dynamic piece of work to use our collective imaginations to protect ourselves to the greatest degree we can.</p></speech>

I agree with his point that in the event that there is a disorderly Brexit, we would have to mobilise resources to help the country to respond to the consequences and protect key front-line services.  The choices the Government could make about the sum of &euro;700 million and the deficit would be driven by the principles of what we could do to protect living standards in a vulnerable time in the economy and society, as well as engaging with stakeholders on the responses needed to deal with this great shock.  Up until this point, the engagement we have had with the European Union has been on the flexibility we may need in providing state aid.

No one can assume that there will be no increase in health expenditure, for example.  Is the Minister saying that, in terms of the budget, &euro;700 million is the limit of the scope available to provide what he calls temporary targeted funding for the sectors most affected?  Is that all there is?  He says that the budget day package will be &euro;2.8 billion in either scenario.  It seems the only flexibility he has is what he will do with that &euro;700 million.  He will not even have all of that &euro;700 million.</p></speech>

This is an issue with which we will deal when we move into the budgetary process itself.  We have to get the mixture right.  We have to ensure that the resources are in place to support public services.  I then need to engage with key stakeholders regarding what further may be needed to support the economy at a time of great change.  At this point in time it is very difficult to say what that might be.  It is very early to be forming a view on what the impact of Brexit could be and, therefore, on the plans that will be needed.</p></speech>

One of the stand-out points made in the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, report was that somewhere between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion of the &euro;10.4 billion received last year could be considered excess or outside of the normal economic cycle.  In other words, it may not be sustainable.  If we had the perfect storm scenario in which the corporation tax receipts proved not to be sustainable at the same time that a no-deal Brexit occurred, we really would be in extremely serious difficulties.  Will the Minister address IFAC's point?  Does he accept its point that up to &euro;6 billion of corporation tax may not be received again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500045#SS00400"><p>The Deputy made a proposal in this area, although I saw the merit in doing it.  He suggested a process be put in place to form a view on sustainability.  The IFAC outlined a very broad range of scenarios.  It suggested that &euro;3 billion to &euro;6 billion of the approximately &euro;10 billion we collect may be at risk.  That is very broad guidance from which it then advises me to work.  I will be very brief; I know Deputy Pearse Doherty is next.  I want the Department of Finance to lead the work.  It is not appropriate to outsource key projects that could affect important economic decisions.  I will then look at how that work and those recommendations can be externally validated to ensure we receive a different perspective on the analysis.  The Deputy is right.  When a group of people is working on any key issue over a prolonged period, week after week and month after month, it is appropriate to sense-check the conclusions reached.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500045#SS00600"><p>It is precisely because of the analysis of our current expenditure projections offered by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council that we have increased them for the summer economic statement.  The average rate of projected economic growth in the SPU was 2.5%.  In the forecast for the medium-term projection, which underpins the two different scenarios, I have increased the rate of expenditure growth to 3.25%, an increase of one third.  I have done so in recognition of the views being offered on this issue and based on my own experience of managing current expenditure and the different pressures associated with it.  I have a different view from the Deputy and from some of the analysis offered in that I still believe that if we begin to predetermine projected current expenditure growth into the future it will, in itself, create a base off which Government decisions will then be made.  That would be the wrong course to take.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500045#SS00700"><p>The projection for 2020 was &euro;2.6 billion.  Will the Minister confirm what the projection for expenditure for 2020 is now?  With regard to the figures he has presented, the Minister has talked about medium-term projections, which suggests they are further out, but they are nowhere near the expenditure levels we have seen in the past two years.  This expenditure is nearly double what is being projected at this point in time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500045#SS00800"><p>The change to which I referred is in respect of the year 2021 onwards; it does not take account of 2020 because the rate of expenditure growth for that year will depend on the decisions made on budget day.  I am not in a position to indicate what those decisions will be right now because we have made no budgetary decisions.  Predicting a gross rate of expenditure growth of 3.25% when the economy is growing at a rate of approximately 3%, which is our medium-term growth forecast, is credible and a significant change from where we were.  I have heard the Deputy's views on the matter; I have heard what the IFAC has had to state and I have a fair bit of experience of managing this issue.  That is why I decided a recalibration was merited.</p></speech>

Is the Minister going to continue to ignore the criticism received year after year from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and others?  That bonus is to be paid in December.  As Colm McCarthy says, there are things that are unpredictable but Christmas comes every year.  Is the Minister suggesting the bonus is not going to be paid?  Why is it not included in the data he has produced today?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500045#SS01000"><p>A custom and practice has built up with regard to the payment of the Christmas bonus.  Another Deputy appeared to allege that because the Christmas bonus is not referenced in the summer economic statement, it is not going to be paid.  The Christmas bonus payment has been included in most budgets, including all recent budgets.  At this stage I do not have any plans to change that provision.  The payment is in our base and I will make a decision on how to handle it on budget day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500045#SS01100"><p>The reality is that the &euro;700 million decreases to &euro;400 million if the Minister commits to pay the Christmas bonus again in 2020.  The other issue that is very clear is that an overrun is projected in health.  All the indicators, which mirror those we have seen in previous years, show that there will be another significant overrun in health.  Has the Minister factored that in?  Building on the questions asked previously, in the context of a no-deal scenario the &euro;4 billion - or &euro;5 billion under the current projections - will, of course, have to be borrowed to make up the deficit.  The idea that the only money that would be available to support industries that will need huge support in the event of that kind of shock to the Irish economy is the &euro;700 million, which is &euro;400 million after the Christmas bonus and perhaps nothing after the health overrun, is not plausible.</p></speech>

The payment of the Christmas bonus is in our base.  Traditionally when we determine the allocation of new resources, which are outlined in the summer economic statement, we are referring to expenditure on top of the base.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-06-25a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="20:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062500045#SS01500"><p>To clarify, if the Christmas bonus is in the base, that means that it is accounted for.  It is not in the base.  The Minister needs to correct the record.  That is one of the criticisms made by the IFAC, the ESRI, and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  Does the Minister want to correct the record?</p></speech>
