It is fitting to ask the question as this is our final opportunity for questions before the introduction of the scheme and providers and parents would welcome an update on it.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000003#A00350"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The national childcare scheme is fundamental to delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that we are making good progress on the development of the scheme.  Many of the major elements are now in place in preparation for the scheme&rsquo;s opening in October 2019.</p>  <p>  Following the enactment of the Childcare Support Bill 2017 last year, detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines are being finalised for my approval and signature.</p>  <p>  I have formally appointed Pobal as scheme administrator under section 3 of the Act.  This has enabled Pobal to open a parent phone line.  The phone line is now available to assist parents or guardians with any queries on the new national childcare scheme.  Providers have been invited to sign up for the scheme and I am delighted that, to date, almost 2,300 have done so.</p>  <p>  A national communications campaign is under way.  As part of this, my Department launched a dedicated website, which has received more than 175,000 hits, and we have distributed more than 60,000 parent information booklets nationwide.  It also delivered a nationwide training programme to more than 3,500 early years professionals.</p>  <p>  In September and October, my Department will undertake further training for providers and will run a large multimedia information campaign to ensure that parents are aware of their entitlements.</p>  <p>  The development of the scheme is highly complex and has thrown up challenges.  That was expected with a scheme of this size, which will benefit many families throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  We are designing a highly innovative supporting IT system for the scheme so that we have the option of a user-friendly, paperless, automated assessment process for parents.  While the main IT system to deal with online applications is largely built, work is continuing on the supporting structures to deal with postal applications.  With this in mind, the experts overseeing development of the scheme have recommended a phased launch approach but in accordance with the expert advice, we are working towards delivery on time in October.  The paper-based system will be available in January for those who do not wish to apply online.</p></speech>

Some 2,300 of providers, or approximately 50%, have signed up to the scheme so far.  What is the cut-off date for signing up?  The Minister said the main ICT system is largely built.  Is the Department on budget for the roll-out of the ICT system?  Since we last spoke on this issue, have more providers signed up?  Has the scope of the IT system been expanded on a trial basis to include more childcare providers throughout the country?</p>  <p>  The broadband network in Leitrim is not great.  What will the Minister do for childcare providers or parents in areas that do not have a good broadband network?  The Minister said the paper-based system will be available in January.  What will be the position in October for those parents?  How will the Minister transition them and give them reassurances that everybody will be catered for?</p></speech>

I will share the cut-off date with the Deputy.  I apologise; I just do not know that directly.</p><p>On the ICT issues, the project management team and all the other people who are engaged in this, especially Pobal and the contracted provider who has been developing this with us and providing oversight, have worked exceedingly hard.  The online system will be delivered on time for applications.</p><p>Regarding the Deputy's questions on an appropriate broadband speed, I understand it does not have to be very fast.  We are designing it in a way that will allow people to apply on the phone.</p></speech>

Is the Minister happy with the transfer of people's personal private data?  I refer to the Data Protection Commissioner ensuring that the website is sufficiently secure for the uploading of the sensitive material that will be required.  Will it be protected?  A cohort of parents are conscious of the need for their data to be protected.</p>  <p>  I was in Moylough last week where I met a number of community providers who have concerns regarding the support for small community childcare providers such as themselves.  I was talking to a gentleman from Wexford yesterday about the Bunclody Traveller movement and, separately, Coolcots, Wexford town.  As part of the affordable childcare scheme, is the Minister hearing about the fears of some community childcare providers that the funding will not meet their demands?</p></speech>

This has been complicated work and part of that is to ensure that we are doing it appropriately in respect of privacy provisions and at the same time ensuring the willingness and engagement of both systems to talk to each other in order that we can provide this kind of benefit.  I assure the Deputy that all of those regulations have been adhered to in respect of the small community providers.  I understand there are concerns because something new is being introduced.  At the same time, we have fantastic supports through the community, county and city childcare committees and I hope they will be their first port of call in looking for that kind of support.  If there are other questions, we are always available to answer.</p></speech>

Currently, the SCP receives annual funding of &euro;24.7 million.  My Department works with the Educational Welfare Services, EWS, to ensure that necessary resources are available to support this programme and to ensure staffing levels are sufficient to deliver a high quality service for those young people most at risk of early school leaving.</p>  <p>  However, a number of long-term complex issues continue to exist in regard to both the governance and the staffing of the programme.  In recognition of the need for a strong policy platform for EWS, including the SCP, I requested that my officials establish a task group to support the further development and integration of these services.  The work of this group is near completion and I am eager to ensure that the output will result in a clear blueprint for the development of the three strands of the EWS, which include the SCP.  A consultation event on the blueprint was held on 10 June - I was present for some of it myself - where those working with vulnerable young people as part of the EWS were able to express their views and help shape the policy blueprint prior to its publication.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the actions contained in the blueprint, I have requested that a new SCP scheme be scoped out and developed to ensure that its reach, resources and impact are maximised in supporting young people.  I am also continuing to examine options in respect of the employment status of SCP co-ordinators and project workers.  In budget 2019, I secured an additional &euro;500,000 in funding for the EWS and the alternative education assessment and registration service.  I will continue to lead on advancing supports both in policy and provision in this crucial area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000004#B00600"><p>I cannot speak highly enough of the work being done under the school completion programme.  Unfortunately, under previous Governments resources for this important programme were cut.  Its move to Tusla seems to have led to many complaints from staff and teachers about how long it takes for the scheme and the activities to be approved.  With everything else Tusla has on its plate, it is probably not the best body to be overseeing this.  We also have a bit of a problem that it is mostly DEIS schools that can avail of the programme but now many students are travelling to Gaelscoileanna and non-religious schools.  These students who would have been able to avail of the supports are no longer able to do so because they are no longer attending school in a DEIS area.  Has the Minister given any consideration to placing this programme back under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000004#B00700"><p>I agree with the Deputy about the incredible work of the SCP, the co-ordinators, project workers and all the other people they bring in to help them work in the context of usually difficult circumstances for children and families.  I have visited a number of them in my own constituency and outside it.  I cannot speak highly enough of them.  I also understand the challenges and frustrations regarding the programme itself, knowing that we need reform and I am looking forward to that.  Tusla has a dedicated unit with a national manager and others working on that who are strictly focused to this work as distinct from child protection and everything else.  The decision was made a long time ago to transfer the programme from the Department of Education and Skills to Tusla.  They have a history of doing that.  One of the things the blueprint does is offer some guidance particularly in integrating the SCP with the other two streams, which has not been done previously.  That is why it needs to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000004#B00800"><p>The half year Exchequer returns boasted of another year of record tax yields.  I hope there will be more investment and supports, particularly for our young people in this programme.  The Minister said there is an allocation of more than &euro;24 million but ideally I would like it to be much more than that and I hope the Minister will champion this.  We heard from co-ordinators who feel that the reduction in funding has resulted in more targeted intervention.  They feel more targeted intervention is causing a stigma among young people and a broader approach might be helpful.  We have also had issues with contracts of employment and pay for staff who work in the scheme.  I understand this has been raised by their trade union.  Can the Minister outline whether any progress has been made on that issue?  The Minister said a new task force has been set up and there will be a new SCP scheme.  When will the task force's recommendations be published?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000004#B00900"><p>On targeted work versus universal supports, and what is going on currently in the SCP, several co-ordinators were part of the consultation event and my Department is in ongoing engagement with them and one of them is represented on the task force.  I hope there is enough of a vehicle or pathway for their engagement as we develop the blueprint for the SCP, listening to the concerns and the best way forward.  The programme's works in schools in tandem with the home school community liaison programme and the work of educational welfare officers.  The programme has never had a well thought-out policy base, not to mention a legislative one, upon which it can do its work.  How that relates to other work that is going on in that context and that is why that is so important.  We expect to have the blueprint published relatively soon and we will then move forward with the scoping of the programme itself.</p></speech>

I intend to develop regulations for childminders that are proportionate and appropriate to the home setting in which childminders work.  The current regulations both for early learning and care settings and for school age childcare settings are not tailored for childminders, and the extension of regulation to childminders will require a full review of these regulations.</p>  <p>  My officials are at the final stages of developing a childminding action plan, which I hope to publish shortly in draft form, for the purpose of public consultation.  The action plan will cover a period of approximately ten years, and aims to improve access to childminding as one means of delivering affordable, quality early learning and care and school age childcare.  My intention is to work towards an expanded workforce with many more registered childminders available.  This will support the growing demand for childcare.  The action plan will enable parents who use childminders to benefit from subsidies under the national childcare scheme.  The action plan will also aim to bring childminders into the mainstream of regulation, funding and support, and to recognise childminders for the valuable work they do for children and for parents.</p>  <p>  In respect of registration standards, the action plan will support the quality assurance of childminders and the safeguarding of children by extending the scope of regulation and inspection to all paid, non-relative childminders.  In doing so, my priority will be to ensure that regulation and inspection are proportionate and appropriate for childminders.  Public consultation will form an essential part of this process, and I look forward to working closely with stakeholders and with childminders, in particular, in the review and reform of the regulations.</p></speech>

According to the previous census 10% of children from birth to 12 years are cared for by paid childminders, and approximately 90,000 young children are cared for by childminders in Ireland.  One of the most shocking figures I ever received via a parliamentary response was on the question of how many childminders are registered, which I asked three years ago.  The figure I got back was there are 120 registered Tusla childminders in the entire country.  Some counties had no registered childminders at all, which is quite hard to believe given that the census tells us quite differently with the 10% figure.  In 2012, the post of childminding advisory officer, as part of the city and county childcare committees, was disbanded or no longer used.  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House when it is planned to put that childminding advisory officer back onto all of the city and county childcare committees as a link between the childminders and the city and county childcare committees so that we can start doing the support.</p></speech>

I understand that we have the national person in place.  The immediate task of the regional development officers will be to work with all of the city and county childcare committees to maximise the number of childminders who can register within the current regulatory framework and to take part in the national childcare scheme, NCS, in the short term.  As the Deputy has indicated, a huge number of childminders are used by parents for the purposes of ensuring that their children are well looked after with regard to their requirements.  I am, however, committed to finding ways to bring in more of them but they need to come in to register.  We have to find ways to regulate in an appropriate way that perhaps is different than the centre-based regulations.</p></speech>

It is about regulating in an appropriate way.  I believe this is where the consultation around childminding comes in.  Perhaps the Minister will give the date she plans for this.  She speaks of the action plan and the ten-year aims.  We need to hear whether childminders are part of that consultation.  When do we plan to roll it out so there is a more informed basis for childminders to encourage them to come in?  From talking to childminders, as the Minister has also, Garda vetting is also an issue because childminders provide a different service.  Another issue is that parents may be able to access the subsidies, which would be very welcome, but not everybody works 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and there has to be the flexibility around the different shifts worked by different parents.  Many parents would be delighted to think that their childminder could access funding for those subsidies of which parents can avail, and this could stop the parents having to use centre-based organisations.  This is where the childminders and the parents would very much welcome that consultation date.</p></speech>

As I said, we will publish the draft action plan relatively soon.  I do not have an exact date.  It is then that the public consultation process will take place.  It will be a full public consultation over the coming months, which will be relatively soon.  The responses to that will assist my Department in finalising the action plan to ensure the consultation is comprehensive and reaches as wide a range of stakeholders as possible, including childminders and parents.  A range of methods will be used, including an open call for submissions, an online survey, focus groups, including focus groups of childminders, and an open policy debate.  As a result of that we will put in place a set of regulations that will form the basis for childminders to sign up and register with Tusla.  It is my intention and hope that this will support them to do that.  We will also have a number of other short-term supports in place for childminders while that public consultation process is ongoing.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;250,000 was provided each year between 2013 and 2018 for new and innovative play and recreation spaces and facilities, with a maximum grant allocation of &euro;20,000 per local authority.  Each local authority was required to match funding of the amount requested from my Department.</p>  <p>  In 2017, 21 local authorities received funding under the scheme.  Tipperary local authority applied for &euro;20,000 and was awarded &euro;8,000 for the refurbishment and replacement of the safety surface at Templemore Park playground.  In 2018, 26 local authorities received funding.  Tipperary applied for &euro;12,500 and was awarded &euro;7,500.  This funding was for the refurbishment of Fair Green playground, Carrick-on-Suir, and the refurbishment of Duneske playground, Cahir, County Tipperary.  In 2019, I increased the amount of capital funding available under this scheme from &euro;250,000 to &euro;450,000.  In consultation with the local authority play and recreation network, we agreed to allocate a maximum of &euro;30,000 per local authority for the upgrade and refurbishment of existing play and recreation facilities.  This includes the provision of new equipment, the development of natural play local authority play and recreation network areas, and the refurbishment of existing play facilities.  The local authority is required to provide 25% of the funding requested from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for the application to be considered.</p>  <p>  In 2019, Tipperary local authority applied for &euro;28,350 and was awarded &euro;21,262 for the refurbishment and rehabilitation of the multi-use games area in Three Drives, Carronreddy, Tipperary town.  A total of 23 local authorities also received funding.</p>  <p>  There is continual engagement between my Department and the local authority play and recreation network to ensure that the play and recreation scheme is highlighted at a local and national level.</p></speech>

It is also important for families to have a dedicated public play and recreation area that can be utilised when needed.</p>  <p>  From the most recent information on this, in response to a parliamentary question, I note that from 2016 to 2018, only three playgrounds were developed or refurbished in County Tipperary.  While the communities who had these playgrounds all benefited, I am sure the Minister will accept that it is a fairly insignificant number of refurbished playgrounds.</p>  <p>  I salute all of the communities that put playgrounds in place.  The Minister referred to one at Duneske in Cahir.  I salute Ms Nellie Williams and the community development association in Cahir for having the brainchild there.  The same goes for Carronreddy in Tipperary town.  These areas have a lot of deprivation and a demographic profile conducted by the Tipperary Education and Training Board shows that south Tipperary continues to show an above-average proportion of young people, which is great.  The ETB also found that the youth population in south Tipperary is likely to grow to approximately 19,000 by 2026.  It is in this context that a greater expansion of public play amenities will be necessary.  The community groups cannot do it all.  It is fine to put in the infrastructure and the community groups were the enabling bodies that drew down the funding and put the facilities there, but we need to have the spaces maintained and upgraded.  We cannot have them closed.  I salute the community development association and others who at this time are trying to reopen their playground in Cahir.</p></speech>

This is the purpose of the funding.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to only three playgrounds with regard to Tipperary.  In 2019, our investment went from &euro;250,000 in 2018 to &euro;450,000, which is a significant increase.  It is important to note again that the current criterion is that we offer &euro;30,000 per local authority.  It is within this that decisions are made.  It is also critical that rather than asking for 50% matching funding, it is now 25% matching funding from the local authorities.  All of that is moving in the right direction in supporting local authorities, including in County Tipperary, for more investment in this kind of work.</p></speech>

In 2018 the Minister's Department began holding annual meetings with LAPRN members and established a subgroup.  All of this is fine.  Through this process the Minister and the Department have been able to identify particular issues with respect to insurance costs for local authorities.  There is a huge issue in this regard right across the community spectrum.  We have invested a great amount over the years, in good times and bad, through the enabling bodies of the communities.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  It was they who put us on the road.  They are the people with the vision and the passion.  We need funding to keep such facilities maintained and to upgrade them.  There is no point in investing for years only for a facility to be closed due to a lack of funds.  People do not have the energy, the funds, or the capacity to repair these facilities.  We must invest more in our community facilities.  It is fine to allocate grants to get them up and running and to have a ribbon-cutting and a big hoo-ha and hurrah, but we must ensure there is sufficient funding to keep them active.  We should carry out a small amount of maintenance every year to prevent big issues developing.  We must support the communities that support themselves.</p></speech>

Some funding goes towards upgrading them.  As the Deputy indicates, there has been ongoing and really good engagement between the local authority play and recreation network, my Department, and other local authorities.  We need to take account of his suggestion that some of the investment go towards ongoing servicing, as well as upgrading in the future.  I hear that.  It needs to be part of the consultation and conversation, which will ultimately impact the way in which decisions are made and in which the criteria for funding for 2020 are developed.  I thank the Deputy for his points.</p></speech>

Will the Minister show how the scheme will impact on subsidies for childcare and the hours of childcare available to lone parents?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000006#D00500"><p>The OECD's 2017 Faces of Joblessness report compared the childcare supports for lone parents previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the national childcare scheme.  It found significant improvement for lone parents.  It found that, for certain lower-paid lone parents working full time, the scheme will bring net childcare costs down from being the highest across the OECD to the 11th highest.  Analysis of the impact of the new scheme conducted using the ESRI's simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model indicated that, on average, the boost to disposable income provided by the scheme will be larger for one-parent families than for couples, reflecting the typically lower income profile of one-parent families.  Employed lone parents are the family type that will experience the greatest gains, with an effective average disposable income increase of &euro;48 per week.  These findings reflect the very considerable work undertaken to poverty-proof the national childcare scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates.  </p>  <p>  Many parents will see an increase to the level of subsidy they currently receive and many new families will benefit for the first time.  The scheme removes many of the current restrictive eligibility requirements to receive supports, such as those linked to social protection payments or the medical card.  In this way, the scheme aims to combat poverty traps and to support parents and ensure they are not disincentivised from taking up a job.  Arrangements are in place to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new scheme.  Families can continue to access their current targeted supports and can remain on their current payment until the end of August 2020.  In addition, I have asked my officials to undertake further analysis to identify if any refinements are required to the scheme in order to ensure that we fully achieve our aim to deliver quality, accessible, affordable childcare for families in Ireland. </p></speech>

There are parents, predominantly women, who feel they are at risk of being forced to forgo work or education because of the potential impacts of the national childcare scheme on existing support schemes for single parents.  According to Single Parents Acting For Rights of Kids, SPARK, lone-parent families could face losses of up to &euro;350 per month through the loss of these schemes.  The schemes are invaluable in helping lone parents to work or upskill and in helping them to fall into welfare dependency.</p>  <p>  With the greatest respect, the Department allowing people to stay on their existing schemes until August 2020 if they are not better off is equivalent to admitting that some people may be much worse off as a result of the introduction of the national childcare scheme.  That measure is actually elevating fears rather than easing them.  I fear that, while the scheme will potentially benefit 95% of parents, it will have a negative impact and possibly awful repercussions on the other 5% and will push them deeper into poverty.  Will the Minister outline how the level of subsidies under the scheme will not have a negative impact on such families?</p></speech>

Let us get that word out there.  That is really important.  Outside evidence being given to my Department supports the analysis it has done of the impact of the national childcare scheme.  That is the first really important point I want people to hear.  That does not take away from the other points the Deputy makes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made a point about the saver, as we call it, which we have developed.  If people are concerned that they might lose out or that their provision will be less, we are offering them the opportunity to stay on their current scheme until August 2020.  This measure is designed to increase certainty and reduce fear.  It is not necessarily an admission that there will be major problems with the scheme.  It will give us time to see whether any anomalies arise during the implementation of the scheme.  When lone parents apply and see how the scheme will benefit them, this measure will give them time to take a look at it.  This is meant to support parents and increase certainty, rather than as an admission that there will be a major problem for lone-parent families, although I am not saying there will not be hard cases in respect of some families.</p></speech>

There must be much clearer two-way communication with single-parent families and with advocacy groups.  It must be clear to a mother who is hoping to return to her studies in October that she will still be able to do so under the national childcare scheme.  People need to be able to plan their lives and the lives of their families with certainty.  I ask the Minister to consider holding a briefing with the persons affected, women's organisations, and Oireachtas Members because we all need clarity on this issue.  Families need to know because they need to plan for their future.  I have heard that parents are being told subsidies will be based on their own personal circumstances, but it is not clear to them how much they are set to lose once the scheme is up and running.  That is where the clarity is really needed.  Will the Minister commit to meeting with stakeholders and to giving them concrete answers to their questions?</p></speech>

It is a very good suggestion.  I have had discussion with my officials in recent weeks on the need to prepare for that and on the potential need for more ongoing communication with a wider group of lone parents because of the concerns raised by some of the advocacy groups.  With regard to the Deputy's first input, we have heard the concerns of SPARK, other advocacy groups and those providing childcare to lone-parent families.  Arising from those concerns, we have been looking at the areas of greatest concern, including some lone parents and community employment workers.  That kind of analysis is ongoing with a view to ensuring that our policy intention for lone parents to have at least as much support as other parents, if not more, is realised.  The Deputy's suggestion regarding communicating with the stakeholder group is really good.  We will do that.</p></speech>

This allowed for increases in core funding for each centre, as well as the establishment of 11 new FRCs last year which are now fully operational.</p>  <p>  Many FRCs have financial and staff resources significantly in excess of the core resources provided by Tusla.

However, the crux of the matter is when one compares the position in 2008 with the position in 2018.  Only 40 family resource centres have the core staff they had in 2008.  Along with the 11 new ones, that is 51 centres out of 121.  The problems have not gone away.  They still exist.  The staff under the voluntary board of management are working flat out.  Yesterday we heard a presentation from Mr. Jim Gibson about the invaluable work the family resource centres do in assisting local authorities when it comes to supporting families who find themselves in emergency or homeless accommodation.  That is not just centred in one geographical location but occurs throughout the country.  In the forthcoming budget will the Minister make a presentation seeking to restore the other more than 50 family resource centres to the full staffing level of 2008?</p></speech>

The way in which I decided to utilise the &euro;1.5 million increase this year demonstrates that there are various ways in which we can provide the support FRCs require.  One of them is, and this gets to the heart of what the Deputy is asking, a 5% increase across the board to the FRCs that already existed, as distinct from all of them, given that we invested in establishing the new ones in the previous year.  I am requesting in a letter to Tusla that it will ensure the money will be released to the FRCs by the end of July.  The second way is increasing the number of staff for the coming year as identified.  I hope the FRCs will be notified by the end of August about which of them can employ the extra family staff worker for their particular region of the 17 regions.  There are both more staff and more money.</p></speech>

That works out at &euro;13,606 per family resource centre.  Is that money to be allocated to the budget for taking on additional staff or is it part of the centres' core funding to provide services?  If members of the family resource centres are listening to the proceedings today, I am sure they are wondering how the &euro;1.5 million will be used.  Is it ring-fenced for taking on an additional staff member on a part-time basis?  That would work out at &euro;262 per week, which would mean a centre could recruit somebody for half of the week.  That might be very welcome in a family resource centre.</p></speech>

Their current core funding from Tusla will increase by 5%.  My understanding is that they can use it in whatever way they decide to use it.  Second, from a staff perspective we are also investing in one family support worker in each region to add to the complement of staff working in the family resource area.  That does not necessarily mean it brings the centres back to the 2008 position or to the numbers that each family resource centre wants.  I understand that, which is why I answered "yes" to the Deputy's earlier question about whether I am committed to seeking increased investment.  However, I decided that for the coming year this would help to meet some of the concerns about core funding where costs related to insurance and so forth have increased, as well as trying to provide more staff in an equitable way.  That is the way we have done it for the coming year.</p></speech>

Is thought being given to promoting the use of Irish in all cr&egrave;ches and in the early school programme throughout the State?  I refer to not only the Irish language facilities but all of them.

I want to make it absolutely explicit that I am not talking about Irish-medium childcare settings.  That goes without saying, though they should be provided as a basic human right to those who require them.  The websites should also be provided, but I do not see too many two year olds reading websites.  I am referring to the whole remit of childcare, because all these children are going to go to primary school and will have to start learning Irish there, but they have a much greater ability to learn Irish at two or three years old than at five years of age.  Every year that we do not expose them to a second language, we lose a unique opportunity.  Children have no problem learning languages, unlike adults.  Is an effort going to be made to encourage the use of the Irish language in all childcare facilities across the country through songs, poetry and little rhymes?  We should teach these children little sayings that anyone with an elementary knowledge of the language could teach.  Are we going to have a programme in English-language cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities to encourage the use of bilingualism?  A child who learns two languages early will learn a third, fourth and fifth language much easier later in life.</p></speech>

As he can appreciate, I felt it was important to identify the ways in which we are responding and supporting Irish-medium childcare settings, as well as Irish-speaking parents who want to see Irish being utilised in the development of the national childcare scheme.  That is important and more needs to be done in light of the various action plans that have come out, including the most recent report from the Joint Committee on Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Those are my first points.</p>  <p>  I accept what the Deputy is arguing for and I agree with him on the helpfulness and importance of opportunities for children in all childcare settings, not only Irish-medium ones, especially in early years.  A number of recommendations in the recent committee report to which I referred also highlight that.  My Department will work with an interdepartmental working group in order to decide how to support those recommendations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000008#F00300"><p>This goes beyond what people were thinking up until now, which was all about Irish language medium childcare and preschool education.  That is absolutely vital and is a basic fundamental right for those who rear their children through Irish.  Some parents also choose to send their children to an Irish-medium facility.  However, I am talking about the wider sector.  If we were to tell parents that we could give their children the present of contact of with a second language, which they will grasp naturally, for free, 85% or 90% of them would be delighted.  Young children have no difficulty with this.  They become very dextrous in languages when they are exposed to two languages.  Why are we not thinking about the big picture, or thinking outside the box?  We could give the greatest free present ever to our children, simply by encouraging the use of little sayings and rhymes.  They are all there and the back-up is there.  Having a programme which encourages cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities to expose children to the Irish language as a second language will also help them learn other languages in the future.  The vast majority of children, barring those with severe disabilities, will learn two languages as easily as one.</p></speech>

I get what he is saying and agree with his arguments.  The report from the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands is more focused on Irish-speaking educational and early educational settings.  However, one of its recommendations is that the Department of Education and Skills should create specific posts in order to develop further Irish-medium provision in the early years sector, both inside and outside Gaeltacht areas.  That will effectively cover every early years setting, which is what the Deputy is arguing for.  Is that not exactly what he is suggesting?</p></speech>

Cases of suspected child abuse referred to Tusla can be categorised into four different types: neglect, emotional abuse, physical abuse and sexual abuse.  Between 2016 and the end of April 2019, there have been almost 180,000 referrals to Tusla&rsquo;s Child Welfare and Protection service, with over 55,000 referrals in 2018 alone.  Approximately 60% of referrals in a year will be for child welfare reasons, with 40% relating to concerns about possible child sexual abuse.  The child protection team on duty will assess each referral to see if it meets the threshold for intervention and all urgent cases are assigned immediately to a social worker.  After screening, a duty social worker carries out a preliminary inquiry, gathering information about the referral, in order to determine whether the report meets the threshold of harm for child protection.  If the preliminary inquiry finds that a child protection response is not required, the case may be diverted for a welfare response at that point.  The preliminary inquiry also determines the priority status of each case.  Cases that cannot be immediately allocated to a social worker are overseen by duty social work teams and in some cases specific actions are carried out by the social work team, including information gathering and visits to the child in question.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the investigation of a crime is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Where appropriate, social workers notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, following the procedures set out in the Children First Act 2015.  Tusla social work teams work in a risk-heavy environment and it is not always possible to remove every risk to a child.  However, in situations where a child is at immediate risk, Tusla will act to remove the child to a place of safety.  Where children remain in their homes, the focus is on building networks of safety around a child and ensuring that the source of any risk or threat is managed through planning and working with families.</p></speech>

Given the large number of referrals and the possibility of someone falling through the net, as it were, is the Minister satisfied that all cases have been fully and thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of her Department?  Can cases which were referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be followed up on in order to find out whether subsequent actions were taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  To what extent have the families in question had any follow-up to reassure all involved that the system is capable of meeting these challenges?</p></speech>

I am satisfied that the appropriate actions are being taken, particularly in high priority cases where children are at immediate risk and there is potential abuse or harm going on, as distinct from cases involving child welfare concerns.  There is a child protection concern in the former.  I have described the system that is in place and that system is being followed.  It is a heavy-risk environment.</p><p>Sometimes, some decisions are not correct and things are not done that ought to have been done, but I feel fairly certain that when there is an immediate risk and priority is given, that the analysis is done appropriately for those children who are at the highest risk within that priority.</p></speech>

Some 40% of the referrals relate to child sexual abuse concerns.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will deal with any criminal aspects of that sexual offence against a child under the relevant criminal justice legislation.  One of the important elements in ensuring all this works in the way that the Deputy is requesting is joint working between Tusla and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It forms an integral part of child protection and welfare.  We have a number of meetings, as set out in Children First, that form an important link in an investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a potential crime.  I established an interdepartmental group in 2018, which is currently working to develop a service for child victims of sexual abuse that will bring together social work policing and health services in one site.  This provides a solid and good example of the way to work in the future to support the ongoing work between those two agencies.  I am satisfied regarding those concerns at a systems and individual level </p></speech>

The report provides a sober, full account of what happened, and a clear analysis of the failures that occurred in managing the case.  </p>  <p>  In particular, the report finds that there was enough evidence at the time of the disclosure, in 2007, to warrant the removal of the remaining foster children from the placement.  It found that the safety plan was flawed, and that there was a management failure to recognise the seriousness and complexity of the case.  These were very grave errors, which have led to lives being changed forever.  </p>  <p>  In the intervening years since then there have been significant changes in practices and standards.  The standards and practices now used are much improved from those used in the past.  Since its establishment in 2014, Tusla has worked hard to improve child protection and foster care services, by way of standards, staffing, resources and practices.  There is plenty of evidence to show that positive changes are happening.</p>  <p>  In respect of the NRP report, I have been advised that the fostering team in Galway increased from three social workers at the time of the Galway case, to 15 whole-time equivalent social workers.  Local governance has been strengthened with a principal social worker and three team leaders assigned to the fostering service.  Tusla has reformed the foster care committee guidance, beginning with its review in 2016 and the implementation over 2017 and 2018.  There is a stand-alone protocol for the management of concerns and allegations of abuse or neglect against foster carers since 2017 which provides an effective system of management and oversight of an investigation and its follow-up.</p>  <p>  At the more systemic level, I fully implemented the legislation for mandatory reporting and safeguarding statements in December 2017.  Tusla also launched its ambitious child protection and welfare strategy in 2017.  Since last year, the first national approach to child protection cases, Signs of Safety, is being implemented for duty-intake across all 17 areas.</p></speech>

The report notes that the Department is piloting an integrated model for investigation, assessment and management of child sexual abuse allegations to prevent repetitive interviewing of children across the different agencies and to provide ease of access to medical and therapeutic services.  It also mentions the need for a clear understanding and mutual respect for each agency.  Have the terms of reference for this integrated service been developed?</p></speech>

I made a brief reference to this in my earlier reply to Deputy Durkan in that we have worked for some time to develop that model, which we are naming as One House, and which we hope will open in September.  We had hoped to do this a little earlier but it has taken longer to bring together such an innovative model arising from recommendations from such an incident.  It came out of the reports from Dr. Shannon to myself and the Department.  We travelled to the United States and different parts of the UK to see how they were bringing the different professionals together in one setting in order that children and their families can come to be seen and to tell their story in a context where all of the professionals are available to provide support.  It means they do not have to engaged in ongoing re-telling that can be re-traumatising and ways of moving forward and providing supports for them can be determined in a more efficient manner by all of the professionals being in one place.</p></speech>

This was made worse if the visits and inspections by Tusla were infrequent.  They did not feel that they were in an environment in which they could share the information.  The Minister has answered that question.</p><p>The Minister will agree that the staff problems in the agency are a worrying matter.  This support is often based on the trust between the child and the social worker.  This is why the retention of staff is so important. </p><p>The Minister stated that Tusla was rolling out the Signs of Safety child protection framework.

I am trying to outline that there are a number of recommendations, many of which had been responded to, and major changes have happened.</p>  <p>  That is not to deny given the challenges identified by the Deputy regarding the retention of social workers, etc., the difficulties will not continue to ensue in a high-risk environment that I have identified previously.  It is helpful to ask about the Signs of Safety programme as a great deal of research was carried out to see what was the best way to take a preventative and early intervention approach under the programme, to train all of the Tusla staff throughout the country, where appropriate, and to pilot and roll out the programme in the 17 regions.  All of that has happened.  As this continues and as the programme is fully implemented, there needs to be ongoing monitoring and reporting back.  I am confident that the programme is being monitored well and is seen as a very positive aspect of Tusla's reform.</p></speech>

Officials from my Department and I meet these organisations formally twice per year to share knowledge and information on developments in the youth sector.  Most recently, I met the national youth organisations on 11 April.  An additional meeting was held on that day with the national organisations in receipt of targeted youth funding to keep them updated on the ongoing reform of that funding.  My Department has also committed to convening formal meetings twice yearly with the five largest grantees from 2018 onwards.  This commitment follows an internal audit report, published in 2017, that recommended more engagement on a periodic basis with youth service grant scheme grantees.  In May, my officials met Youth Work Ireland, Scouting Ireland, the National Youth Council of Ireland, Crosscare and For&oacute;ige in that regard.</p>  <p>  Youth officers of the education and training boards, ETBs, provide an important support role to my Department in the co-ordination and administration of youth services at a local level across the country.  My officials hold scheduled meetings with the youth officers and youth liaison officers to maintain an open dialogue.  The most recent meeting took place on 20 June with a specific focus on the transition to the new targeted funding scheme.  My Department has set up a working group with five youth officers that is focused on strategic planning for future capital funding for the youth sector.  There is ongoing active engagement between my Department and the youth constituency of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures advisory council.  A small number of national youth organisation representatives are members of the council.  Officials from my Department also meet youth organisations on an individual basis when the need arises.  We have a professional and constructive working relationship with the national youth organisations, which my Department consistently works hard to maintain.</p></speech>

In my initial reply, I tried to outline the various structures and conversation paths that have been established in terms of a better, deeper and more frequent dialogue between the sector and my Department at national and community or local levels.  That is an improvement, and significant changes have occurred in recent years in that regard.  I am, therefore, confident that this will bear the fruit for which we are hoping.  The communication channels are operating in different ways and at different levels.</p>  <p>  As to what has been requested or is being considered, we undertook a major reform of targeted youth funding.  That has created many concerns and there has been much dialogue in that regard.  We are moving towards full implementation of the reform.  The need for an ongoing dialogue at different levels is especially critical now.</p></speech>

We received an additional &euro;1.5 million for youth funding in 2019.  Funding is allocated and offered to the youth sector in different ways, but it totals &euro;60.4 million.  Organisations argue that, due to the years of austerity, it is still not at the level it should be, but there has been a further &euro;1.5 million increase this year.  We have targeted youth funding, the 2019 allocation for which is approximately &euro;35 million.  Youth service grant schemes will receive &euro;11 million; youth information centres, &euro;1.377 million; local youth club grant scheme, &euro;2 million; and revised youth funding schemes, &euro;3.3 million.  That is an outline of the details.  The national youth organisations are putting a case for increased investment, but I told them at our most recent meeting to develop the detail of that.  I am open to receiving same and they are working on it now.</p></speech>

They have been received positively overall, with providers and parents recognising my duty to protect children and assist in ensuring quality of service.  Concerns raised in the media focused on the minimum ratio of one adult to 12 children that will come into force in August.  However, data available to my Department indicate that the large majority of school age childcare providers will have no difficulty complying with the new ratio.  A sample of 400 school age services surveyed in 2018 found an average ratio of one adult to nine children, well within the new ratio requirement, and 85% of sessions of school age childcare provided were within a 1:12 ratio.  A separate survey was carried out in May and June of this year by the county childcare committees.  In the ten rural and urban counties for which data are available so far, 79% of services were already operating within the 1:12 ratio.</p>  <p>  Concerns have also been raised about the impact on the number of places.  However, the available data offer assurances.  In the ten counties for which data are available, there will be an overall increase in the number of places this September.  Additionally, my Department recently announced the results of a capital scheme, which will create 2,308 new school age places nationally.</p>  <p>  The 2019 regulations are relatively limited in scope and were introduced to support the inclusion of school age childcare in the new national childcare scheme, which will open later this year.  We need some regulations if providers are to receive subsidies.  It will be necessary to replace the regulations in due course with comprehensive ones to ensure children's health, safety and well-being.</p>  <p>  I recently carried out a full public consultation to inform the future regulations and quality standards.  The consultation period closed on 5 July and I am looking forward to hearing the outcome.</p></speech>

Concerns focused on the minimum ratio of 1:12.  Do I understand her correctly that there will be scope for expansion in this?  Is that because the ratio applies to younger children or will it be applied for all attending after-school services?</p>  <p>  I welcome the regulations and the legislation, but I have a slight concern about the ratio, not as it relates to 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. pick-ups, but as it relates to older children who are coming out of classes with a ratio of 1:26.  Is there a way of phasing the regulations in so that, if certain childcare providers exceed the 1:12 ratio, they will be able to change that over a period of six or 12 months?</p></speech>

I have indicated that we had a full consultation process as regards the development of the regulations.</p><p>We will see if that concern has been raised.  I will certainly bring what the Deputy has said back to my Department.  I would not say "No" to it outright.  The Deputy has offered a rationale, about which perhaps we could talk further.  Having said that, what I am describing is what was recommended not only by experts but also by key stakeholders, including Early Childhood Ireland, Children's Rights Alliance and the National Parents Council.  It has fed into the development of the ratio and the strong belief that is what is required to ensure quality of life and the safety of children.  I do not think I can promise that anything will move, but I will bring the specific argument the Deputy has made back to the Department for it to look at it.</p></speech>

Families can continue to access their current targeted supports, remaining on their existing payment if they so wish, until the end of August 2020.  They include parents availing of the community employment childcare scheme.  The national childcare scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support and see many families qualify for a higher level of support.  The scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain social protection payments or a medical card to receive targeted supports.  In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps within the existing schemes and ensure taking a job is not a disincentive.</p>  <p>  I have worked to poverty-proof the scheme by ensuring families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates.  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, analysis finds that the scheme will significantly address affordability for lower income families, with one analysis showing that Ireland will change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents to the 11th position.  The new scheme is designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, subsidy rates and maximum hours designed in order that they can be adjusted over time as more investment becomes available.  The hours and thresholds published have been costed and funded, but they can be enhanced in future years.  The existence of the saver mechanism for the first year gives us time to monitor the position and ascertain if further policy change is required.  As such, the scheme provides the pathway to quality, affordable and accessible childcare.  It is central to my commitment to changing the childcare system to ensure it is the best.</p></speech>

Nobody denies the need for affordable childcare services for parents, but the reality is that people on special community employment schemes availing of childcare or a community aftercare services are primarily lone parents, some of whom are extremely vulnerable, have mental health or addiction issues and require that support.  While it might not be full-time, it appears that they are not getting the childcare support they had been getting.  There are significant concerns that their progress and recovery to make themselves more eligible for employment will be affected because they are not able to attend in the way they did because their childcare hours have been reduced.</p></speech>

I am aware of the concerns of both lone parents and their representatives.  Deputy Catherine Martin suggested we might need to meet them to communicate what was going on and identify how the changes would impact on them.  Ongoing communication is very important.  When we move to the national childcare scheme, it will be based on household income.  In the past, certainly on community employment schemes, people gained access to subsidies based on social welfare or other related entitlements.  It is shifting towards that.  I will try to describe how I think the changes to the community employment scheme should involve the provision of supports which are at least as good, if not better, as we move towards the future.</p></speech>

I have seen the difference they are making in the number of women who are being supported to return to employment and in dealing with the various issues in their lives.  The idea of a meeting is a very good one.  If the Minister is organising one, I would love if it included some representatives of the groups I have mentioned.  I know that there is concern about online applications because some of the skill set is missing for certain people for many reasons into which we will not go now.  There is a need to provide that support.  I am talking about people who are particularly vulnerable.  They have children and want to do the best for them and themselves.  It was disappointing when they saw this, as it was supposed to be beneficial and positive.  They saw the unintended negative consequences.</p></speech>

Part of it is through the city and county childcare committees, Intreo and Citizens Information offices.  We will find ways to support people who face challenges in making online applications.  On whether they will be worse off, I certainly know that under the community employment scheme, as well as on some education and training courses, parents, especially lone parents, received a capped co-payment.  The concern is that they will have to pay more as they move into the national childcare scheme.  I have a table in front of me which I will share with the Deputy, on which the maximum subsidy payment under the current scheme is listed as &euro;145 for a child under the age of one year, plus a co-payment of &euro;15, meaning that the provider gets &euro;160.  Under the national childcare scheme, the maximum subsidy payment for a child under the age of one year is &euro;204, meaning that it is more rather than less.  That is just one example.  I have others.  There are many circumstances.  I understand there is uncertainty, which is why we have put the saver mechanism in place.  I accept that there is a need for more communication and hope that it will ease the concerns and fears and that the policy intentions will be clear.  If there are hard cases, we will work with them.</p></speech>

The definitions of work and study will be set out in regulations to be made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and extremely comprehensive, covering different types of work and study arrangements such as part-time, week on-week off and zero-hour contract arrangements.</p>  <p>  Parents who do not meet any of the criteria which I have mentioned may still qualify for a standard hours subsidy up to a maximum of 15 hours per week.  This approach recognises that, in such cases, parents do not need childcare for work or related reasons.  It also reflects the evidence for the strong benefits of early childhood care and education for young children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as the evidence that these benefits are, in most cases, realised with part-time participation.  For children in school and pre-school, the standard hours subsidy will entitle them to up to 15 hours of subsidised childcare out of term time while during term time child development needs will be met through school and pre-school services.</p><p>The approach is consistent with the scheme's policy objectives of promoting positive child development outcomes, labour market activation and a reduction in child poverty.  It is also bolstered by special sponsorship arrangements which will ensure that, if there are vulnerable children and families, they can be referred for childcare without any parental co-payment.  To support a smooth transition to the national childcare scheme, families can also choose to make the switch to the new scheme once it is launched in October, or they can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year.</p></reply>

There are a number of schemes across the country.  I am aware of two in County Wexford, one in Bunclody and the other in Wexford town, where Ferns Diocesan Youth Service, FDYS, provides childcare schemes for the children of sometimes vulnerable adults or adults with serious addiction or mental health issues.  On the provision of childcare, the schemes are more in the nature of intervention and welfare-type schemes.  Their funding will be cut under the new scheme.  If they lose their funding, they will be gone.  The children benefit greatly from the schemes which help to set them up for school and provide them with food and support.  That support will no longer be available.  Their parents will not be benefiting from work activation programmes, given that sometimes they cannot read or write and are from very difficult backgrounds where there may be mental health issues.  The FDYS tells me that its schemes will be gone.  We hear about similar situations across the country; for example, there is a similar case in Carlow.  I ask that something be done to ensure the schemes will be kept in place.  The scheme in Bunclody receives &euro;36,000 a year and is providing phenomenal support and value for money for the children.  It is about the children.  I am not worried about the parents but about the children and the support they are receiving which needs to be continued.</p></speech>

We want to make sure the supports that have been provided for parents and children in the past in the way we have provided funding will still be available.  I do not want to comment further on the specific settings as I am not sure exactly what is going on, but we will look at them.  More generally, what I have been trying to describe is that, with the introduction of the national childcare scheme, those who are making the least or on the lowest income will get the most.  In fact, we are trying to ensure this will continue to the case as we move towards the introduction of the national childcare scheme.  As I have said previously, we will have sponsorship arrangements within the national childcare scheme.  For example, if there are teen parents who are still in education and training, the Minister for Education and Skills sponsors them and they receive free childcare.  If there are refugees and asylum seekers who need support, they are sponsored by the Department of Justice and Equality and receive free childcare.  To promote their welfare, Tusla often sponsors children in order that there is free childcare.  We will look at the specific settings the Deputy has identified because there may be something else going on.</p></speech>

The difficulty seems to be that in the codifying of the childcare programme certain programmes are going to fall between the cracks.  As I understand it, in some cases the number of hours is going to be reduced from 40 to 15.  I suggest the Minister's office make contact with Mr. Kieran Donohoe who is over the FDYS and helping to provide schemes.  I have talked to a number of my colleagues in other parts of the country.  There are schemes in place that do not fall into any of the particular categories, but they are providing very good childcare services in particularly disadvantaged areas across the country.  They are falling between the cracks.  It was perhaps the case that they were shoehorned into the previous system and the codification is hurting them.</p></speech>

So too is the legacy of that abuse and the failure of the State to act, failing its citizens and society.  Child sexual abuse is particularly abhorrent because those who perpetrate it have positions of power.  That is the case whether the abuse happens in institutional settings or the home.  Victims of violent crime deserve tremendous sympathy, victims of child sexual abuse all the more so.  Child sexual abuse is a crime which deeply touches our emotions.  I repeat the Taoiseach's apology to all those who were abused in day schools in the period prior to 1992.  It is said the past is another country and that the country in which the abuses took place was very different from that of today.  As a nation, we have travelled an enormous distance in our societal attitudes and willingness to place previously unspoken and unacknowledged facts in the open.</p><p>I will speak presently about the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme and the decision of the independent assessor, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, but the sad fact of the matter is that we should not be here talking about compensation schemes.  The truth is that if more people in decades past had been willing to speak out about issues such as sexual abuse, the State and those of us who hold positions of authority would have been better placed to act to prevent abuse and better protect children.  We need to reflect, not just as a state but as a society, on this.  There have been failings on the part of the State.  This was most manifestly the case in the residential institutions where the State had a very direct role in the incarceration of children.  It was at fault for failing to identify the systematic regimes of abuse which were in force in the institutions.  It has paid significant financial redress to the survivors of the institutions, but it is important that we continue to pay tribute to those brave people who, as children and young adults, endured dreadful privations and carried that trauma.  It is right that those survivors hear the apology again here today.</p><p>Child sexual abuse was not unique to institutions.  We also know that it happened in some day schools.  They were not set apart from the community or hidden behind high walls.  The children who attended them were not separated from their parents, yet we know that, regrettably, there were still teachers in these schools who preyed on children for their own sexual gratification.  Largely because of our history, we have a somewhat unique school system which reflects the constitutional position that the State provides for education, rather than being the provider of education.  The arm's length nature of the system has been recognised by the domestic courts when considering issues of the State's liability for wrongdoing in schools.  The European Court of Human Rights took a different view from the High Court and the Supreme Court on the specific issue of liability for the sexual abuse of schoolchildren in the landmark case taken by Ms Louise O'Keeffe.  The European Court of Human Rights found on the facts of the case that the State did have a certain responsibility for historical abuse.</p><p>The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights is complex and lengthy and runs to some 80 pages.  What is clear is that some people who were abused in day schools discontinued cases against the State before the judgment in respect of Ms O'Keeffe's in the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>Some of those cases involved the State being joined in actions that survivors had taken against school authorities including religious congregations.  The <i>ex gratia</i>scheme was established to provide a mechanism to address the situation of these people.  The criteria of the scheme reflected the State's interpretation of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, judgment, including the criterion that there must have been a prior complaint of abuse to a school authority.  I acknowledge as a matter of fact that this proved to be too difficult a hurdle for applicants to cross.  Put simply, the scheme did not work.  The result is that close to half of the people who applied to the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme subsequently applied to have their case reviewed by the independent assessor to the scheme, retired High Court judge Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill.  Mr. Justice O'Neill has ruled on those 19 applications.  He has formed the view that the requirement for a survivor to secure evidence of a prior complaint is not consistent with the ECHR judgment.  As a result, 13 people are entitled to a payment.  This will be paid as a matter of priority.<br/><br/>In response to the assessor's decision, the Taoiseach announced in the D&aacute;il yesterday that the prior complaint criterion would be dispensed with and that the scheme would be reopened.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining the scheme in light of this.  I met the Attorney General, Mr. S&eacute;amus Woulfe, yesterday to discuss the next steps in the process and I hope to be in a position to bring a memo to Cabinet next week outlining the Government's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000013#L00200"><p>I warmly welcome the recent declaration by former judge Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, because it sweeps away the bogus barrier which this State sought to put in the way of a small group of blameless victims who are trying to pursue justice and recognition.  Anybody who studied the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in respect of the O'Keeffe case will know that the State's interpretation was absolutely ludicrous.  Mr. Justice O'Neill did not spare his words and said it represented an inversion of logic but, in fact, it was worse than that.  It was a grotesque distortion and it was risible.  The European Court of Human Rights found, as one fact among several others, that there had been a prior complaint in the Louise O'Keeffe case.  It did not rule that, as a matter of law, a prior complaint was a legal prerequisite to compensation.  Even a cursory examination of the judgment readily demonstrates that.  The question, then, is why the State insisted on such a perverse interpretation.  The sad fact seems to be that, even while the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, was congratulating Louise O'Keeffe on her courage, her fortitude, and her tenacity in achieving victory in Europe his Government was, at the very same time, searching for some device, some artifice, to ensure that nobody would benefit from the victory of Louise O'Keeffe.  It is a shameful chapter in the history of this country.</p><p>I am glad the Minister mentioned the Statute of Limitations being re-examined.  Another hurdle in the way of the victims who were seeking justice was the requirement to establish that they initiated legal proceedings within the time set out in the Statute of Limitations, even if the proceedings were later withdrawn in light of subsequent court decisions.  Many of those people were not in a position, financially or, because of the abuse they suffered, psychologically, to initiate legal proceedings.  More important, the prevailing legal view of the time was that they would have no case.  If we leave this criterion in place as it stands, are we now saying that people were expected to have gathered up the courage and the wherewithal to go to their solicitors, to be told that they had no case whatsoever but, nevertheless, to have insisted on their solicitors bringing the case forward, even in spite of the legal advice?  If that requirement is left in place, a number of blameless, innocent victims will not be able to surmount the barrier and will be deprived of justice.  It would be a manifest absurdity if they were expected to do that.</p><p>People have said that this is about money but it is not about money.  The maximum somebody can be paid under the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme is &euro;84,000, which is a fairly pitiable amount of money in the context of the destruction that has been done.  How does one compensate people who have died during the long wait for justice?  How does one compensate people who have taken their own lives?  It is not a question of compensation but of a tangible recognition and acknowledgement by the State that it did wrong to those people, and that its attitude in the aftermath of the Louise O'Keeffe case was coldly and determinedly adversarial.  They need an element of closure and they need it as a matter of urgency.  Anybody who is familiar with the effect on the lives of the victims will find a tangled tale of broken lives, broken homes, broken relationships, broken dreams and broken marriages.  That has been the consequence of the abuse they suffered when they were entrusted by the State, which took no oversight responsibilities, into the care of people who abused them.  Those people deserve justice.  They have suffered too long and they have suffered too much.</p><p>Yesterday in this House, the Taoiseach acknowledged, verbally at least, that the State had failed these people and had failed them on more than one occasion.  He gave his word to this House that they will not be failed again.  I hope the Taoiseach means what he said and I can assure him that we will try to ensure he adheres rigidly to that promise.  The victims deserve no less.</p></speech>

It is important that the apologies are followed up by constructive work and deeds.  I personally know quite a number of these lads.  In my city of Limerick, some of the lads who went to Creagh Lane school suffered abuse, the case went to court and the perpetrator was convicted in 2009.  The brave journey taken by Louise O'Keeffe, who had to take our country to the European Court of Human Rights, has unfortunately not delivered for any of the people affected.  The introduction of the prior complaint requirement, among other things, meant that people who had suffered abuse could not proceed.</p>  <p>  I thank Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill for his excellent work in this case.  He has put to bed the prior complaint requirement and the Taoiseach was left with no option yesterday other than to agree that it led to the system not working and that it denied people access to the scheme.  We can sometimes forget that people are involved.  In some cases, survivors have secured convictions in court but were still unable to access the scheme.  I ask that the Government look after these people as a matter of priority.  It is not just a question of what happened to the men involved - most of them are men - it is also about what happened to their families.  Some of them suffer from addiction and others are, unfortunately, not with us, while there have been family breakdowns in other cases.  I know of one guy who still cannot read or write because he had no proper education, having hated the idea of walking through the doorway into his school.  Another man told me that his mother was not even aware of what was going on.  Later, she asked him if the fact that he knew what was going to happen was the reason he always looked back when she sent him down to the school.  The families of these children feel devastation over the fact that they were not aware of what was happening to their children.  We need to address this properly.  The Taoiseach's apology yesterday was welcome.  He said he would not fail these people for a third time and it is important that this is the case.</p>  <p>  Who actually came up with the prior complaint criterion?  Was it a political decision or was it a legal decision?  Whoever came up with it should be ashamed of themselves.  Will the Minister publish the advice his Department received?  I understand that the current Minister was not in the Department at the time.  Will he publish the advice the Department received that stated that a prior complaint was required?</p><p>I believe the requirement was not needed and was only included to make it as difficult as possible - almost impossible - for people to access the scheme.  For the people in these situations, justice is far more important than money.  Money was never a factor.  When people affected by this issue approached me, some of them five, six or seven years ago, they never mentioned money.  The main things they sought were an apology from the State, recognition that the crimes had been committed and an acknowledgement that what had happened to them was wrong.  They were the key issues.  Obviously, compensation is important and action is needed in that regard.</p> <p> Last year the D&aacute;il voted by a margin of 2:1 to instruct the Government to get rid of the prior complaint requirement.  I am glad that it will now be done, but we have wasted a year.  We could have acted far more quickly.  The comments of the Taoiseach yesterday must be followed by action.  This must not drag on any longer.  Can the Minister give a timeframe for sorting out this issue?</p> <p> I will again specifically mention Creagh Lane school.  Will the lads who suffered abuse there be included in any new scheme or changes to the current scheme?  Have survivors been contacted?  Is the Department setting up a telephone line for those affected by this issue to contact it?  Can we be assured that people will not be subject to the Statute of Limitations?  We do not want people who realise the prior complaint requirement has finally been done away with such that they can access the redress scheme to fall at another hurdle, that of the Statute of Limitations. </p> <p> I again welcome the important apology given by the Taoiseach yesterday.  The people affected to whom I have spoken are very appreciative of it.  The outcome needs to be the delivery of a solution for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000014#M00200"><p>Like all Members, I welcome the apology given by the Taoiseach yesterday on the floor of the House and reiterated today by the Minister, Deputy McHugh.  In this the centenary year of the First D&aacute;il, we should remember the words of the Democratic Programme written by Tom Johnson more than 100 years ago.  It states:</p><blockquote>It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as Citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland.</blockquote><p>It is clear that the Government has failed to meet that very important commitment.</p><p>In 2014 the European Court of Human Rights delivered a landmark majority judgment in favour of Louise O'Keeffe.  For 15 years she had sought redress.  It came 40 years after her abuser, Leo Hickey, had been convicted for abusing her while principal of her school.  The judgment found that the State had been negligent in failing to protect her from abuse while she was in school and that it should compensate her.  Her human rights had been breached.  Unbelievably, the State did not apply this important principle in cases involving other victims, but, in effect, perpetuated the abuse and thereby exacerbated the injury to the unfortunate people concerned.  In many of the cases, the abuse was perpetrated by private individuals.  However, the State failed in its duty to supervise or check the individuals who had committed the horrendous crimes of abuse.  The State has since dragged its feet and done all in its power to frustrate the judgment which aimed to ensure those who had been abused physically or sexually in schools received appropriate compensation.  The hands-off approach to the school system has continued for many years.  The Government and the State prefer to pretend that the responsibility lies with school boards of management, notwithstanding the fact that the Department of Education and Skills is the only financier of the employees involved.  The reality is that the State pays the wages of teachers, supervises the school curriculum, funds the operation of schools and inspects them.</p><p>A legal fiction was employed to escape liability.  I have been involved in cases where this principle has been rigidly applied by those on the side of the State.  All too often the State is prepared to wash its hands of responsibility for the national education system.  It is time to undo the wrong perpetrated against Louise O'Keeffe and hundreds of others.  The legal gymnastics must end.  In the words of the retired Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, the conclusion reached by the State was inherently illogical.  I am unequivocally asking the Minister to call off the lawyers and ensure the State Claims Agency deals with the claims quickly.</p><p>There is no doubt that the interpretation of the judgment by the Government, its advisers and, more particularly, its legal advisers was wrong.  There must be an apology for the impossible standard that was set for <i>ex gratia</i>payments to be made, namely, that claimants were obliged to show that their abuser was the subject of a prior complaint.  It set a hurdle that no one could meet and was tantamount to furthering the abuse faced by the victims.  The condition is impossible to defend.  At the heart of the ECHR ruling was that not only was the State was liable on the basis of previously complained of sex abuse by the perpetrator, but that there was also a glaring failure by the State to set up a proper structure to protect children from sexual abuse.  That was made clear by Mr. Justice O'Neill who stated that for the State to insist on the prior complaint requirement as a precondition to eligibility involved an inherent inversion of logic and a fundamental unfairness to applicants.  Can the Minister commit that the State will review all cases, including those pending and discontinued, as requested by Louise O'Keeffe and that the State will stop fighting victims?There is an obligation to so do.</p><p>The Taoiseach apologised yesterday in the D&aacute;il and that is welcome.  Those words must now be matched by deeds and actions.  The D&aacute;il voted previously to expand the terms of the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme.  The Government must heed the voice of the people and the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  More than 20 years ago, the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, issued an apology.  For more than 20 years, the State has engaged in evasive action to avoid responsibility.  What worries me is that the current <i>ex gratia </i>scheme was constructed in such a way as to purport to comply with the thrust of the O'Keeffe judgment but not to do so in effect.</p><p>Some time ago, I read a brilliant article by Dr. Conor O'Mahony, a senior lecturer in child law at UCC.  He was scathing in his view of the State and the fact that it had incurred more than &euro;1.5 million in legal fees in order to avoid paying compensation to victims and through that action re-traumatised some of its most vulnerable citizens.  As I stated, I have been involved in cases on behalf of plaintiffs who were sexually and physically abused.  We brought them through the court process.  Young children often do not disclose abuse at the time it occurs; such disclosures tend to be made later in life.  As Deputy Connolly is aware as it applies to a place not 100 miles from where she lives, even if a complaint was made contemporaneously, the records of such complaints were often mislaid or lost.  One had a better chance of winning the lottery than of getting the records from the religious order involved.  As Dr. O'Mahony stated, the education system has been found to be inherently defective from a child protection standpoint.  Compensating all of the victims - I know that it is not about compensation, but they deserve something - would cost &euro;29 million, which is equivalent to one fiftieth or 2% of the cost of the indemnity given to religious orders for institutional abuse.  Need we say more?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000014#M00300"><p>I praise Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill for the work he has done and welcome the outcome of it.  In the few minutes we have available to discuss this matter we should try to draw some lessons from the case.  Even though I have only been a Deputy for a short time, it feels familiar to be talking about a scandal that involves State abuse of vulnerable citizens.  There is a familiarity about the Taoiseach's apology, the heartfelt utterances by Ministers who adopt a <i>mea culpa</i>attitude, the commitment that we will never allow this to happen again, that lessons need to be learned and the hope it is in the past.  Time and again we seem to have a strong sense of <i>d&eacute;ja vu</i>.</p><p>The problem for me is that lessons have not been learned and that the State has not changed.  The Minister and the Taoiseach will have the same instincts the next time they are confronted by vulnerable citizens failed by the State as they do today.  It is not an oversight, a mistake, or the workings of some over-zealous civil servant or functionary; it is embedded in the heart of the State and its workings.  If one looks at our record on hepatitis C and Brigid McCole, symphysiosotomy, Cervicalcheck, the Magdalen laundries, church-run schools and institutions, the Shane Farrell case and the long list of other issues, the speeches by chastened Ministers and leaders are similar but, frankly, they ring hollow.  What did the State do in this case?  What is it hoping to achieve in contesting the Ruth Morrissey case?  What is the thinking behind denying justice to the Magdalen women or seeking to limit the rights of survivors of abuse?  It is not protecting its citizens but, rather, protecting its failures and institution from its vulnerable citizens.</p><p>Like Brigid McCole, Louise O'Keeffe was bullied and threatened with ruin if she pursued a clear injustice.  The instinct of the State is to circle the wagons and hunker down, in the hope the threat might pass it by.  We know that it is not just about limiting its liability because we have seen the other side of the State in recent cases involving big business and in which the coffers have, on occasion, overflowed with abandon.  There seems to be little limit to its largesse in such cases.  The actions of the State in this case are about protecting itself.  The links between many of the cases are the failure of the State to provide basic services citizens should receive by right, the contracting out of core responsibilities to religious or other bodies or companies and the fact that as a result it is women or vulnerable people who bear the brunt of failure and the subsequent attempts by the State to hide or evade its responsibility.</p><p>Bertolt Brecht said: "Unhappy the land that is in need of heroes".  We do need our heroes and we seem to be blessed with them, whether it is Vicky Phelan, Brigid McCole or Louise O'Keeffe; but we should not need them.  We should be a happy nation that does not need them and our heroes should not have to risk so much and have their personal stories laid out so publicly to correct the failings of the State and the attempt by the State to protect itself.  One might ask what our State institutions are protecting.  What did the Government and its officials think it was protecting in 2012 when it chose to interpret the ECHR judgment in such a clever and maliciously narrow way?  Who did the then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and Fine Gael think they were protecting when they threatened Brigid McCole with penury over the hepatitis C scandal?  Who did the State Claims Agency think it was protecting when it decided to appeal the recent Ruth Morrissey judgment?  Who did Fianna Fail Ministers think there were protecting in 2010 when they tried to claim that the State "did not refer individuals nor was it complicit in referring individuals to Ireland's Magdalene laundries"?  They are not protecting citizens.  They are not defending their rights or vindicating their rights as human beings.  They are protecting the institutions of the State and the layers of privilege and wealth that go with them.</p> <p> Karl Marx famously said that the state is simply "armed bodies of men", which is true, but it is also a standing army of senior civil servants, managers, advisers and learned lawyers whose class instincts at all times are to treat victims of abuse, injustice or of failures of the State as enemies of the State, to be denied, shunned, ridiculed and threatened if they try to expose those failures.  Despite the pious statements from the Minister and the Taoiseach, I bet that we will be back here again when another hero or heroine faces down the threats of the State and is vindicated.  This is not the last time because, unfortunately, we do not seem to have learnt lessons from this litany of tragedy in the history of the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000015#N00200"><p>I usually find the Minister very reasonable, but I am deeply disappointed with his contribution  I welcome the apology given by the Government but I see no evidence that it will mean anything, in particular in view of the Minister's statement: &quot;The truth is that if more people in decades past had been willing to speak out...the State...would have been better placed to act&rdquo;.  This is not about more people speaking out; this is about the State failing in its duty and in infringement of Articles 3 and 15 of the ECHR.  Article 3 enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic societies.  It &quot;prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot;  The State failed to do that.  More importantly, the State is continuing to fail to do that.</p><p>Paragraph 62 of the judge's findings outlined that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Article 13 rights under the convention continue to be infringed.  Yet the Minister gave a speech today in the manner I outlined.  He stated, &quot;Put simply, the scheme did not work.&quot;  Put simply, the scheme was designed not to work; it was designed to fail.  We know that because conditions were put into it that were impossible to comply with.  The Minister referred to a complex judgment from the European Court of Human Rights.  I thought it was a pretty straightforward judgment.  Notwithstanding that, and various people's level of experience, Mr. Justice O'Neill put it in crystal clear language.  My colleague quoted another writer earlier.  Shakespeare's words come to mind, namely, &quot;A Daniel come to judgment&quot; regarding the judge's use of language.  He states on page 16 that it is crystal clear that the ECHR did not make any finding of a breach of Article 3 based on the fact of a prior complaint, yet the Government has consistently in its engagement with him and before every court said that a prior complaint was an integral part of finding the Government liable.  The Government has persisted with its line.  Previous Governments have done wrong and the Government has persisted with that.</p><p>Mr. Justice O'Neill went on to say, regarding the inclusion of such a criterion, that it was inherently illogical for the State to demand the very evidence that is not there or cannot be recovered because of the very failure of the State, which constitutes the actual breach.  The Government breached Article 3 and then put in a condition that made it impossible for people to access the scheme.  There is a phrase in Gaeilge.  T&aacute; fhios agam go bhfuil Gaeilge ag an Aire.  It is f&aacute;inne f&iacute;, a vicious circle.  The Government put the victims of abuse through a vicious circle, knowing well that they could not succeed.  Within that vicious circle we know that of the 50 persons who applied to the State Claims Agency, 44 were refused and six cases are pending.  Of the 44 refused, all failed on one particular reason, and in some cases another, namely, that they had no evidence of a prior complaint.  Today's speech from the Minister perpetuates the abuse rather than learns from it.  Even for the time in 1973, the Government failed to enforce the most minimal standards and still in the 21st century, it is trying to say it is historical.  It is not historical.  Even at the time, the minimum standards were not complied with.  There was no provision to even report complaints, notwithstanding the fact that the courageous Louise O'Keeffe reported a complaint.  That was subsequently misused in a misinterpretation of the ECHR judgment.  The Minister is shaking his head.  I ask him to read the findings of Mr. Justice O'Neill and the six recommendations.  He will see the judge taking the State's case and the way it was represented in the three High Court cases.  It was not an accurate representation of what the court found.  The Minister should read the judgment and find out and then put it in context.  The context is that Louise O'Keeffe said the State fought her tooth and nail, as it fought all the other victims.  After a legal journey of 15 and a half years, she had to go to the ECHR, and she is still fighting.  What did the State do?  It fought her every step of the way and it fought her in its submissions to Mr. Justice O'Neill.  It set up an <i>ex gratia</i>payment that was designed to fail, to exclude and to heap abuse on abuse.  Nobody succeeded at that.  That was on top of 400 incidents of abuse since the mid-1960s in one national school, followed on by a perfect awareness from the convictions in the criminal courts that sexual abuse was prevalent at the time.</p></speech>

Deputy Connolly is passionate and honest about this matter.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on this most important matter.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased because it affords me the opportunity to put on record my admiration and that of the entire Rural Independent Group for the heroic bravery and courage of Louise O'Keeffe.  It was only fit and proper that the Taoiseach apologised on behalf of the State to victims of sexual abuse in day schools, anseo inn&eacute;.  As we know, we are here today following a finding that the State misinterpreted a European Court ruling on the survivors of sexual abuse in schools and the requirements they must meet to avail of redress.</p>  <p>  As I understand it, the Government's position was that the decision of the ECHR applies only to people who were abused after an initial complaint was made against a teacher and no action was taken.  In the context, misinterpretation is probably too soft a word.  I do not blame the Minister, Deputy McHugh, personally but his contribution did not give me any solace.  I was unable to be present for it but I listened to it in my office.</p><p>According to Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, it was inherently illogical of the State to demand evidence when there was no State-controlled mechanism for detecting and reporting incidents of child sexual abuse in national schools.  We all know that.  Mr. Justice O'Neill went on to say that for the State to insist on such a precondition to eligibility involved an inherent inversion of logic and a fundamental unfairness to applicants.  It is totally inherent and unfair and beggars belief that the State would be so cumbersome and inept to think that we would accept this.  I salute Mr. Justice O'Neill and thank him for the hard work and honesty in this report.  We have had many reports, tribunals and God knows what and they are all waffle, but this is clear concise and direct.  The response of the Minister for Education and Skills is feeble - I am being kind to the Minister.  Mr. Justice O'Neill went on to say that for the State to insist on such a precondition to eligibility involved an inherent inversion of logic and a fundamental unfairness to applicants.<br/><br/>I listened with admiration to what Louise O'Keeffe said yesterday in response to the findings of Mr. Justice O'Neill.  She said there was now an &quot;absolute onus on the State to review all cases, both pending and discontinued&quot;.  She went on to say that all of those cases must be reviewed and the State &quot;must own up to the responsibility that was theirs and is theirs to get this right&quot;.  It is beyond time to get this right.  The families and abused persons deserve this at best.  Louise O'Keeffe went on to say:</p><blockquote>For the past five and a half years [the State] have fought every other victim and they have used a prior complaint as the big issue and they were wrong. They simply must come out, they must sort out, they must own up to responsibility.</blockquote><p>I hope that process of taking responsibility is now in train.  Yet, from the comments or remarks of the Minister, I wonder if that is so.  This is due almost entirely to the courage and perseverance of Louise O'Keeffe.  It has nothing to do with the willingness of the State to prevent further trauma to people like Louise and the many other victims of abuse.  We salute their courage and bravery.<br/><br/>From looking at the emptiness of the benches this morning, shortly before Leaders' Questions, I do not get a sense of the Government giving this the mark of importance that it should have - I am not saying this to the Minister personally.  Where are all the others in the Government?  The Taoiseach will be on his way in.  I fully expected the Taoiseach would come to the Chamber yesterday and apologise for the grievous hurt and damage he caused the Catholic Church, Catholic priests and the Catholic faith last week.  I expected that he would apologise in the House, where he made those remarks, but he did not.  It is very sad and unfair on the 99.9% of hard-working decent Catholic clergy at home and abroad who have done so much good for the Taoiseach to tarnish them in the way he did in comments to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I would expect - I still expect - that the Taoiseach will come to the House and be man enough and humble enough to apologise.  I know he apologised outside in the media and to others at a meeting, but it is totally unacceptable and unworthy of his position.</p></speech>

It has been too long and there have been too many words.  There is no solace in words today.  There is no solace in words for me unless there is action.  I understand that because it is not only about Louise O'Keeffe.  People in a similar position have been wronged.  They have been let down and have had false dawns.  A scheme presented to them in the form of the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme was unworkable.  There is no question about what went wrong.  There is no justification in my standing up on behalf of the State to say we tried our best but failed.  That is what happened.  We failed as a State and as a society.  I have remarked on people coming forward.  There are still people with information.  There are congregations and people with information who still need to come forward because we need to step up as a society.</p><p>What can I do in my position?  I will stand over my words and public utterances yesterday morning on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;.  I am determined to get this right.  I am determined to get it right through action not words.  That is why I met the Attorney General yesterday afternoon on this particular issue.  That is why officials from the Department of Education and Skills and the Office of the Attorney General are meeting this week on this issue.  It is because we want to get it right.  It is the least we can do.</p><p>There is one thing I tried to get around or into my head yesterday before coming in here.  I was thinking on the survivors but while I was picturing them as adults, I was thinking on them as children.  For example, Louise O'Keeffe was a nine year old girl who had to go through what she went through.  It was wrong.  They have been wronged.  It is up to us now collectively to rectify that.</p><p>I know from the constructive tone in the House today that we are determined to do this together.  Some weeks ago Deputy Quinlivan, asked me to meet the men from Creagh Lane national school.  I said then that I would and I am happy to do that.  I am happy with the work of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill and I am disappointed that it took two years.  We have all these disappointments but it is what we do next to ensure we get it right that counts.</p><p>Deputy O'Dea asked whether we were looking at different elements of it.  We are going to look at the entire scheme and examine it in detail with the Attorney General to try not to leave anyone behind.  There have been too many hurdles and obstacles.</p><p>Sometimes we have to lay out the facts.  This was based first on a High Court decision and then on a Supreme Court decision.  Louise O'Keeffe had to go through all of that, including the High Court and the Supreme Court.  She then had to go to the European Court of Human Rights.  For her to go through a second trauma was wrong.  That is effectively what it was - a second trauma extended over decades.  The Taoiseach apologised yesterday.  That apology was based on a conversation we had the previous night on what we can and will do.  Words are probably useless today to the survivors.  I do not know how my words will fall but that is not what I am interested in.  I am interested in rectifying this and in trying to get it right.  Yet, I will not get it right on my own.  We have to get it right as a collective and as a society.  It is the least we can do and I commit to doing that.  I committed to doing it yesterday and I will certainly try my best to try to get it right this time, because time is not on people's side and I am conscious of that as well.</p></speech>

I hope to be able to withdraw it.  I would like the Minister, though, if he could, to clarify where we have got to on this.  For the benefit of the House, I remind Members that the tribunal covers all the women involved in the CervicalCheck group, that is, the 221+ group.  It also covers the additional women who were on the national cancer database, who were not in the CervicalCheck group and who agreed to the review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, in the UK.  The group that has been excluded from the review is comprised of the women who were on the national cancer database, who contracted cervical cancer and who for their own reasons declined the audit by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  I believe, and I think the Minister shares the belief, that the group of women who declined the RCOG review did so without knowing that they were excluding themselves from the tribunal.  It is imperative that they have access to the tribunal, and this amendment speaks to that.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would look at ways of doing this.  I am very open to what his solution is but, ultimately, its result, for me and for Fianna F&aacute;il, needs to be that a mechanism is found for the women who declined the RCOG audit such that they can participate in an independent audit, thereby gaining access to the tribunal.  The Minister might address this.  We want to hear about the mechanism, but before that comes the principle.  Does the Minister believe he has found a way for that group of women to have one more option, time limited, to participate in a review or an audit of their slides, thereby gaining access to the tribunal?</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly also tabled an amendment on this.  Deputy Donnelly and I agree on this.  We are trying to find a way - he is right that we originally set up a tribunal - to provide a route for compensation if adjudicated.  To the 221 group we added the RCOG group.  Deputy Donnelly is right that there is now a number of women, a number I expect to be quite small, who declined to partake in the RCOG audit and who were not part of the CervicalCheck audit but to whom I am happy to provide one more time-limited opportunity.  The criteria as to what that independent review would look like would absolutely need to be set out and acceptable to my Department for obvious reasons.  I therefore suggest, in the interest of allowing for the establishment of this tribunal in the autumn, that I return to the House in the autumn with a legally sound amendment to achieve exactly what Deputy Donnelly seeks to achieve, which is to give that group of women who could have participated in the RCOG audit but chose not to, whatever their reasons were, one more opportunity to participate in some form of independent review that would then allow them access to the tribunal.  Were the Deputy happy to withdraw the amendment, I would commit on the floor of the House to return in the autumn with the legally sound way of doing this.</p></speech>

That is fine.  I will withdraw the amendment.  I appreciate his comments and take him at his word.  I will just put on the record - it could be through no fault of his own - that Bills, particularly miscellaneous Bills, to which we often try to table amendments, can have a habit of drifting.  We would therefore very much like to see the Bill on the D&aacute;il schedule, on the priority list, in order that we could have it passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly after they reconvene.</p></speech>

It is an amendment that Deputy Kelly asked me to table, and I gave him a commitment that I would look at this.  The Deputy basically asked that a six-month period be allowed.  He referred to, I think, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on Committee Stage.  I am happy to table amendments Nos. 6 and 7, which would give effect to this.  The amendments effectively provide that if the tribunal says it is not in a position to assist someone for whatever reason, he or she then has an additional six months added to his or her statute of limitations.  We discussed this on Committee Stage, I think there was broad support for it, and I thank Deputy Kelly for bringing it forward.  My two amendments give effect to the proposal.</p></speech>

This is a critical issue.  We must compare this legislation with other legislation to ensure consistency, and a timeframe of six months should be added to the Bill.  In fairness to the Minister, on this issue, if this issue alone, he has listened to us.  Otherwise, we would have been left in a scenario in which some women could potentially, due to certain circumstances, have fallen outside of the time period.  Adding on the six months ensures that they are within the time period.  For this reason I welcome the fact that the Minister has added it.</p></speech>

We are an island nation and therefore our naval services in particular are important for patrolling and protecting our seas, resources and our interests.  The Navy is in a crisis of morale and numbers and it lacks confidence about its future.  The inability to retain staff is central to that crisis.  Able sea personnel is now at 50% strength, mechanics are at 46% strength, communications operatives are at 50% strength and the diving section is at 33% strength.  Alarmingly the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission shows that a significant number of personnel in both the specialist and generalist areas will leave, the majority within two years, with 63% of specialists planning to leave the general Defence Forces.</p><p>Flag Officer Commanding, Commodore Michael Malone, has confirmed the loss of 450 crew over the last five years has placed an extraordinary burden on those who remain, so that all ships are at reduced manning levels but that they docked two ships in a commitment to valuing the welfare and safety of personnel.</p><p>The Government has been in denial about this crisis for too long.  Repeated spin from the Minister of State and the Government has attempted to camouflage the crisis.  The most recent manifestation of this was the efforts by the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to undermine Commodore Malone's communications to his staff by claiming that the two ships were docked due to maintenance and not crew shortages.  The Taoiseach tried to rescue the Minister of State and sounded a bit like President Trump when he said that two opposites were actually the same thing.  The Taoiseach said that rather than spreading the crews over seven ships they were going to fully staff and equip five.  Speaking at Haulbowline, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, said that it was inaccurate reporting but I understand he was quite adamant with the media at the time and trenchantly argued this was inaccurate reporting.  The Taoiseach has endeavoured to rescue him from his plight.  Commodore Malone was very clear when he said: &quot;I have taken the decision the Naval Service now needs to cut our cloth to measure and take an operational pause to allow us to consolidate and regenerate.&quot;</p><p>The Minister of State's behaviour has angered the Naval community.  Retired personnel are incensed, as is evident from today's <i>Irish Examiner.  </i>To be frank, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, does not inspire confidence in them.  The military community questions his competence and authority within the Government.  This crisis has been identified for some time but effective intervention measures were not taken by the Minister of State.  This morning, only three ships are out at sea.  The remaining are in dock.

First recruitment, which had been paused by the previous Government, was resumed, and second, there has been major investment in the Defence Forces, with five new vessels and the most modern fleet ever.  There has been investment in aircraft with a new fisheries protection aircraft on order, there is new equipment and our barracks have been consolidated and are being invested in again and upgraded.  There has been an expansion of UN missions overseas and also EU missions, including the EU training mission in Mali.  We have also participated in the Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean and a decision was taken recently to deploy the Army Ranger Wing in Mali under the MINUSMA programme.  In recent years, under the Minister of State's stewardship, we have seen investment in our fleet, aircraft, equipment, Defence Forces and their barracks and an expansion of operations overseas, particularly with the UN and the EU, as well as the resumption of recruitment.</p>  <p>  Everyone in government, including the Minister, Deputy Kehoe, acknowledges that we have a real and severe challenge when it comes to recruitment and retention in our Defence Forces.  It is not unique to the Defence Forces.  At a time of full employment when there are so many opportunities in the private sector, we are struggling to recruit in many parts of the public sector, as are many parts of the private sector.  What are we doing about it?  We have a pay deal with the public service which also applies to members of the Defence Forces.  It involves full pay restoration for people earning &euro;70,000 or less, which is being phased in currently and which will be completed by next year.  In addition, something which the Minister of State fought for, the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission, from which the Deputy quoted, has made recommendations to improve allowances for members of the Defence Forces.  The Government has accepted those recommendations in full and we are in the process of implementing them.  It does not stop there.  The next step is a review of tech pay, recognising that there are people in the Defence Forces with particular skills which are very valuable and sought after in the private sector.  We need to improve pay for those in tech and specialist grades.  That is the third step which is being taken.</p></speech>

That is the only reason.  I do not know from whom the Taoiseach is getting his information.  The rest of the Members of the House know from talking to people, to families of those who work in the Army, Navy and Air Corps and from retired personnel, how angry they are at the running down of our Defence Forces.  That is the recurring refrain from those who love and value our Defence Forces, those who have served and the military families whose fathers, and fathers before them, operated in the Army.  Go to those communities, Taoiseach.  They have never witnessed what they perceive to be the neglect of a Government towards them.</p><p>The Taoiseach can say all he has just said but it does not equate with their experience and how they see it.  Morale has never been so low in our Defence Forces.  Numbers have never been so low.  That is a fact.  The Army, Naval Service and Air Corps have never been so under strength.  More alarmingly, specialists in all three arms are dangerously low, from Army bomb disposal, to cybersecurity, to communications specialists and across the board.  The intervention of the pay commission is very belated with regard to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  I note the Taoiseach has said he has absolute and total confidence in the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  I suspect that not too many out there in the military community, be they serving members or retired members, who value it so much, would share his sentiments in this regard.</p></speech>

Second is a &euro;10 million package of improvements in allowances, as recommended by the Public Sector Pay Commission.  This has been accepted by the Government.  The third step is the review of tech pay and specialist pay, recognising these are people with really valuable skills who we need in our Defence Forces but who are sought after by a private sector that is booming.  We need to improve their pay and terms and conditions.  This is the third step that has now commenced.</p></speech>

All of the main farming organisations across the island are utterly opposed to the deal and for very good reason.  The Mercosur deal represents a sell-out of Irish farmers and their families.  It is devastating news for the rural economy and flies in the face of commitments made to tackle climate change.</p>  <p>  Irish beef is the best in the world and let there be no doubt about this.  Through no fault of their own, farmers and their families are under massive pressure.  There has been a sustained decline in beef prices over the last number of years and farmers are being fleeced by factories that do not pay a fair price for their cattle.  Farmers are already suffering because of Brexit and any prospect of a hard or chaotic Brexit will be utterly devastating for the sector.  In the middle of all of this, at a time when farm incomes are at disastrously low levels, the European Commission seeks to plough ahead with a deal that would cripple Irish agriculture by allowing tens of thousands of tonnes of cheap meat into the European Union and Ireland.  All of this makes absolutely no sense.  In fact, it is an insult to farmers, their families and everyone who relies on the beef industry in particular to make a living.</p>  <p>  It also makes no sense from an environmental perspective.  In fact, I would say it makes a mockery of the European Union's concerns surrounding climate change.  We all know the Amazon is being destroyed on a daily basis because of illegal logging and to make way for new cattle ranches.  This policy is supported by the new president of Brazil and undoubtedly it will continue and be accelerated if the deal is approved.  The D&aacute;il recently declared a climate emergency and the Government recently launched its climate action plan.  This deal and the Government's support for it renders both of these initiatives utterly meaningless.  The deal needs to be stopped.  That is what we need to do.  To this end, Sinn F&eacute;in has a motion coming before the D&aacute;il this afternoon that calls on the Government in no uncertain terms to stand up for Irish interests and to oppose the deal.  The motion can be the first meaningful step in defeating what is a bad deal for our farmers, our environment and our country.  I ask the Taoiseach to do the right thing and support the motion this afternoon when it comes before the House.</p></speech>

The best thing we can do for our beef industry and beef farmers, recognising their importance to the wider rural economy, is to ensure we secure a deal on Brexit by the end of October so the largest export market for our beef farmers remains open to them in a few months' time.  The vast majority of our food is exported from this island and our largest market is the UK.  This is the issue to which the Government, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, so many others and I are giving so much time because we know how much our rural economies and farmers will suffer if we end up in a no-deal scenario on 31 October.  The concerns that arise from Mercosur will pale into insignificance if we end up with no deal on 31 October.</p>  <p>  With regard to Mercosur, what the Deputy said is not correct.  There is no trade deal agreed.  After 20 years of negotiations led by various people along the way but on this occasion led by Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m of the ALDE group there is now a political agreement between the European Commission and Mercosur on a future trade deal.  There will be a two year process whereby that 17 page document will be turned into a legal agreement about this size.  It will then go to the trade Council, most likely for a vote under QMV.  As I have said before, if it is the case that the trade deal is not in Ireland's interest we will not hesitate to vote against it but we will need to see the full legal agreement and do a full economic and environmental assessment of it because while there is no doubt there are serious downsides in this for our beef industry there may also be upsides too, in the dairy sector, the drinks sector, for small and medium-sized enterprises, industry, manufacturing and lots of other parts of our economy.  Any responsible Government has to wait to see what the agreement is and then examine it in the round.</p>  <p>  No matter what happens, we will strive to ensure the interests of our beef farmers are protected, first by insisting that the agreement, if it goes through, requires South American countries to meet their obligations under the Paris accords, and it is really important they are tied into this; second by ensuring that any beef exported to the EU from South America meets the same food safety standards and traceability standards as we would expect from our beef farmers and beef industry; and third by making sure that compensatory mechanisms are put in place whereby other markets are opened up to our farmers, as has been the case already in Korea, Japan and Mexico and other places.  As the Deputy said, we produce the best beef in the world and when one produces the best beef in the world one can find a market for it and get a good price for it.  We need to make sure those markets are open to our farmers.</p></speech>

It makes no sense.  Nobody believes the Taoiseach when he gives us this line that he is conscious of the needs of the rural economy and farming families, when out of the other side of his mouth he states the deal needs to be assessed and tested.  It sounds like he is quite prepared to throw farming families under the bus if it suits the interests of bigger corporate interests who might wish to export into the large South American market.  That is how it sounds to me and how it sounds to the farmers at the gate.  What they need to hear from the Taoiseach is an unequivocal commitment to protect their livelihoods.  What consumers need to hear from the Taoiseach is an unequivocal commitment to protect standards and the quality of the meat that is consumed here.  We produce the best beef in the world.  Why in the name of God would you open up our market to substandard produce?</p><p>Beef from South America does not comply with the same food standards or traceability requirements.  The Taoiseach knows that.  The President of Brazil has as much interest in the Paris Agreement or environmental standards as the man in the moon.  The Amazon rainforest is known as the lungs of the world.  The Government is proposing to puncture the lungs of the world to allow cheap beef imports into the Irish market.  That is unforgivable.  If the Taoiseach and his Government care about farmers then they should support our motion.  That will be the real test and the real yardstick of his rhetoric.</p></speech>

Ensuring that we have the highest food safety standards and the highest traceability standards should apply to beef that is imported as well as to beef produced here.  We are not doing anything, however, for beef farmers, the beef industry or farm families if we just bury our heads in the sand.  We export 90% of the food we produce to other parts of the world.  Free trade is good for our food industry.   Our food industry is based on free trade.  We have to ensure, however, that competition is fair and that anybody competing with our farmers and our food producers meets the same food safety standards, the same environmental standards and the same traceability standards.  If that is done, if the playing field is fair, then as the best beef producers in the world we should be able to compete.  That is what we need to make sure happens.</p></speech>

The anger was palpable at a packed meeting held recently in Toomevara, County Tipperary.  People attending that meeting expressed their view that effectively nothing has changed in recent years.  They still feel as vulnerable as ever and that there are not enough garda&iacute; or resources, as well as not enough meaningful sanctions in place against those who repeatedly commit these types of heinous crimes.</p>  <p>  One of the related issues that emerged, however, was a clear sense that the legal aid system in this State is broken.  People in rural Ireland feel that the system is totally stacked against them.  Regarding costs, the amounts involved are truly staggering.  I will go further and state that the costs associated with civil and criminal legal aid are utterly obscene and unjustifiable.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, confirmed to me in a reply to a parliamentary question that more than &euro;605 million has been allocated for legal aid from 2011 to 2017.  That is an astonishing amount of money and demonstrates that absolutely nothing is being done to reduce the outlandish fees being paid to provide this service.  Information I have received shows that the cost of criminal and legal aid for each of the years from 2011 to 2017 has ranged from &euro;49 million to &euro;58 million.  That is a staggering amount of money. </p>  <p>  That was at a time when Garda stations were closed left, right and centre throughout the country.  It was also at a time when Garda overtime was drastically cut in Tipperary and when vehicles and other tools of the policing trade were not available to the Garda.  There were constant reviews of the resources available and constant cutbacks.  The average cost of civil legal aid during the same period shows that it never dropped below &euro;30 million per year.  Imagine what that amount of money, or even half of it, could do to support and resource members of our Garda, who do a tremendous job day and night, despite being under-resourced and understaffed.  Indeed, there was an increase of &euro;9 million in the costs incurred for legal aid from 2011 to 2017.  There has been a steady increase in that time and it is a nice little economy for certain people. </p>  <p>  The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, promised as far back as September 2016 that the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 was being reviewed.  She also stated that the Department was preparing legislation to update the law and introduce powers to secure contributions from defendants, introduce more rigorous means testing and implement stronger sanctions against abuses.  It is blatantly obvious that none of these things have come to pass.  There is no will to do that.  Instead, we are witnessing the fleecing of the nation's resources by a criminal element and the absolute abuse of the system.  Although designed to protect rights, that system is now radically undermining the safety of entire communities.  If we continue at this rate then the provision of legal aid will have cost us more than &euro;1 billion within a few years.  That will be at a time when the resources of the State will already be under significant pressure due to the full fallout from Brexit and the possible damage to the rural economy from the Mercosur deal.</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach, therefore, prioritise a full and immediate reform of the system in order that the costs can be contained?  More importantly, will he do that so the criminals who repeatedly terrorise rural communities do not feel as if they have a never-ending pot of legal resources to attack rural communities?</p></speech>

There are victims of crime, unfortunately, all over our State.  We should not see this as a rural versus urban issue.  We do have a serious issue with rural crime.  I represent an urban constituency, however, as do many people here, and I assure the Deputy that the threat of and fear of crime is as worrisome in west Dublin as in west Tipperary.  It is wrong, therefore, to characterise this issue in the context of a rural versus urban divide that does not exist when it comes to crime.  Sadly, crime levels are actually higher in urban areas than they are in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Turning to what is being done, the Government is investing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Garda numbers have now increased to 14,000 and that is the highest overall total for a long time.  We have also extended the operation of armed support units, ASUs, across all six Garda regions and have increased the budget of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.7 billion.  That is the highest Garda budget ever.  We are also implementing the recommendations of the O'Toole Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to ensure that we have a more modern and fit-for-purpose police service.  That implementation is co-ordinated by my Department and is under way and on track.  </p>  <p>  Turning to the matter of legal aid, the cost of that programme is very high.  I agree with the Deputy on that point.  We have to find a correct balance in this area.  On one hand, we need to protect the taxpayer from facing very high costs and having to pay very high legal fees for others while on the other hand, we also need to have a justice system that ensures that people have representation in court and get a fair trial.  We have seen instances in other countries where there have been court cases and criminal cases which have been very much stacked against the accused.  We must bear in mind that everyone in a democracy is innocent until proven guilty.  I do not know if the Deputy  has seen the film "If Beale Street Could Talk", but it gives an example of what happens in other countries where there is inequality in the courts and the accused is not given proper legal representation or is represented by a public defender, who may be somebody on a low salary or not of the same standard as the prosecution.  In a democracy and in a free country, the right to a fair trial is really important and that is not something I would want us to give up.  We could in particular see vulnerable people and communities and minority communities ending up getting an unfair outcome from courts if the system was stacked up against them.  I know it is a complicated area but it is an area where we need to tread carefully.  Everyone is innocent until proven guilty and everyone is entitled to fair representation in court.</p></speech>

I never suggested there was not crime in Dublin.  If we turn on the news any day of the week we can see how horrific the situation is in the city.  Ordinary members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however, will confirm that in Dublin they can get backup within minutes from another station or benefit from other resources.  In Carrick-on-Suir, however, it would be necessary to wait for two hours for assistance while it could be three hours in places like Ballyporeen or Toomevara.  That is the difference.  We do not have the numbers in those places.</p>  <p>  I never suggested that people were not innocent until proven guilty.  I ask the Taoiseach to be honest and to tackle the scourge of, the waste in and the abuse of the free legal aid system.  I of course believe in free legal aid but it should be a case of two strikes and then a person is out.  We had promises from the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald - she has now gone to Europe and I wish her well - that we would reform this system.  It has not been reformed, however.  Something is blocking the reform of this system.  It is a scandal to be able to go into any court any day of the week and see the carry on.  I am referring to what is happening outside on the steps as well as inside the court itself.  Marauding gangs are getting the best of lawyers while ordinary victims have to pay for legal representation and pay dearly.  They are not able to afford that and they have to cut their cloth according to their measure, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle told me.  </p>  <p>  The amount of money being spent on legal aid is ridiculous while people are being terrorised in their homes by these marauding gangs.  I ask the Taoiseach not to try to paint me as acting for rural Ireland and forgetting about the city.  I ask him as well not to try to paint me as stating that people are not entitled to legal aid.  They are of course.  The concept of being innocent until proven guilty is very important to me.</p><p>I know all about it and ask the Government to, please, deal with the situation.  Its members trot out figures about resources, but we just do not have them.  The Government must cut out the waste and tackle the fat cats who are getting the money.  It does not want to touch them at all, nor does any of the bigger parties.  That is where the rot is.</p></speech>

That is not a surprise.  Delegates from all over the world came to the recent Velo-city conference and could not believe how shocking the traffic management system in the city centre was.  On Monday the first part of the much heralded Cork sustainable transport system was shot down when Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted against a bus priority improvement measure on Wilton Road.  The first part of what was supposedly the new Luas line in Cork is now dead in the water.  We face gridlock costs of &euro;2 billion a year under the Government's transport policies.  The Government has 51 major national road and motorway projects on the go.  They are being built or planned, but not a single public transport project is at the same phase.  </p>  <p>  The EPA stated in June that, with existing measures and measures included in the Government's national development plan, transport emissions were due to rise by 11% by 2030.  We face fines of hundreds of millions of euro a year for the failure to cut them.  On 13 June the House voted on a motion that was moved by the Social Democrats and amended by the Green Party which called on the Government to "revise the NDP to ensure the achievement of the interim 2030 emissions reductions target and subsequently a net zero emissions economy by 2050".  The Taoiseach's party has been playing politics with it.  The handbags between him and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin last week concerned this issue.  The Taoiseach said Fianna F&aacute;il wanted to cut the roads programme.  Disappointedly, Fianna F&aacute;il replied by stating it had not voted in that way on 13 June and was just talking about overruns on the national children's hospital project, but it did vote in that way.  The House approved the motion to revise the national development plan to start to make it climate-ready and to start making a change.  </p>  <p>  The Government's climate action plan has nothing to state on transport, other than promising to turn every diesel or petrol car into an electric vehicle.  Every environmental expert of note says this is not good enough.  It will not work and will leave us stuck with gridlock and the inefficient and unsustainable system that is killing the economy. as well as our society.  The question is this.  What will it take for Fine Gael to admit that its treasured and much promoted Project Ireland 2040 and national development plan are not fit for purpose?  The Government cannot be taken seriously on climate change if it insists on sticking to every one of the road projects and not moving an inch to change the national development plan.  It has to change.  It has to go.  The people of this city are choking.  The people of Cork are now guaranteed gridlock for the next while because the Taoiseach's party will not support a public transport measure.  What is going to change?</p></speech>

Project Ireland 2040 is not just about climate action.  It is also about new schools, new sports facilities and more homes.  Climate action is really important, but other things like health and housing are important, too.  When people oppose Project Ireland 2040, they should be specific about what projects they oppose.  Is it the housing projects, the health projects, the education projects or the sports capital programme?</p></speech>

I disagree with him.  If road maintenance and restoration are excluded from project Ireland 2040, the split in new projects is actually two to one in favour of public transport over new road projects.  We need to retain and restore roads, particularly in rural Ireland.  The new road projects include din the plan are very much needed, for example, the N20 which connects Cork and Limerick as part of the Atlantic economic corridor.  Other projects are bypasses that are needed and for which people have been awaiting for a very long time.  I refer to places such as Ardee and Virginia.</p></speech>

A two-to-one split is about right.  I appreciate that Deputy Eamon Ryan sees things differently and would have a much smaller roads programme.  Looking at the projects, however, I know why they are included.  Another really important one is the outer ring road in Galway.  I do not think we should cancel the roads programme altogether, or reprofile or review it as others have suggested.</p>  <p>  On air quality, I live in this city, very near to the M50.  Believe me, air quality is something in which I have a real interest.  It is something we will need to tackle and work on.  It is not quite the case that the nitrous oxide limits have been breached, but they are heading there.  It is good that the EPA came out early and gave us that warning.  The Dublin local authorities will be required under European law to produce an action plan to deal with them.  Central government will support them, but I am conscious of the results of the local elections.  Generally, the Dublin local authorities are now governed by a coalition involving Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party. </p></speech>

A route via Cahir would save &euro;500 million which could be used to provide the public transport system Fine Gael is not providing in Limerick or Cork.  On Monday the party voted against such a system.</p>  <p>  The air quality issue in Dublin is exacerbated by the fact that the Government is widening every motorway approach road in Dublin to the M50 that is gridlocked.  That will only make the problem worse and do nothing to solve the transport problems of the city.  It will make them even more difficult, as the Government plans to remove front gardens and every tree in the city to cope with the model into w hich it has bought and the resulting ever-increasing traffic.  It is the same in just about every city or area at which one looks.  The Government is following an old-fashioned and sprawling road-based development model.  It claims in the national planning framework that it wants to go back to the core, but its transport policy is doing the exact opposite.  It is encouraging sprawling development that can never be sustainable.  That is not good for our society.  That is the reality of what is happening.  The reality is that 51 major national road and motorway projects are on the go, while not one single public transport project is being built or even in the planning system.  Fine Gael is voting against one in Cork and ignoring the air quality issue in Dublin.  Nothing is happening to promote cycling.  That is what is happening.  That is the reality.  A Green mandate will see it change.</p></speech>

Any reasonable person would be a little confused on hearing Deputy Eamon Ryan's contribution.  The democratically elected local councillors in Cork decided to vote against the bus project precisely because it involved taking away trees and parts of people's gardens.  The Deputy seems to think that is a reason to vote against BusConnects in Dublin, but it is not okay for people in Cork to vote against the project on Wilton Road for exactly the same reason.</p></speech>

The Deputy's party has a responsibility to act in that regard.</p></speech>

That is really important and it is happening.  A total of 17% of new vehicles bought this year are electric or hybrid.  That is not enough, but it is a lot better than it used to be and the number will continue to increase.  The Government is supporting it.  We also need to move away from diesel cars.  I appreciate that it may have been done in good faith, but a terrible policy error was made by the Green Party the last time it was in government when it encouraged people to move from petrol to diesel cars.  That is the main reason air quality has disimproved to such an extent.</p></speech>

This is in the context of the programme for Government.  The Minister said he would look at ways and mechanisms to do so.  That is a contrary position to the messages I heard from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, when I raised the matter during Leaders' Questions last week and from the Taoiseach also.  I refer to the matter in the context of climate change.  Last week when the Taoiseach met his colleagues at the European Council, they had extensive meetings, albeit on the question of nominations to fill various positions in the EU institutions.  What is surprising and worrying is the degree to which the European Union seems to have sold the pass on climate change.  The election of Mr. Bolsonaro as President of Brazil has ushered in a rapid and reckless acceleration of the deforestation of Amazonian rainforest which will have significant negative impacts on the climate.  With all of the rhetoric and plans in Europe, it is extraordinary that this was not a show-stopper for Mercosur.  This reckless deforestation, as evidenced by the media, is an incontrovertible fact and its aim is to make way for the beef that will find its way to Europe.  Areas of rainforest are being cut down at a rate of 1 ha per minute and the European Union is incentivising that behaviour.  The only way to disincentivise it is to tell leaders in South America, in particular the Brazilian leader, that EU Heads of State and Government say there will be no deal unless they stop what they are doing immediately.  Any talk of signing up to the Paris accord is nonsense.  The reality is much different.  Has the Taoiseach had that discussion with EU Heads of Government?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has described a hard Brexit as an ugly outcome and he is right.  We are all very well aware of the potential catastrophe that could visit our island in such a scenario.  We all agree that we cannot countenance an economic border on the island, that there can be no hardening of the Border and that the Good Friday Agreement must be protected, with our progress and peace.  Therefore, I am very troubled to hear that the T&aacute;naiste would even countenance the idea of checks on goods from the North to the South as it would fly in the face of our collective objectives.  I put the following direct question to the Taoiseach and would appreciate a very direct answer.  In the event that there is a crash, with no withdrawal agreement and no backstop, how will the Government ensure there is no economic border, no damage to the Good Friday Agreement and no damage to the progress we have made in the past 20 years?</p></speech>

We have negotiated a withdrawal agreement and a backstop and will continue to work towards its ratification.  However, I would not be telling the country and the House the truth if I said if we have no deal and the United Kingdom crashes out, I could somehow promise that we would not end up in a difficult situation and a scenario none of us wants.  That is why we have to secure a withdrawal agreement and ensure we will not end up in a no-deal scenario, but I cannot make a promise that is not true.</p></speech>

For most people reading the estimate published by the Government yesterday, the most stark and shocking figure in it was that between 50,000 and 55,000 jobs would be lost in the event that there was a hard Brexit.  It would be catastrophic for us.  One of the key lessons we learned from the economic collapse was that it is much easier to preserve jobs than to try to replace them.  The Taoiseach will remember the phrase Mario Draghi used which gave those of us in government at the time great heart, namely, that he would do whatever it took to preserve the euro currency.  My question is about the preservation of jobs.  Will the Government do whatever it takes to preserve jobs in the event that there is a hard Brexit?  Specifically, what level of funds has been identified for schemes to support businesses and workers through whatever difficulties will arise in the coming months and years?  Has the Government had preliminary talks with the trade union movement on altering work practices to preserve jobs, as happened in Germany during the crisis?  Now that the prospect of a hard Brexit is looming as a reality, what level of resources, in cash terms, will the Government deploy to ensure the 55,000 jobs will not be lost?</p></speech>

It is worthwhile making it clear that the same document highlights that we will still have over 2.1 million people at work in the economy.  Of course, as the Deputy said correctly, the loss of any job presents a great difficulty and problem for the person who loses it and his or her family.  Even though there are still high levels of employment within the economy, the Deputy is right that we have to mobilise all of our resources to keep people in work and ensure that, if citizens lose work, the loss will be temporary.  In budget 2020 we will outline the resources that will be available to achieve this.  There will be a combination of options.  We will use the surplus we are aiming to generate next year and, if it is not sufficient, I have already indicated that we would be willing to run a temporary deficit to respond to the very issue the Deputy has identified.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, Jigsaw decided to pull out of Clondalkin, where it was covering a huge area for young people, including Lucan and Palmerstown.  That decision was a huge mistake and Deputies Curran and &Oacute; Broin are saying that too.  Hundreds of young people will gather in Clondalkin tonight to protest against the decision that has been made by Jigsaw.  Young people want to know what provision will be made for mental health services in Dublin Mid-West if Jigsaw moves away from Clondalkin.</p></speech>

I refer to a letter from Mr. Hugh Ryan that was sent to the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government this morning about an illegal development being carried out on behalf of An Post which is moving from the square in Thurles to the shopping centre.  It got a warning letter on 30 May, but it is still continuing to carry out these works in breach of conditions Nos. 1, 8, 14 and 17, among many others.  There is health and safety and fire safety issues and lack of ambulance access: it is outrageous.  The Minister smirked at me when I raised this with him a week ago.  Will An Post be allowed to act as a cabal with big business?  I am told this shopping centre is owned by a fund and no one knows who they are.</p></speech>

There was a great development in recent days when planning permission was granted for Millstreet hospital.  Millstreet and Kanturk hospitals are both on the capital programme.

As we all know, the D&aacute;il will rise for the summer recess tomorrow.  I ask the same question again.  When will we have sight of the capital plan for 2019?  When will we have clarity and commitment in relation to capital projects in hospitals throughout the country?  Every time the estates section of the HSE is contacted, we get the same answer, which is that it cannot sign off on projects until it has sight of the capital plan.  It is beyond ridiculous that in July 2019, we have yet to see the HSE capital plan for 2019.</p></speech>

The non-publication of the plan does not, in itself, prevent capital projects from going ahead.  No capital plan at all was published last year, yet the Dunmore wing was built at University Hospital Waterford and new wings were built in hospitals in Limerick and Clonmel, to give three examples.  Those who are saying that the non-publication of a capital plan prevents projects from going ahead need to look out their windows and see the projects that have gone ahead.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Cassells, raised the question of the Dublin to Navan railway line in this Chamber last week.  There is a railway line in place between Navan and Kingscourt.  I ask the Taoiseach to work with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to commission a feasibility study.  I have been informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that this would be one of the easier projects it could do across the country because it owns the Navan to Kingscourt line, which means no compulsory purchase order would be needed to buy land.  It would be a fairly straightforward project if there was a commitment from the Government.</p></speech>

Some 27,476 people have been referred over for a second year.  Some 354 people have been referred over for a third year.  This means they are doing the same thing for a third year in succession.  In response to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection informed me that 51,548 of the 226,851 people who have been referred to these companies have commenced employment.  Just 6% of those who have been referred - 14,617 people in total - have been sustained in employment for a year or more.  I imagine that many of those people found employment independently of Turas Nua and Seetec, only for those companies to claim that they had assisted them in finding employment in order to get sustainment payments.  Will the Taoiseach recognise that this project, which has cost the State &euro;182 million to date, has been a complete failure?  Will he honour the mandate provided by this D&aacute;il when it supported a Sinn F&eacute;in motion in February that sought to stop referrals to Turas Nua and Seetec with immediate effect?  Will he ensure the referrals stop and this failed project is binned once and for all?</p></speech>

We see employment at a record high and unemployment at its lowest in over a decade.  This includes youth and long-term unemployment.  Part of the suite of policies that has made this possible are programmes such as JobPath, the work of the Intreo offices and local employment services.  If somebody cannot get a job, one does not stop trying to help him or her.  One keeps trying to help him or her and this may mean a second referral to JobPath, a local employment scheme, Intreo or a community employment scheme.  One keeps trying to help that person.

Despite that, there are serious issues, as the Taoiseach knows, up and down the country.  I received a response recently from the HSE to a parliamentary question.  I found out that there are 975 people on the waiting list for ear, nose and throat, ENT, outpatient services at Roscommon University Hospital.  Some of them go back to May 2019 while 310 go back to November 2016.  There are 645 people on the waiting list for routine services, some of whom go back to November 2015.  This will be four years in a couple of months.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that in respect of ENT services, it is very important that those outpatient clinics are looked after.  The management and staff at that hospital are doing a fantastic job and the hospital has many successes, which I acknowledge.  They tell me the problem concerns resources.  They do not have the resources.  Can the Taoiseach do anything for a hospital like that with such a waiting list in the ENT area?</p></speech>

In the most recent response I received, I was told that the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, brought proposals for a new transport support payment scheme to the Cabinet in May 2018.  They then withdrew it.  There has been no explanation.  They said they were going to come back with a revised proposal but, again, there was no timeframe.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that has not been acted upon.  This issue has been sitting in the Government's legislative programme for years.

Waterford City Council has submitted an application for funding to facilitate the North Quays development.  I know the ask is for significant State funding of &euro;105 million.  This is to fund the access road into the development, a new pedestrian bridge and moving the train station on to the new North Quays as a new platform.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, along with Deputy Butler and I, had a high-level meeting with the developers.  The difficulty is that all of these ducks must be lined up for this project to go ahead.  My understanding is that the council hoped that the entire envelope of money - &euro;105 million - would be delivered through the urban regeneration and development fund.  It now seems that the part relating to moving the train station may need to be funded from the Department or from a different source, which complicates and potentially slows down the process.  I asked the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government recently when we would get certainty with regard to the funding in terms of timescales and the next round of funding.  Can he give a commitment that all three elements of this in terms of infrastructural ask, including moving the train station, are supported by the Government and the funding will be delivered?</p></speech>

It is a very significant project.  If I recall correctly, under the urban regeneration and development fund, it received one of the largest allocations of funding under the first round of funding but it was just a first round.  There are subsequent rounds to come over the period of the fund - &euro;2 billion over ten years.  The project has a number of moving parts, as the Deputy outlined.  Funding has been given under this first phase for particular aspects of the project from the fund.  A delivery board is in place to drive that forward so I will consult with the local authority to see if there are any obstacles in the way at present, but there should be no obstacles with regard to the drawdown from the urban regeneration and development fund.</p></speech>

LNG is one of the options put forward to deal with energy security.  Having access to LNG supplies also has support within the EU as an item of strategic potential.  This issue is primarily for the planning authorities but the principle of LNG has a role in energy policy.</p></speech>

It is a place of great importance from an ecological, archaeological and cultural perspective.  It is a great place for local people in which to walk and enjoy as it is bordered by Kildare, Newbridge, Milltown, Athgarvan and Kilcullen.  Local people have a great respect for it.  For this and many other reasons, it should have the highest level of protection, while affording the opportunity for people, both locally and nationally, to enjoy its beautiful surroundings.  Ideally, I would like to see it become a national heritage site.  I was in touch with the Minister&rsquo;s office on this issue, but, sadly, it will not happen.  That does not mean, however, that I will not pursue it.  We could look for UNESCO world heritage status for the Curragh because it is an important focal point in County Kildare.</p><p>The Curragh has its own unique administrative arrangements enshrined in law in the Curragh of Kildare Act 1961.  My Bill is an amendment to that Act.  For several years there have been ongoing issues with illegal dumping and encampments on the Curragh.  They completely take away from its beauty for those who wish to use it daily.  After consultation with authorities, it was agreed that this was one possible way of helping to solve one of the particular problems.  The Bill proposes that anybody who wishes to occupy the Curragh, by having a vehicle, shelter, tent, caravan or other temporary or moveable structure, will have to apply to the Minister for Defence for a licence.

We adopted the new EU strategic agenda for the period 2019 to 2024, inclusive, in which Ireland&rsquo;s priorities are well reflected.  We also had an initial discussion on high level appointments to the EU institutions, a discussion which we concluded successfully on 2 July.  We had a substantial exchange on climate action in preparation for the UN climate action summit in September.  I emphasised the need for the European Union to show leadership in order that we could credibly encourage others to follow suit.  I also briefed leaders on Ireland&rsquo;s climate action plan.  We also discussed the multi-annual financial framework, which we hope can be finalised by the end of the year, the European semester, disinformation, as well as enlargement and the stabilisation and association process.</p>  <p>  On external relations, we discussed developments in Russia and eastern Ukraine, Turkish activities in Cyprus&rsquo; exclusive economic zone; the fifth anniversary of the downing of flight MH17, the eastern partnership, developments in Moldova, the situation in Libya, as well as relations with Morocco and, more generally, Africa. </p>  <p>  On the Friday we met in euro summit formation to discuss economic developments across the eurozone and the strengthening of Economic and Monetary Union.  We also had a brief discussion in Article 50 format about Brexit and reaffirmed our position that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, was not for renegotiation.  I had a good bilateral meeting with Michel Barnier on the Thursday morning before the European Council.  We noted the strong and consistent EU position on Brexit and agreed to stay in touch in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  In addition to participating in the formal discussions over the course of the two days, I engaged informally with many of my EU counterparts on the margins of the meetings, using the opportunity, as I always do, to promote Irish interests.</p>  <p>  I travelled to Luxembourg on Friday, 21 June, following the European Council.  I had a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel, at which we discussed the positive bilateral relations between Ireland and Luxembourg, issues on the European Council&rsquo;s agenda, as well as the growing co-operation between us on EU issues of mutual concern.</p>  <p>  At the headquarters of the European Investment Bank, EIB, I met the bank's president, Werner Hoyer, and its vice president, Andrew McDowell.  I was present for the signature of an EIB loan of &euro;350 million to the Dublin Airport Authority for the development of operations at Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  I also visited the European Court of Justice where I met the president of the court, Koen Lenaerts, as well as the Irish Judge and Advocate General at the Court of Justice and the Irish judges at the General Court.  We discussed the role of the court in upholding the European Union&rsquo;s treaties and laws, as well as the implications of Brexit for its work.</p></reply>

Has he spoken to European Commission President-designate Ursula von der Leyen since she was nominated to discuss her plans and proposals that she envisages pursuing in her role in the next five years?  The current nominee did not campaign for the position.  She was not involved in any of the <i>Spitzenkandidat</i>debates which were televised.  Many of us are unaware of her specific views on the policy platforms and issues she wants to highlight during her term in the next five years.</p><p>The Government has reappointed Phil Hogan for a second term as Commissioner.  It is reported that he is being tipped to be given the prestigious trade portfolio in the new Commission.  That would be an important and prominent position to hold, given the ongoing uncertainty about Brexit and the impact of the proposed Mercosur deal, for which, as agriculture Commissioner, Phil Hogan, had been advocating.  Has the Taoiseach raised with Ms von der Leyen the portfolio Mr. Hogan might be given?  Is there an agreement in that regard?  If so, will he share it with us?</p><p>The greatest challenge facing the next trade Commissioner will be negotiating a new trade deal with the United Kingdom post Brexit.  It will be the most significant issue for the European Union, especially for us.  There are thousands of farmers outside Leinster House protesting about Mercosur.  They are concerned about the beef industry specifically.  Likewise, there are other issues which will very much be on the next Commissioner&rsquo;s agenda.</p><p>On that deal and the commitment that was repeated again in the House last night to have comprehensive analysis done on its impact of, I specifically ask the Taoiseach if that overview and analysis will include specific inputs and involvement from the trade union movement on labour law and labour standards as well as involvement and input from environmental groups on climate change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000026#Y00200"><p>I welcome and acknowledge the apology the Taoiseach gave earlier and the withdrawal of remarks he made last week.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach did not respond to my question yesterday about Commissioner Hogan's highly irregular intervention during the local elections.  From what I can see, there is no precedent for a Commissioner to announce a politically important support scheme during an election, particularly when the full details are not available.  We would like the full details of that support package to be published as soon as possible.  Can we expect more of this co-ordination by Government with our Commissioner during future elections?</p>  <p>  More importantly, at the recent European Council meeting, the Taoiseach decided that Ireland should stand with Kaczyński in Poland and Orb&aacute;n in Hungary in seeking to block Frans Timmermans, MEP because of his tough stand in favour of core democratic values within the European Union.  It is a deeply sad situation that at no stage did the Taoiseach say that Ireland really wants the best person for the job.  The Taoiseach instead joined with those who threw a fit at the idea that one party might lose its grip on the Commission presidency.  Given that the EPP's vote has fallen from 39% to 24% since it gained the presidency of the Commission, and that it included Orb&aacute;n's votes in its claims for legitimacy, there is nothing to commend in this party-first approach.  It is sad that the Taoiseach did not speak out against the anti-Timmermans campaigning by actively illiberal and increasingly anti-democratic leaders.  If we do not call it out when these people are flexing their muscles, it does not send out a good signal for the future of the European Union and our basic values of freedom of speech, an independent judiciary and an independent media.  It is worrying when punches are pulled in these instances in terms of those who are advocating the undermining of those values.  It is the first time in the history of our membership of the European Union that Ireland has stood against a reasonable compromise on leadership positions.</p>  <p>  It is also reported that when Dr. von der Leyen was proposed as President, a series of leaders talked to her and received assurances before the vote.  Italy claims it was promised an economic portfolio and Hungary and Poland say they are reassured by her.  What assurance did the Taoiseach seek from Dr. von der Leyen before deciding to support her?  Can the Taoiseach indicate to us what meetings he has had with her, how often he has met her as a presumptive candidate and why does he believe she is a better appointment than the man whose nomination he helped to veto?</p></speech>

To take up the points raised by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, I would be interested to know the position taken by Ireland in respect of these negotiations.  When it became clear that Manfred Weber from the European People's Party would not succeed in becoming President of the European Commission, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron hammered out a deal at the G20 summit in Japan to make the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats candidate, Frans Timmermans, the President instead.  It is widely reported that the Taoiseach led the rebellion within the EPP against this deal.  His appointment was opposed by several eastern European states.  Can the Taoiseach outline his reasons for opposing Frans Timmermans?  Was he trying to promote the candidacy of Michel Barnier instead?  Have relations with Angela Merkel and the socialist group been damaged as a result of this?  We need all the friends we can get as the Brexit deadline approaches.  Will the EU still ensure that the rule of law is enforced under Article 7 proceedings in Poland and Hungary, now that Frans Timmermans has effectively been blocked by these eastern European countries?  Was Ireland right to side with these countries on this basis?  What are the implications of all this for the Spitzenkandidaten process following the outcome of this European Council meeting?</p></speech>

There are farmers outside today protesting against an EU plan to do a deal with another vile regime, that of Bolsonaro and the Mercosur countries.  With that in mind, I would like the Taoiseach to explain to me how we could in any way consider working with a regime that is accelerating a devastating programme of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.  The Amazon rainforest produces 20% of global oxygen, and in the last ten years alone, an area the size of Portugal has been cut down.  Bolsonaro is systematically dismantling the Brazilian environmental protection agency, he has called for an extermination of the indigenous people of the Amazon to be carried out on a similar scale to the extermination of the indigenous population in North America and he told a political opponent that she is not worthy of raping.  This guy is filthy.  How can we give favourable trade status to regimes such as this in order to then destroy beef farmers in this country, with the devastating consequences they are facing?  How is that in any way in tune with the progressive values the Taoiseach so often ascribes to the European Union?  What about the transport emissions that would be involved in massively expanding the sale of gas-guzzling German cars and pharmaceuticals in Brazil and Brazil in turn cutting down rainforests in order to send beef back here?  Does that not just make complete hypocrisy of the European Union's claim to be a progressive and environmentally-forward defender of human rights and so on?  Is it not just the purest hypocrisy?</p></speech>

This is something the European Union must do.  As we speak, we have a President of the United States of America who wants to tear up the Paris accord and who is talking about the United States not fulfilling its mandate in those targets.  It is important that the European Union is a leader in this and strives towards the highest targets that can possibly be agreed and met.</p>  <p>  I take a simple view that climate justice and social justice are flip sides of the same coin.  What we need to do first is set the most ambitious targets, which Europe has failed to do, and then we have to look at the real solutions, which are public housing of the highest standard, public transport of the highest standard and making sure that people have alternatives.  That is simply not the case today.  On the one hand the European Council is not in a position to agree targets that need to be met for a zero carbon economy across Europe, and on the other hand we have a trade deal with South America, which will accelerate the cutting down of rainforests and which undermines all the efforts made by Irish farmers to produce products such as beef to the highest quality, with traceability and the highest environmental standards.</p><p>While the Taoiseach says that it is not a deal yet and that there are protections built into the agreement, people do not believe it because they know what the view of the Brazilian Government is and its track record in this.</p> <p> The failure of the European Council to agree targets regarding zero carbon is serious.  Why is that the case?  When we see what is happening in the United States and the very negative approach by its president, why is the European Union not able to agree binding zero-carbon targets by 2050?</p></speech>

I understand the Dutch are particularly concerned about the issue of the Border in Ireland in the event of a hard Brexit in the context of Europe's frontier being open.  Is the commentary in the media regarding the Taoiseach's European and EPP contacts correct in this respect?  Have the Dutch given him a sense of what they would like to see if, unfortunately, a hard border emerges?</p>  <p>  It was welcome that yesterday the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was finally more forthcoming about what might unfold.  The Taoiseach needs to be more upfront with people in Ireland.  What discussions did he have on the side about the implications for the Border in Ireland?  We do not want to see a hard border but it would appear that the Dutch and others are very strong on maintaining the European border.  How does the Government propose to address this?</p>  <p>  When Viktor Orb&aacute;n's party, Fidesz, had its membership of the EPP suspended, the Taoiseach stood by him, in that he supported that group of countries when it came to making a decision on the potential presidency of Mr. Timmermans.  What is the Taoiseach's view at the moment of the Fidesz Government of Hungary led by Mr. Orb&aacute;n in respect of the vindication of human rights in Hungary and the implications of that for the wider European Union? </p></speech>

She very kindly mentioned that I am often quoted as being close to particular EU prime ministers, including Mr. Rutte.  I thank her for her comments.  Over the past two years I have put tremendous effort into building up personal relationships with all prime ministers in the European Union regardless of their political colour because I need them to be on our side when it comes to Brexit.  I have put a considerable amount of time and effort into that.  It does not matter which group they are from; I put the effort into it.</p>  <p>  She is not correct in suggesting that Mark Rutte is in the EPP; he is actually part of the liberal Renew Europe group.  Notwithstanding that, we have a very close relationship, as I do with other liberal prime ministers, such as Charles Michel and Xavier Bettel to give two other examples.  I have already built up a relationship with the new Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whom I know very well through the EPP and Sebastian Kurz, who I anticipate will return as Chancellor of Austria in the coming months.  I put a significant effort into that and their political family does not matter.  Ireland needs friends and allies at this time and I will make sure we have as many as we possibly can.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to commentary that the Dutch had a particular interest in the Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  I do not think that is correct.  I had a very long meeting in The Hague with Mark Rutte not too long ago and our objectives are shared, in terms of protecting the Single Market and the customs union which the Netherlands will also need to do at its ports.  Understandably the Dutch have a particular interest in that and also we will want to do the same in our country.</p>  <p>  I understand the comments the Deputies are making about the V4 countries, namely, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  Those four countries tend to work together in European Council summits and they are four countries that are under considerable pressure from the European Commission over the rule of law, democracy, academic freedom and so on.  I note that the focus of this Chamber is always on Hungary and its Prime Minister, Mr. Orb&aacute;n, whose party has been suspended from the EPP, but there are four countries in that group.  They work together and have similar issues with the European Commission.  They include the Government of Slovakia, which is part of the socialist group and has not been sanctioned or suspended in any way from that group.</p></speech>

It is important to say that she has not yet been ratified by the European Parliament - that procedure is yet to happen - nor has Commissioner Hogan for a second term.  I hope the MEPs from Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il will vote in favour of her election as President and for the re-nomination of Commissioner Hogan.</p>  <p>  I have not spoken to her since her nomination.  We are trying to schedule a phone call for this week or next week.  I am confident that she will stick to what she has said in the past, particularly about Brexit and the backstop.  I am confident that she will be in line with the political programme of the EPP, which is the one to which her party signed up.</p>  <p>  I will speak to her about the portfolio that she will assign to Commissioner Hogan.  There are 27 posts, or 28 as there will still be a UK Commissioner.  I have not sought or received any promises on them.  I know it is difficult for a small country to get an influential portfolio.  I will be working hard to ensure that our Commissioner gets an influential portfolio.</p>  <p>  I have not met Ursula van der Leyen personally, but the Ministers, Deputies Flanagan, Donohoe and Kehoe have, and they have very high regard for her.  She was personally recommended to me and to the European Council by Chancellor Merkel.</p>  <p>  On the EU-Mercosur agreement, there will be a detailed economic and environmental assessment, which will look at the impact on Irish jobs and business in particular.  A similar exercise was done for CETA, the agreement with Canada.  It will be headed up by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her Department.  We would very much welcome input from business, trade unions and environmental groups.</p>  <p>  The political agreement on Mercosur - it is a political agreement not a trade deal at this stage or a free trade agreement, FTA, to be absolutely accurate - links South American countries, including Brazil, into the Paris accords.  I would be strongly of the view that if they do not abide by those Paris accords on climate change over the next two years, the deal is dead in the water.</p>  <p>  I do not know if Commissioner Hogan's announcement on beef is unprecedented.  Perhaps it is, but I have not gone through that looking for precedents.</p>  <p>  Regarding the EU summit, it is important to point out that neither of the Spitzenkandidaten - neither Manfred Weber nor Frans Timmermans - was able to command a majority in the European Parliament or the European Council.  Neither was a compromise candidate in that sense.  Neither could command a majority in the European Parliament or the European Council.</p><p>Eleven countries did not support Mr. Timmermans' nomination of which only four came from the Visegrad Group, V4, countries.</p></speech>

Eleven countries did not want to support his nomination as President of the Commission, only four of which were V4 countries.  His defence of the rule of the law was not an issue for me or for Ireland.  I said that to him at our meeting.  I am sure that when he continues in his role as First Vice-President, he will continue to pursue those issues.  After a certain point, President Macron and Chancellor Merkel agreed that it would not be sensible to appoint a President of the Commission who did not have the support of so many countries, whether that be Manfred Weber or Frans Timmermans, so the compromise candidate, as nominated by President Macron and Chancellor Merkel, is Ursula von der Leyen and we were very happy to support her as the compromise candidate just as we would have been happy to support Michel Barnier if he had emerged as a compromise candidate.</p>  <p>  The Spitzenkandidaten system does need to be reviewed.  One thing that was evident in the debate was that the different groups had a different understanding of how it might work.  For some it was the candidate of the largest group, for others it was not necessarily that, but that groups could come together and find a new majority.  It could be looked at as the difference between a coalition and a confidence and supply arrangement.  Some take the view that it might make more sense to make the Spitzenkandidat the President of the Parliament rather than the Commission because these are parliamentary elections.  Others take the view that we should have transnational lists and should allow people around the European Union to vote for that list.  That would make more sense in selecting a Commission President.  </p></speech>

The plan contains more than 180 actions that Ireland needs to implement to meet our EU 2030 targets and achieve our longer-term low carbon emission objective. </p>  <p>  Delivering such an integrated set of actions and policies will require a deep level of collaboration across Government.  The approach adopted will closely follow the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee and will build on the what was learnt from the success of the Action Plan for Jobs. </p>  <p>  The climate action plan outlines significant new governance structures to ensure that climate policy is implemented.  These include: a five-year carbon budget and sectoral targets with a detailed plan of actions to deliver them; an independent climate action council to recommend the carbon budget and evaluate policy; strong accountability to an Oireachtas climate action committee; and carbon-proofing all Government decisions and major investments.  The governance structure also includes a climate action delivery board to be established within my Department to ensure delivery of the plan.  The delivery board will be jointly chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The membership will comprise Secretaries General from Departments responsible for the actions outlined in the plan. </p>  <p>  The first meeting of the board is due to take place on 16 July 2019.  The board will ensure co-ordinated, timely and effective implementation of the actions in the plan and hold each Department and public body accountable for its delivery and implementation.  The delivery board will also discuss and review strategic projects and areas of work in the plan.  It will prepare quarterly reports on delivery for the Government, which will be published.  It will also contribute to development of an annual update of the plan, starting in early 2020.  This will ensure that this plan is a living document, with new actions being added each year and which will take into account technological change as well.  This follows the successful approach which was core to delivering the Action Plan for Jobs.  My Department is also responsible for a small number of specific actions outlined in the plan and preparations are already under way to ensure these actions are delivered.</p></reply>

How, specifically, does he plan to hold other Departments to account?  He has talked about the new climate action delivery board which, we understand from his response, is to be jointly chaired by the Secretaries General of his Department and of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Who else will sit on that committee?  Will this House have any input into it?</p>  <p>  We are well past the point of questioning the need for an urgent response to climate change.  The question is how to do it quickly and, equally important, fairly.  A strong commitment to climate justice is required and that was under-emphasised in the climate action plan, specifically, under the Government's plan, high upfront costs for the retrofitting of people's homes, the purchase of electric vehicles, the roll-out of electric charging points and access to micro-generation of electricity, will impact on all households but immeasurably more on households that have meagre incomes.  In terms of a just implementation of the climate action plan, how specifically will the Taoiseach ensure that all households can bear the change that needs to be made now?  The ESRI's report on climate taxation illustrated that the twin goals of reducing emissions and alleviating economic inequalities can be achieved.  Is that the Taoiseach's objective and if so, how would he go about it?</p></speech>

I cite for instance the trade deal that he is talking about tweaking and making economic assessments of.  Climate change is an international problem, although the Taoiseach often frames it in Irish terms saying, "if we do this or that".  That is nonsense.  Climate change does not know borders.  If fossil fuels keep going into the air, the environment will choke.  That is a fact.  Unless the Taoiseach has a different view from the scientists, that is indisputable and there is no point in arguing it.  How does that fact tally with a massive expansion of trade in cars going to Latin America?  Aside from cutting down the rainforest, beef will come from Brazil to Europe and cars will go from Europe to Brazil.  That will massively increase emissions.  How can we take the Taoiseach or Europe seriously when they are doing trade deals to massively increase trade in areas where we should not be doing it, if we care about the climate.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the Taoiseach states the climate emergency measures Bill will make no difference to our emissions.  I want the Taoiseach to answer my next question with a straight face: does he honestly believe that the scientists are wrong when they say that to deal with climate change, 80% of known reserves - never mind reserves we do not know about - have to stay in the ground?  Are they right or wrong?  If they are right, is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that we could discover gas and oil off the coast of Ireland and that it would just stay in the ground?  Is he suggesting that we would issue licences to explore for it but it will not be burnt and will not add to the overall quantum of choking emissions in the global environment, which are leading us towards a climate disaster?  Does he expect anybody to take him seriously when he makes arguments like that?</p></speech>

Does he have an integrated climate action plan which would address the issue of NO<sub>2</sub>pollution in Dublin in particular, and in heavily trafficked areas of the city?  I draw to his attention the report by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which shows that emissions at the testing station in Phoenix Park have been above the recommended level.  So also have the emissions in Blanchardstown.  I mention them as places the Taoiseach would know well, because they are in our constituency.</p><p>The Government is also presiding over a regime of smoky coal. </p><p>It does not require a great deal of political courage to end smoky coal because it is killing people.  The Taoiseach is a doctor.  He knows the number of children suffering from asthma and other respiratory diseases.  Together with poor housing conditions, the use of smoky coal means that significant numbers of children and older adults suffer.  The health service is trying, not very successfully, to deal with the high prevalence of asthma among the very young and very old.  I would love to see a joined-up plan that goes after those issues we can address relatively quickly and that would improve people's quality of life, as well as a broader, larger plan.  Let us think of the pall of smoke sitting over Enniscorthy while the Government does nothing. </p></speech>

The reply was that of 6,573 vehicles registered under the State-owned emergency vehicles and rescue vehicles tax classification, only 13 were registered as electric.  That says it all.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, recently ordered 200 diesel buses.  Nine hybrid buses are on trial in Dublin.  I raised with the Taoiseach some time ago the need to ban smoky coal, which Professor Sodeau in Cork has said is making Enniscorthy like the New Delhi of Ireland.  It speaks to a lack of urgent co-ordination between Departments to deal with climate change.</p>  <p>  I was a member of a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change when I was in government, even though I was in foreign affairs.  Cross-departmental Cabinet sub-committees matter, because behind each Minister there is a set of officials, and people have to face one another and be accountable for the respective measures in each Department, whether it be that of transport, agriculture or whatever.  The Taoiseach has set his face against Cabinet sub-committees and I think his governance model is wrong.  That is reflected in health, where there has been only one sub-committee meeting in six months and the health service is in a deep crisis.  The housing issue has not been resolved.  The Taoiseach has now proposed that the Secretaries General of his Department and of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will be essentially without officials.  It seems the governance model the Taoiseach prefers is a Minister-less model.  It is no wonder that Ministers are detached from the operational details of what goes on around them, and from implementing and delivering commitments and actions.</p>  <p>  Most people in the industry and most people I talk to say the 100,000 electric vehicle target is just not obtainable.  There is no point producing plans if the Government tells us a dramatically disproportionate number of such vehicles will come on stream at the latter end of the plan.  Circumstances have to change very quickly on that front for that to take place.</p></speech>

People want to embrace climate action and climate change.  The vast majority see it as an exciting prospect that there would be a just transition to a zero-carbon economy but they are not fools.  As I said earlier, they know that to achieve that, there has to be a clear link between social justice, delivering for citizens, delivering a fair economy and society, and a just transition to climate justice and zero-carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  We need to know, and people need to understand, that houses will be built for people to the highest standards.  They need to see investment in public transport and, as Deputy Howlin noted, the funding to ensure that electric cars are cheaper and that the infrastructure is there to make the transition happen.  If people do not have alternatives, carbon emissions will not be reduced.  The Government can talk about carbon taxes, which I acknowledge is only one element of its plan, but people need alternatives, yet all they see coming are punitive measures rather than investment where it needs to be, namely, in public housing, retrofitting people's homes where energy ratings are not what they should be and public transport.</p>  <p>  There is no public transport in large parts of rural Ireland.  Under the Taoiseach's watch, in some rural towns and villages that had connectivity with Dublin, Expressway bus routes were axed because the State was not prepared to subsidise Bus &Eacute;ireann and the bus routes.  The Government needs to understand that it not only needs to get people excited about the prospect of climate justice but that getting them to embrace it, live it and deliver it means the State has an obligation to deliver.  Unfortunately, even if a 2% per annum reduction in carbon emissions is achieved by 2030, as is the target in the Government's published action plan, we will still be 10% behind.  There is a great deal of work to be done and much to catch up on.</p></speech>

They worked together on that, largely because they wanted to see a roadmap as to how it could be achieved, and they were not willing to accept the view that carbon sequestration and carbon storage technologies will be developed in adequate time, although we will continue to press them on it.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Howlin's questions about how we hold other governments and bodies to account to implement the plan-----</p></speech>

As well as that, a Cabinet sub-committee deals with climate action and the delivery board will report to us.  There are some robust structures in that regard.  I anticipate that the sub-committee will meet at least quarterly.</p>  <p>  On climate justice, Deputy Howlin referred to the ESRI report on carbon tax and how, if it is done properly, it can be progressive.  It is a very good report and it shows how the use of the dividend model, in particular, can be socially progressive and reduce emissions.  The ESRI estimates that carbon tax could reduce emissions by 1% or 2% per year.  There are other ways to achieve climate justice, not least by making sure that workers in old industries get decent redundancy packages or retraining packages, and means-tested grants, such as those that exist already, including the warmer homes scheme.</p>  <p>  We need to be honest with people when we talk about climate change.  It is estimated that it would cost approximately &euro;50 billion to insulate all the homes in Ireland and probably &euro;30 billion or &euro;40 billion to replace all existing vehicles with electric vehicles.  No Government, of any hue, would be able to find that kind of money.  The Government can help but will not be in a position to fund the insulation of every home or to replace everyone's car, and we need to be honest about that with people.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me if I am guilty of climate hypocrisy.  I do not accept that charge and I suggest that the reverse might be the case, given that the Deputy supports a total ban on exploration in Irish waters but opposes increases in the carbon tax.  We know the science of this.  It tells us a total ban on exploration in Irish waters will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions next year, the year after or the year after that-----</p></speech>

The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, raised issues about the level of nitrogen dioxide in Dublin's air, which hit the newspapers and other media yesterday.  We are in danger, if we have not done so already, of breaching European Union limits on air pollution in Dublin.  This has particular consequences for the health and well-being of people who live in the capital, particularly those with asthma or other respiratory diseases who are far more susceptible to a decrease in air quality.  Of course, people know this anyway and did not need the EPA to come up with a report to tell us the air quality in Dublin is poor.  I also wish to address the Government's rather poor response to these findings.</p>  <p>  I live in Knocklyon which is on the M50 corridor.  Today is a day of still air and if one goes up the Dublin Mountains from April or May onwards on a still day, one can see the entire line and curve of the M50 as it stretches from Wicklow to Fingal and beyond.  On a day like today, one would see a heavy brown pallor of smoke approximately 200 feet above the M50.  It is there constantly but we tend to only see it on clear days.  Nothing has been done to address that pallor, which has been there for the past decade.</p><p>We must thank the EPA for undertaking a degree of air monitoring.  The M50 is not the only area it mentioned, but it is one which it indicated was approaching, equal to or above the nitrogen oxide levels acceptable.  So too are areas around the port tunnel in the city, the quays and Heuston Station where the levels at Dr. Steeven's Hospital appear to be the highest.</p> <p> We must have some leadership from the Government on this issue, as it is a problem that will not go away.  The level of car ownership is increasing.  The Government's response is that the pollutants in the city are mainly diesel vehicles, cars, trucks and buses and, therefore, the answer is BusConnects, as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said yesterday.  The BusConnects project is a year old, yet nothing has happened.  By the time it is finished - if it is ever completed; much of it, including the infrastructure, will never see the light of day - it will be 2027 or 2030.  We need some indication that the Government will not be reactive on issues such as air quality but proactive.  </p> <p> The answer to chronic emissions is dealing with the vehicles that create them.  It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that to improve air quality in and around the city, we will have to reduce the number of polluting vehicles.  That will take courage, but someone will have to do it because the only way to clean the air is to remove the vehicles that are polluting it.  The answer others on this side of the House and I keep getting is the solution is Project 2040, BusConnects and e-cars by 2030.  There will be a reckoning for the Government on its performance in dealing with this issue.  At the very least, we are calling for air monitoring installations to be set up immediately in all parts of the city and other urban areas in order that we can capture the level of its quality, but that is only part of the story.  Dramatic action must be taken.  That will require leadership; leadership will require bringing people along, identifying the challenges and immediate, medium and long-term solutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000032#KK00200"><p>Any threat to public health is a matter of concern for the Department of Health.  The recently published 2019 report of the Environmental Protection Agency on urban environmental Indicators which looks at nitrogen dioxide levels in Dublin does give cause for concern.  Nitrogen dioxide, NO<sub>2</sub>, is an air pollutant associated with urban areas.  It is strongly linked with traffic emissions.  High levels of NO<sub>2</sub>can have a detrimental effect on public health, including an increased prevalence of diseases such as asthma.  Ireland has some of the highest rates of asthma and cystic fibrosis in the world, as well as high rates of other respiratory conditions.  This, in turn, can place an additional burden on health services, with increased numbers of GP visits and hospitalisations.  It can also have an impact on the economy in work days lost.  While everyone needs good air quality, people with underlying respiratory disease are more vulnerable to health impacts when air quality deteriorates.</p><p>The findings in the EPA's report present an early warning of potential exceedances of EU limit values in certain areas of Dublin.  The highest levels of NO<sub>2</sub>occur at locations where traffic levels are heavier.  However, we can draw some comfort from the report&rsquo;s finding that levels of NO<sub>2</sub>are well within the recommended EU limits in many residential areas in Dublin away from busy roads.</p><p>It is clear from the findings in the report that long-term exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub>is a cause of concern for people&rsquo;s health.  I agree that action needs to be taken.  It requires a whole-of-government approach.  In that regard, I am confident that implementation of the Government&rsquo;s recently published climate action plan will have benefits for air quality.</p><p>Whereas the Department of Health is tasked with maintaining public health, other Departments and agencies such as the local authorities have significant roles to play.  The Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment has lead responsibility for policy and legislation on air quality.  Air quality is a key determinant of health identified by the Healthy Ireland framework for the period 2013 to 2025 and one of 31 indicators included in the Healthy Ireland outcomes framework.  The factors that contribute to air quality are complex and inter-related.  They will, therefore, will require an inter-sectoral and co-ordinated response to address them.  Initiatives to reduce pollutants significantly will require significant inter-sectoral collaboration.  The Government&rsquo;s first national clean air strategy is under development by the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment which the Minister anticipates will consider key pollution sources such as transport and its links with increased levels of NO<sub>2</sub>.  The strategy is expected to lead the way on policy change to improve the air that we breathe. </p><p>Improved data collection is very important in ensuring we will not breach EU limits for NO<sub>2</sub>.  The EPA, by way of improving the availability of real-time air quality data for the public, is setting up new permanent monitoring stations in Dublin in partnership with Dublin City Council and Trinity College Dublin.  They include locations in Dublin identified in the report as black spots with the highest levels of  NO<sub>2</sub>.  I understand that, if further monitoring confirms the EU limit values of  NO<sub>2</sub>have been exceeded, the local authorities in Dublin will be legally required to prepare air quality action plans to address the causes and provide solutions in the affected areas.</p></speech>

The response states: "We can draw some comfort from the report&rsquo;s finding that levels of  NO2 are well within the recommended EU limits in many residential areas in Dublin away from busy roads."  The M50 runs through my constituency, in areas such as Kingswood in Tallaght, Oldbawn, Templeogue, Greenhills, Walkinstown, Knockline and Ballycullen, out into the constituency of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in areas such as Ballinteer, Dundrum and Marley Park.  That there are areas not covered by the report is of little comfort to me.</p>  <p>  I am very taken by the fourth paragraph in the response.  There is a sentence which runs for ten words, five of which have five syllables: "Initiatives to significantly reduce pollutants will require significant inter-sectoral collaboration."  We know that; the fact is that nothing is happening.  People on the south side of Dublin know all about air quality, dating back ten years.  The answer also states improved data collection is very important.  We also know that, as the EPA has told us about it.  </p>  <p>  The project between Dublin City Council and Trinity College Dublin was mentioned.  It will affect the city, but what about South Dublin County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council through the areas of which the M50 runs?  </p>  <p>  The response states, "if further monitoring confirms that the EU limit values of  NO2 have been exceeded, the local authorities in Dublin will be legally required to prepare air quality action plans..."  Why, therefore, are we waiting?  It is inevitable that levels will increase.  Car levels are increasing and any efforts at reduced emission or volume of cars on the road has not kicked in at all.  Why are we waiting?  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment why we should wait for the EPA to produce a further report stating we have breached EU guidelines and recommended limits in certain areas?  We should have air monitoring, but that will only identify the problem areas where the Minister and the Government will need to come up with a range of immediate, medium and long-term actions to deal with air quality in Dublin which is disimproving.</p></speech>

There were not as many cars then and the improvements in air quality have been eaten into by increased car use.  One of the inter-sectoral actions in the climate action plan involves the increased use of electric and hybrid vehicles which will help to immediately reduce emissions, something that will happen if buses were run on electricity or biofuels.  I agree with the Deputy.</p><p>If local authorities are informed and forewarned of the possibility it would be up to the local authorities as well and not just central government.  It is the role of the Government and the EPA as an agency to notify them and put them on notice.  If it is the case that it is likely that they will breach then they should have monitoring in place, particularly along the busy route the Deputy mentioned, which also stretches into north Wicklow at the M11 and M50 interchange.</p> <p> It is something we need to be aware of and cognisant of.  Various initiatives that will help drive down the amount of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere will help in the long term.  It is never too early to start and we should have an immediate joined-up collaborative approach.</p></speech>

It is an outrage.  There are four Ministers of State and one Minister at the Department of Health and not one of them could be here to take this issue.  Topical Issue matters are not selected easily and it is thanks to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle this has been selected.  It beggars belief that the Government would send in the Minister of State with a script and fob us off.  For a long time, I accepted the bona fides of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, but they are quite useless now.  Goodwill gestures and telling us he is interested are no good to us any more.  He is doing nothing about the situation in Tipperary.  We have not had one long-stay bed in Tipperary since the so-called A Vision for Change was ushered in by the former Minister of State, John Moloney, of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Then we had Kathleen Lynch and now it is three years out of date and we still have no places.  It is just not funny any more.</p>  <p>  Recently, I received a reply to a parliamentary question from the HSE's head of estates, Mr. Jim Curran, who confirmed to me that the new design for a proposed upgrade to the Grenville mental health crisis house in Clonmel is undergoing a review.  This is not even happening because funding has yet to be confirmed under the HSE's capital plan for 2019.  Are all the Ministers in hiding?  We still do not have the 2019 HSE capital plan.  The Ministers are hiding because they have made such a bags and unholy mess of the children's hospital that every other project is suffering as a result.  This is confirmation of it.  We badly need mental health support, crisis nurses and other staff to deal with people in Tipperary.  Kilkenny is full to the brim.  It cannot keep us there.  The same is true for the people of north Tipperary who must go to Ennis or Limerick.  This is a crisis of high proportions.  Fr. Michael Twomey came here and met the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  We had a committee in south Tipperary to save our hospital and now we are dealing with this also.  There are groups such as C-saw, Taxi Watch and the River Suir Suicide Watch out night and day patrolling.  There is an epidemic of drug dealing in Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Tipperary town and many other towns.  Every town and village has a crisis with drugs and there is nobody to deal with it.</p>  <p>  CAMHS, with regard to children trying to access it, is in utter disarray.  Recently, I received two separate calls from parents whose children are attending CAMHS with severe social anxiety and other mental health issues.  These children have been referred to the early intervention and disability services team for assessment of needs but the families have been told not to expect one for 12 to 18 months.  Imagine this.  The Minister of State should be ashamed to be part of a Government that deals with vulnerable people in this way.  These children were due to start secondary school in September but they have no services.  Even the fact they have received urgent referrals from CAMHS should be sufficient to ensure the children are seen but that is not sufficient.  What do we have to do?  We have countless suicides and a mental health epidemic but nothing is happening with the Government.  Its members should be ashamed of their lives to send back replies when no Minister would come in to deal with it.  They can run but they cannot hide, and they cannot hide from the people of Tipperary.  This is a crisis epidemic and people are being left vulnerable and sadly short of services for their loved ones.</p></speech>

This in turn will allow for continued improvements to all aspects of mental health care across the nine HSE Community Healthcare Organisations, including CHO3 and CHO5, which incorporate County Tipperary.</p>  <p>  One of the strategic priorities for mental health in the HSE's national service plan for 2019 is to deliver timely, clinically effective and standardised safe mental health services in adherence to statutory requirements.  The provision of acute inpatient care to the adult population of north Tipperary, which is in CHO3, is provided between the acute unit in University Hospital Limerick, which has 50 beds, and the acute psychiatric unit in Ennis, which has 39 beds.  The 44-bed department of psychiatry based at St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny is the designated approved centre for acute inpatient services for south Tipperary, which is in CHO5.  This enables all acute inpatient admissions for this CHO area to be managed at a single site.</p>  <p>  Referrals to St. Luke&rsquo;s are through a consultant psychiatrist who makes the clinical decision to admit based on the level of acute presentation or need.  In addition to the department of psychiatry, there is a dedicated psychiatric liaison team operating from the emergency department in St. Luke&rsquo;s.  All service users presenting to the emergency department who require psychiatric assessment will receive that assessment within agreed timeframes, in line with relevant guidelines.  Onward referral pathways are agreed with all service users upon completion of psychiatric assessment in the emergency department.  Pathways can include admission to an acute unit, referral to a relevant community mental health service team or referral back to a GP.  There is a range of other mental health services for adults in Tipperary.  These include psychiatry of old age teams, non-acute beds, day hospitals and day centres.  In addition, there are community mental health teams and high, medium and low support community residences.</p>  <p>  In relation to those under 18, three CAMHS teams operate in Tipperary, with one in north Tipperary and two in south Tipperary.  The CAMHS acute units at &Eacute;ist Linn in Cork and Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway, which has a total of 42 beds, serve the Tipperary catchment area.  The new permanent crisis house to replace Glenville House is included in the HSE&rsquo;s capital programme for 2019 and is at the tendering phase.  The Government is also funding a new Jigsaw service for the youth of Tipperary.  A plan is now being put in place by Jigsaw with the aim of opening the new service in the early part of 2020.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is very aware of the challenges facing the mental health services in Tipperary.  He has met Oireachtas members and various local representatives to discuss current and future provision of mental health services in Tipperary, on several occasions, most recently on 3 July 2019.</p></speech>

I have a reply to a parliamentary question from the head of procurement, Mr. Jim Curran, who confirmed to me that while the new design for a proposed upgrade is undergoing a review the tender process, the project cannot proceed because funding has yet to be confirmed under the HSE's capital plan for 2019.  Is the Minister of State telling me that since this morning the capital plan has been approved?</p><p>It was not approved this afternoon during Leaders' Questions.  I will not accept mistruths and baloney from any Minister of State but especially from someone who is reading a reply on behalf of someone else's Minister.  What the Minister of State read as part of that reply would be a sick joke if it was not so serious.  He stated: "One of the strategic priorities for mental health in the HSE national service plan for 2019 is to deliver" [wait for it] "timely, clinically effective and standardised safe mental health services in adherence to statutory requirements".  It is not delivered, timely, clinical, effective or standardised.  </p> <p> We have nothing in south Tipperary.  It is an appalling vista and there is nothing but a skeleton service.  We could not even be given a room in South Tipperary General Hospital where people could go when they have a psychotic attack.  Having such a facility would mean that people could be brought to a quieter place rather than be left in an overcrowded and overburdened emergency department.  That is a disgrace.  I want the Minister of State to withdraw his reply because the service plan was not agreed this afternoon during Leaders' Questions.  Unless it was agreed and published over lunch today, he is telling mistruths.  </p> <p> I will not accept that from him or anybody else.  I have a reply to a parliamentary question here.  The Minister of State thinks that he can peddle as many untruths as he can get away.  He will not, however, get away with that in Tipperary.  He has no place to hide.  It is disgusting and no wonder none of the five Ministers or Ministers of State with responsibility for health would come into the House.  It is a downright disgrace on the second last day before the summer holidays for the Government to think that it will get away with treating the people of Tipperary, and especially those who have mental health issues, this way.  It is a total abdication of responsibility and the Minister of State does not deserve to be in government.  He deserves to be out milking the cows or someplace else on his farm but not giving that kind of diatribe to me and to sick people in Tipperary.  I will not accept that.  I want the Minister of State to withdraw what he stated.  The HSE strategy has not been announced and part of the Minister of State's reply stated that it is.</p></speech>

There have been more than 20 deaths by suicide, at least, in the Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot area.  Grieving communities and families who are distraught are left behind after those deaths.  They are reaching out and crying out for support to help stop this epidemic.  Another three young women died in the past fortnight or so.  People in those communities are asking the questions we all do.  How can we help?  How can we stop this happening?  What is causing it?  Why is it that in this area in particular there is a different profile for those who have died by suicide compared to that in other areas?  More than half of those who have died by suicide have been young women.  They are often women with children and they are dying violent deaths.</p>  <p>   I appeal to the Minister of State, and in particular to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who has special responsibility for mental health, as well as to his other colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who lives in the constituency to which I am referring and knows the community, or should know the community.  She has responsibility for the drugs services.   We need the immediate setting up of a multi-agency task force.  It does not have to be a new task force.  The existing drugs task force can be utilised.  It needs to be resourced and funded, however.  That task force needs to be able to deliver the services it is trying and struggling to deliver.  </p>  <p>  I refer to the services delivered by Ballyfermot STAR and FamiliBase in particular.  Those organisations have reached out well beyond their resources to try to help with issues connected with drugs and, in this case, with suicide.  Regrettably, many of those who have died by suicide are addicted to or dabbling in drugs.  Some of those people have been linked to services such as Ballyfermot STAR and FamiliBase, but those organisations are grappling against the odds.  They have the support of other agencies in the area but they do not have the resources to provide a full community-led response.  They also do not have the resources to provide a full 24-hour service in the area or to tackle the increase in polydrug use, the re-emergence of cocaine and, scarily, the use of crack cocaine in the community.  All of those addictions are feeding into this epidemic.  This is not just about polydrug use or drug use because other factors play a role in the tragic decisions that these young people have taken.  </p>  <p>  The community is scarred, in mourning and reaching out.  There are some simple things that can be done.  It is not all about money; it is about access to resources and trying to ensure that we address this as a society but also as a community and from the bottom up.  SafeTALK and STORM training should be rolled out in as many schools and sports clubs to as many people as possible.  That is so we can help and play our role in identifying people in distress, assist them and, hopefully, help to prevent them from taking tragic decisions similar to those that have affected our community in recent weeks.</p></speech>

Before I read out the prepared note, this is an issue in which I have a personal interest.  I think the Deputy knows that.  When I read out the note, therefore, I agree with what is being stated and I am not just reading.  It is important that I state that on a personal level.  It is not the case that because we are in separate Departments that we do not have empathy with issues such as this.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Any loss of life to suicide is a tragedy, and my deepest condolences go out to the families and friends affected by suicide.  Every suicide affects not just family and friends, but the community itself.  It is important to ensure that strong supports are in place to help family, friends and the community to deal with this tragedy.  I understand that the HSE, as recently as Monday this week, met locals in the Ballyfermot area who had expressed concern.  It was agreed to provide additional support people in the area whom it was felt they needed to link in with mental health services.</p>  <p>  Tackling suicide in all areas of Ireland is a priority for the Government.  Connecting for life, CFL, is Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide and will run until 2020.  Reducing suicide requires a whole-of-Government approach, and in this regard, a cross-sectoral steering group was established to assist the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, in implementing CFL.  The NOSP is part of the HSE and was specifically established to co-ordinate suicide prevention efforts around the country and to implement CFL.  To support the NOSP, funding has been increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of &euro;12 million.   An additional &euro;2.75 million was provided in 2015 for additional resource officers for suicide prevention and for priority actions under connecting for life.</p>  <p>  Nationwide, the trend over the past number of years has been a reduction in the number of suicides.  The work of the NOSP has helped to reduce that number from 495 in 2010 to 352 in 2018.  The 2018 figures are provisional, and by their nature are subject to change, so they should be interpreted with caution at this time.  A key part of the CFL strategy is the development of local CFL plans.  All 17 of these plans have been launched, including the CFL Dublin South Suicide Prevention Action Plan 2018-2020, which was launched in February 2018.</p>  <p>  In 2017, extensive consultation took place to develop this plan.  This consultation process helped to identify key risks regarding suicide in the Dublin south area and associated service challenges.  The action plan was developed in response to these identified risks and in line with the national CFL framework.</p><p>Implementation of the plan is being driven by one of three resource officers for suicide prevention across south Dublin, Kildare and west Wicklow.  The plan, Connecting for Life - Dublin South, details 64 actions that are currently being implemented in the area with the aim of reducing the rate of suicide in south Dublin in line with national targets.</p> <p> Throughout south Dublin there are several services targeted at the promotion of positive mental health and at addressing the needs of those experiencing mental health difficulties.

I do not believe any of us has ownership of this issue.  It is a pity that we have to come here to address it but it is has reached epidemic proportions in some of our communities.  I acknowledge what the Minister of State has said about the fall in numbers.  Any decrease in the number of suicides is to be welcomed.  However, it may be the case that suicide is becoming more concentrated in certain areas or certain cohorts of communities.  The community for which I am appealing for extra supports is that in Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard.  I acknowledge that the HSE has been active this week.  There have been several interventions by both the local drugs services and other services, as well as by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There have been several meetings and there will be another tomorrow night.  That reflects the scale of the issue.  I hope to be at the meeting in the civic centre tomorrow evening.</p>  <p>  However, meetings by themselves can only do so much.  We will not get an instantaneous answer or sort this out overnight.  That is why I appealed to the Minister of State to ensure that we roll out the SafeTALK and skills training on risk, STORM, components of the Connecting for Life programme as extensively as possible.  We must also start to fund some of the agencies doing this work so they can properly carry out the work they need to do.  I refer in particular to those which fall under the remit of the drug and alcohol task forces, which have not seen any increase in funding sine 2008 despite facing additional workloads and a role in tackling the issue. </p>  <p>  There is a network of active groups.  I ask the Minister of State to pass on to the Ministers of State at the Department of Health, Deputies Catherine Byrne and Jim Daly, an invitation to come to the area to meet these groups.  We must collectively take the approach upon which everybody agrees and work together to lift this blight from our communities.</p></speech>

Suicide is a challenging issue, especially where we use the phrase "black spots".  The numbers have been stubbornly high.  Bringing them down and building resilience are challenging tasks.  The HSE is funding partner agencies in south Dublin including Candle Community Trust, Aware, BeLonG To, Mental Health Ireland, Pieta House, Samaritans Ireland and Suicide or Survive.</p>  <p>  The resource officer for suicide prevention in the area is also involved with mental health promotion and training at local level.  I do not have last year's figures to hand but in 2017, more than 1,000 individuals working or living in the south Dublin area were trained through programmes to enhance the community's capacity to respond to suicide and self-harm.  They have been educated to be alert to the signals and to intervene and intercept incidences.  That sounds like a bad word, but ultimately that is what we are trying to do in cases where people do not make a phone call to one of those agencies.  Through these programmes people are empowered and trained to identify signals.</p>  <p>  A range of measures is in place.  There is no doubt that it is an ongoing issue which needs to be resourced.  The Deputy mentioned the drug and alcohol task forces.  I have been a part of one for years.  It is really important that alongside other agencies and statutory bodies, they are empowered to facilitate training for people in the community to address this issue.  The Ministers have been open to meeting.  I cannot speak for them but the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who lives in the area, is acutely aware of the issue and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has expressed a willingness to visit.</p></speech>

We recognise that Moneypoint's days as a coal-burning facility are numbered.  There is a date in 2025 by which coal will no longer be burned.  That is in line with our climate change commitments and is widely accepted in the community.  However, it was expected that there would be a comprehensive plan to assist the communities most affected and to assist the workforce in transitioning away from this carbon-intensive activity.  Lessons need to be learned from events in other parts of the world where significant change has taken place and in the absence of government intervention, communities have effectively been dismantled.  I have no doubt that the directly-employed workers will receive compensation from the ESB, but the wider community will be really adversely affected.  There is a lot of support employment there.  Contractors have already been let go.  Nobody is talking about them.  For a wage pool of that size to be taken out of west Clare represents utter devastation.</p>  <p>  I thought the ESB and the Department would engage more fully.  We spent we spent the last several months addressing climate change issues in the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  A key aspect of the report which was presented to the Government was a requirement for it to put a plan of action in place for places like Moneypoint or the midlands, where the extraction of peat will not happen any more.  We have recommended the establishment of a task force to manage a just transition.  However, the Government's action plan includes none of these commitments.  It seems to allow for job losses and abrupt closures instead of taking a planned approach to the changes required by our environmental commitments.  The ESB must engage with the Department.  Along with others, Deputy Carey and I had an opportunity to meet representatives of the ESB today.  Sadly the ESB does not see itself as having a role as part of a just transition.  It looks at this solely in economic terms.  That is not good enough for the communities and people who will be most affected by this. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000035#NN00700"><p>The first priority here is the workers and their families.  They have been deeply shocked by the large number of jobs lost at Moneypoint.  As Deputy Dooley has said, up to 100 people, who are highly skilled and well thought of and who are committed to this plant, will lose their jobs.  The ESB has a very good track record in looking after its employees.  At a meeting with the ESB today, I impressed upon its representatives the need to limit job losses as far as possible.  Those who lose their jobs must be offered a generous redundancy package.  It is essential that measures such as retraining and education are put in place.  Moneypoint power station has been a driver of economic activity in County Clare for more than three decades.  It has been a key employer, providing top-quality full-time jobs and significant work for contractors.  It has even provided seasonal employment.  It is essential that an alternative energy source is identified for the site as soon as possible in order that it can continue to play a positive role for west Clare and the county as a whole.  There are alternatives, such as biomass and offshore wind power, and I acknowledge the ongoing work of the ESB in this regard.  However, these plans must be produced without delay.</p><p>With climate change, the dawn of a new reality is upon us.  Fossil fuel powered generating plants are no longer sustainable and we must find an alternative we can support.  It is critical that we retain Moneypoint as a site for the generation of electricity to support jobs in west Clare and the county more generally.  I ask the Minister to remember that the Moneypoint plant was once the backbone of electricity generation in Ireland.  Up to 2012, it produced 5 MW of energy.  This year it has produced 0.6 MW.  I think back to the Ardnacrusha plant and the history of power generation in County Clare and appeal to the Minister.  Ireland cannot turn its back on the Moneypoint plant and the people of west Clare.  We are depending on the Minister and our local Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Pat Breen.  We must work together with the ESB to achieve the best possible outcome for the workers and wider economy of County Clare.</p></speech>

I understand absolutely the concerns they raise on behalf of their constituents and the workers at the Moneypoint plant, in particular.  As Deputy Dooley rightly pointed out, the use of coal to power electricity plants is to be phased out, with 2025 having been assessed as the date for the ending of such energy generation.  The immediate challenge for the ESB is that the rising price of carbon in the emissions trading scheme has put pressure on the company.  One of its plants did not get the capacity support to allow it to continue and the company has, therefore, had to initiate the consultation process on its future operation to ensure it will continue to be fit and competitive in such auctions.  Clearly, the ESB must also look at the longer term future.  I have met its representatives to discuss the matter with them.  The company is undoubtedly looking at the future use of the Moneypoint plant, as Deputy Carey indicated, and seeking to identify the opportunities that may arise, including in the use of offshore wind energy and biomass.  There are real opportunities for development in Ireland in the years ahead.  In creating a pathway to these markets we are undertaking to review the Foreshore Act as part of the climate action plan to ensure offshore wind energy projects, in particular, can be developed.  The Moneypoint plant would have a particular competitive advantage in that context.  I am also seeking to bring forward the scale and frequency of renewable energy support scheme auctions that will allow for new renewables to come onto the system.  I am working strenuously to ensure we can bring them forward in a timely way.</p>  <p>  I recognise absolutely that part of a just transition is a requirement to look at the wider regional perspective.  We have developed not only in the climate action plan but in the wider national development plan a recognition of the need for significant resources to support the transition.  We have set aside resources to the tune of &euro;1 billion for rural development, &euro;1 billion for urban development, &euro;500 million for climate action initiatives and &euro;500 million for disruptive technologies.  We will work with the regional enterprise strategies for the affected regions to develop the response.  As part of the climate action plan, we have appointed the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to oversee and have inputs into the work we are doing to ensure there will be a just transition.  While Government policy has been designed to deliver this, the NESC has cross-social partnership representation and is engaged in a great deal of very useful economic analysis.  It can, therefore, add significant value.  I assure the Deputies that developing a road map for the future of the Moneypoint plant and the mid-west region is very high on the Government's agenda.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to establish a task force with the specific responsibility of securing a just transition for the workers and communities, including those who worked in supporting roles in the Moneypoint region.  I appeal to him to appoint the task force and let this be a pilot project for the other tough decisions that will undoubtedly have to be taken as part of the decarbonisation of the economy.  It is a very simple ask.  Will the Minister establish a task force with the responsibility of managing the transition from the carbon intensive burning of coal to generate electricity at Moneypoint and finding the appropriate level of employment and support for the workers and communities into the future?</p></speech>

I support the call for the establishment of a task force involving the Minister's Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Moneypoint plant is critical infrastructure which has provided significantly for west Clare.  Without it, there will simply not be employment opportunities.  As such, we need a task force to look at all of the issues that arise.  We need to identify an alternative energy source to drive the plant, while retaining jobs which can ground future development.</p></speech>

Prior to my appointment as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, we had no regional enterprise strategies, whereas now we have pulled together an enterprise group for the mid-west, on which are represented all of the key players one would need to have to develop a diversification strategy.  They include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the local authorities and Science Foundation Ireland.  In the ESB we have a key player in finding new opportunities in decarbonisation.  It is a company which has the capacity to develop sectors such as biomass or offshore energy in a way no task force could deliver.  The regional enterprise strategies which the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, is driving and which have more than exceeded their targets in the diversification of the enterprise bases in their regions are the effective tools to bring this forward.  The ESB is the key player in our energy environment that is identifying and adopting the opportunities onshore and offshore for the diversification of its portfolio.  It is key to developing the assets at Moneypoint to ensure we can exploit the opportunities created by them.  I am satisfied that the approach we are adopting will deliver the response for which the Deputies are, rightly, asking.</p></speech>

We want the Government to stand up for Irish interests and reject this disastrous trade deal.  We cannot stand over a trade deal which undermines completely Ireland's climate change targets and the Paris Agreement.  We cannot support a deal which requires and facilitates the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.  We cannot support a deal that sells out Irish beef farmers and accelerates a race to the bottom in the beef industry on beef quality and workers' rights.  The beef sector is an industry of which we should be proud, but the Government seems steadfast in making life as difficult as possible for those who work in it.</p><p>The beef sector now faces three significant threats to its existence.  The first threat is the Government's Mercosur deal, which has been agreed by Commissioner Phil Hogan.  The second is Brexit, the impact of which can already be seen in our exchanges with Britain.  The third is the substantial margins being taken by factories and producers.  Very little is being left for farmers, as the primary producers, and for those who work on farms.<br/><br/>If the Government lets the Mercosur deal go ahead, it will be the final nail in the coffin of the beef sector.  The deal, which is a threat to farmers, will expose the Irish public to a product that may be dangerous because it is produced using chemicals and hormones which are banned in the EU.  Brazilian farmers will be able to undercut Irish beef farmers with their products because the quality of Brazilian beef production standards is well below what is required here and across the EU.  Perhaps the most alarming aspect of this matter is that unlike in Ireland, where every single animal is tagged, Brazil has little or no traceability.  This is a great concern.<br/><br/>The Government is asking the House to support the Mercosur deal in the full knowledge that the President of Brazil has made no secret of his frightening plans to oversee the continuing rapid deforestation of the Amazon and has set out his desire to remove Brazil from the Paris climate change accord.  The deforestation of the Amazon, which is now at its highest rate in a decade, increased by 13% last year.  Last month alone, an volume of rainforest the size of two football pitches was being cleared every minute.  It is no coincidence, and no surprise to anyone, that deforestation in Brazil has been increasing considerably at the same time that it has become the biggest exporter of beef in the world.<br/><br/>How does the Mercosur deal fit in with Ireland's climate action commitments?  We declared a climate emergency in this House two months ago.  The Government published its climate action plan last month.  Given that Ireland and the EU are more than self-sufficient in beef, can the Minister explain the logic behind the carbon-mile footprint that will be required to ship this beef from South America to Europe?<br/><br/>We all know that none of this makes sense from a climate perspective or from the perspective of Irish farmers.  To put it plainly and simply, this bad deal trades the Amazon and Irish farmers for cheap beefburgers.  Over recent days, Ministers have been saying that this deal has been 20 years in the making and that it will be a long time before anything happens.  It seems that Commissioner Hogan does not agree with them because he told the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>last week that if the circumstances are right, we could have a deal &quot;quite soon&quot;.  I call on the House to reject the Fine Gael amendment, support our motion and reject the Mercosur trade deal.</p></speech>

This is disappointing for the thousands of farmers who are protesting outside the gates of Leinster House today.  They feel their livelihoods are under threat because the Government is working in co-operation with large corporate interests across Europe, such as BMW and Mercedes, that want to be able to sell their products in Latin America in exchange for allowing more beef to come from Latin America into Europe.  Even though a tariff has to be paid on the beef that is coming from Latin America to Europe, they can still sell it at a lower price than the price for which Irish farmers can produce and sell their beef.  When this trade deal comes in and the tariff is reduced to practically nothing, they will not have a chance.  That is the reality for Irish farmers such as those who are in the Gallery this afternoon.  They want a fair deal.  The Government speaks about fair trade deals and free trade deals, but all our farmers want is fair play.</p>  <p>  When I spoke recently to someone who has worked on a farm in Latin America, I was told that every couple of months, the 15,000 cattle on the farm would be rounded up and the fat ones would be picked out, tagged and sent off to the factories.  Prior to that, there was no tagging and no traceability.  At the moment, less than 1% of farms in Brazil are certified as being free of TB.  What situation would we have in Ireland if that were the case here?  When animals go down with TB and are locked up, farmers come into our clinics to tell us about the problems they encounter.  Even though TB is rampant in the Mercosur countries, we think it is appropriate to put the farmers in those countries on the same scale as Irish farmers who are struggling to survive.</p>  <p>  The truth of the matter is that Europe has decided it wants to have a free trade deal with the Mercosur countries so that it can do business on the big field.  Irish farmers, Irish agriculture and European agriculture are being put on the back foot and sacrificed.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, said that the provisions with regard to beef are the sweetener in the deal.  At a time we are talking about global warming and climate change, it is very poor form that Irish farmers are being used to sweeten a deal that will allow the owners of BMW and Mercedes to sell their vehicles, which are probably going to be phased out in Europe in the coming years, in South America.  We expect to get support from everyone in the House, including Government Deputies, for our motion.  We hope this will happen.  It is time for the Government to take a stand by saying to its partners in Europe and to the Commission that the proposed deal is not acceptable.  The world has changed in recent years.  This Parliament has declared a climate change emergency.  The EU intends to do a deal with Latin America, where rainforests are being cut down and untraceable and disease-ridden beef is being produced.</p>  <p>  We have to make a stand for ordinary people.  I am talking not only about farmers but also about ordinary people around the world who want and expect to get fair play, which is all this is about.  If Irish farmers get fair play, they will accept that.  They will accept standards in other countries if they have to meet the same standards.  Irish farmers are not unreasonable and have never been.  The truth of the matter is that there is no possibility of the Mercosur countries going in this direction.  I know the Minister has said that a big part of this agreement involves putting pressure on the Mercosur countries to come up to our standards.  They are so far behind our standards that it would probably take them two generations to catch up.  Their model of farming is totally alien to the model of farming in Ireland and other countries.  We are asking the Minister to support this motion, withdraw the Government amendment, which basically waters our motion down to nothing, and accept that Irish farmers and European consumers deserve better than this kind of trade deal.</p></speech>

The agreement is a bad deal for Ireland and for the planet.  There is no two ways about it.  As my colleagues said, the deal involves the importation of 90,000 tonnes of beef into each year.  A lot more was demanded of the EU.  Such imports will cripple the beef industry in Ireland, while simultaneously causing severe climate damage.  This deal stands in complete contradiction to the 2030 carbon emissions targets and the Government's climate action plan, which was published recently.  The production of the beef to be imported creates a carbon footprint four times the size of the carbon footprint of Irish beef.  Additional emissions will be created through transportation of the beef from South America to Europe.</p>  <p>  The Government must reject this deal now.  I have heard Ministers suggesting that the deal will somehow cause Mercosur countries to improve their environmental protections.  Their attitude to the concerns that have been expressed by Sinn F&eacute;in is that we always oppose trade deals.  We make no apologies for opposing trade deals that have negative effects on Ireland.  We have been proven correct in our opposition to many of the trade deals that have been entered into by this Government and its predecessors.  Over the years, we have pointed out Israel's clear violations of the provisions in the EU-Israel free trade agreement that relate to the protection of human rights, and indeed its war crimes, but nothing has happened.  The EU-Israel agreement is violated each day without any repercussions.  We have made similar complaints about the EU-Colombia free trade agreement.  We warned that it would lead to a deterioration in human rights and we expressed concern that the human rights provisions in the agreement were not strong enough.  Unfortunately, we have been proven to be correct in that case as well.</p>  <p>  The Government wants us to sign up to an agreement with a far-right Brazilian President who glorifies the old military dictatorship in Brazil.  Since his election, he has shown complete disdain for human rights, environmental protection and the rule of law.  His Government has failed to demarcate land to indigenous communities adequately.  This has led to significant land grabs by Brazilian agribusiness.  This, in turn, is leading to the destruction of these indigenous communities and the environment, as well as to the assassination of community leaders who resist.</p><p>These actions will increase significantly if this deal is ratified.</p> <p> The Brazilian President has stated that he plans to assimilate Brazil&rsquo;s 800,000 indigenous people into Brazilian society stating that they currently live like animals in a zoo.  He plans to remove them from their ancestral land and land reserved for indigenous communities in order to hand it over to commercial agriculture and mining.  We should not sign a trade agreement with a country whose president calls its indigenous people "animals" and who is committed to environmental destruction.  We should not sign any trade agreement that is going to devastate an Irish industry, as this will devastate our beef industry, in the same way as the EU has already done with our fishing industry.  The Government must reject this agreement and ensure it is never ratified.  </p></speech>

Yesterday, the IFA held a briefing on the trade deal, the crisis in farm incomes, the adverse effect of Brexit and climate change.  There are farmers in the Public Gallery, including some from Louth.  They are all appalled by this deal.  There is agreement among all the main farming organisations, Opposition parties, and it would appear, some in the Cabinet that this is a bad deal for farmers, a bad deal for the island of Ireland and a bad deal in terms of meeting the challenge of climate change.  Around 100,000 producers - farming families and local communities - are involved in the beef and livestock sector.  The beef processing sector employs thousands more.  The reality is that farmers in my own constituency of Louth, across this State and in the North now face a significant new threat to their livelihoods.</p>  <p>  While the focus of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement has been on the beef industry, it also allows for the significant importing of poultry and pigmeat.  We should not forget that these new levels of imports are in addition to the 269,000 tonnes of beef and 500,000 tonnes of poultry that the Mercosur states of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay export to the EU.  This deal will do serious damage to our struggling agricultural sector and our rural communities, which are already being stripped of essential public services.  The farming and agrifood sectors, which already face enormous difficulties and challenges as a result of Brexit, will be put under even greater threat by this deal.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, at a time when the EU and its member states have prioritised climate change, this deal will encourage states with a poor record of protecting their environments and a record of supporting deforestation.  Last week, the Brazilian Space Agency released data documenting a massive spike in deforestation in the Amazonian rainforest.  There was a year-on-year 88% increase in deforestation.  What this means in practice is that 4,565 sq. km of rainforest were destroyed.  That is an area five times the size of County Louth - gone in less than a year.  </p>  <p>  Climate change is not the only threat from the deal.  Farming organisations have already expressed their concern that these states do not have the same standards of traceability, animal welfare or food safety.  The Government must vote against this deal when it comes before the EU Trade Council but, crucially, the Irish Government has no veto.  That was given away by our friends in Fianna F&aacute;il.  </p></speech>

I have the floor so could I have a wee bit of manners?  To pass, the deal just needs just 55% in a qualified majority vote so the Government must urgently seek allies to ensure that when it comes to vote, this trade treaty is voted down but first, it needs to make it clear that it will block this deal.  It can do this by supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.</p></speech>

It is also about transparency and the future of this country and our world.  This Government has yet again proved itself to be the epitome of hypocrisy.  At a time when, in a piecemeal fashion, Fine Gael and its Independent Alliance colleagues declare a climate emergency in this country, they have been complicit in an agreement to a shabby trade deal motivated solely by profit for certain interests that will have devastating environmental consequences for Ireland, Europe and South America.  It has the grubby fingerprints of the big capitalist backers of the politics of Fine Gael, its partners in the European People's Party and, of course, its negotiating Commissioner, Phil Hogan, all over it.</p>  <p>  This deal is bad for the environment, ordinary people and the beef industry in Ireland.  It is bad full stop.  At a time when this country is apparently facing a climate emergency, are we going to roll over and cause untold damage to the climate for the sake of selling European-manufactured cars into South America?  To facilitate this entry of cars into their market, the South Americans are tearing down Amazonian rainforests to clear land to graze cattle.  They then intend flooding the European market with cheap and, let us be under no doubt about it, substandard beef that this country, which is already in the middle of a beef crisis, will be unable to withstand.  Just a few months back, the Taoiseach was telling us he was trying to eat less meat to reduce his carbon footprint.  This is globalisation gone mad.  It is totally disingenuous of Fine Gael, which wants to impose a carbon tax on Irish citizens that is allegedly aimed at stopping climate change.  I urge the Ministers present and the Government to take a step back and think about the logic of their position.  </p>  <p>  Can the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation confirm whether this House, and we as legislators, will be given the opportunity to vote on whether this deal is signed up to by Ireland?  Will this House, which is representative of the people of this State, have the opportunity to make a final determination on the suitability of this deal?  I hope that in their responses, the Ministers will clarify the position.  There should be no doubt that resistance to the Mercosur deal is growing across Europe.  Farmers in France, Italy, Spain and Poland along with Irish farmers are all against it and it is a certainty that resistance will grow further.  This Government will have to decide whose side it is on.  Is it on the side of the world's climate and ordinary people or is it on the side of the big corporations and their profits?  It is make-your-mind-up time.  I hope the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Business, Enterprise and Innovation will make the right choice and urge their colleagues in Cabinet to join them in rejecting this so-called deal.  </p></speech>

At the outset of this debate, it is important to acknowledge first and foremost just how vital international trade deals are for this country.  Last year, we exported &euro;316 billion worth of goods and services all around the world.  The fact is our exports have increased by 74% since 2013 and have played a huge role in the remarkable recovery in our economy over that period so let us be clear and honest here today.  As an island nation on the edge of Europe, Ireland has been a major beneficiary of the ability to trade internationally and of our membership of the EU.  Free trade has transformed this country from the isolated and impoverished state we were in the 1960s.  Many in this House are rightly critical of the protectionist policies that are currently being pursued in the UK in terms of Brexit and by the current Administration in the US.</p><p>It is ironic that some of those same people are the first to dismiss an international trade agreement which opens up access to a market of 265 million consumers without giving it any level of detailed scrutiny.  As a small, open, export-led economy, we depend on balanced international trade.  The key word is &ldquo;balance&rdquo;.  The Government will go through this agreement in minute detail and see if it strikes the right balance for Ireland.</p> <p> We also need to acknowledge there are positives in this agreement with significant benefits for Irish exporters.  In 2018 alone, Ireland exported almost &euro;2 billion worth of goods and services to the Mercosur region.  Our trade with the region has grown by one fifth between 2010 and 2016.  This agreement will allow Irish exporters to expand faster and take advantage of new opportunities.  In this regard, analysis by my Department estimates a potential doubling of annual goods and services exports from Ireland is possible over the period to 2030.</p> <p> The deal ensures Irish whiskey and Irish cream liqueur are protected under the EU&rsquo;s geographical indication, Gl, scheme.  It is also important to point out the special provisions for SMEs in the agreement.  There are positives for the dairy sector with tariffs on 45,000 tonnes of product including cheese, milk powder and infant formula moving from approximately 19% to zero tariff over a ten-year period presenting significant opportunities for the sector.  It is important these benefits from the agreement are acknowledged.</p> <p> However, this deal is not perfect.  I recognise the genuine concerns expressed by our farming community about Mercosur.  These concerns are not just about beef but also about our poultry sector and pig farmers.  I am from a rural community and live on a farm.  I have listened to some Members in the House over the past few days who are happy to jump on a bandwagon to score a cheap political point.  The truth, however, is that some of them would not know a bee from a bull&rsquo;s foot or the difference between a bull and a bullock.</p></speech>

This is a deal negotiated at EU level.  As a member state, Ireland has raised serious concerns over a long time on beef access.  For my part, I raised these concerns at every opportunity at European Trade Council meetings.  I also raised it directly with the European Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m.  As recently as 31 May, I wrote to her once again highlighting our serious concerns, particularly given the current challenges and uncertainty facing the Irish beef sector in light of Brexit.</p>  <p>  There has been a sustained effort right across the Government on this matter.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, raised it with his EU counterparts.  The Taoiseach also wrote jointly, along with the leaders of France, Belgium and Poland, to highlight our concerns to the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>  <p>  It must be remembered the South American countries were initially looking for a beef quota of 300,000 tonnes.  The deal on the table provides for 99,000 tonnes and it is clearly segmented 45% frozen and 55% fresh.  It is also carcass weight equivalent ensuring it involves the whole animal, not just prime cuts.  Irish farmers produce a high-quality product in a competitive market.  They accept there is always going to be competition but they want a level playing field.  In that regard, this agreement ensures there will be equivalent standards.  EU sanitary and phytosanitary standards, SPS, will not be relaxed in any way.  They remain non-negotiable.  The highest EU standards will be applied to all imported goods, especially food, to ensure no hormone beef or GMOs will be allowed.</p>  <p>  Currently 270,000 tonnes of beef from Mercosur already enter the EU market.  Those imports are subject to rigorous testing by veterinary authorities across the EU, work that is overseen by the European Food and Veterinary Office in Grange, County Meath.  Equivalent standards are an integral part of this agreement.</p>  <p>  Several Deputies have raised genuine concerns on the climate impact of this deal, in particular around the Brazilian track record on the environment.  I am not here to defend the Brazilian President, Mr. Bolsonaro, nor would I attempt to do so.  However, the Mercosur countries, including Brazil, will have to fully implement the Paris Climate Agreement as part of this deal.  I have no doubt the European Commission, as will all member states, will be monitoring Brazil&rsquo;s actions closely over the next two years.  Should Brazil walk away from the Paris Agreement or fail to meet its obligations, then this deal falls.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

The European Commission has begun the official mechanism at EU level to restrict concessions to Cambodia over similar concerns.  It is not true to claim the EU does not act.</p>  <p>  This is far from a done deal.  At this stage, member states, including Ireland, do not have sight of the full deal.  It is an agreement in principle, which must now be transposed into a legal document.  That process is going to take over two years to complete and Ireland will input into that process.  It then has to be voted through by a qualified majority on the European Trade Council and then go through the European Parliament.  After all of that, as it is a mixed agreement, our current understanding is that all member state parliaments, including this House, will have their say on it.</p>  <p>  The beef quota will only be introduced on a phased basis over six years.  This deal might not be fully felt until around 2028.  Meanwhile, 113 days from now, on 31 October, there is a real possibility that we will have a no-deal Brexit.  If that comes to pass, it will deliver a serious shock to our economy and, in particular, it will have damaging consequences for the agricultural sector.  In that context, with serious immediate challenges like Brexit facing us, we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.  That is why my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will now proceed to ensure a comprehensive independent economic and environmental sustainability assessment is carried out on Mercosur.  We have the time and space necessary to do that.  The shape Brexit takes, as well as the impact it has for the agricultural sector, will be a key consideration of that assessment.</p>  <p>  There is a long way to go on this.  We need to go through this agreement line by line, as more detailed information is known, to establish what the exact opportunities and challenges are across the economy.  In the meantime, I, together with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, will work to forge alliances with other member states to diminish the impact of this deal for our agriculture sector.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that the Government has an open mind on this deal.  There are benefits in certain sectors but there are also negatives.  We need to determine overall if this deal will be a win or a lose for our economy.  We should not lose sight of the fact that in recent years, we have had EU trade agreements with Japan, Vietnam, Singapore and Mexico that have been positive for our agriculture sector, particularly providing for the export of 105,000 tonnes of European beef.  Those were good trade deals for our agricultural sector.  I fully accept that Mercosur is a difficult one.  We are not pressing ahead with this deal.  The Government must look at this deal in the round.  That is what the economic assessment will do.  It will ensure the Government makes a fully informed decision when deciding what position to take when the ratification process on this deal commences in two years&rsquo; time.</p>  <p>  Until that work is complete, and indeed until we have sight of a final legal text on this agreement, it would be premature for the Government to accept the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I encourage Members, therefore, to support the Government&rsquo;s amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000039#RR00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has supported previous EU trade deals with Japan, Mexico, Canada and Singapore, which were important and good for this country.  It also is important, in the context of the EU making trade deals, that the Government represents the country well and ensures that the deals done are fair in terms of the national interest and proportionate.</p><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to this Mercosur deal, we have been let down by the Government in that regard, particularly so when we have had our own national Commissioner in the role of EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, because it is the beef aspect of this deal in particular which represents such a big threat to the country.  When one looks at the fact that Ireland is the largest EU exporter of beef and the fifth largest beef exporter globally, the agricultural sector in Ireland will be carrying a lot of weight of the losses of the agreement so that other sectors can benefit, and there are also many poultry and pork quotas involved.  That represents a political failure on behalf of the Government in not having ensured that our interests were better represented in Europe with the headline deal that has been achieved.</p> <p> One of the key reasons the deal does not make sense is the climate change aspect.  We have seen the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, along with Commissioner Hogan, propose a 50:50 &euro;100 million stock reduction package in recent months, which involves an option to have domestic stock reduced.  Meanwhile, it would appear there is no problem taking in an additional quota from South America to depress our domestic markets further.  When one looks at the fact that Europe is 102% self-sufficient for beef, we have no need to take high carbon footprint beef from South America, where it is impacting on the Amazon rainforest, all the way to Europe where it can be produced much more efficiently and to Ireland where we can produce beef more efficiently than in any other part of the world.</p> <p> The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, have been a soft touch in representing Irish interests at European level up to now, alongside Commissioner Hogan.  It is time they stiffened their resolve and brought the case to Europe of the damaging impact this deal would have on Irish interests and pushed back to try to ensure that the interests of Ireland, particularly of our agricultural sector, are protected.  Our agricultural sector has many representatives here today and had many representatives here yesterday who have made it clear how their livelihoods are at stake as a result of what is being proposed in this deal.</p></speech>

Again, people looking on can have little confidence in what this Government will do because the Minister is still unable to say whether we will have a say on the future of this deal.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation says it is her understanding that we will but one would imagine that at a very minimum she would know whether we do or we do not.  Yesterday, one Minister was saying one thing and another Minister was saying another.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation seemed to say it was a <i>fait accompli</i>and the only way we would bring about change is if some of the Mercosur countries failed to comply with standards, yet the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, who was quite rightly under pressure on the quality and quantity of beef that is proposed to come into our market, seemed to suggest that a deal that is 20 years in the making could be changed between now and the deal becoming a legal text.  He was unable to confirm to my colleague the details of the cut and quite frankly there is huge uncertainty among the community that is looking on and the Minister has given them no confidence.</p><p>It was incredible to find out yesterday that the Government has yet to carry out any meaningful economic assessment on what this deal could mean for our country.  The Minister tried to tie it in with an economic assessment that has been ongoing for 12 months on a multitude of trade deals but no economic assessment has been carried out on this specific deal and what impact it will have on the Irish economy.  The Minister has confirmed in her speech today that this assessment will only commence now.  It should have commenced years ago.  A small and open economy like ours relies on our ability to trade.  Quite simply, without our ability to trade, we could not survive.  We are the second largest exporter in the world of IT software and of baby formula and we are in the top ten exporters in the world of pharmaceuticals.  When we are talking about trade, we must ensure that we are trading with countries that adopt the same standards and regulatory environment that we operate in, not with a country that is decimating rainforests.  I understand that in the past year alone, there has been a 60% increase in the deforestation of our rainforests, which are critical for our environment and for providing global oxygen.</p><p>Government needs to engage with like-minded states to ensure the necessary changes are made before any future consideration can be given to this deal.  It needs to carry out an economic assessment to ensure it does not have an adverse impact on our economy as well as carrying out an environmental assessment.  If the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation is serious about global trade, she needs to tackle what the National Competitiveness Council called our &quot;high cost economy&quot; earlier this year.  She needs to tackle our utilities, our cost of credit and our big business and service inputs and then she will be doing our trading businesses a good service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-07-10a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000040#SS00300"><p>Preventing catastrophic global temperature increases means rapid and deep decarbonisation in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  Biodiversity loss is also an existential threat, which is fundamentally linked to the climate crisis.  This House has made great strides in recent months in the form of the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as well as the more recent declaration of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  The jury is still out as to whether this Government will tackle this crisis with the urgency it deserves.  At EU level, it is welcome that the Government is supporting a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and must also apply this at national level.  However, in terms of the motion before us today, this Government commitment will prove utterly hollow if the Mercosur deal allows for the destruction of the Amazon and the active defiance of the Paris Agreement.</p>  <p>  Transparently assessing and improving environmental standards is a cornerstone of EU agriculture policy, an area which Ireland must continue to support actively.  Yet it is far from clear whether these criteria will be prioritised and upheld in the context of the Mercosur deal.  Brazilian beef is not produced to the same environmental standards as is beef in the EU.  It also has a higher carbon footprint.  Beef production has become a major driver of deforestation, with most blame attached to the Brazilian Government.  Deforestation of the Amazon has surged since President Bolsonaro took office.  Deforestation has risen to its highest level in a decade, with clear-cutting up 88% in June compared with the same month in 2018.  Over the past 11 months, over 4,000 sq. km have been lost.</p>  <p>  It is also worth highlighting the extremely concerning political developments, as well as the worsening environmental and human rights protections in Brazil, which are rightly referenced in the motion before us.  Since President Bolsonaro took office in January, eight former Ministers of the Environment have warned that Government actions are undermining Brazil&rsquo;s environmental protection policies.  There are also reports that the Brazilian Government has opposed returning protected lands to indigenous communities.  Attacks on environmental activists and indigenous people are on the rise and increasing numbers of small-scale farmers have been displaced.  Legislation has been proposed that would relieve farmers of the obligation to maintain up to 80% tree cover on their land.  Also, legislation has been proposed to allow an amnesty for those who have deforested.  Ministerial appointments have been made which include individuals opposed to climate change and environmental action.  The powers of the Ministry of the Environment have been weakened and certain senior positions replaced.  Most recently, in June over 340 civil society organisations produced a joint letter to the EU authorities, expressing alarm over the devastating impacts the agreement will have on forests, indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights, climate change and small-scale farmers and have urged the EU to halt the negotiations with Mercosur due to these concerns.</p>  <p>  This is not an exercise in simply condemning Brazil.  Certain Brazilian states have committed to fulfilling the country&rsquo;s Paris Agreement commitments.  Previous Brazilian Governments have also been strong supporters of climate action.  We need to focus on the strategy and priorities of this Government and the EU in negotiating this deal.</p><p>President Junker and Commissioner Hogan have emphasised that the trade deal includes a provision that the Paris Agreement will be &ldquo;effectively implemented&rdquo; and that the Mercosur countries have made specific climate pledges, including on afforestation.  However, it is completely clear that even if Brazil has not officially left the Paris Agreement, effective implementation is not taking place.  The deal lacks adequate enforcement mechanisms and proper safeguards to ensure forests will be protected and rights respected.</p> <p> The Government needs to rethink entirely its approach if it is serious about meeting its sustainability objectives in agriculture.  This is relevant to the issue of EU leadership on climate change but also Ireland&rsquo;s campaign for UN Security Council membership where the Government has put much emphasis on climate action.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is calling for a new impact assessment of the Mercosur deal on Ireland.  At EU level we also need an analysis of the deal&rsquo;s potential environmental impacts based on up-to-date scenarios.  It should be backed by guarantees that no Brazilian products sold in the European Union will lead to increases in deforestation, land grabbing of native lands or human rights violations and confirmation backed by clear evidence that the Brazilian Government is actively taking progressive steps to fulfil its Paris Agreement commitments.</p> <p> The Mercosur deal is a litmus test of the European Union&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action.  The Government must ensure rigorous enforcement of international obligations and an end to deforestation.  We need a fair trade policy that includes global compliance with environmental and social standards.  Ultimately, a failure to prioritise respect for climate and environmental obligations will hurt Irish farmers and undermines both Ireland's and the European Union&rsquo;s international standing.</p></speech>

What makes it all the more galling is that it has been done by one of our own.  When Ray MacSharry held the same agriculture portfolio, he framed CAP reform in a way that would suit Irish beef farming.  Here we have a Commissioner framing a trade deal that will bring devastation to the agriculture industry.  The production of beef, poultry, pigs, sugar beet and ethanol will be undermined by this trade deal.  At a time when Brexit is heading to its conclusion and given that the European Union after Brexit will be 116% self-sufficient in beef production, it beggars belief that a deal such as this could be done to allow extra beef into the European market.</p>  <p>  What is most galling for Irish farmers is the hypocrisy of the Commission on climate change.  European food producers know that they must adapt to climate change.  They know that it will bring extra production costs, but they were prepared to do this.  They see the Commission enforcing all of these climate change restrictions on them, but then it does a deal that will hasten climate change on the planet.  There is no way that addressing climate change is compatible with importing beef, poultry and pigs from halfway across the world to take the place of European produce.  That is why such a large group of farmers were on the streets today.  They find the hypocrisy of the Commission impossible to swallow.</p></speech>

However, this deal provides for loads of give on behalf of farmers, which is very unfair.  It will result in the decimation of farming, especially beef, poultry, pigs and sugar beet farmers.  It does not provide a level playing field and is environmentally hypocritical.</p>  <p>  Many farmers in my constituency of Cork South-West have contacted me in recent weeks.  They are genuinely concerned about the consequences of the deal.  It is inevitable that the influx of beef into the European Union will impact greatly on our beef producers who export 90% of their produce to the United Kingdom.  Producers who are already at rock bottom will feel it even more.  It is no exaggeration to say the devastation for the farming community in Cork South-West will be unreal.  By extension, their families will feel it and thus, in essence, the local economy.  This is not to mention further economic losses that will be incurred as an indirect result of the deal or the impact it will have on the environment.  It is somewhat remiss of the European Union to slap sanctions on Ireland over climate change, while at the same time agreeing to the transportation of tonnes of beef halfway across the world when there is a superior version of the same product on our doorstep.  It also seems to be somewhat remiss to agree to a deal of this magnitude without knowing exactly what will happen with Brexit which presents the biggest challenge to the European Union.  The interests of Irish farmers must be represented in Europe.  I call on the Ministers present to be the voice of the farmers of Cork South-West and the country as a whole.  They should support the motion in the interests of farmers and all stakeholders in Ireland.  I plead with them to reject the deal.</p></speech>

The Minister said:</p><blockquote>I am not here to defend the Brazilian President, Mr. Bolsonaro, nor would I attempt to do so.  However, the Mercosur countries, including Brazil, will have to fully implement the Paris Climate Agreement as part of this deal ... Should Brazil walk away from the Paris Agreement or fail to meet its obligations, then this deal falls.  It is as simple as that.</blockquote><p>I ask the Minister to change that and simply say that if Brazil walks away from the Paris Agreement, the EU-Mercosur deal will not start.  I assure her that Brazil has walked away from the Paris Agreement.  Its Prime Minister is a climate change denier.  He has said global warming is a plot.  He has right-wing attitudes on all issues such as same-sex marriage and homosexuality.  In no way will he meet the requirements of the Paris climate accord.  He has not done so to date and will not do so in the future.  We should not even contemplate this deal until that country and its leader come into line, which will not happen in the first place.</p><p>The Minister also said: &quot;The Government has absolutely fought to achieve the best deal possible for our farmers.&quot;  I have not met a single farmer who agrees with that statement.  If the agriculture community in its entirety is telling me and everybody else that this is a bad deal for farmers, we should not be signing up to it.  We should be gathering allies in the European Union - something we should have been doing for the past four years - to prevent this deal from going through.  The single biggest issue on our agenda is climate change and we are already turning our backs on it.</p></speech>

In all my dealings with her since my election to this House in 2016 I have found her to be sincere.  I do not believe she believes in the address she made to us today.  She keeps telling the House that it is not a done deal.  However, she emphasised strongly that it would be introduced on a phased basis and would not be operational until 2028.  She emphasised that the deal would not commence for two years.  She emphasised strongly that these boys wanted 300,000 tonnes of beef coming in and that the EU side had brought it down to 99,000 tonnes.  What does that tell me and my colleagues?  Does it tell the farm families of Ireland that the Government has decided to go with this deal?  Excuse the pun but the Government is making the beef sector the sacrificial lamb.  That is the reality; it is taking a gamble.</p>  <p>  There are 6,000 farm families in County Roscommon and a few thousand more in the part of County Galway I represent.  I spoke recently to farmers in Ballygar and Williamstown on the Roscommon-Galway border.  They all tell me that they believe their options are selling or using their land for forestry.  The Government is about to get the biggest hop it has ever got with this deal.  The farming community will take it on and fight it on this issue.</p>  <p>  Overwhelmingly, the House does not agree with the deal.  Government Members should do the right thing and support the motion.  We should move forward united to get a better deal.  We are not against the trade deal, but we want a better deal for rural communities and farmers.  The Minister should remember that this applies strongly in her constituency, particularly to the poultry sector.  It also applies to the pigmeat sector.  Government Members should take away their objections and support the motion in order that we can work together to get a better deal.</p></speech>

I know the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will not support its ratification in its current guise.  Nine out of every ten cows produced on Irish farms have to be exported.  We have a 900% oversupply.  Farmers are feeling the pinch already and beef prices are significantly below the cost of production.  The looming threat of Brexit has to be the immediate focus because it poses a threat to farmers' livelihoods.  The European beef market on which we depend is already oversupplied and the introduction of this 99,000 tonnes of fresh and frozen meat into an already over-saturated market makes no sense, economic or otherwise.  Therefore our economy and our farmers&rsquo; livelihoods cannot be put at risk.</p>  <p>  From an environmental perspective this deal cannot proceed.  A couple of weeks ago, the Government launched a comprehensive climate action plan which calls for further reductions in carbon emissions from Irish agriculture.  Irish farmers have worked hard in recent years to meet higher environmental, health and welfare standards imposed on the sector yet the nations we propose to import beef from come nowhere near close to our standards.  Deforestation of rain forests for agricultural use has been common practice in some of the nations involved in this deal.  That is not to mention that huge carbon emissions output, which will arise from the transportation of this meat.  It is folly to say we are addressing climate change issues at home and then put that at naught by this import.  That is why it must be resisted, even on that score alone.</p>  <p> The possibility of a no-deal Brexit is looming large and is the most immediate issue to be addressed.  While we are rightly spending some time talking about the Mercosur deal, the loss of our largest beef export market, the UK, will have a devastating impact with 300,000 tonnes involved.  That is three times more than the amount we are discussing here, 99,000 tonnes, which is to be distributed around the EU.  The 300,000 tonnes comprise the amount of one of our products we put directly into it. The Brexit uncertainty and concerns arising therefrom, such as the weak sterling has severely dented the confidence of farmers in this area.  We know how important that is for our rural economy and throughout the country, especially in large areas of the west of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  We have to put the EU-Mercosur deal into a bit of context from a trade perspective.  What we are talking about is not intended to be just a trade agreement between the EU and the Mercosur countries.  There was to have been a long-planned partnership agreement but where is the partnership?  The draft deal is all about free trade.  There is no detail about genuine social and environmental co-operation or about a real partnership between South America and Europe.  The Labour Party is not in favour of unregulated free trade.  We cannot support the draft EU-Mercosur deal as it is currently constituted.  We are in favour of fair trade, which improves workers' rights, protects the environment and offers a fair deal to all sections of Irish society, including our farmers, especially in the beef, pig and poultry sectors.  Fair trade does not just happen.  It has to be made happen by strong rules and enforcement of those rules.  The European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC, and its counterpart in South America, the co-ordinator of central labour organisations, CCSCS, are both committed to the development of a genuine partnership agreement if there are strong guarantees in place.  For years, the ETUC and the CCSCS have been calling for a more balanced partnership, based on social justice and guaranteed respect for the environment.  Those are prizes worth fighting for but this draft agreement does not deliver same.  We have had a significant period of EU membership which has been good for Ireland.  Our incomes grew.  We would like to see other countries achieve the same level of economic development and progress as Ireland has achieved but we do not want to pull up the ladder behind us.  That is why we would welcome a genuine partnership between the EU and Mercosur, as long as it is built on strong workers' rights and environmental protection but the draft deal is not convincing in any aspect of enforcement.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, there was a struggle to explain the dispute resolution mechanism that will be used in this deal and how it will work.  Any dispute resolution mechanism must be under democratic control, with clear processes that include trade unions, environmental groups and civil society groups.  Instead, trade union organisations and other civil society groups have been rebuffed every time they have asked for a place at the negotiating table.  All the deal-making has been shrouded in secrecy.  Why should we have any confidence that the current draft deal will improve workers' rights and save the rainforest?  We cannot.  All of that is even before I return to our farmers and farm workers.  There is no doubt that this deal is a bad deal as currently constructed.</p>  <p>  The deal says European food standards will not be compromised but there is no guarantee that Argentina and Brazil have the technical and administrative capacity to achieve European quality standards at this time.  Will there be boots on the ground to ensure biosecurity and phytosanitary standards are observed and adhered to?  We are familiar with the work that goes into ensuring high standard food quality.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland does excellent work, as does the European Food and Veterinary Office, which is based in Navan.  The work of these organisations provides consumers in Ireland and around Europe with reassurance that the meat they buy is of high quality and is safe for them and their families.  What reassurance would we have from Mercosur countries?  It is a matter of significant policy difference.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is acutely aware of this.  Argentina and Brazil permit hormone treatments and other practices that are illegal in Ireland.  There is no tagging in Brazil, no database and no traceability.  Foot and mouth disease is rampant.  I recall being here in 2000 and 2001 before the Minister came in here.  This place almost closed down.  It came to a halt because of foot and mouth.  We adjourned and we were all around the country fighting that.  Why should we allow this become a threat?  The deal says there will not be compromise but I do not know about that.  There is a reason we do not have European free trade in food.  We have a regulated social market approach to farming and that is as it should be.  We have tried to keep improving over the years to achieve decent incomes for farmers, increasing productivity and keeping the backbone of the rural economy going.  Our farmers cannot compete on a free trade basis with beef coming from Argentina and Brazil.  We need a level playing field and the only way to achieve that is to raise the South American farmers up, not lower the economic security and incomes of Irish and European farmers.  </p>  <p>  We are not going to give up our livestock farmers for this deal nor should we ever contemplate sacrificing them for a tawdry cars for cows accord between the EU and the four countries in the South American bloc.  The Labour Party will not support the deal as it stands.  We will work constructively to achieve partnership with working people in other countries.  Excellent deals have been concluded with Japan and other places.  It is on that basis that we support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.</p>  <p>  One has to wonder.  Many people say this is a provisional accord but environmentalists have indicated that the proposed provisional trade deal is a double whammy for the planet.  It exacerbates the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and encourages the production of gas guzzlers.  The most troubling aspect of it is how we can enforce the applicable standards.  What is in writing might be difficult to apply in theory.  An area the size of a football field is razed every minute in the rainforest.  There are no controls.  That is why this deal has to be binned in its current form. </p></speech>

They have betrayed the fight to deal with the climate emergency.  They are sabotaging efforts to deal with the horrendous destruction of the Amazon rainforests and betraying any commitment to human rights or indeed even to the aspirations and livelihoods of small farmers in Latin America.</p>  <p>  I do not say that as a bandwagon jumper.  I was in Genoa in 2002 at the G8 summit where we were tear-gassed and batoned off the streets, standing alongside indigenous people from Brazil, farmers from France and Italy when this deal was first being hatched, protesting against the plans to bring in these deals, which would destroy the small farmers and producers of Europe, destroy the environment and drive a coach and horses through any commitment to human rights.  That is our record and it was that which led us to oppose the Lisbon treaty because as we warned at the time, the Lisbon treaty signed away our veto to oppose this kind of trade deal.</p><p>That does not mean opposing trade.  Rather, it means trade should be fair and sustainable, not done in the interest of a tiny group of corporations but that is what is going on.  Small farmers, the environment and human rights are being sacrificed for German car manufacturers, large pharmaceutical industries, a small number of large manufacturing industries and the financial services industry.  Rural Ireland and small farmers are being destroyed in that agenda.  The commitment that there will be safeguards for the Paris Agreement are nonsense because we have lost our veto.  The Germans will say they want their cars to be exported to Brazil and none of the clauses will be invoked.  We know this happens with human rights clauses in deals because the Government never calls out the Israelis.  Despite the commitments to human rights in the trade association agreements, the Government never does anything about it because big business comes before any of those commitments.</p> <p> All that can be done now is for farmers to keep on the streets and link up with other farmers and environmentalists, throughout Europe and Latin America, who fight and resist the deal in order that it can be brought down.  Otherwise, the environment and rural Ireland will suffer terrible consequences.</p></speech>

The United Nations has told us there are 11 years in which to prevent irreversible damage to the planet from climate change.  The trade agreement seriously undermines attempts to do that.  The world number one carbon sink, the Amazon rainforest, is under threat from deforestation.  Some 800 sq. km of rainforest was hacked down in 2018.  That is an area 100 times the size of Manhattan.  Cattle ranchers and farmers are responsible for 80% of that deforestation.  The world's largest meat processor is a Brazilian corporation called JBS.  Its greenhouse gas emissions were greater than the total greenhouse gas emissions of the Netherlands in 2016.  It sells meat from companies that have been fined for deforestation.  The situation has worsened in the past six months with the election of the extreme right-wing President, Bolsonaro.  Since the start of the year, there has been a dismantling of environmental protections, a surge in the number of invasions of lands owned by indigenous peoples and a large spike in deforestation in the Amazon.</p>  <p>  These are the corporations and politicians whom the Minister is talking about doing a trade deal with for more beef.  The Mercosur agreement, the so-called cows for cars trade deal, is a boost for the Brazilian beef industry, those responsible for deforestation and those who threaten the climate and planet.  The EU had a trade-for-all strategy in 2015, where it indicated it could use trade agreements to promote sustainable development.  The deal in question does nothing of the sort.</p>  <p>  It is not a one-way street.  The export of cars, many of them German, to the Mercosur countries will not help the climate, although it will help the German car industry, which will sell many sport utility vehicles or gas guzzlers.  It will mean job devastation for car workers in countries such as Argentina and for industry in those countries.</p>  <p>  Capitalism threatens the very future of the planet, putting profit above all else, including the needs of the environment and the next generation.  If one needs further proof, one should look at the Mercosur trade deal.  We oppose the deal and will support the motion.</p></speech>

Farmers' share has been slashed by one quarter in the past 15 years.  Over that period, South American beef has been used as one of the most important tools in undermining the margin paid to Irish suckler farmers.  If the Mercosur deal is ratified, the equivalent of 1 million head of cattle a year will be transported up to 11,000 km from South America.  Brazilian ranchers clear an area the size of County Cork every year to meet a European market that already produces enough beef to meet demand.  It is a bad deal for Irish beef farmers and the climate.</p></speech>

Teagasc estimates that one third of farmers simply do not make enough money whatsoever.  The number of farmers in the State is falling, average wages are on the floor and poverty is rampant among farmers.  The Government has allowed for multiples and factories to have massive buyer power and they are squeezing the last cents out of farmers to make super-normal profits.  On top of this, Fine Gael seeks to enforce the Mercosur deal, which will put Irish farmers at an unfair competitive disadvantage.  They will have to deal with significant regulatory costs while their competitors will have little or none.  It could not happen at a worse time.  We are teetering at the edge of Brexit and the deal will do further damage to beef producers in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Fine Gael has long stopped bothering about rural Ireland.  Its centre of gravity is currently in south Dublin.  Anybody who has any confusion about the matter should consider the lopsided state of the country.  Capital plans are overheating, the commuter belt is sprawling and many parts of rural Ireland are being emptied of their younger population. </p></speech>

Around the same time, approximately 600 scientists with representatives of indigenous communities called on the EU to support human rights and sustainable development in the light of the increased violations and threats to indigenous peoples and their lands in ecologically valuable areas.  Civil society in Brazil is under severe threat because of President Bolsonaro's campaign of anti-activism.  His plans include supervising and monitoring those non-governmental organisations and international agencies that draw attention to such issues, while his Cabinet contains at least two ministers who are deniers of climate change and global warming.  It is staggering to think the Mercosur countries originally sought a beef quota of 300,000 tonnes, whereas the deal will now provide for 99,000 tonnes.  That will require an awful lot of grazing land and, in this time of climate awareness and urgency, it is illogical that forests will be cut down for grazing cattle while our farmers are being encouraged to grow trees, not least in view of the emissions from cattle.</p>  <p>  Food safety is the other aspect.  Great progress is being made here on raising awareness, the importance of traceability, knowing about the meat we eat and what the cattle are fed, but this is a retrograde step.  We know that people will buy cheaper meat.  Some people have no option but to do that, such are their circumstances, but we will not know exactly what is in the meat.</p>  <p>  There are so many questions about the trade deal.  I have previously mentioned the investor-state dispute settlement.  The deal is presented as historic and it took 20 years.  The Minister stated it is not a done deal and that it has not been approved by any member states or the EU.  There is an opportunity, therefore, to examine it.  It has been dominated by beef issues, about which there are genuine concerns, but other aspects in the deal also need to be examined.  There is an opportunity for a high level group to do that forensic examination, particularly to climate-proof and rights-proof it and to check it for threats to Irish farming and businesses.  There is finally a business and human rights implementation group here and it could discuss the matter.</p>  <p>  The Dutch trade minister wrote an opinion piece stating this is an opportunity for Europe to export its high social and environmental standards to South American companies.  We know the need for labour rights, better working conditions, a living wage and a minimum wage in the Mercosur countries.  She claims there are strict monitoring mechanisms, a commitment to implementing the Paris Agreement and so on.  There is no doubt about the anger of Irish farmers.  It was palpable not just in emails they sent but also earlier on the streets.</p><p>Many issues must be addressed and we need thorough scrutiny of all that is involved before accepting or rejecting a deal.  We must have fully formed decisions and where improvements are to be made, they must be made.</p></speech>

I support the motion.  In conjunction with the motion, a seed has been sown by the quiet people in rural Ireland as the Beef Plan Movement has brought people together to come to Dublin city at a time of year they would otherwise be at silage, hay or other work.  People from all parts of the country have given their time to show their disgust at what is going on in the farming sector.  This is not just about Mercosur and I have listened for the past while as Members spoke about climate change.  In the past three weeks, we have seen a document that will screw these farmers out of &euro;15 in every &euro;100 when they make silage or hay.  This is a time factories are abusing farmers and those farmers are being treated in a disgusting fashion in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations.  Brexit is around the corner as well.  The final kick in the teeth is the European Union decision on the Mercosur deal.</p>  <p>  Seven, eight or ten years ago, when this country was on its knees, we were damn glad to rely on the agricultural industry for &euro;3.5 billion of exports from the beef sector.  Everybody welcomes the fact that our country has started to do better but those farmers seem to be the forgotten people now.  Instead, we will do a deal with countries where there is no animal traceability and there are high rates of tuberculosis.  It has been proven that these countries have sold rotten meat to other countries.  We know these countries are cutting areas of forestry the size of a football pitch every minute but this deal is meant to be all in the name of tackling climate change.  This beef will be hauled halfway around the world, no more than what we are doing with some of our biomass.  Do we think that is good?</p>  <p>  Europe is trying to eliminate some of these types of systems so it can be a clean area in comparison with everyone else.  People have spoken about "Mercs for meat" but before we speak of climate change, we should speak about people, families, livelihoods, living, communities and areas in rural Ireland that must survive.  These are areas where 100,000 farmers rely on the beef sector and where some families work but many farmers put bread and butter on the table not alone for their families but for the shopkeeper and butcher down the road and the local hardware merchant.  We must remember that this is not just about the 100,000 farmers.  What are we to do?  Shall we make a theme park out of the west of Ireland or, indeed, the rest of Ireland because we are the green and clean economy?  Are we to let someone else produce the stuff?</p>  <p>  There seems to be an agenda driven by Europe that we should plant much of this country and forget about this type of farming.  We must remember that we are heading into Brexit and we may have to borrow &euro;5 billion in our next budget.  We are looking at people losing their livelihoods because of Brexit and this deal.  If a person does not have a livelihood, he or she cannot contribute to an economy and will need funding.  In the past few days I have heard about the great fund of &euro;1 billion that Commissioner Phil Hogan has procured.  Is that &euro;1 billion going to save 27 countries in Europe?  We should remember that our exports from beef alone are worth more than &euro;3 billion so Phil can shove his &euro;1 billion where the sun does not shine.  It will not save our beef industry.  We need to put a floor under it and get real.  We must believe that people are more important in our country than winking and nodding to other bureaucrats in Europe doing their deals.  We must stand up for our people in each part of the country now in their hour of need.  I have heard people saying we must look at how this will go over the next few years.  Our MEPs and Councils of Ministers, along with everybody in these Houses, must stand together as Irish people to fight for farm families once and for all.</p></speech>

I welcome the support of Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Richard Boyd Barrett as we are in a crisis affecting all of Ireland except the groups from Dublin.  None of those Members is here.  The Government's wonderful leader and other Ministers care nothing about what happens beyond the Red Cow.  The late Mr. Seymour Crawford, God rest him, was the mentor of the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, but I do not know what he would say to her today because he would not have had anything to do with this deal.  The Minister knows he fought all his life in the Irish Farmers' Association.  The father of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, was also a Member.</p>  <p>  This is an outrageous sellout but what else should we expect from big Phil the destroyer - the enforcer who ran riot in this country when he was here.  Now he is running riot in Europe and the Government has the cheek to appoint his as Commissioner again.  It is jobs for the boys.  The Ministers saw those Beef Plan Movement farmers today and we met members of the IFA yesterday.  Tomorrow we will have hill and sheep farmers coming here to tear into the Government because they are sick and tired of it.  The Government has walked on the people of rural Ireland and its little people.  All the Government cares about now are the banks, the likes of Larry Goodman and big business.  There are big deals with Granahan McCourt for broadband so it is about anything that is big and which can give plenty of money to the Government.  To hell with the little people seems to be the thinking.  Fine Gael was never any different and it had no interest in small farmers.  It had the fellows with the winding avenues and big trees.  By God, the members of this Government will have to hide up those trees because the people are sick and tired of them.  The saying is "To hell or to Connacht" but it will be to hell or to Connacht for Fine Gael if it backs this deal.</p>  <p>  The lads beside me backed the Lisbon treaty twice but I was the bigger fool in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party at the time.  That was the start of the selling out of our people.  It sold out de Valera's party and the struggle of the War of Independence.  We are being told by Europe what is good for us.  Saint Leo negotiated the backstop and said the deal was secure nearly a year and a half ago.  Where is it now?  Briste.  T&aacute; s&eacute; imithe.  The Mercosur deal was going through all the time, as the Government knew.  Tweedledum and Tweedledee were going to Europe to save us.  The Government should vote against this now and send a signal to Europe and the rest of the world that we will not have this and we will stand for our people.  That is before the people come here to tear out the Government.  We had vermin in part of the building yesterday but what the Government has done to the people is nearly as bad.  It does not care about them.  It is destroying the people while it is in bed with the banks.  Shame on them.</p></speech>

This proposal will affect Ireland much more than any other European country in the same way a hard Brexit will affect Ireland much more than any other European country.  The effects of the Mercosur deal may fade into insignificance if we have a hard Brexit as by the time it comes along, it may not make a lot of difference because there will not be many beef farmers left.  In my constituency, particularly west Clare, suckler farming is the mainstay of farming income.  If that is destroyed by a hard Brexit, the Mercosur deal will not make much difference.</p>  <p>  Another issue being faced by west Clare farmers and others around the country is the price that they get from meat factories.  There is a major problem as the retail price in supermarkets for meat is several times what the farmer receives for producing that beef.  The middle men are making more money than the producers.  These are two important issues for the beef industry.  We have fair trade in this country for coffee and fruit and vegetables but there is not fair trade in the production of beef.  We need beef that is traceable, of good quality and in which we can have confidence.  Mercosur is destroying the indigenous populations in South America, where rainforest is being cut down, and this is very serious.  The environmental damage that this causes is also something that should be taken into account by this Government and Europe.</p></speech>

They are very angry.  They are already squeezed by the factories and if Brexit happens, they know they will be squeezed further.  It is outlandish to think the Government is considering a deal with Mercosur when it complies with no rules and regulations.  The animals are not tagged or anything.  There is foot and mouth disease in those countries.  Against this we can see how all farmers here for at least 20 years have gone through every hoop and met the highest standards.  There are inspections every day and Department vets are on top of them.  They comply with every regulation so it is outlandish to think we could even consider this deal.</p><p>It is of no benefit to the people of rural Ireland, the small farmers and the decent people from Kerry and all over the country who came to protest outside the gates of Leinster House today.  Why would the Government even consider it when it is of no benefit to those people?  It will hurt them, drive them into the ground and finish them.  All those people want to do is to continue what their fathers did before them, to carry that on and hand the farm down to the generation following them in a slightly better condition.  This Government has not helped farmers with the factories and is going to hurt them further by even entertaining this agreement.  This deal is with a crowd from South America that are complying with no rules and regulations.  They are breaking every rule in the book.</p> <p> Commissioner Hogan had a cheek to ask Ireland to cut down production and plant more land when hundreds of acres are being cut down every day.  Back in 2013, the then Minster for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, told farmers to increase production.  What kind of a crowd is the Government?  The truth is that the Government is supporting Hogan.</p></speech>

Today, over 2,000 farmers from west Cork and throughout the country, led by the Irish Beef Plan movement, protested outside the D&aacute;il.  Most of them left their wellingtons behind them because many beef farmers know it is all over because the Government has sold them down the swanny and they are going down the tubes.  The Government should be proud of itself.</p>  <p>  Those farmers are angry because they have listened to Ministers and the Taoiseach finding a nice way out of saying they are backing this deal in the past week.  There are 80,000 beef farmers, each of whom spends &euro;30,000 in the local economy.  The loss of that spend in local villages will lead to further closures of shops, pubs and schools in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  This Government has stood idly by while towns and villages have died before our eyes.  The &euro;100 million to support beef farmers that was announced before the local and European elections was a sop to get a few people elected.  It looks as if the devil is in the detail because no one knows who is entitled to that money.  The Beef Plan Movement must play a big part in this with other farm organisations.  They were united outside the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today.  I call on the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, and the Beef Plan Movement to stand together and stop rotten beef from coming into this country.  Stop Fine Gael selling us down the swanny one more time.</p>  <p>  The only way the 2,000 people who were outside the gates of Leinster House today feel there is a way forward is if this Government is booted out.  I call on my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues to bring this Government down.  We must bring it down if we are to save rural Ireland and the beef farmers in this country.</p></speech>

I wonder how the farmers outside the gates of Leinster House feel about their concerns being described as overblown and disingenuous by the Commissioner.  He wanted to point out that the central tenet of the Mercosur deal is that trade should not happen at the expense of the environment and labour conditions, yet all of the evidence points to the contrary.  We know that the EU recently had to impose a temporary halt on Brazilian meat imports from certain plants as a result of revelations regarding contaminated meat and a culture of lax regulation, including bribery of key agricultural officials to turn a blind eye to poor hygiene, atrocious labour conditions and a disregard for environmental concerns.</p><p>Ireland has passed a climate emergency motion.  This is a time when climate protesters throughout Europe are making their voices heard.  People know we are on the climate precipice and significant action is required if we are to offset some of the damage already inflicted.  In the absence of proper commitments to environmental sustainability from the US and China, it is the role of the EU to take a leadership role on the sustainable agenda.</p><p>Beef farmers are in the spotlight at the moment but the poultry industry would also be significantly impacted by the Mercosur deal.  There are concerns about chlorinated chicken coming through the back door if there is no Border post Brexit.  This deal would mean that some of the meat produced to that standard would be coming through the front door.  Producing food to a high standard costs money.  If others are producing low-quality food at a reduced cost, it is obvious that it will impact the overall standards and quality available in the food sector generally.</p><p>It is important that Ireland does trade deals and benefits from them but the standards must be such that we do not trade ourselves out of an industry.  There is no doubt that we must create a more sustainable farming sector and that has to be done by working with the sector.  Brexit is obviously a huge risk to the sector and this deal is a challenge too far.  The Social Democrats will be supporting this Sinn F&eacute;in motion.</p></speech>

My 75 colleagues in the European Parliament intend to vote against this deal when it is presented.  That will be critical because every vote is going to count.  The question for parties here is not only how we think in this Chamber but what their colleagues in the European Parliament are going to do.</p>  <p>  The Green Party is going to vote against the Mercosur agreement in Europe because we think the standards that are being put in place cannot be enforced.  There is no real enforcement mechanism on the environmental and labour standards that are cited by the parties supporting this agreement.  </p>  <p>  One cannot ignore the fact that the Government in Brazil is a threat to the local, indigenous people and to the Amazon in a way that is a threat to us all.  The European Union is talking about preserving certain values, principles and standards in global trade and I cannot see how the EU can do a deal under which those considerations are dispatched.  How can we do a deal when the Brazilian Government is fundamentally opposed to the values we represent?</p>  <p>  This is a critical moment in time.  As Deputy Harty said, there is a real prospect that, if a no-deal Brexit occurs, our farming community will be in havoc and facing a real crisis, beyond anything comparable in this country for a long time.  Mercosur presents a similar threat to that posed by Brexit but it should be a signal for us to change our ways and that the current model of how we pay and support Irish farm families is not working and needs to change.  We have an opportunity to do this under the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We in the Green Party have been saying we should pay our farmers properly for protecting biodiversity at home.  It is not just the Amazon we need to look after.  We have our own equivalent here in the peat bogs we have let go and lost. </p>  <p>  We must pay our farmers for being scientific and expert in restoring pristine water quality.  I understand that is allowed for in the new CAP rules.  Let us pay our farmers properly for training a whole new generation of young farmers.  The current system is not serving Irish farming.  The average age for a beef farmer is 57 and rising.  Before those men and women retire, let us pay them properly for training a whole new generation of young people into Irish farming who have expertise on how we manage and use our land.  What the environmental movement needs more than anything is farmers with real skill and knowledge of local land conditions.  We should also pay them for storing carbon.  </p>  <p>  Perhaps most importantly, we must pay farmers a proper price for high quality food.  We are currently trading on an Origin Green brand and getting a commodity price on the international markets.  That is a fact and the core of the problem.</p>  <p>  We produce high quality food which, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, is tagged and well husbanded compared to other parts of the world.  We should be getting a premium for that and we are not.  We should start at home by developing local, indigenous markets where there is a better connection between the consumer and the farmer and it is not always the retailer and processor who make all the money. </p></speech>
