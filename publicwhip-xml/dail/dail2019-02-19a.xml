    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900003#A00200"><p>There are two further serious reports in the news media today on the continuing saga of the national children's hospital.  There is one in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>which is headlined &quot;Secret plan to manage hospital fallout [...]&quot; and another in <i>The Irish Times</i>which is headlined &quot;Children's hospital overrun would have happened regardless [...]&quot;.  The articles reference a confidential report which the HSE prepared having been asked to do so by the Department of Health.  The minutes of the meeting of the joint construction and finance sub-committee of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 30 August are particularly revealing because they show that there was significant unease and concern about escalating costs.  They also reveal that there were significant efforts to keep the news under wraps, including the signing by approximately 25 members of confidentiality clauses.  The meeting took place three days after the Minister for Health ad been told about a potential overspend of &euro;391 million.  One wonders whether this overall secrecy fed into the misleading of the D&aacute;il in the answer Deputy Cowen received to his parliamentary question which, as we now know, was not correct.</p><p>The articles also describe a meeting that was held with a public relations agency to discuss the communications fall-out from the overspend.  They state the meeting with Q4PR examined two scenarios: awarding the phase B contract to BAM or not awarding it to BAM and going with plan B.  The minutes show that Mr. John Pollack noted that a paper had been issued and that Anne Butler agreed on some actions that were required.  That level of engagement with a public relations company in deciding whether the contract was to be awarded to BAM or whether the project was to be retendered as plan B was quite extraordinary.  Two issues emerge, one of which relates to the secrecy.  One of the 25 people is the top procurement officer in the Civil Service.  There is a code, under which he is obliged to report to the Minister, particularly where there are serious weaknesses in controls that have not been addressed, despite having been drawn to the attention of the board or the chairperson.  There is an obligation, particularly in a non-commercial State body, to provide that material for the Minister of the day.</p><p>The main message emanating from this seems to be that the Government's focus was on controlling the message, not the cost.  Whatever else it did, it would control the message around the overspend.  There was no real focus on getting the costs down.  It is quite extraordinary.  On looking at all the photographs and videos on the national children's hospital, the Government was good on the hard hats and the yellow vests.  It was good on the videos, YouTube, you name it; there was no lack of communication around this hospital right from the get-go.  It was all about getting the project started.  It was even started without the detailed design being worked out.  Get boots on the ground, get it working from the public relations perspective.  That rendered the Taoiseach very vulnerable when it came to costs and taking a hard line on cost management and control.  Is it still the Government's position that the chief procurement officer did not discuss or alert senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to this overrun until November, notwithstanding what was going on around August?  Can the Taoiseach rule out that the confidentiality around this was not a factor in the Minister misleading the D&aacute;il last September?  Will he confirm that all documentation and reports pertaining to this issue will be made public once and for all and that this drip feed of information is stopped?</p></speech>

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is an agency that was established by the Oireachtas, empowered and given the statutory responsibility to design, build and equip the children's hospital.  There are no politicians on that board or any of those committees and there are no political advisers on any of them.  Once again this sounds like one of Deputy Martin's conspiracy theories.  There are no politicians or political advisers on this board or any of those committees.  If the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board had a PR or communications plan to explain the increased costs of the children's hospital, it did not do a very good job of it, quite frankly.  I think we would all agree on that, given that it was not explained or communicated very well either to the Government or to the public thereafter.</p></speech>

That is yet to be determined.  The PwC report currently under way may well answer that question.  I think it is probable that what has happened here is that the cost of building this project, this massive hospital, this very complex development, was underestimated.  This is not a case of taxpayers' money being wasted.</p></speech>

Less than 20% of the project cost has been spent so far.  This is a case of the real cost of the project being underestimated.  We have seen examples of that in the past with other major structural projects, although not in the past decade.</p>  <p>  In respect of Mr. Paul Quinn, he was appointed by the Minister for Health to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  He does not represent either the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Office of Government Procurement on that board.  He was appointed because of his procurement expertise.  </p></speech>

The Taoiseach should not talk to anybody in here about yarns.  People are quite frankly fed up with yarns, public relations and spin.  They want substance, facts and precision.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach made reference to Mr. Paul Quinn, the chief procurement officer.  The Taoiseach's defence or response is simply not tenable.  It drives a coach and four through circular 12/2010, the protocol for civil servants nominated to the boards of non-commercial State bodies.  It reads: "Where there is a significant public policy issue at stake or a disagreement within the board on a major public policy issue, the civil servant should request the Chairman to notify the [relevant] Minister or, failing that, notify the Minister himself-herself."  There are serious weaknesses in controls that have not been addressed, despite them having been drawn to the attention of the board or chairperson.  We are talking about a &euro;391 million overspend which the Government was alerted to last August.  It is the Government's position that the chief procurement officer, who is a civil servant, with loyalty to the Government, the State and the taxpayer, was prevented somehow from telling his line Minister, who is responsible for the overall expenditure of the State, the facts around the alarming growth in expenditure for this project.  I do not believe that is a tenable response.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, nurses and midwives were forced to engage in strike action because their legitimate and correct concerns in respect of the recruitment and retention crisis were ignored by the Taoiseach and his Government.  GPs have protested outside Leinster House at the Government's failure to invest adequately in primary care.  Hospital waiting lists have continued to grow, and last week reached new record levels, with more than 523,000 patients now waiting for an outpatient consultation and over 72,000 waiting for an inpatient procedure.</p><p>That is absolutely scandalous.  The trolley crisis continues unabated.  Today there are 512 patients on trolleys in hospitals throughout the State.  Despite this, only half of the additional beds promised in the HSE's winter plan have been opened, which is absolute madness.  Last week we learned that women who had availed of a smear test following the CervicalCheck scandal last year were waiting up to six months to get the test results.  To top it all off, we have the calamity surrounding the cost overrun &ndash; I heard the Taoiseach today spinning it as a cost underestimation - on the national children's hospital project.  It is going to have a serious knock-on effect in the delivery of other health projects throughout the State.  For example, in Limerick the provision of a new 60-bed ward block at University Hospital Limerick is the latest project to face the axe, despite the fact that University Hospital Limerick is consistently one of the hospitals worst affected by overcrowding in the State.  This is a serious blow to people across the mid-west region and, quite frankly, unforgivable.<br/><br/>In that regard, I acknowledge the announcement this morning by the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, An Teachta Harty, that he would support Sinn F&eacute;in's motion of no confidencein the Minister for Health tomorrow evening.  That is significant and I am sure An Teachta Harty has not taken the decision lightly.  I am sure he has arrived at the conclusion, with the rest of us, that something has to be done because we cannot tolerate the health service in this crisis.  The Taoiseach's friends in Fianna F&aacute;il who, as he says, spin yarns may well be prepared to stand aside, allow the <i>status quo</i>to prevail and allow an incompetent Minister to remain in office, but we will not.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and Fianna F&aacute;il will have the opportunity to put up or shut up tomorrow evening in that regard.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Deputy was not here and that she was otherwise occupied, perhaps in Northern Ireland or London &ndash; I am unsure.  I outlined in detail exactly which projects would be affected.  In the health service there is none.  Of the &euro;100 million that has to be found within other parts of the capital budget, &euro;24 million will come from the Department of Health.  The Department of Health has a fund of &euro;94 million for minor capital repairs, equipment and replacement.  That budget has been reduced to &euro;70 million, which is still represents an increase on the budget last year.  Therefore, it does not affect any of the individual new builds or new healthcare projects.  I am happy to reiterate that point today, but  I do not think for one second, a Cheann Comhairle, that that will stop Deputies from all over the country from trying to claim every project is being delayed or axed, as the Deputy says.</p></speech>

I have already answered a question on Limerick.  I understand this is now part of Sinn Fein's spin all over the country.  I am advised that Deputy McDonald was on local radio in Wexford last week, claiming that the Enniscorthy flood relief scheme was also delayed because of the children's hospital.  This, of course, not the case and the scheme is on schedule and the project has been allocated &euro;40 million plus.

It was a truly historic referendum.  The central message was clear that people with a crisis pregnancy should be cared for in Ireland and should not be forced abroad and that people should be able to make these decisions freely without barrier or obstruction.  In the last 24 hours we have heard that women may face intimidation from anti-choice zealots in hospitals, clinics and car parks.  The Taoiseach needs to give the date for urgent safety-zone legislation.</p><p>We are also hearing of women struggling to get access and who are left outside of the law.  I want to ask the Taoiseach about women with tragic foetal diagnoses, people who had such an impact during the referendum.  There are worrying signs that the very women whose stories resonated throughout the country are still being forced abroad.  A number of women have contacted my office and three of them have had to go to England for terminations for medical reasons.  In the latest case, a woman - let us call her Mary - contacted me.  She had a scan in Portiuncula Hospital and the obstetrician told her that there was a muchal translucency with fluid around the neck of 8 to 9 mm and possible Edwards syndrome.  She was told there was only 15% chance of delivery and the baby might live an hour or so.</p><p>However, the doctor then said, for whatever reason, that nothing could be done, as she was over 12 weeks.  Mary was handed the names of three hospitals in England.  By the way, she also said a staff member had treated her like a leper after this point.  She later rang the HSE and was directed to University Hospital Galway where, despite a GP telephoning and apparently making an arrangement for a scan, a doctor told her on arrival that there was no one there to see her and that she would not get to the second trimester.  At that stage, she and her husband had had enough.  They walked out and within hours had made an appointment to travel to England.  Of course, it would have been at great expense, in having to have children looked after, making work arrangements etc.  Mary said to me: "I would lose my head if I had to continue this pregnancy, but Ireland will do nothing for me."</p> <p> All of the women who have contacted me have individual stories, but they have one thing in common - last May they voted never knowing that they were going to face this situation but thinking they would be cared for if they did.  They have asked me to put some questions to the Taoiseach.  Why can a pregnant person in another country sit down with a doctor, get all of the facts and then come to a decision with her family?  In this country why is a distinction made between fatal and severe abnormalities that is not made in other countries?  One of the women who is a nurse asked who made the decision on what conditions got onto the list of fatal foetal abnormalities-----</p></speech>

The women also asked why a 28-day rule had been introduced.  It is difficult for doctors to live by and was never part of the referendum conversation.  Does the Taoiseach agree that conservative Catholic control of hospitals and a very narrow law with criminalisation are having a chilling effect and forcing such women to travel abroad?</p></speech>

I believe abortion is very much a private and personal matter.  I do not believe any woman decides or chooses to end her pregnancy lightly.  No woman seeking this service and no doctor, midwife, nurse or anyone else involved in providing it should be subject to intimidation in any way in the course of going about that work or seeking to avail of what is now a legal health service in Ireland.  As Deputies will be aware, the legislation to enact and realise the decision made by the people was passed by the Houses.  There are now 274 GPs nationally who have signed up to provide terminations in early pregnancy, while there about ten maternity hospital units which are providing the service.  When one considers that roughly between ten and 14 women end their pregnancies in Ireland every day, 274 GPs are there to help them and ten maternity units provide the service.  The service will continue to be developed in the months and years ahead.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question about the difference between fatal and severe abnormalities, that was a decision that was discussed in the Oireachtas.  As an Oireachtas - the Deputy participated in all of those debates, which is why she should know the answer to her own question - we decided that disability would not be grounds for the termination of a pregnancy but that fatal abnormalities would be.  A severe abnormality is very often a disability.  That is a decision we made as a House - that we would make that distinction and that disability would not be grounds for a termination after 12 weeks.  I do not really want to comment on any individual case.  I know that the diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality must be a very difficult one for anybody - the mum, the dad and the family - when in a much wanted pregnancy one finds out something has gone wrong.  Without knowing the facts of any individual case, it would be inappropriate for me to comment.  I am aware that the Deputy raised an individual case here in the past, the facts of which turned out to be different from those that she-----</p></speech>

That is my point.  The Taoiseach has not bothered to comment on the problems women are encountering in reality in our hospitals and, I am sure, particularly in rural areas.  What we need now is a review of the law sooner rather than later, particularly the 28-day rule that was never part of the national conversation.  The Taoiseach is right.  Politicians chickened out on what the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly recommended, which was severe foetal abnormalities to be considered as well.  Those women are paying the price now and it is really not helpful of the Taoiseach to conflate this with disability when he knows these conditions are very complex and interact with one another.</p> <p> Finally, we need separation of church and State.  We need fully secular hospitals where there is not such a culture that sends people on their way but where the Catholic Church no longer has a say in these matters and influences medical staff as well.  We need that sooner rather than later.  Is the Taoiseach willing to at least review the 28-day rule, which many people cite as being problematic?</p></speech>

This service is new.  It was never going to be a case of being able to start it in one day.  Any new medical service, any new public service, has to develop and evolve, and it will develop and evolve.  Unfortunately, it may not be up to scratch for some women and patients now but we will see to it that it improves and evolves as it is developed.</p>  <p>  I have to take issue with one of the Deputy&rsquo;s remarks.

We decided that as a House.  If the Deputy wants to reopen the debate about whether disability should be grounds for termination, that is the her choice.  It is not that we chickened out.  We decided as a House.  We said during the referendum campaign when we asked people to vote "Yes", or at least I did, that we would not allow disability to be grounds for terminations after 12 weeks.</p></speech>

The only thing that is absolutely certain at this point is that all of it could have been avoided.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Dr. Jimmy Sheehan, Ireland's leading hospital developer with six decades of experience in delivering world class health projects, in conjunction with Dr. Fin Breathnach, our premier paediatric oncologist, told the Oireachtas health committee that opting for the St. James's site would lead to catastrophic cost overruns.  I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group presented this information in a Private Members' motion on 29 March 2017, a full month before the Government signed off on the first part of the contract.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach and his Government chose to listen to an inexperienced Minister who did not have six days' work experience in the Department of Health instead of listening to the experience of a professional hospital developer and a medical man of some renown with six decades of experience.</p>  <p>  Every concern Dr. Sheehan, the parents and everybody else raised in 2016 has now come to pass.  He has been ignored and sidelined, as was the Connolly for Kids campaign, but above all the parents of the most sick children, the Jack and Jill Foundation, Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Healy and many others repeatedly told the Government about inevitable access difficulties to the site.  Not only was the Government told but every Member in this House who cared to listen was told.  One would think that having accurately predicted both the cost overruns and the lack of capacity at the site, which we visited last week &ndash; it is nothing but a big black hole &ndash; that Dr. Sheehan and his colleagues would be welcomed with open arms and asked for their advice on how to proceed, especially now that the company, BAM, has offered to withdraw from the project and go back into negotiations, which I welcome, yet that has not happened.  The Government seems determined not to learn from past mistakes.  If the Taoiseach wants to talk about yarns, that is the yarn that will be told about him.  </p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, I wrote to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health asking it to invite Dr. Sheehan and his colleagues back in to engage with the committee on possible solutions.  Now is the opportunity for that.  The committee rejected the suggestion, which appalled me, and gave the extraordinary reason that it had already heard what they had to say in 2016, which has now proven to be true, and we are now in a hole.</p><p>Can the Taoiseach believe that the committee objected and refused, as if nothing had changed or happened in the meantime?  This beggars belief.  It is some yarn.</p> <p> Two years ago, the Connolly for Kids group wrote to the Taoiseach personally, as it had to the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and handed in some 60,000 signatures expressing concern but they were not listened to.  The group did not even get a reply from the Taoiseach himself and received a one-line reply from former Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny.</p> <p> I have worked closely with Dr. Sheehan for a number of years on this issue.  He is clear that &euro;63 million in cost savings could be made with respect to the proposed underground car park for St. James's alone.  This would also avoid what has been described as the bizarre and unnecessarily dangerous decision to build a children&rsquo;s hospital above an underground car park where the risk of fire could substantially destabilise the structure, with potentially horrific consequences.</p> <p> The suggested costs of making the national children's hospital at St. James's a digital hospital are &euro;150 million.</p></speech>

Everyone had a different view, including planning experts, doctors, paediatricians, developers, you name it, on St. James's, the Mater, Tallaght, Beaumont, Blanchardstown, a site not co-located with an adult hospital at Newlands Road and another site by Belcamp near the M1.  There was never consensus among doctors, planners or anyone as to where the best site should be.   In 2012 the Government took a decision that the site should be Dublin 8 at St. James's Hospital, with satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  In doing so the Government listened to the expert group chaired by Dr. Frank Dolphin.  On that expert group were planners, developers, paediatricians and people who knew about building hospitals and where they should be located.  It was always acknowledged that it would be quicker and cheaper to build it on a greenfield site.  Nobody every doubted that.  The decision was made in favour of St. James's, on the advice of the expert group chaired by Dr. Frank Dolphin, because of the advantages of co-location with an adult hospital and a maternity hospital.  The advantages are that the hospital would be the biggest one in the State with the most advanced specialties and the most advanced opportunities for academic links and clinical research.  This is why the decision was made.  Yes, it would have been quicker and cheaper to build on a greenfield site - nobody ever argued otherwise - but it would not have been better.  When deciding to build a project like this, which will stand the test of time and will still be used by children in 100 and 150 years, one makes the right decision, not the cheapest or quickest decision.  This is why that decision was made.</p></speech>

We have a chance now to go back, re-evaluate and stall.  The St. James's site was once described in a Department of Health briefing note as "the least worst option for delivery of this priority project&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach commit to meet Dr. James Sheehan, Dr. Fin Breathnach and others?  Will he sit down in a room with them and talk to them at this stage, while BAM has offered the breathing space?</p>  <p> Relocating the children&rsquo;s hospital is not just about saving hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayers' money.  It is first and foremost about saving children&rsquo;s lives.  They must be the most important people of all.  One of the most appalling aspects of this entire tragedy is the lack of capacity to develop a co-located maternity hospital.  That is now not going to happen.  The Taoiseach knows that - if he knew anything about the whole - and if he went back to school he could add up the sums.  The maths just do not add up.  It will not happen.  This is not in keeping with international best practice and it will absolutely result in avoidable deaths in a few babies and significant disability and handicap in many other babies over the decades.</p><p>Professor Chris Fitzpatrick, an obstetrician and former master of the Coombe hospital, says maternity services co-location at St. James's Hospital is pie in the sky.  Will the Taoiseach listen to him?  Will he listen to anyone?  There is none so deaf as those who do not want to hear.  This is perhaps the most urgent reason to reassess and consider moving to a site which will permit co-location with a maternity hospital, which is vital but it will not happen at St. James's Hospital.  I again appeal to the Taoiseach to do the right thing and stop the project until a full re-evaluation is carried out by experts, not PwC, which knows nothing about construction or issues like it.  We need outside experts to tell us the very truth about what happened.</p></speech>

Since then special import licences have been granted to approximately 15 people, if not more.  Most are directed to The Hague in Holland by the Department to facilitate this.  However, supplies are becoming difficult there because of increased demand.  There has been a lack of clarity on the Minister's intentions as to when this compassionate access programme to medicinal cannabis is to be introduced.  The UK Government has authorised a new legal framework since last November and the UK will receive its first shipment of medical cannabis from Canada in the next few weeks.  I understand the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, has been in discussions with Tilray for a considerable length of time and that it was due to start early this year.  It is time for the Minister to give a comprehensive statement outlining when it is intended to bring this medicinal cannabis into the country under the aegis of the compassionate access programme.</p></speech>

Yesterday, journalists Ellen Coyne and Katie O'Neill exposed how anti-abortion campaigners are planning to protest outside healthcare centres so the need for that legislation is underscored yet again.  The Government published a Bill today to regulate health and social care professionals but it does not address this issue.  As I have said repeatedly in the Chamber, women in crisis pregnancies are being abused by charlatans on occasion and we must protect them.  I accept the bona fides of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I accepted his assurance that he was moving to regulate this area.  At a meeting on International Women's Day in 2017 officials from his Department gave the Labour Party a commitment that its Bill would be advanced before the summer of 2017.

I ask that he do so not only for the 25 children, but also for the 50 adult survivors across the State, who should have the opportunity to explore the application and relevance of this drug to their condition, namely, spinal muscular atrophy.

I understand that the committee met to consider a number of new medicines, including Kuvan, Spinraza and Translarna.  The committee must consider the evidence as to whether a drug is effective; if so, how effective; and whether the price charged by the company is fair and in line with charges in other countries.  Under the statutory process, the HSE must issue a letter to the company this week formally notifying it of the HSE's proposal.  After this, the company has another 28 days to respond and, as is the case with all medicines, has the opportunity to submit revised data on either efficacy or cost.</p></speech>

There have been several accidents and near misses on roads and injuries to persons.  Hundreds of accidents have been reported to me, particularly in areas of County Tipperary.  I refer to the foothills of the Knockmealdowns and the Galtees and the Comeragh Mountains in County Waterford.  What is the current status of the Irish deer management forum?  I assure the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, it is not a laughing matter at all, .  If a deer hits one's car, it is a traumatic experience, particularly with babies on board and so on.  When will a chairperson be appointed to the Irish deer management forum?  I call on the Departments in question, namely, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, together with the relevant stakeholders including farmers, the IFA, all the gun clubs, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and the county management committees to implement policies of best practice in every county affected by this issue, and there are many.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has pointed out repeatedly, as have other Ministers, that the Revenue Commissioners are independent.  In addition to that independence, however, the Taoiseach himself said on 13 February that the matter was under review.  The Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Finance confirmed it was under review.  Will the Taoiseach please confirm whether a decision has been made?  If not, when will it be made?  As I said, this is a cause of great distress to those who rely on food supplements, minerals, vitamins, fish oils and so on.  The introduction of the measure on 1 March will be really serious, given that we face Brexit and the consequent price increases at the end of March.</p></speech>

Revenue has stated this is the result of a re-examination of VAT legislation in the light of the recently commissioned expert report.  However, the expert report which has just been published states food supplements are food, that they are legally recognised as such and that they are required to be supplied as such in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the proposal will not proceed as planned on 1 March and that people who have due regard to their health will not be penalised in so doing?</p></speech>

As other Deputies have noted, the Government urgently needs to review and abandon the proposal.  It is worth bearing in mind that the revenue which is expected to be generated from the proposal is a miserable &euro;8 million.  Given the impact and hardship it will cause the many people who need food supplements, vitamins and so on which, in many cases, have been recommended by their doctors as necessary for their health, it would be a shocking decision to take in exchange for a miserable &euro;8 million.  I hope the Government is listening and that it will abandon the proposal.</p></speech>

That was a few weeks ago.  I do not know if the Taoiseach is aware that there is a degree of panic among that group.  For example, having the slides tested independently will cost each woman approximately &pound;2,500, but they have been told that they will not be able to claim back the money.  Commitments have been given and apologies made to the women.  In fact, the Taoiseach gave a commitment that no women would have to go to cour, but there is an ongoing fight behind the scenes on behalf of the women.  When will the <i>ex gratia </i>payments be made?  Can something be done about some of the costs the women face?</p></speech>

The tribunal which will be an alternative to court for women who wish to claim medical negligence is being established on foot of the recommendations of Mr. Justice Meenan.  It is one of only six items of legislation prioritised for this session.  Work on it is progressing well and we anticipate that it will be brought before the Houses well before the summer recess, provided matters stay on track.  The <i>ex gratia </i>payment<i></i>scheme which is a separate matter relates to the non-disclosure of the results of the clinical audit.  The Minister for Health has drafted a memo, but he needs to identify a judge and make some changes to the terms of reference.  I anticipate that the matter will come before the Cabinet next week or the week after.  The Minister needs to identify a judge who will be willing to be in charge of the scheme and to ensure the judge will agree to the terms of reference, given that a judge cannot be appointed until he or she is happy with the scheme he or she will administer.  In the case of the tribunal, however, a judge has been identified, namely, Ms Justice Mary Irvine.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach is aware, there are too many black and white cattle going into beef production at the moment and it is decimating the livelihoods of beef farmers.  The programme for Government commits to developing increased live export markets for the beef sector but to facilitate exports, we need extra lairage capacity in Cherbourg.  Will the Taoiseach direct the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to bring the key players together to put in place the additional capacity that is now urgently required to avert a catastrophe in the beef sector?</p></speech>

While the lairage facilities currently in place will manage for ten months of the year, we need additional capacity for these two months.  There are serious problems because the regulations relating to the timing for when the animals can be on trucks are rigorously applied and they cannot go to alternative lairage which is a short distance away from there.  This was raised at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine too.  The answer is for an element of the Government to step in and to ensure that we can put additional lairage in place and rent additional facilities in Cherbourg.</p></speech>

I want to preface my question by saying that I am not talking about the roll-out of the national broadband plan, nor about Brexit.  I am asking the Taoiseach and the Minister in charge of the mobile broadband task force what is happening to address the plague of dropping out of calls due to issues with mobile phone coverage.  People in businesses and living along the Border corridor are continually disadvantaged and discommoded by dropping out of calls.  It is not just along the Border but also along the Irish Sea, especially in the Louth-Meath area, due to connectivity with the Isle of Man, and the ease of roaming in and out of those areas.  What steps are being taken to ensure that, regardless of Brexit, an agreement is reached between the Irish and UK Governments that there will be no return to roaming charges and that the shared broadband services on this island will be shared for all in an all-Ireland economy?</p></speech>

I am still getting queries from substitute teachers who have not been paid proper wages due to what appears to be a mess-up in the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister promised that he would sort it and it has not been sorted.  He also promised that he would give information about it.  The only information that substitute teachers who are down money have is the information on social media or from when they can get through to the Department or Revenue, which they can find very difficult.  I would be grateful if the Minister would tell the D&aacute;il when this will be resolved and when he will pay those wages.</p><p>Can he institute a campaign within his Department to let these substitute teachers know what is going on?  He is desperate for substitute teachers because there is such a shortage and we should not be doing anything to put them off.  They deserve to be paid their wages. </p></speech>

We still have to work through another cohort.  I am happy to give the Deputy a daily update because I hope the remaining teachers will be sorted within the next few days.</p>  <p>  I also want to acknowledge these substitute teachers who have had to deal with this very difficult situation.  They have been in touch with the Department because they needed reassurances to pay rent and mortgages and we were happy to provide them.  Teachers are due holiday pay at Easter.

A family member must be with them.  Parents are strangled trying to bring their children to college or wherever or trying to bring them to and from work.  Given that they cannot drive alone on a provisional licence, can the Taoiseach explain to me why the cost of insurance has not come down but has in fact gone up?

However, the critical issue of access to landowners' property could not be addressed because access routes were never submitted for approval to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and so were not part of the decision this morning.  Not one single access route has been submitted to local authorities.  Not one single official access route has been sent to any landowner and there is no agreement for access routes at landowner level.  Nothing has changed on the ground in all the time that I have raised this with the Taoiseach and Ministers.

On 4 September a High Court decision was made in respect of pre-qualification tenders for St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin.  This has led to long delays for the children, the teachers and the whole school community in Monasterevin.  This has wider implications for every single project which has been put out for tender by the Department of Education and Skills because the Department now has to review all its procedures in respect of pre-qualification tenders.  When will the Department have new guidelines in place which will allow it to put projects out to tender?  Until it does so every single school project in the country will be impeded.  This has to be a matter of urgency for the Department.</p></speech>

That decision targeted young provisional drivers.  The Taoiseach directed the Garda, which is now impounding as many as eight cars a day.  This is bringing in revenue of &euro;8,000.  I hope the Taoiseach is proud of that.  It is the hard-pressed parents who have to pay this money.  These young people want to be called for driver tests.  When will the Taoiseach ensure a realistic and acceptable waiting period for driver tests?  The Taoiseach has criminalised these drivers and hurt their parents.

The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority are working on reducing the waiting time for tests to less than 12 weeks.  It is important to say again that the concept of the provisional licence was abolished a very long time ago.  There are no provisional licences anymore and there have not been for years.  It is called a "learner permit".  It is not a licence to drive.  The reason young drivers have learner permits is that they have either not done a test or have failed their test.  It is, therefore, not safe for them to drive on their own.  Above all this is a road safety measure.</p></speech>

I would expect that if participation in this project is to be discussed and approved by this House that it would first get a full report based on what was said in the committee.  I ask that we get a report on the points raised at the committee meeting before this matter is nodded through.  Moving from solely engaging in peacekeeping missions, through which we have built up a significant reputation throughout the world, to involvement in whatever is meant by military search capability building is a very serious change to the role of Irish Defence Forces.  This is something about which I am deeply concerned.</p></speech>

We discussed developments in Northern Ireland and our shared interest in seeing the devolved institutions restored.  We also discussed possible structures for future engagement post Brexit.</p>  <p>  On Brexit, I restated the EU position that the backstop is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement.  It was negotiated in good faith over many months, it is finely balanced, and it was a compromise in itself.  It was approved by the 28 EU leaders in November.  No other solution has yet been found that ensures that the absence of a hard border in all circumstances can be guaranteed.  I reiterated our wish to see the withdrawal agreement ratified so that negotiations on a future partnership between the EU and the UK in the areas of economy, trade and security can start as soon as possible.  We did not discuss any technical aspects of Brexit.  The Prime Minister indicated that further consultations are taking place in London and with the European Commission in Brussels.  We agreed to stay in touch over the coming period.</p>  <p>  Prior to our meeting on 8 February, I was in contact with the Prime Minister on Tuesday, 29 January and we spoke by phone on Wednesday, 30 January following the previous day's votes in Westminster.  I set out once again the Irish and EU position on the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and the backstop therein, noting that the latest developments in Westminster had simply reinforced the need for a solution that is legally binding and practically operable. </p></reply>

There are 38 days to go until Britain is due to exit the European Union according to the current law of both the United Kingdom and the European Union.  We all understand that there is chaos in London and that it is still unclear what would satisfy a majority in the House of Commons.  The neat daily commentary we get from our own Government about what London needs to do is fine, but the issue today is what the Government is going to do and what it is doing.</p>  <p>  For three weeks in a row I have asked the Taoiseach to answer a very basic question.  If no deal or no delay is agreed in the coming weeks, what will happen on our borders both at sea and on land?  We are so close to Brexit that some businesses are already taking orders and scheduling production which will take effect on or after 29 March.  These businesses need to know a hell of a lot more than that our Government is not contemplating or planning certain things.  The Taoiseach has said what he is not planning and what he is not contemplating.  What do these businesses need to do to prepare for a no-deal scenario next month?  Can they be assured that no additional steps will be required of them if they are crossing the Border in 38 days' time?  The Taoiseach has repeatedly made it clear that a failure to have a withdrawal agreement and something like the backstop would mean disruption.  He needs to start being open about what exactly that disruption will be.  What will happen on 29 March in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  </p>  <p>  It seems clear that a text of some sort is being discussed with the United Kingdom and that our Government is fully informed about what is in it.  Will the Taoiseach outline the nature of that text to us in the course of his answer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900017#P04000"><p>We are now at ten minutes to midnight.  If St. Patrick's week is removed from the 38 days, there are fewer than 30 working days until the UK's withdrawal, assuming that everybody will be working weekends in the lead up to it.  <i>The Irish Times</i>today said that the British focus is now on legal language which would put a limit on the backstop in respect of content, duration, or both.</p><p>The Taoiseach has spoken with the Prime Minister several times recently, as he said, on the phone and in person.  Has she told the Taoiseach specifically what legal changes to the withdrawal agreement she and the British Government are seeking?  Have the Taoiseach's EU counterparts advised him as to what the British are actually looking for in their negotiations?  Has an extension to the Article 50 period been considered in the discussions?  Is the Taoiseach aware as to whether the Prime Minister is trying to negotiate that?  An extension of the Article 50 timeline probably would suit a lot of people in Ireland because it would give us some more time in which to prepare.  Has there been an agreement about any likely impact on the European elections in May in the context of an extension of Article 50?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900018#Q00200"><p>I want to ask the Taoiseach about another aspect of British politics which we heard echoed today on "Morning Ireland", when a contributor echoed a position of Theresa May's about which we should have something to say.  We had a journalist making a casual connection between support for Palestinians, criticism of the Israeli state and anti-Semitism, essentially suggesting they were all the same thing.  This has been an extremely worrying narrative that Theresa May has echoed in attacking Jeremy Corbyn.  They are attacking what they describe as the hard left and accusing them, incredibly, of being anti-Semitic because they support Palestinians and are critical of the apartheid policies of Israel.  We all abhor anti-Semitism and should oppose it in the most robust fashion.  However, it is absolutely unacceptable that an Orwellian narrative is now spreading across Britain.  It had better not spread over here; it needs to be resisted.  It suggests that legitimate criticism of apartheid policies in Israel and of the persecution of Palestinians by the Israeli state somehow equates to anti-Semitism.  Opposing apartheid policies and racism should actually lead us to be critical of what Israel is doing, not to be silent about what Israel is doing.  Precisely because we oppose racism and abhor the suffering of Jewish people in the past, it is absolutely important to criticise what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people.</p></speech>

Can the Taoiseach confirm that he told Mrs. May at dinner that this is the case?  Can he confirm that the backstop cannot be time limited in any respect and cannot contain unilateral exit clauses, which would render the backstop entirely meaningless?  Can he confirm that he had that conversation again with Mrs. May, to make that clear?  Can he shed some light on what she shared with him in terms of her game plan to move things forward?  We are now advised that the British Attorney General has a wording which would involve, it is speculated, a time limit on the backstop.  Did the Taoiseach have a conversation with Mrs. May about that?  Has text been shared?  Does the European Union have text?  Has the Taoiseach seen it?  Did Mrs. May make any reference to moves to change the political declaration rather than the withdrawal agreement itself?  Can the Taoiseach shed any light on these matters?</p></speech>

I think that is achievable.  It may not be achievable in the next few weeks but it is achievable and we are working towards that.  On what may happen if there is no deal on 29 March, we must always remember that 29 March is a UK deadline, one set in Britain for Britain.  It was not set by Ireland or the European Union.  A no-deal Brexit is not a threat that Ireland or the European Union is making.  It can be taken off the table by the United Kingdom at any time, either by revoking Article 50 or by seeking an extension of it.  We will listen to any requests the British may make for that.  I was asked by some Deputies about texts being discussed.  No texts have been discussed or shared with us and I have seen no text nor have I discussed any text.  We are not being secretive about a text that does not exist.  I imagine that is another conspiracy theory.</p></speech>

That was not the Deputy's first question.  In respect of no deal, we are making preparations at the ports and airports.  We have control of land that we need at Rosslare and Dublin.  We have control of Dublin Airport and will be able to enforce the <i>acquis</i>if we need to at the ports and airports.  In respect of land borders, I have said many times in this House that we are not making any preparations for physical infrastructure, controls or checks on the land Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  As I have said before, that does create a real dilemma and a real problem for us.  In the event of no deal, the United Kingdom will have obligations under the World Trade Organisation and we will have obligations to protect our Single Market and customs union, of which we will continue to be a full part.  That would create a dilemma for both countries and for the European Union.  Therefore the only solution which can assure that we do not see the emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is an agreement on customs, a common customs territory, call it what you will, and regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the European Union or perhaps the whole UK and the European Union.  That is what we have negotiated.  I do not think we will get anything very different from the agreement that is on the table now.  Even if there is a period of uncertainty after 29 March, we will end up with an agreement not dissimilar from what we have now.  That is why we should ratify it now and not subject citizens and businesses to that level of uncertainty or potential damage.</p><p>The UK Government has been quite open about what it is seeking.  It is seeking to explore alternative arrangements which it believes could replace the backstop.  We have yet to see any such alternative arrangements written down in legal form, let alone operating and tested and working anywhere in the world.  They seek the possibility of a time limit and we have explained why a backstop with a time limit is not a backstop, as the Prime Minister herself eloquently explained when she was advocating for the backstop.  An insurance policy that can be cancelled at the time one most needs it is not an insurance policy at all.  They have sought a unilateral exit clause and again we have explained why it is something we cannot accept.</p><p>I have raised the issue of Article 50 potentially being extended and the Prime Minister has made her position clear.  She intends that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union on time on the date it has set.  On the European elections, there are conflicting legal opinions but the general consensus is that if Article 50 is extended to the end of June or early July, the European elections will not have to take place in the United Kingdom as the new European Parliament does not actually sit for the first time until early July.  However, if Article 50 were extended beyond early July, it would be necessary for the European elections to be held in the United Kingdom, as UK citizens would continue to be EU citizens and therefore under the treaties would have a right to be represented in the European Parliament.  We have made provision in our legislation that if the elections do take place in the United Kingdom, the candidates last elected in Dublin and in Ireland South will not take up their seats in the European Parliament until such a time as the United Kingdom has left.  Another detail which is unfortunate but we can find no way around is that should the United Kingdom leave before the European elections take place, UK citizens resident in Ireland will not be able to vote in the European elections as the treaties say that the European Parliament represents the citizens of the European Union.</p><p>UK citizens will not be EU citizens after Brexit.  They will continue to be able to vote in local elections, D&aacute;il elections and Seanad elections, but will not be able to vote in European elections.  Unfortunately, we could not find a way around that as it would require an amendment to the treaties.</p> <p> I do not think for a second that criticism of Israel is inherently anti-Semitic, and I very much agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett in that regard.  The occupation has gone on for far too long.  This Government is a very strong supporter of a two-state solution and a just and lasting peace as there can be no peace that is lasting that is not just.  We believe the settlements are wrong.  The T&aacute;naiste is currently hosting a two day retreat on the Middle East in Farmleigh House and Iveagh House, with foreign ministers from Arab countries, France, Bulgaria, Sweden and other countries.  We are very committed to Palestinian statehood and a two-state solution.  We do not believe it is inherently anti-Semitic to be critical of the state of Israel.  Perhaps Deputy Boyd Barrett is missing the point about the concerns some people have.  It is not so much about criticisms of Israel but the double standards of some people who are very critical of Israel for doing certain things that are wrong while turning a blind eye when similar things are done by regimes in places such as Zimbabwe, Cuba, Venezuela or North Korea.  They naturally wonder if there is something particular or different about Israel that singles it out for criticisms-----</p></speech>

I met with the DUP leader, Ms Arlene Foster, the vice president of Sinn F&eacute;in, Ms Michelle O'Neill, the UUP leader, Mr. Robin Swann, the Alliance Party leader, Ms Naomi Long, and Mr. Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP.  I had the opportunity, the night before, to engage with the convenor of the Green Party of Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The meetings provided an opportunity to engage with the Northern Ireland political parties and to hear their views on the latest Brexit developments and the current political situation in the North.  We discussed what could be done to get the institutions in Northern Ireland functioning again, and I once again emphasised our commitment to all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all its institutions.</p>  <p>  The Government wants to see an agreement in place to secure the operation of the devolved institutions, and will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek urgent progress in that area in the period immediately ahead.  </p>  <p>  On Brexit, I outlined to each of the Northern Ireland parties the Government's position, shared by the European Union, that the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation, and represents the best way to secure an orderly Brexit while avoiding a return to a hard border.</p></reply>

While the inquiry into that scheme showed that Sinn F&eacute;in was more deeply involved than it admits, to the extent that its Minister of Finance took instructions from a secretive internal party structure, many other reasons are now being cited for the refusal to re-establish the democratic government of Northern Ireland.  The DUP is clearly wrong and in breach of its responsibilities in its opposition to important equality measures, but there is no indication that the sheer gravity of the Brexit threat is getting through to those involved in the talks.  It is quite extraordinary that, at a moment of great peril for Northern Ireland, it has been without a functioning Executive and Assembly for over 760 days.</p>  <p>  Most people of goodwill will have seen the latest discussions and reacted with despair.  Can the Taoiseach tell us exactly what is being done to try to break this cycle of failing talks?  When we talk to the parties the only issue we hear about is the assigning of blame.  Is it still the policy that nothing will happen until after the Brexit issue is resolved?  The Taoiseach will be aware of the extremely bad signal which last week's decision to delay a major project in the North due to the re-profiling, to use his phrase, of Government expenditure.  There are shades of Narrow Water bridge debacle in this.  At a moment when we should be speeding up cross-Border projects, which have broad support, we are actually delaying them.  Who in Northern Ireland did the Taoiseach inform of this proposed delay before it was announced?  </p></speech>

Was a border poll discussed with any of the parties during the Taoiseach's meetings?  Did the DUP outline to him the legal changes it wants to be made to the backstop, or is it simply rowing in behind the British Conservative Party position?  Does it have a separate position on Northern Ireland?  It would be interesting to know that.  Was there any discussion about the type of changes it wants to see that would mean it might support some kind of withdrawal deal?  I am talking about the withdrawal deal that has been negotiated or any variation of it, if available.</p>  <p>  The president of Sinn F&eacute;in has recently stated that the next Chief Constable of the PSNI should come from outside the force.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that proposal?  Is he aware of whether other parties, such as the Alliance Party and the DUP, share that view?  Was there any discussion about policing in Northern Ireland?  Policing has been supported in Northern Ireland for a long number of years by all the parties, and it seems that may be about to change.  Can the Taoiseach tell us about his discussions on that issue?</p></speech>

Eamon McCann was the first Assembly member to call for an election over this issue because we were talking about hundreds of millions of pounds.  It is an absolutely shocking scandal.  It took place in the context of a raft of austerity measures that were agreed under the Stormont House Agreement, including the now notorious universal credit scheme and PIP social welfare assault on people in the North, plans to sell off state assets and to axe thousands of public service jobs.

An inquiry is under way and it will report.  When it makes its findings, I imagine we can all reflect on that.</p> <p> There was an agreement last February to put the institutions back up.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  I believe the next round of talks must succeed but for us to have a real prospect of success and for success to be arrived at, we need answers.  By "we" I do not mean political parties but that citizens need answers to the outstanding issues.  This means the DUP and the British Government must stop blocking rights that citizens elsewhere in Britain and across this island openly enjoy.  This is not rocket science - no one is being asked to split the atom.  This is actually straightforward.</p> <p> I am keen to reassure Deputy Burton that policing is still very much supported in the North of Ireland and that the Northern Ireland Policing Board and other mechanisms carry out scrutiny and oversight.  I wish to advise the House that last week it came to light that the PSNI had failed to disclose sensitive information to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland as it is obliged to do under law.  The information related to several killings, including those of five people at Sean Graham bookmakers on the Ormeau Road in February 1992.  The killings in question involved weapons supplied to loyalist paramilitaries by British agents and included the active participation of British agents.  All of this is established and accepted public fact.  I met the families yesterday, a Cheann Comhairle, who are awaiting but who will now not receive a report from the ombudsman.  I could not overstate the distress and anger they feel.</p></speech>

Anyone who wants to meet me can seek a meeting in the normal way and it will be considered in the normal way.</p>  <p>  Talks were held last Friday in Belfast.  All the major parties attended.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was there, as was the T&aacute;naiste.  I was not present but the T&aacute;naiste briefed me and advised me that little or no progress was made, unfortunately, in the talks.  However, he said the two Governments would continue to engage about a process into the future that might allow progress to be made.</p>  <p>  My own view is and has been for many months that the current environment, notwithstanding the reasons for the collapsed Northern Ireland Executive two years ago, is a difficult one to facilitate restoration of the institutions.  Brexit has created extraordinary uncertainty.  In the absence of a withdrawal agreement being ratified, it will be difficult to get the institutions back up-and-running.  Frankly, the fact that the Conservative Party and the British Government depend on the votes of the DUP in Westminster to continue in existence creates a problem as well.  This is because it does not allow the UK Government to play the role it would have played in the past by putting pressure on unionism and all parties to get back around the table and come to an agreement.  These are two new dynamics that did not exist in the past when institutions broke down.  They are two very unwelcome dynamics.  Perhaps they will not be dynamics forever and perhaps they are not insurmountable either way.</p>  <p>  I wish to clarify again that the A5 road is not delayed as a consequence of re-profiling by Government.  It is delayed because of legal challenges in Northern Ireland and the fact that there is no Minister to sign off on the project.  Once it gets back on track, the Government will be more than happy to provide the &euro;25 million that we had intended to provide this year, because the road was supposed to start this year.  If the road starts this year, I would be happy to be present at the sod-turning.  I may even bring the cheque with me, but we are not going to pay &euro;25 million to the Northern Ireland authorities for a road that has not even started when it was supposed to start this year.</p>  <p>  It is a project to which I am highly committed and one in which I believe.  It will connect Derry to Dublin, will help us to develop Derry and Letterkenny as a new urban growth centre and is very much part of Project Ireland 2040.  It will help with the development of the north west.  It will be beneficial not only for the western half of Northern Ireland but for people in Letterkenny, Donegal and Monaghan.  It is a project I am keen to see started.</p></speech>

Cabinet committee A deals with issues relating to the economy and the labour market, competitiveness, productivity, rural development, the digital economy and pensions.  It last met on 12 November and the next meeting has not yet been scheduled.  Cabinet committee D works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery and ongoing development of policy across the areas of infrastructure investment, housing and climate action.  It provides political oversight on Project Ireland 2040.  It last met on 31 January.</p>  <p>  The economic division also leads Ireland's participation in the annual European semester process.  It prepares the annual national risk assessment, which provides an opportunity to identify and consider potential economic risks and challenges on a structured basis.  The 2018 report was published in July.  The 2019 national risk assessment process will commence shortly.  The division is also responsible for liaison with the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  The division is leading the preparation of the Future Jobs initiative in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Future Jobs is the Government's new economic initiative to ensure we are well placed to meet future challenges facing the Irish economy.  Future Jobs will drive our development as a resilient, innovative and globally connected economy capable of coping with technological and other transformational changes ahead.  It is aimed at enhancing productivity, labour market participation, innovation, skills and talent and the low-carbon economy.  My note states that it will be launched in the next two weeks but it will not, although I hope it might go to Cabinet in the next two weeks.</p>  <p>  A unit with the economic division works with the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection to help ensure a whole-of-government approach to data protection and broader digital issues.  In this regard the unit provides the secretariat to the interdepartmental committee on data issues and to the Government data forum.  The division is currently leading the development of a new overarching national digital strategy in collaboration with other relevant Departments to enable us to maximise the societal and economic benefits from digitalisation.  That will be published in the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  The division provides me with briefing and speech material on economic and related policy issues.  Given its role, the division works closely with colleagues in the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as other Departments that have lead responsibility for specific policy areas.</p>  <p>  The division contributes to work across my Department and the wider Civil Service in response to the challenge posed by Brexit.  In particular, the division is currently working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments on no-deal contingency planning.  This is a priority task as long as there is a risk of a no-deal outcome.</p></reply>

This is increasingly producing people who are earning significant amounts of money, as well as significant numbers of workers who are on low pay.  Some of them are on very low pay and they have few guarantees in their work or work status.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach believe we should move from having a minimum wage to having a living wage as part of the economic policy of this country?</p><p>Would Fine Gael support a move from a living wage, which has now become fairly well-established?  In the context text of how rents and costs have moved for people on low incomes, it is patently not sufficient to allow people to afford the astronomical rents that are now a feature of life not just in Dublin but increasingly throughout Ireland.  Even where two people in a couple are working, it is extremely limiting in terms of being able to aspire to purchasing a house.  This is a major change in society.</p> <p> The Taoiseach has often spoken glowingly about digitalisation and its future but has he considered at any point what is going to happen to the people in lower-income employments who have very little way of improving their wages and salaries unless the Government moves?  The Government has given 20 cent increases in the minimum wage in recent years, which, in the context of things like rent, goes nowhere towards meeting the needs of workers.  Today's TASC report shows that this is now making Ireland, notwithstanding a very good social welfare system that compensates for much, much less equal than it ought to be.</p></speech>

It shows a disproportionate share of national income accrues to richer groups in society and consequently a lower share to the less well-off section of society.  The report finds that the bottom 40% of the State's population receives just 22% of the national income while the top 10% receives almost 25%.  It does not take a genius to work out that we live in an unequal society in respect of income levels and take-home pay.  The TASC report finds that insufficient pay is the primary cause of that inequality.  The report's author, Dr. Robert Sweeney, said this morning that if one wants to really reduce inequality in the future we have to tackle low pay.</p>  <p>  We know with housing, because we have been told time and again, that quite outside of those who find themselves in emergency accommodation or find themselves on homeless lists, we have a hidden hardship, a whole hidden generation of people who sleep in their Ma's box room or who sofa-surf and we have more who will never have the aspiration of owning their own home and more who struggle to pay the rent.  There are more people who are in work but who are worried that if anything goes wrong or another bill arrives on the mat, their domestic situation goes under.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach adopt, as policy, the payment of a living wage and to move from minimum wage payment, as our floor or our threshold?  That would be the right thing to do.</p></speech>

I want to know what the Taoiseach thinks of his comments.  They come as part of a pattern of trying to normalise homelessness and, incredibly, victim-blaming, suggesting that somehow homeless services were &quot;attractive&quot; to people because we had so many of them and they were so good.  The implication was that people want to get into homelessness services.  I have never met a person who wanted to get into homelessness services and who was not in absolute dire need.  He also made very alarming statements about the wider policy remit of local authorities, of the State and of the private market.  Does the Taoiseach agree or disagree with this?  The head of the biggest local authority in the country, someone who is appointed by Government, said:</p><blockquote>Housing supply is going to have to be delivered by private sector, even if we end up renting a significant number of units.  We will only ever built a small proportion.</blockquote><p>He went on to say that social mix is not happening because, in many cases, the 10% we were supposed to get-----</p></speech>

He put in place a special budget in his own Department for this matter.  When challenged on this in the D&aacute;il, he repeatedly said that advertising of the children's hospital and the national development plan, NDP, in general was essential, because the public needed to be informed about what was being done with their money.  Depending on what timeline one starts from, there is an overspend of anything up to &euro;400 million if it is last year, and nearly &euro;700 million more from the Taoiseach's time as Minister for Health.  In terms of delayed projects and the need to completely revisit costing assumptions, can the Taoiseach tell us when he intends to update the list of claims and projects he published last year for the NDP?  On the health capital plan alone, a combination of health capital inflation and new specifications on safety and technology will apply to the entire acute hospital building programme, not just to children's hospital.  At best it is insulting to the public to claim that nothing will change in the NDP and that everything will be done as promised.  The attempt to only talk about re-profiling this year is the exact opposite of the openness that he has repeatedly promised and which justified huge marketing budgets.  Can he give us a simple commitment to publish immediately an updated national development plan list of projects and timings?  I can list a whole range of projects for which we are still waiting timelines.  One gets the sense that there is a real lack of precision on what was announced last year.</p></speech>

The Deputy made a valid point in that construction inflation will not just affect the national children's hospital and will, of course, affect other projects.  As it happens, road projects and water projects are all coming in on budget or even below budget.  I am not entirely sure about the schools projects but I believe they are fairly okay.  Road and water are okay.  It would be wrong to assume that the national children's hospital is going to be the only project where construction inflation is an issue as it may well be an issue for other projects.  There is provision for a review of Project Ireland 2040, and the mid-term review also.  It may well be the case that we have to make adjustments over the course of it, and that was always intended.</p>  <p>  I note Deputies mentioned the TASC report, and I will come to that in a second, but the most important survey released today was one produced by the CSO, which is an independent body and not a think-tank.  The labour force survey was out today.  The good news is that 2.3 million people were in work in Ireland at the end of 2018, which is a record high.  Unemployment is down to 128,000 people, which is a ten year low.   More than 1,000 new jobs were created every week, the vast majority of which were full-time.  Deputies may be interested to know that it also showed that the number of people who are self-employed had actually fallen last year.  The narrative we often hear from the Opposition is that there is a drift towards self-employment and that all the new jobs are part-time jobs, but the opposite is actually the case.</p><p>Almost all of the new jobs are full time and the numbers in self-employment are actually going down in raw numbers and percentage terms of the full workforce.  It proves the inaccuracy of the claims made throughout the course of last year by some elements of the Opposition.  The biggest increases which should not surprise people are in services and construction.</p> <p> In terms of the TASC report, I had an opportunity, not to read it yet, but to listen to one of its authors speak on radio and to skim over it earlier today.  It confirms that the levels of poverty and deprivation in Ireland are falling and have been for several years, that income inequality in Ireland is about average and less than in most English speaking countries and about average when one compares-----</p></speech>

Therefore, the narrative that inequality is widening and that poverty is getting worse in Ireland is not correct.  The TASC report, CSO data and EUROSTAT data all bear that out.  It points out, as Deputy Burton rightly pointed out, that the tax and welfare systems are highly progressive, with the richest 10% paying about 80% of income taxation, and that the taxation system is funding a welfare system that distributes so well that this is a country that is no less and no more unequal than developed countries in the rest of the world.  If one looks at the report, it indicates that Ireland has a real issue with low pay but not actually in cash terms.  The minimum wage is now the second highest.  If one compares pay levels across the public sector and the private sector with the exact same for people working in other countries, pay levels here are actually higher, but they are low relative to the fact that we have a lot of people in Ireland on high pay rates, particularly professionals and people who work in the multinationals.  It is a more complex picture than perhaps is understood by Deputies, at least judging from their comments.  The minimum wage has increased considerably in recent years, I think by about 25% under the Government.</p></speech>

I firmly believe that if one calculates it, one has to take into account the views of trade unions that represent working people and those of the public, but one also needs to take into account the views of employers and small business owners.  One of the problems with the living wage as it is calculated in Ireland is that employers are excluded from participating in the calculation.  Their views are not taken into account.  That is a mistake because one always has to bear in mind the impact on employment, which is particularly important in the Border counties where employers are competing with much lower wages on offer in Northern Ireland.  Whether one calls it a minimum wage or a living wage does not bother me, but a system that excludes employers from any involvement in calculating it is wrong-headed.</p></speech>

A derogation is possible, but has the Government set its face against the notion of one for smaller and single member pension schemes and, if so, why?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900022#U02700"><p>The transposition of the IORP II directive will result in significant improvements in the regulation and governance of funded occupational pension schemes in Ireland.  While the directive provides for the possibility of a derogation from specific articles for smaller schemes, members of smaller schemes should have the same protections and oversight as members of larger ones.  Money saved for pension purposes should be properly protected to ensure people have adequate income for their retirement years.  The value of investments held in many schemes fell substantially during the financial crisis.  This highlighted the need for stricter regulations and greater protections, especially for small schemes investing in riskier unregulated markets.</p>  <p>  It has been suggested single person pension schemes should be exempt from the application of IORP II rules on the basis that the scheme members are competent in the management of their own affairs and that the governance requirements are unduly onerous.  However, Ireland has a far larger number of small schemes than any other EU state and the Government shares the European Union's concerns about such small schemes, particularly in the protection of consumers and the money they have invested, the riskiness of these investments, the charges that apply and the standard of governance.  Accordingly, the Government has decided that the provisions of the directive should apply to all funded occupational pension schemes.</p>  <p>  The application of the directive is prospective, not retrospective.  This means that existing investments and borrowings can remain in place.  After the transposition, no single member scheme, including small self-administered ones, which are the only schemes currently allowed to borrow, will be allowed to enter into new borrowing arrangements, except for short-term and liquidity purposes.  All of their future investments will have to be made in accordance with the investment rules included in the directive.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, are managing the transposition process of the IORP II directive.  TIt is a substantial directive and the preparation of regulations to transpose it is at an advanced stage.  It is expected that transposition into Irish law will be achieved before the end of March.</p></speech>

Is she aware that her colleague in the European Parliament, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, confirmed at a meeting on 29 January with the association representing these schemes that the Government had a clear and strong view on the terms of the directive to the effect that there must be maximum flexibility in how schemes were managed so as to be able to make special provision for one member arrangements?  He went on to say and allowed the association to reference him that the reason for the derogation was Ireland had championed and supported it.  The Minister's colleague in the European Parliament has pointed to why there should be a derogation from the directive, yet the Government is choosing not to implement one.  The Minister has stated people must be protected from mismanagement of their funds, but is she aware that the pensioners in one member pension schemes make the decisions?  They have not sought protection against their own decisions.  Is the Minister aware that the Government's approach eliminates freedom of choice and will have an impact on, for example, investment in housing, an area in which some of the schemes are the main investors and where the Government has committed to providing more housing?</p></speech>

I do not agree with the Deputy's description of what that derogation achieved.  During the financial crisis many large and small investment pension schemes suffered significantly not only because of the years-long disaster but also because of the lack of regulation and governance.</p><p>We intend to ensure that the new governance measures will relate to everybody equally.  With respect to Brian Hayes, MEP he is entitled to his opinion but as long as I am sitting at this desk I will make the decisions on the basis of the best evidence and advice that is given to me.  That is what I have done in this case.</p></speech>

She is talking about protecting people from themselves.  People here make the decisions and I suggest to the Minister that the only consequence of not allowing a derogation here, as was arranged by Brian Hayes in Europe, is that these people will be driven into the hands of the larger companies where there will be less transparency and much higher charges.  I ask her to reconsider that decision because it will prove counterproductive in the medium to long term.</p></speech>

What is the Minister doing to honour the democratic wishes of this D&aacute;il, which overwhelmingly supported the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, regarding JobPath?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900023#V00700"><p>The Government's position on the recent motion debated in the House on the JobPath service was clearly set out in my contribution and that of others at the time.  I note the views of the House on the matter.  However, the position of the Government remains unchanged.  My Department has entered into legally binding agreements with the JobPath providers and the Government will honour these contractual commitments.</p>  <p>  I will reiterate again that the JobPath service performance recorded and published by the Department exceeds contracted target levels and that creditable large-scale customer research, also published by the Department, shows very high levels of customer satisfaction and very low levels of complaints.</p>  <p>  The Department also operates a robust inspection and compliance system and a detailed report from the Comptroller and Auditor General made no recommendations regarding how the service is governed.  The Department will shortly publish the results of an econometric evaluation of the service which will further indicate that the outcomes for participating jobseekers, both in terms of employment and earnings, are better than those of non-participants.  Compared to this body of evidence I note the criticisms of the service are based on anecdotal or very small scale research which would not be considered as reliable evidence in any serious evaluation of the service.</p>  <p>  During that particular debate and prior to it I asked Deputies to forward me examples of cases that they believed substantiated the criticisms of the service.  Since the debate on the Private Members' motion, I was provided with just two examples of people who expressed dissatisfaction with the service.  The case is being reviewed but the nature of the complaint does not differ greatly from representations which are occasionally received in respect of other activation services, including the Department's Intreo service, our CV clubs, local employment services, job clubs etc.   It is certainly not suggestive of any widespread or systemic issues with the service over and above what would be expected in a service that has now served in excess of 200,000 Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  Therefore, I am satisfied that the proper course of action is to continue with the service in order to support our long-term unemployed jobseekers.  Thankfully, the number of long-term jobseekers are dropping, as reported by the Central Statistics Office today.</p></speech>

Certainly the evidence that was given in this Chamber was not anecdotal.  I stated during that debate that TDs do not lie at home dreaming up these cases.  These are real cases.  TDs act as the eyes and ears of the public and those stories, which we raised, were brought to our attention.  Therefore, they were certainly not anecdotal evidence.</p>  <p>  During the debate the Minister put out the figure of 41,000 full-time jobs having been commenced through JobPath.  Myself and other TDs questioned that figure and asked for a breakdown of those 41,000 so-called job starts.  Correspondence the Minister has given me, which is quite startling, shows that only 11,334 jobs out of 206,000 were sustained in employment exceeding 12 months, yet she still stands over this having been the so-called most successive labour activation scheme in this State.  How can she conclude that the programme has been successful given that not even close to half of those 41,000 full-time jobs have been sustained in employment for over a year?  In terms of the democratic will of the D&aacute;il, we have spoken and the Minister must listen to that and act on it. </p></speech>

I do not believe the Deputy and I are ever going to agree on this and so we will have to agree to disagree.  For some reason, he has a problem with the JobPath programme.</p></speech>

He does not have to take my figures for it, he can take the CSO figures that were released today.  We had the largest drop in long-term unemployment last year that we have had in years.  That did not happen by magic.  That happened because of all of our activation partners - Seetec, Turas Nua, all our Irish local development network, ILDN, partners, all my community employment host companies and all my T&uacute;s companies.  They all work collectively and collaboratively with the State to ensure the people who are at risk of being long-term unemployed get the best services they can to get jobs.  Despite the Deputy's best efforts, it is working and we are going to continue to do it.  As I believe I have said to the Deputy previously, we are conducting a review of all of our activation services to make sure that the next generation of Ireland's unemployed get a tailor-made service.  We will do that with our ILDN partners.  A review of my community employment schemes is taking place, and we will do that for the rural social scheme, RSS, JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec when the econometric review comes out.</p></speech>

As we speak, there is 1,971 vacancies within community employment schemes the length and breadth of the State.  That is not by accident but by design.  There is genuine concern regarding the local employment service.</p>  <p>  The Indecon report was published a few weeks ago.  There is a strong view it is paving the way for the privatisation of some of the successful schemes such as the local employment service in terms of public procurement.  Will the Minister invest in the local employment service, as there is genuine concern regarding her intentions?  There is a view that the ground is being prepared for the privatisation of that sector going out to public procurement and that the payment by results model will be rolled out.

The first part is that the Minister recently announced a review of the community employment scheme.  I would like an update on the review.  Second, has the Minister read the Indecon report?  Is she aware of its recommendations on the local employment service, LES, and has she taken any decision on the matter yet?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900024#W00400"><p>With some 900 schemes, community employment is the largest employment programme administered by my Department.  It aims to enhance employability and mobility by providing work experience and training opportunities for unemployed persons within their communities.  They do this superbly.  Community employment also helps long-term unemployed persons to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their long-term experiences of unemployment through a return to work routine.</p><p>Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from community employment schemes by the individuals, the host companies and communities.  Communities benefit from the skills and talents of participants, while participants are provided with the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new ones, while performing valuable work in local communities.  Many community employment schemes provide vital community services across the country, all of which are well embedded in the communities.  I know that we certainly could not do without some of these services in County Meath, but that is true and reflective of all the counties we represent.</p><p>I am fully committed to the future of the programme and will continue to support and improve it for the benefit of the people who participate in it and having regard to the valuable contribution it makes to local communities.  In that regard, the Government has agreed to my request to establish an interdepartmental group to explore the most appropriate organisational arrangements, including which Departments should host sections of the community employment programme, especially social inclusion schemes.  Deputies may be aware that following the review of the community employment scheme in 2015, a decision was taken to adopt a two-strand approach to all community employment placements which were categorised as either a training and activation strand or a social inclusion strand.  It is my strong view that local services supported by these social inclusion placements should be safeguarded.  The scheme will continue to be subject to continuous improvement and reviewed on a regular basis.</p><p>The Department values very highly the local services provided by bodies such as the LES and will continue to depend on local service providers to supplement and complement direct service provision into the future.  It is, however, a legal requirement that the services be procured in an open process and that appropriate governance arrangements be entered into.  Accordingly, my Department commissioned Indecon to complete an independent, evidence&ndash;based evaluation of the effectiveness, efficiency and governance of the local employment service and jobs clubs.  The report was published in January and I have read it.  It will inform the Department's and my decisions on the future activations and partnerships we require. </p><p>I am incredibly committed to the people involved because they are incredibly committed to unemployed persons.  They provide valuable services and we will continue to support them.</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>It will help to inform both the Department and the LES of how to ensure compliance with legal procurement requirements.  My Department and I have been engaging with key stakeholders throughout the process and will, of course, continue to do so.  Looking to the future of employment services generally, one of the factors to be taken into account is the reduction in the live register.  This creates an opportunity to consider how best to encourage and support other groups into employment such as inactive persons who are not currently seeking work and people with disabilities.  I consider that services such as the LES are well positioned to offer such a service.  My Department will continue to consult the relevant stakeholders to ensure any future contracted public employment service will give the best possible service to those who wish to return to the labour market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900024#W00500"><p>I am glad that the Minister is committed because my information is that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is directing people away from community employment schemes to keep Turas Nua and Seetec fed.  It is to keep that monster fed.  When does the Minister expect to be in a position to make a decision on the future of community employment schemes?  Does she intend to retain responsibility for the schemes within her Department? There is a suggestion it may move to another Department.</p>  <p>  The Indecon report contains a recommendation that active consideration be give to having an open, public, competitive procurement model for future provision of services, that is, the services being provided by the LES.  Is the Minister aware that, as a State body, the LES would not be able to compete in such a procurement process?  It would not be in a position to compete if the service was opened up to private tender in this way.  That would directly open the door to the privatisation of the service.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to reiterate my views in that regard which I delivered to the Minister last week during Private Members' business.  Will she give an assurance to the people who are being well served by the LES and the dedicated staff within it that this is one of the recommendations she will not be accepting?</p></speech>

The interdepartmental group is going to have its first meeting next week.  Ms Simonetta Ryan has agreed to chair the group and we will have a number of meetings in the next few weeks.  I will have recommendations arising from the meetings and the consultation with host CE companies.  I will bring a memo to the Cabinet before the end of May.</p>  <p>  I will explain the route I am taking.  After the review in 2015 in which we categorised CE placements as training and activation and social inclusion, we continued to govern them with exactly the same rules we used for activation.  How, in God's name, can we genuinely support a person in sheltered or supported employment if he or she is being governed by the same rules as those used in training somebody to gain work experience or undergoing a course for one year, which are to get people off the live register and into employment?  That just does not work.  We need two sets of rules in that regard.</p>  <p>  We also need to look at where the rural social scheme sits.  We need to look at T&uacute;s in that context.  This will be done in the interdepartmental review.  I cannot tell the Deputy the outcome of the deliberations on the Indecon report, but I can tell him what I told the Irish Local Development Network at its AGM in December.  They are an integral part of the delivery of services in the State and have been for years and will be for years into the future.</p></speech>

Will she also answer my other question?  Is it her intention or objective to retain responsibility for community employment schemes within her Department, rather than have it transferred to another Department now that the social aspect is to be the focus from here on?</p></speech>

I do not mind who owns the schemes or who funds them, but I do mind that it is not fair on people in communities who need sheltered employment and additional supports to be governed by the same rules as those we use for job activation schemes.  It is just not fair and not feasible and I do no think I can stand over it.  Whether we keep responsibility for the schemes and drugs rehabilitation schemes in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which would be fine by us, or whether it moves naturally perhaps to the Department of Health, while responsibility for the RSS would perhaps move to the Department of Rural and Community Development will be discussed with the host CE companies and the interdepartmental group which will come up with a list of recommendations that best suits the future of the schemes to support them in the way they should be supported.  It should be inclusive and not try to activate people from community employment schemes who cannot be activated for one or two years.  The Deputy is aware that Ministers spend their weeks answering community employment scheme requests for persons to be allowed to stay on it for extra years.  There are reasons people want to stay on it for the extra years and I believe we should have different rules governing the different strands.</p></speech>

Many issues had been flagged before Christmas, in October and November.  Have they all been resolved at this stage?  Just before Christmas the Minister gave us a categorical assurance that they would all be resolved and that there would be no more problems.  Is that now the case?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900024#W02400"><p>As the Deputy is aware, payment issues arose under the illness benefit schemes last year when my Department transferred administration of the scheme from an old legacy IT payments system to the new core business IT platform which is managing many of its other scheme payments.  At the time I expressed my apologies to all of those who were affected, of whom there were far too many.  I am very happy to do so again today.  It should not have happened and we can do better.  My Department has since been working hard to resolve the issues and ensure claims are processed and paid promptly.  We have made good progress in that regard, with payment levels in the past few months being maintained at the expected norms for the time of the year.  The telephone helpline and call handling performance system has also been addressed because it endured major stress because of the numbers calling us.  It is now back to normal levels, although customers may still experience some delays owing to call volumes at particular times, perhaps during the flu season and so on.</p>  <p>  There was an increase in the number of claims for illness benefit in January, but it reflected the typical annual increase at the time of year owing to seasonal illnesses.</p><p>Currently, people who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order receive their payment promptly.  It is important to note, as I have a number of times before, that there have been and will always be cases in which people's payments are legitimately stopped, paused or delayed for a variety of reasons, including the late submission of medical certificates.  In addition and as was always the case, human errors can be made from time to time by departmental staff or applicants and it is up to us to ensure we rectify those in as timely a manner as possible.  This is to be expected in a scheme that processes between 9,000 and 10,000 certificates a day.  I am satisfied, given that we are processing 50,000 certificates into payment every week in line with the normal level established over many years, that such issues are normal processing issues.  While I would obviously prefer that every application was administered correctly in the first instance, we are only human and 100% perfection is not always attainable.  However, my Department is learning from the recent challenges and is constantly looking to improve its services.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>As ever, people who experience an urgent financial need while awaiting an illness benefit payment can apply to my Department's community welfare service to receive an interim payment and should contact the relevant local Intreo centre in that regard.</p></speech>

These are not isolated cases.  Not a day goes by without someone contacting my constituency offices on the problems he or she is experiencing.  There are many cases.  Yesterday, a man came to my clinic who has been in receipt of illness benefit since 4 January 2019.  On that date, he received a full payment whereas the week after he received a part payment.  The following week he got no payment and the week after that he received three part payments to make up the full payment.  Last week, he got a full payment.  His certificates had been submitted well ahead of time and this is not an isolated incident.  This is going on right across the State and it is an unmitigated mess.  General practitioners, GPs, are hesitant to fill in the new forms, which have been rolled out to allow people to go beyond the week.  That is despite the encouragement of patients by the Department to do so.  Has the Minister engaged with GPs on the serious problem with the new forms?</p></speech>

The relationship between the Department and GPs is at an all-time high.  If there are particular GPs in Bray or the Deputy's neck of the woods generally who have a difficulty, I ask him to give me their names.  I will contact them to sort out any issues.  In the main, we have 50,000 certificates coming in every week and are bang on target to the level we were at this time last year and in the years before.  While there may be cases of delayed payment or of extra or double payments in a particular week on foot of the way the system currently works, there are no more and no fewer such cases than there were one or five years ago.</p></speech>

They include cancer patients and people with terminal illnesses.  To not know from week to week what payment will come in, if it comes in at all, is a problem.  While I appreciate that staff within the illness benefit section of the Department do tremendous work and certainly do not blame them, the new system that was rolled out to streamline and improve things has actually caused an unmitigated disaster.  It has left an absolute mess in its wake.  It has not succeeded.  In previous discussions, the Minister has said the system was due to be extended to other social welfare payments.  Does she still intend to roll the system out to other payments when there are still problems here?  If it is rolled out, it will cause an unmitigated disaster.</p></speech>

I have told the Deputy that we are taking in more than 50,000 certificates every week.  If even 1% of those people have a difficulty, the Deputy will focus his attention there, rather than on the 99% success rate on which most people would focus.  I have told the Deputy that the system is being operated by humans, including those applying, GPs submitting certificates on their behalf and the staff receiving the applications, and that there will be mistakes.  There will be times that a medical certificate which was supposed to arrive on a Monday does not come in until the Wednesday, which will mean a split payment the following week.  The system is a new one.  Either the Deputy has misunderstood me or I have misinformed the House, but no one is moving to a new system.  The illness system is for the illness benefit payment scheme.  While other schemes might be moving towards our new IT platform, that is just a matter of moving from one server to another.  It does not affect the system's design or operation.</p></speech>

In other words, they can work until that age of their own volition.  Given the pension situation which militates more strongly against community employment supervisors than any other sector, will the Minister change the administrative rules applying to these supervisors so that they are treated in a similar and equitable fashion and may work beyond the age of 65 if they wish to continue in their role?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900025#X02600"><p>The Government agreed that the compulsory retirement age of most public servants recruited before 1 April 2004 should be increased to 70 and that such additional service would continue to accrue retirement benefits, subject to the maximum of 40 years' service.  This was provided for in the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018, which passed in the House just before Christmas and which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Community employment, or CE, participants and supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector.  My Department is not the employer of CE participants or supervisors and such employees are not public servants but are employees of the sponsoring organisations involved.  They are not, therefore, subject to the changes recently introduced for public servants who can now work until they are aged 70.  Funding for the employment of supervisors on community employment is available until the supervisor reaches the State pension age.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the national pensions framework.  It provided for an increase in the qualification age for the State pension from 66 to 67 from 2021 and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It is open to CE supervisors to remain on CE until the working day before the birthday on which they reach State pension age as follows; 66 for those born before 1 January 1955; 67 for those born on or after 1 January 1955; and 68 for those born on or after 1 January 1961.  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></speech>

The position has been advertised for over a month but no applicant has come forward.  Can that person stay on?  That is the very simple question.  Community employment schemes provide essential services across the towns, villages and parishes of this country, urban and rural, and they are publicly funded.  To create what I term a kind of "constructive corporate veil" between the Government and the group carrying on the service is a nonsense.  This has to be broken down.  It is the same thing that is going on with the pensions.  It is cowboy stuff.  If companies outside were doing it, we would call them cowboys.  All Governments, including the one of which I was a member, have been cowboys in this regard.  They have tried to fool people.</p>  <p>  There are 44 supervisors on community employment schemes who are aged between 65 and 66 and I want to know if they can continue to work beyond that age.  Can they?  One cannot have one rule for one group and another rule for another group.  It would require a simple administrative decision for the Minister to change this.  It is the right thing to do.  The Taoiseach said it was up to the employer, but the corporate veil or Chinese wall involved, whatever one calls it, is a nonsense that must stop.  Community employment supervisors are employees doing valuable work but we do not treat them as valuable employees.</p></speech>

However, I remind him, and he was probably a Member of the House when it was established, that CE was established as a working age activation scheme.  The people who are on a scheme must be of working age.  I do not know the date of birth of the person the Deputy mentioned, and I am happy to take his or her details from the Deputy and look into the matter later today, but a person must retire when he or she reaches retirement age.  Currently that is 66 years of age, in a number of years it will be 67 years and in 2028 it will be 68 years.  That is the rule that governs the working age activation programmes for participants, assistant supervisors and supervisors in the CE programme as it currently stands.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Minister saw a responsible, sensible cohort of people who act in important positions.  They are not looking for the world.  Some of them said on the picket line that most would like a pension that would acknowledge their role or, at least, a decent <i>ex gratia</i>payment.  Those who are now long retired could certainly do with that as many of them are in very impoverished positions.  Is there any way this can be resolved and what steps is the Minister taking to resolve it?</p></speech>

We are actively pursuing every and any way of trying to resolve this issue without causing the contagion we know it would cause at present.  To be entirely fair to the two unions that are representing the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, they have come up with different ideas in the last few months that are just not manageable or workable.  We are working together.  It was sad that they had to go out on strike yesterday but perhaps that will make us redouble our efforts to find a solution.  However, the solution must be found within the confines of not costing the State in excess of &euro;600 million.  If it is possible I will find a way to do that, but it is not as easy as it sounds.  I will not give up.  For as long as I am here I will keep trying.</p></speech>

I do not believe the governing rules for the two separate strands of CE are viable.  They are not fair to the people who are in the socially inclusive places.  I could not get them changed as matters stand, and I had to employ the assistance of my colleagues in different Departments, who perhaps have more clout than I do.  I expect that we will reach a satisfactory conclusion between now and the end of May.  All the Departments that are involved in any way with CE schemes and all the CE host companies have been invited to make submissions to me on how they believe things should be done in the future.  However, I have not yet asked for the Deputies' opinions.  If there are Deputies who have a gr&aacute; for supporting the socially inclusive places and activation training places in their communities, I would be grateful if they would make submissions with suggestions on what we could do to support those people and make them even better than they are today.</p>  <p>  I should make Members aware that we will not be talking about this for months.  The meetings will take place over the next couple of weeks and I expect to go to the Cabinet before the end of May with our recommendations.</p></speech>

Like me, she knows many of the CE supervisors, staff and workers on the schemes in our constituency.  Deputy O'Dea met some from Dunboyne and Athboy last week and I am grateful to him for doing that.  They have a good vision of what is required and I am sure they will be delighted to give submissions to the Minister.  They also have a good vision of what their communities require.  The CE schemes certainly do fantastic work.  Unquestionably, there are people among the public for whom the CE scheme is an answer, beyond the cohort who require it for job activation.  The big concern Fianna F&aacute;il has, and Deputy O'Dea has expressed it, is that it may go outside the Department.  We cannot get to the bottom of why that may be required.  The Department set up the review for the reason the Minister outlined and we welcome the review in that context, but I see no necessity to move it outside the Department.  The Minister's Department is the traditional caring Department.  It has a huge budget and looks after people.  That is what this scheme does as well.  It looks after people and their communities and I will strongly urge that it should remain in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

There are three or four items on the list.  I am not sure the Department is the natural home of the RSS.  It did not start in our Department but was brought from the Department with responsibility for rural affairs when a particular Minister came to this Department because that Minister had started it.  It might be more suitable for the Department of Rural and Community Development.  That might or might not emerge from the interdepartmental review.  In addition, some of our drugs rehabilitative schemes might be better managed by the people in the HSE, although they might not agree with me.  However, we will have a proper conversation about the childcare, elder care, drug rehabilitation, training and social inclusion and sheltered employment strands and where they naturally should be.  I will be happy to keep them.  Indeed, one of the nicest parts of this job is travelling around the country and meeting incredibly decent and hard-working people who find a real gr&aacute; in providing activation - the assistant supervisors, supervisors and the people who are working and providing the services in our communities.</p></speech>

The Minister strongly defended Seetec in the House today but it is an organisation that is absolutely hated across the board.  People cannot understand why a private company is brought in to do a job that was traditionally seen as the role of the State in trying to help people.  We do not want to see that happen with the CE schemes.  It has to be said that Seetec draws the ire of people across the board, even people who have nothing to do with it.  When people hear about the system they just do not like it.  They do not like the private sector being involved in those matters.  I want CE schemes to remain on the ground.  The supervisors and the people involved in them know what is required and they look after people.</p></speech>

Seetec, Turas Nua and JobPath have nothing to do with CE and will not have anything to do with it in the future.</p></speech>

Thankfully, there is consistency in the payments.  Telephone helpline and call handling performance has also been addressed and is now back to normal levels, although customers may still sometimes experience delays due to call volumes in particular weeks.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase in claims for illness benefit in January.  That reflects the annual increase at this time of year due to seasonal illnesses.  While over 9,000 transactions per day are processed, people who are due a payment and whose medical certificates and claims are in order, receive their payment entitlement promptly.  In stating this, there are always cases, and there were always cases, where people's payments are legitimately stopped, paused, or delayed for a variety of reasons, including the late submission of medical certificates or error on the part of people in the Department, the GPs or the applicants. </p>  <p>  People who experienced an urgent financial need while awaiting an illness benefit payment were encouraged to apply to my Department's community welfare service to receive interim payments.  They did that and we were able to look after most people relatively quickly.  That avenue remains open to anyone who is adversely affected and the Department will respond sensitively to any case.  I am specifically referring to something the Deputy has brought to the attention of the House on a number of occasions.  Some people incurred bank charges because of missed, delayed or no payments over a number of weeks or months.  I encourage those people to apply to the local community welfare office to get those bank charges.  Some people might say it is only a small amount of money but when people are living on illness benefit of &euro;198 per week, bank charges of &euro;15 or &euro;30, which were imposed on them for something that had nothing to do with them in the first place, are not sustainable.  People should make applications to the community welfare officer, CWO, and we will look after each case sensitively.</p></reply>

It is interesting that if the Department makes a mistake and overpays someone, it is that person's responsibility and fault straightaway and he or she must repay the Department, yet it has been slow to accept that it has caused financial difficulty for people who have been depending on this system to survive and it has caused significant difficulties.  There must be a system that will allow for documented repayments to be made.  There must also be a recognition within the Minister's Department of the turmoil caused which should be acknowledged.  It is the least the people concerned should expect and vitally important that it happen.</p></speech>

A community welfare officer, CWO, is available in various places in every county.  If there are people who have been put out financially because of charges imposed on them through no fault of their own, I ask the Deputy to tell them to make applications to us.  There is other legislation at which I was looking dealing with longer term financial compensation, but it does not quite cut the mustard because one must be waiting for payment for longer than 12 months.  It is called the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, SI 142, and concerns consolidation claims and payment controls.  It allows people to be compensated, but it does not really apply in any of these cases because one must be without a payment for in excess of 12 months, having been entitled to receive it.  The CWO is always willing for anyone to come forward.  All one has to do is show a bank statement with the bank charges included in it.  We deal with each case sensitively.</p></speech>

This is a necessary step when we are responsibly providing access to the billions of euro, of which the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is in charge and which it is giving to people through all of its schemes.  The public services card is only issued after someone goes through the SAFE 2 registration process.  In addition to acting as a token that an individual's identity has been verified to SAFE 2 standard, possession of a public services card enables individuals to gain access to a great many other public services, for example, free travel, more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extend possible.</p>  <p>  Preliminary results of a recent customer survey carried out on the public services card have been quite positive, with very high levels of satisfaction recorded in the process of applying, the resulting public services card, people's level of understanding of the purpose of the SAFE 2 and PSC process and the information provided for applicants.  These are all being very well received.  People also expressed strong support for the sharing of information between public bodies because it makes life easier, which is exactly what we were trying to achieve in the first instance.  I hope to have the full results of the survey next week and that all Deputies will join me in welcoming these positive results.</p>  <p>  To respond to the question the Deputy asked me, the Data Protection Commissioner initiated an investigation to assess the legal basis for the processing of data in connection with the public services card and other related matters in 2017.  The Data Protection Commissioner provided a draft report on the public services card for my Department in late August 2018.  The draft report requested further information and clarification from us in a broad range of areas, but - it is a big but - the commissioner specifically instructed us not to discuss or disclose the draft report to any other party.  We will respect that request.  Therefore, I cannot give the Deputy an indication that I will publish the report, but I genuinely have no doubt but that when the commissioner replies to us, they will publish the report.  If they do not, the only thing I can suggest is I seek permission at that stage, if appropriate, to do so.  However, I am not in a position to give the Deputy an assurance that the draft report will be issued because my Department has been instructed specifically that we are not to discuss or disclose it.  I must do what I am told.</p></speech>

Transparency certainly helps.  It is amazing that the Department's response to the Data Protection Commissioner's inquiry, at this late stage in the history of the public services card's roll-out, requires such a protracted, extended defence.  This is the largest data-sharing project in the history of the State and I think it has cost approximately &euro;60 million so far.  The Minister has not halted the roll-out of the public services card, pending the outcome of the investigation, and her Department has had to write the equivalent of a PhD thesis to defend itself after the horse has well and truly bolted.  However, listening to what she is saying, it looks like the public will not get a good look at the terms of the commissioner's investigation.  The Minister argues about the merits of the public services card.  We are not arguing against them, but we are arguing on the issue of consent.  If people consent, that is grand.  Yes, the public services card involves efficiency, but one cannot force people to consent to using it.  That is our argument.</p></speech>

We provided a comprehensive response for the office on 30 November and have been awaiting its response since.  As I said to the Deputy, publication of the report is now entirely a matter for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, given that it has given us clear instructions that we are not to discuss or disclose the draft report.  I would have the legs cut off me were I not to do what I have been asked to do by it, particularly in the light of the investigation and the sensitivity attached to it.</p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to what he has just said.  We do not make anyone get a public services card.  If people do not want to get it and do not want to go through the SAFE 2 process, they do not have to do so.  However, 3.2 million people have gone through it and the results of the satisfaction survey have given us incredibly positive responses.  As the Deputy rightly says, perhaps the Data Protection Commissioner will come back with a different response.  Whatever it is, either the Deputy or I will have to accept the outcome, depending on whatever point of view we share or do not share with the Data Protection Commissioner at the time.</p></speech>

As I said, it is also to coerce consent to data-sharing.  Perhaps the Minister is now denying it, but section 262(6) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act states:</p><blockquote>(a) Where a specified body has a transaction with a person, the Minister may share the person's public service identity with the specified body to the extent necessary for authentication by the specified body of the person's public service identity.<br /><br />(b) A specified body may use a person's public service identity in performing its public functions.</blockquote><p>The word &quot;may&quot; is significant.  Yes, it permits data-sharing, but it does not require or demand it.  Data-sharing is not an inevitable consequence of the verification of a person's identity.  Section 247C(1) also makes it clear that the purpose of the verification process is &quot;to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity&quot;.  Once the person's identity has been verified and once the Minister is satisfied as to the person's identity, there should not be any legal basis for further processing of the person's data, unless his or her consent has been obtained.  Is our interpretation wrong?</p></speech>

What I do know is that we do not make anybody undergo the SAFE 2 authentification process.  With the exception of one lady, for whom the issue was resolved soon after I came into the Department, we have never withheld a payment due to somebody not having gone through the SAFE 2 authentification process.  That is not the purpose of it.  It is not a control measure in the way the Deputy describes and it is certainly not coercive.  There are 3.2 million people in the country who have public services cards as a result of having undergone the SAFE 2 process, yet none of them has broken legs.  We did not coerce anybody and nobody is being made to do anything.</p>  <p>  We have responded to the concerns that were raised with us by the Data Protection Commission last August.  We replied in November and we await its response.  I cannot tell the Deputy what the outcome will be because I will not know until the commission reverts to me.</p></speech>

While I noted the views of the House on the matter, the position of the Government remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the JobPath service shows a performance well above target levels.  Customer feedback shows high levels of satisfaction of more than 6,000 customers who were independently surveyed and there is a low number of complaints.  All this evidence has been published by the Department.  In addition, preliminary evidence from a forthcoming econometric study, which will be published in a number of weeks, indicates that JobPath participants have better job and earning outcomes than non-participants.  These data contrast with the anecdotes presented by critics of the service and with the small-scale research study which has been quoted - a study so small that it is mostly unreliable.  </p>  <p>  The Department also operates a robust inspection and compliance regime.  A detailed report by the Comptroller and Auditor General found no flaws in the inspection regime.  It made no recommendations in regard to how the service should be governed and instead indicated it was satisfied with it.  Where any issue is brought to my attention and there is sufficient detail to pursue the matter, we do so and action is taken as necessary.  Since the debate on the Private Members' motion, Deputies have brought just two cases to my attention, both of which have been reviewed.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining options for contracted activation services to be delivered from 2020.  No final decisions have been made in this area, but lessons will be learned from recent reports on local employment services, job clubs, the EmployAbility service and the econometric review of JobPath, which is being finalised.  The policy considerations will also include how we can provide activation services to those most distant from the labour market and make persons who have not availed of activation services aware of the latter's existence and allow them to interact with us.</p>  <p>  The JobPath service has proven to be effective, it rates highly with the vast majority of participants who use the service and the Government will continue to offer the service in line with our obligations to jobseekers and our commitments to the service providers.</p></speech>

She was not listening.  We are the Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, the messenger-boys of the people.  I have received countless complaints about the awful experiences of participants in the programme.  I describe Turas Nua as "Turas Uaf&aacute;sach".  An dtuigeann an tAire sin?  It means "an awful journey".

I cannot be receiving all the complaints, and nor can the Sinn F&eacute;in Party members who brought forward the motion.</p>  <p>  I am alarmed that although the Minister noted she was voted down, having made her contribution, she has indicated that votes in the House do not count anymore.

I echo Deputy Mattie McGrath's contribution that it is shocking that the Minister would ignore the democratic wishes of the majority of the House, not least given that she must make a decision on whether she will renew the contract.  Will she indicate whether she intends to renew the JobPath contract for the two companies?</p>  <p>  It has emerged that one of the companies, namely, Turas Nua, outsources to another company, namely, Working Links, which has received 50% of the money paid by the State to the entity.  The latter company is in trouble, however, and has entered administration in Britain.  The British chief inspector of probation ranked the company as "inadequate" and found "professional ethics [were] compromised and immutable lines crossed because of business imperatives".  Does the Minister intend to re-administer the contract to the likes of this company?  We already know from studies that it has a bad track record in Britain, as does Seetec.  The Minister has told us that she intends to ignore the democratic will of the House and reissue the contracts.</p></speech>

Of the 41,000 people, however, only 11,334 were sustained in employment for 12 months or more.  That is a minuscule number.</p>  <p>  The Minister failed to answer my question when I put it to her earlier and, therefore, I reiterate it now.  Is she satisfied that the figure represents value for money?  Millions of taxpayers' euros have been spent on this failed programme and given to Turas Nua and Seetec, yet only 11,334 jobs have been sustained for 12 months or more.  It is a simple question.  Is it value for money and can she stand over those ludicrously low figures?</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that in the social enterprise sector, which includes bodies that run job clubs and so on, local community projects have an impressive record.  The people in charge of many of those projects, however, are worried that they will have to compete for tenders and so on against the JobPath companies and that they will be placed at a disadvantage.  Given that there are organisations that are ready to do this work and have done it well in communities throughout the country, would it not be better to give them the responsibility?</p></speech>

If there were to be any changes to the existing contracts, it would cost the State millions of euros.  As I previously stated in the House, the termination of the contracts or even a stepping-away from the contracts would significantly expose the State financially.  Even if it did not, I am not sure that anybody in the House believes that the 200,000 people who are continually on the employment live register do not need any assistance anymore, because they do.  They will continue to need assistance until there is nobody on the live register.</p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to recent announcements about the awarding of certain contracts relating to the probation service in the UK and the circumstances of Working Links.

As far as I recall, it has not.  What is the point in tabling Private Members' motions if, having been debated and passed by substantial majorities, usually in the D&aacute;il, the Government steadfastly ignores them?  In old politics, the Government came in, had a majority and voted down Private Members' motions.  In new politics, the Government gets defeated but just ignores Private Members' motions.  In addition to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question, it is a bit disingenuous to say that the Department has no direct connection or contract with the company in the UK which has gone into administration.  It owns 50% of one of the companies that the Minister is dealing with.  The Government has to be very careful when dealing with this organisation.  This is the culmination of a long line of complaints about suspected fraud on the part of that company in the UK.</p></speech>

That is exactly the sort of research on the response of the public to JobPath and the companies that run it.  The Minister is in real danger of recreating the national children's hospital on a small scale by saying that it does not matter what Working Links does or not, or whether it is in trouble or not.  It is 50% owned by Turas Nua, which has received significant money from the State.  If the Minister is telling us that she will renew the contract with it, she is putting taxpayers' money in jeopardy, never mind the statement that she cannot significantly expose the State financially by breaking contracts.  What are these companies doing by exposing the State at this level?</p></speech>

This is supposed to be the seat of democracy in this State.  Thousands of people are looking on at this debate and looked on two weeks ago when the D&aacute;il voted on JobPath and gave a resounding answer to it.  The Minister describes herself as a democrat.  She should listen to the will of the people and the Chamber.  For her to say that she will not listen and to disregard totally the will of the D&aacute;il is shameful, to say the least.  I will try for the fifth time to ask a simple question.  The Minister comes in here and says she deals with figures, statistics and reality.  Of the 41,000 full-time jobs that she says have been created, only 11,334 have been sustained in employment for 12 months or more.  Does the Minister deem that to be value for money?  Does she still think that is the most successful job activation scheme in the State?</p></speech>

They also have a special advantage in that they have access to other funds outside of the activation funds which they can apply to us for to be able to provide extra resources for people who have particular difficulty.  They have access to the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  I am completely supportive of what they do.  We could not deliver our service without them.

We are aware of the ongoing issues with Working Links and we will continue to work with Turas Nua to provide the service which it has supplied to us for the last number of years.  I am repeating myself.  Without JobPath, we would not have 5.3% unemployment, having dropped from 15.7% unemployment.  Deputy Brady and I will never agree on that and that is fine.  I respect his views, as I respect the views of everybody in this House who shared them with me last week.  My job is to honour the contractual obligations that the State has entered into with two companies in order to assist us with the 195,000 people who are unemployed.  Whether Deputies have forgotten about them or not, we have not.</p></speech>

I do not know whether she was talking about the cost of living index or average earnings index.  I think that when the Taoiseach was Minister for Social Protection, he floated that idea.  It has been discussed for a long time.  Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy of Social Justice Ireland has advocated strongly for social welfare rates to be linked to average earnings.  First, we have to establish that social protection rates would be above the poverty line and that they are linked to average earnings.  What is the Minister thinking on this and what kind of work has the Department done on it?</p></reply>

A Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023, published last year, commits the Government to examine and develop proposals to set a formal benchmark target of 34% of earnings for the State pension (contributory) and to institute a process whereby future changes in pension rates of payment are explicitly linked to changes in consumer prices and average wages.  The Department is currently considering options to implement this commitment, having examined previous studies on benchmarking and indexation, international experiences and examination of a range of potential benchmarks and indices.  It is worthy of note that the current rates of payment already closely mirror the benchmark-linked process in previous reports including those proposed by the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group in 2001 which is usually relied on by advocacy and other groups.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy, the European Anti Poverty Network, EAPN, the National Childhood Network and the Children's Rights Alliance.  They are all genuinely in favour of pursuing the conversation on this and trying to come up with an algorithm of what we can agree that benchmarking should be against.</p><p>In terms of the wider application of the indexation of social welfare payments generally, section 19 of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act 2018 provides that I, as Minister, will arrange to consult with stakeholders on examining ways in which social welfare rates are increased with the aim of ensuring in law the adequacy for all recipients.  I am doing that.  I met with them last week and we arranged to sit down in the next few weeks to start that consultative process.  It is really important because if we decide to do something collectively, as a House, with regard to benchmarking, I cannot do it without the collective will of the people in the organisations that represent the people of most need in this country.  We all have to agree on the algorithm and that it is going to be sustainable.  We also have to ensure there will not be cuts in the future, such as those inflicted on this Department in recent years.</p></speech>

Will the Department do any kind of impact assessments?  When the Minister responded to my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Deputy Brady, on this subject she gave global figures but no indication of what it would be if it was not a &euro;5 increase across the board.</p>  <p>  This morning the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, published a report entitled Inequality in Ireland and Europe - Cherishing all Equally 2019 which once again highlighted that the lower four quartiles of the population get slightly over 20% of the national income and the key importance of social transfers, especially for lone parent families and many of our senior citizens.  This is an area where the general proposal could be welcome but we need to be very careful about how we would implement it, especially given the fact that parts of the social welfare system, for example, the Christmas bonus, do not appear anywhere in the basic accounts.  They are last minute decisions and in the past two years the Minister had to go back to the Minister for Finance to get &euro;50 million more, I think, for the disability allowance budget to make sure there was enough money for the year.  When will the Department publish something in this area?</p></speech>

I have been corresponding with the officials in the Department, trying to arrange a meeting to discuss that and bring forward the proposals contained in that Bill.  Has the Minister read the Bill and does she think there is merit in it?  Generally, I think we are talking about the same thing but it should not be linked solely to the CPI.  It needs to be linked to adequacy and that is the key point in all this.</p></speech>

The cost of disability tender will, I hope, go out by the end of this month.  That body of work will inform all disability payments in the future arising from the special cost of living, over and above a jobseeker's or a pensioner's allowance.  It will probably take 12 months.  I have asked for preliminary results if I can get them before this year's budget.  It may not be possible but my intentions are clear that I need to reflect people's lived experience of disability which is not the same as another jobseeker's experience.</p>  <p>  We will also follow up on the commitment to consult, which I expect to happen before, on and during the pre-budget forum that we hold every July.  I will engage with the social partners many times between now and July because I would like to be able to finalise the algorithm.  </p>  <p>  I have read Deputy Brady's Bill and I very much hope he will continue to process his thoughts and views in the conversation that we will have with the social partners.  The index we use is not just as simple as lining it up against one or the other.  We need to come up with an amalgamation of an algorithm of what we decide is going to provide adequacy in pensionable or working age for a person with a disability.  That needs to be defined and agreed by all of us, otherwise it will not pass in this House and I will be wasting my time.</p>  <p>  I think I differ from Deputy O'Dea in that all our payments are above the 30% index rate but he was right that if we decide it is 30% and people are below that, they have to be brought up to whatever it is we agree before we introduce indexing and allow it to move on thereafter.  It is not like the Low Pay Commission.  If we had a minimum wage people would have to be brought up to that before we could allow the Low Pay Commission do its work on an annual basis, and we all expect and respect the report that comes from it.  This has to be the same.  We all have to agree that the starting bar is X, and then we have to agree on the algorithm or the indexing calculation to get us to a Y recommendation every year from the equivalent of the Low Pay Commission or whatever body we decide we can trust with it but there has to be a baseline, an algorithm and a calculation that we all agree.</p></speech>

The survey on income and living conditions, SILC, published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in 2017 showed that one in five households with children was living below the poverty line.  The Government committed to trying to take 100,000 children out of poverty.  That is intimately related to the transfer payments and if we went down the index-linked route having a benchmark of adequacy is the key requirement.  The Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, has been very critical of the <i>ad hoc</i>way we have done the Christmas bonus and increases over the years, rather than planning the expenditure and saying we will do this indefinitely.  The Minister might have seen a report at the weekend by Professor Jan Rigby of Maynooth University, stating that the increase in life expectancy rates had fallen during the austerity years which is a damning reflection on our social protection system.</p></speech>

On an annual basis, the live register has been falling rapidly, for which we are to be thankful.  In 2018 it fell by 15.5% nationally.  In Tipperary town it fell by 18.2%, which is equal to almost 200 people coming off the live register during the course of 2018. </p>  <p>  My Government is determined to provide the best possible environment for economic growth along with job retention and job creation, as well as introducing a renewed focus on the best possible approaches to enable those remaining numbers of long-term unemployed to find suitable work.  The careers fair in Tipperary town on 1 February was part of that effort and was organised jointly by my Department and Tipperary Education and Training Board, ETB.  It aimed to increase awareness of the supports available to jobseekers and employers, along with providing information on current employment opportunities in the area.  In addition to staff from my Department and Tipperary ETB, the event was also attended by a range of employers and community-based organisations, including ten community employment schemes.</p>  <p>  The event was attended by almost 800 people over the course of the day.  I attended the event and there was a huge sense of enthusiasm and goodwill from everybody present, even the protestors outside.  Evaluation sheets completed by 450 of those attending confirmed this, with 90% positive feedback and particular mention of the level of information and support available to jobseekers at the event.  Feedback received to date from exhibitors also has been very positive.   </p>  <p>  A number of people have been invited for interview or to make applications for positions and others hope to follow up on contacts made at the event.  Tipperary ETB received 400 expressions of interest in training opportunities and there was a strong interest in apprenticeships.  All of these expressions of interest will be followed up by my Department and Tipperary ETB.  There were also a large number of expressions of interest in our community employment, CE, scheme placements.  Arising from that day, 13 individuals so far have been approved for CE scheme places.   </p>  <p>  I am also happy to inform the Deputy that, because of the success of the careers day in Tipperary, a similar event will be held in Clonmel on 27 March.  The Deputy is very welcome to come, given that he did not attend the last one.</p></speech>

Tonight I raise the issue of the plight of two female employees of the University of Limerick, who have spent the last number of years on half pay and who are now suspended and in receipt of social welfare payments.  These are dedicated, hard-working and courageous women who performed their duties in an exemplary manner.  One might well ask what nefarious crime they committed to find themselves in this unfortunate situation?  They blew the whistle on blatant wrongdoing and exposed wasteful, wrongful and wanton expenditure of taxpayers' money.</p>  <p>  They have been vindicated by a number of independent reports, they have been vindicated by the Comptroller and Auditor General and, importantly and perhaps astonishingly, they have been vindicated by their employer.  On 23 November 2017 and on 15 March 2018, the University of Limerick acknowledged that their suspension between 2015 and 2017 was wrong.  It went on to apologise for describing their complaint as malicious.  Last year the university wrote to these employees thanking them for bringing important matters to the attention of the university and recognising their courage in doing so, courage which it said was greatly valued.  Despite this, they are still suspended and are now, as I have said, reliant on the tender mercies of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Apparently the university is prepared to apologise to them privately.  It should apologise to them publicly.</p>  <p>  When they were vindicated, the Department or the Higher Education Authority, HEA, organised a mediation process to get them back to work.  Mr. Kieran Mulvey was appointed as the mediator.  They only had one meeting with him and he told them he was delegating the matter to a consultant, Mr. Sean O'Driscoll.  On various occasions they were promised by the university that a transition process would be put in place whereby they would be able to take a course in the university, for which the university would pay, while at the same time they would be gradually reintroduced to work.  Of course, they would not be sent back to the finance department, where I personally know that there is a great deal of hostility towards them.  It would not be possible for them to go back to the finance department.  Suddenly, in July last year the university unilaterally withdrew these promises and directed them to go back to the finance department, giving them literally no choice.  It was the modern version of Cromwell's injunction to the dispossessed Irish, to hell or to Connacht.  It was to hell or to the finance department.  The Minister should believe me that it would be hell for these people to go back to the finance department.  I know what I am talking about because I have represented that constituency for many years and know all the various actors in this particular drama.</p>  <p>  This issue brings into question the efficacy of the whole whistleblowing system.  It is fatally flawed if two genuine whistleblowers can end up being treated in this fashion.  I also remind the House that the University of Limerick recently conferred an honorary degree on Ms Vicky Phelan for having the courage to tell the truth and to do the State some service.  The attitude of the university to its own employees who have also told the truth and done the State some service is radically different.  This is intolerable and unacceptable.  It makes a mockery of the whistleblowing process for which the Government claims so much kudos for introducing.  What action does the Department or the HEA intend to take in respect of the plight of these women?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to speak on this issue publicly.  I know his county colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, and his party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, have also raised this issue in these Chambers.  By way of background, the Deputy will be aware that the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 provides a detailed and comprehensive legal framework to allow any worker who is penalised for making a protected disclosure to secure redress.  The Act is supplemented by the procedures that all public bodies are required to put in place under section 21 of the Act for the making of protected disclosures and for dealing with such disclosures.  My Department operates within this legal framework when dealing with protected disclosures.  The Deputy will also appreciate that there is a legal responsibility on my Department to protect the identity of any individual who makes a protected disclosure.</p><p>While respecting this legal responsibility, I am happy to provide the Deputy with an update on the specific issue raised today.  In April 2015 the two staff members referred to by the Deputy made a protected disclosure to the then chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Minister alleging workplace bullying and errors in practice and wrongdoing that they identified as part of their work in the finance department.  Since that time, various review processes, including three independent reports, have been undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority and the University of Limerick in an effort to address the issues raised by the two staff members.  The most recent of the reports, the Thorn report, published in November 2017, outlined a number of recommendations related to the allegations made by the two staff members, referred to as persons B and C in the report, and those of a number of other individuals who had come forward as part of the process.  The university accepted in full the recommendations made in the Thorn report and has been liaising with the HEA and the Department on its progress in the implementation of the recommendations.</p> <p> Arising from the Thorn report, the university embarked on a process of mediation, led by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, former head of the Workplace Relations Commission, with a number of the individuals referenced in the report in an effort to reach a satisfactory resolution of their issues.  The two staff members referred to by the Deputy were included in this mediation process, during which the university engaged with them to facilitate their return to work.  However, my understanding is that mutually acceptable employment positions could not be agreed to between the parties.  The mediation process in respect of the two staff members was unable to reach a satisfactory outcome and has now ended.</p> <p> The issue was most recently discussed at a meeting last week between the president of the University of Limerick and the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  At the meeting the president outlined the position on the steps that had been taken to facilitate the return to work of the two persons referred to by the Deputy.  The president also outlined the university&rsquo;s desire to ensure the issue would be resolved as quickly as possible and requested the assistance of the Department in that regard.  It is the view of the HEA and the Department that the issues raised by both persons have been fully investigated at this point.  The one issue that remains to be resolved is the return to work of the two individuals concerned.  It is primarily an employee-employer issue and I hope the university and the two individuals can agree on a mutually satisfactory outcome that will see these staff members return to the workplace as soon as possible.  While this is an issue for the university to resolve, the Deputy has raised it here publicly, while Deputy Michael McGrath raised it previously, as has Senator Maria Byrne in conversation.  I want to let the Deputy know that I have discussed it with my officials since it was raised.  My Department is willing to assist the university in exploring potential opportunities to facilitate a return to the workplace of the two individuals in question.</p></speech>

What practical steps can it take to bring it to a successful conclusion?  We have a situation where people were wrongfully suspected.  They are being forced to rely on social welfare payments.  They did the State some service and we want to get them back to work.  Does the Minister agree with me that it does not indicate good faith on the part of the university when it directed them to go back into the very section of the department where it was known that they would not be accepted, where they would encounter hostility and where it would be impossible for them to work?   That indicates to me an intention or objective on the part of the university to essentially get rid of the two staff members.  Would the Minister regard it as useful to meet them in order that they could tell him face to face about their experiences and in order that he could tell them what the Department intended to do to assist the process of getting them back to work?  What can we expect to happen next?</p></speech>

I am conscious of this, but I did say publicly that I would become involved to try to facilitate an outcome that would be satisfactory to all parties.  The Secretary General has met the president of the university and I did emphasise the word "any".  They are going to look at opportunities, but at the end of the day, we cannot force people to go into something in which they will not be happy.  That would not yield an outcome that would be desirable.  I acknowledge the Deputy's points about the service both individuals have provided.  I am very conscious of this, but I am also conscious of my role not to become directly involved.  I am confident that when the president and my officials sit down and the two individuals at the heart of the issue, there will be opportunities presented to them to find a solution.  Without pre-empting the outcome, I take the Deputy's offer at face value to meet them.  At this stage it might be a little early for me to do so because I am confident that the parties and the employee-employer relationship will be protected in finding a solution.  I am confident that they will find a solution with which both individuals will be happy.  I will certainly be happy to meet them after a solution is found.</p></speech>

I am asking her to address the recent findings made by the ESRI that disadvantaged parents were twice as likely to have unmet childcare needs as those in better off groups.  This is on the back of a report that was issued in the past few days.  The document examines data collected by the CSO for 5,219 households and 13,186 individuals.  The analysis made in the paper uses weights designed by the CSO in order to ensure the sample is representative of the population.  The survey looked at whether households with persons in need of care, defined as children under the age of 12 years and people who were older or had a disability which required the provision of care for them, had an unmet need in making these care arrangements, that is, whether they needed more care than they were in receipt of.</p>  <p>  The survey found that 24.5% of lone parent households had unmet needs.  I found this shocking.  Some 35% of households experiencing deprivation also had an unmet childcare need.  Between about 70% and 90% of people with unmet needs report the reason as an inability to afford formal childcare services.  Again, lone parents emerge as the group facing the worst situation, with 91% reporting that they cannot afford the required formal childcare service.  When we talk about lone parents, sometimes people think we are talking about those who are completely in the social welfare system, but that is not the case.  Many lone parents go out to work and are struggling to meet their childcare needs.  We have had numerous reports from the ESRI and elsewhere and all know that the cost of childcare is crippling.  It is incredibly difficult for single parents who are trying to rear a family and cannot afford to pay for childcare.</p><p>The affordable childcare scheme was announced by the Minister in 2016 and we had hoped it would be up and running by 2017.  However, owing to ICT requirements, it is not yet ready.  What comfort can we give to parents who find themselves between the cracks?  Children do not have access to childcare services.  While a child might have access to the ECCE programme, his or her parents are not able to provide full-time childcare because they cannot afford it and so cannot afford to return to work.  The vicious circle begins and parents are not able to get out of it.  Will the Minister explain to the lone parents watching these proceedings how they will be able to access the system?  How will it benefit them?  I am aware that it is income based, but the lone parents at the lower end of the threshold are finding it very difficult.  One of the main reasons is the lack of affordable childcare services.</p></speech>

The research report is from that year.  The years I have been in office as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs have seen an unprecedented increase in investment in key early learning and care, ELC, and school age childcare, SAC, areas, with annual investment rising to &euro;574 million, a 117% increase since 2015.  The increases have allowed us to introduce measures designed to be a major step towards accessible, affordable and quality ELC and SAC after decades of under-investment by successive Governments.</p>  <p>  The measures I have introduced include increases of up to 50% in targeted subsidies since 2016 and the introduction of a universal childcare subvention payment of up to &euro;1,040 per annum for the care of children aged from six months to the first eligible point of entry of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.  We have also since the report was carried out doubled the free pre-school scheme ECCE to enable parents access to two years instead of one.  These changes are waypoints towards our goal of delivering genuine affordable, accessible, quality ELC and SAC.  The launch of the new affordable childcare scheme this coming October will alter the landscape of childcare in Ireland.  It will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving children the best start in life.  </p>  <p>  In December I signed regulations which will provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services with Tusla.  The regulations came into force yesterday, 18 February.  This means that parents of school-age children will be eligible to apply for subsidies under the affordable childcare scheme from the outset.  Under measures included in budget 2019, I was able to further enhance the affordable childcare scheme by raising the upper and lower thresholds for income-related subsidies, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000, up from &euro;22,700.  The increases will ensure an even greater number of families will benefit from the highest subsidy rates available under the scheme once it is launched. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note, particularly in the context of our discussion, that the Childcare Support Act 2018, the legislative basis for the new scheme, specifies five statutory bodies which may make agreements on referral procedures for free or additional childcare for children with the greatest level of need.  These are known as sponsor arrangements.  I also highlight that First 5, the Government&rsquo;s ten-year strategy for babies, young children and their families, was launched in November 2018.  It is a fundamental concept which provides for a progressive universalism and seeks to strengthen the supports and services available for all babies, young children and families and put in place additional measures for those with additional needs. </p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to radically reform childcare services for the benefit of children, families, women, our society and economy.  I believe that when the ESRI or any other research body does a similar piece of work utilising SILC CSO data from 2017, 2018 or 2019, conclusions on the childcare needs of disadvantaged  parents will have changed significantly for the better.</p></speech>

I welcome all of the good work the Minister has done, but I still have concerns about lone parents and families with one income.  That is why I have raised this question which I know the Minister understands.  For a two-income family childcare costs are a little less of a burden.  As the Minister gets ready for next year's budget, is she making any provision for the single income family?  I am thinking of the trainee nurse or beautician with a child who needs access to care.  If these persons cannot afford it, or if they are at a certain stage of their career progression or in education, will there be a mechanism under which we can support and encourage them into the workforce?  Their income might be below a particular threshold, but they will still need to be able to access full-time childcare.  Consideration must be given to them.  I would love to hear the Minister's response in that regard.</p><p>The Minister is planning to launch a campaign which will involve <i>myGov.ie</i>.  We have to make people aware of why they have to sign up to the website and the need to use it and tell them that it will prohibit them if they are not registered on time.  There are so many families who are not registered on it.  How will the Minister's Department communicate this message to families to encourage them to sign up?  It is important that they follow the process and sign up in advance.  If we wait until next September to do it, the system will crash.</p></speech>

Single parent families were a key group I had in mind when I decided to move towards the affordable childcare scheme.  Even though the full scheme is not ready to be launched and the streamlining of all of the different targeted subsidies is not yet complete, from the beginning of my ministry and the first budget I negotiated I have received additional targeted subsidies especially to enable those families with the least to get the most to meet their childcare needs.  This is in addition to the universal payments available if single parents have an early born child.  From the very beginning much of the political approach I have taken has been to design the affordable childcare scheme which simply seeks to bring together the various schemes already available in order that they will be easier to administer.  Prior to that happening, we have increased significantly the targeted subsidies, especially for those families with the least income.  They receive the most.  When research is carried out in the future on the position in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019, I believe we will see a different picture.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked whether there could be something in particular provided to target one-parent families.  In the context of the overall plan and the overall family and household income thresholds, the scheme is probably sufficient; those who have the least get the most.  It is also true that, with the First 5 strategy, we are looking to develop a model that will offer a more DEIS-type approach to early learning and care centres in areas where one-parent families are seeking to access childcare and particularly in need of it. </p>  <p>  The Deputy's questions on the information campaign are excellent.  We are working on it and hope to initiate it in the next month.</p><p>All those aspects, especially those relating to the MyGovID portal, are absolutely crucial for people to be aware of, especially where lone-parent families are seeking to access the subsidies.</p></speech>

Imagine announced plans for 400,000 premises earmarked for the intervention area as well.  These announcements are welcome for those who will finally have the potential to receive high-speed broadband.  These people have been across the digital divide for some time.</p><p>For 140,000 households not included in last week's announcements the national broadband plan remains the only show in town.  The announcements have several potential knock-on effects and the Minister needs to clarify the situation.  What is the position for the households not included in last week's announcement?  The first question arises around the size of the intervention area.  The rules of the national broadband plan were clear, as I understood them anyway.  The plan cannot cover areas where a commercial operator is already in place or has already identified an area as being commercially feasible.  Can the Minister confirm that the size of the intervention area has been reduced as a result of last week's announcements?</p><p>The second question is around a timeline for the national broadband plan.  We understand that the final tender has been with the Department since September.  In November, the Minister indicated that he would bring his recommendation before the Cabinet within weeks.  Since then we have not heard much detail other than that it will happen within weeks.  Perhaps the Minister can give us some clarity on that point.</p><p>Have these announcements in the past week or week and a half delayed decisions being brought forward by the Minister and his Department?  Had the Minister any foreknowledge or forewarning that these announcements were imminent?  Did he know that the companies concerned were working on plans to roll out high-speed broadband to those areas?</p><p>The final issue is around cost.  We know the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment accepted at the Committee of Public Accounts that it was reasonable to conclude that the removal of the 300,000 homes from the intervention area in March 2017 made the national broadband plan less attractive to bidders.  Does the same logic apply here?  Can we assume that the decisions of Eir and Imagine to effectively offer a service to potentially in excess of 400,000 homes will impact significantly on the attractiveness of the national broadband plan?  I would have thought it was reasonable to assume that the final price and roll-out will be influenced by the size of the intervention area.  It is reasonable to assume that the NBP cannot be rolled out in areas where a commercial operator is in place.  We know the issues around state aid rules.  Prior to the development of the intervention area map there was a good deal of toing and froing between the Department and the European Commission.</p><p>It is reasonable to assume the NBP cannot be rolled out in areas where a commercial operator is already in place or has already proposed to roll out a service on a commercial basis.  If the intervention area shrinks by up to 400,000 overnight, what will happen to the cost to the State?  Has the cost per household of the roll-out increased or decreased as a result of the announcements last week?  It was reported previously, in rather informed leaks to <i>The Irish Times</i>towards the end of last year, that the cost of the national broadband plan to the State was a multiple of what was originally envisaged and outlined in the national development plan.  The figures quoted then seemed to suggest that it had increased by between four and six times what had been originally envisaged.  Can the Minister provide us with some clarity?  How much is Granahan McCourt potentially going to get paid in that case?</p></speech>

It is of considerable importance.  The backdrop to the national broadband plan is exactly as the Deputy described.  The purpose of the national broadband plan was to promote commercial investment to the maximum extent possible.  Indeed there has been &euro;2.75 billion worth of investment in upgrading telecommunications networks since the national broadband plan process started.</p>  <p>  The issue of the intervention area where a subsidy can apply, as the Deputy has said, is confined to areas where it has been established that other companies will not provide a commercial service to an adequate standard.  Some time ago it was envisaged that there would be approximately 750,000 premises in the intervention area.  However, through monitoring by my Department and discussions with the commercial providers the figure was reduced by 300,000 where Eir undertook to deliver to the necessary standard on a commercial basis.  At the same time some areas were added to the amber area or the intervention area provided the Department was satisfied that people in the relevant areas would not be served by companies that had previously signalled an ability to do so.</p>  <p>  The position on these new investments, which are welcome indeed, is that my Department is seeking an early meeting with both companies.  At this point neither operator has submitted commercial or technical plans for the Department to assess.  For the Department to determine that the companies have met the standard to reduce the size of the intervention area we will need to have a certain level of scrutiny of the proposals.  The intention of the national broadband plan was to deliver to 100% of premises a high-speed service, which was specified at that stage as being 30 Mbps.</p>  <p>  The only other comment to be made is that the two announcements by Eir and Imagine are somewhat different.  The announcement by Eir covered expanding the company's commitment to deliver fibre to the home.  This indicates the trend of the thinking across much of the sector that fibre to the home is the standard to which we need to move in the long term.  The Imagine proposal is delivered through wireless technology so it is somewhat different in its delivery.  I realise there were comments and questions in the committee about the capacity to deliver 100% in the way that fibre would.  These are issues that the Department will want to work out with the two companies to see what impact they might have on the intervention area.</p></speech>

The final line in the Minister's written statement is that he expects to bring a recommendation to Government on the national broadband plan in the coming weeks.  I take it that will be influenced to a large extent by the discussions or presentations from the companies concerned to the Department on the impact of their announcements on the intervention area.  I can assume that is the case.</p>  <p>  If the intervention area is to change significantly, then the position is absolutely clear.  If the 120,000 homes that are still not covered by any of the commercial operators are to be facilitated, then the cost effectively remains the same.  This is because of the need to roll out high-speed broadband to the areas concerned.  It is effectively the same network that we will have to roll out so the cost per household goes up significantly.  Does the Minister accept this is a factor or at least that it comes about as a result of the tardiness of this Government and the previous Government in reaching a decision and failing to roll out the service?  As a result of tardiness and delay we are now left with a situation whereby we are effectively going to have to pay the same amount of money to cover far fewer homes.</p>  <p>  The public private partnership that was envisaged as part of the national broadband plan bidding process recognised that in addition to the State subvention there would be a revenue return from customer uptake.</p><p>If the cherry-picking has been done, given the two announcements, it is going to put a much greater liability on the State and delay further the roll-out of high-speed broadband to those homes.</p></speech>

The figure that Eir and the Department have in common is 335, so there are 35,000 additional premises served by Eir.  At the same time, there is a considerable number of premises which the Department has identified, in addition to the 84,000 that were taken out before, where although there was an indication that commercial service would be delivered, it does not now seem that it will be delivered.</p>  <p>  On the service which is wireless and based on 5G technology, the point has to be made that both the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, and the Department's experts have always argued - indeed, in common with much of the industry - that 5G networks and 4G networks are complementary technology to fibre roll-out and are not a replacement.  There are a number of reasons for that.  One is that the wireless technology is line-of-sight, which has restrictions on its capacity.  To overcome those restrictions, one would need to build a great number of masts.  The evaluation by ComReg indicated that to build the number of masts on the scale needed would cost in the region of &euro;1.8 billion.  The second reason is that it is shared or, I think the word is "contested", which means that when a service is delivered, the more people who come on board for the service means that it becomes diluted, which is unlike fibre to the home.</p>  <p>  There are issues here that clearly the Department has to tease out with the two companies.  It would be untrue for the Deputy to assume that the intervention area has been reduced to whatever the number he quoted as result of these decisions.  Clearly, investment in this area is very welcome.  It brings forward the delivery of service but we will listen closely to the companies before we give an indication and I will inform the Deputy.</p></speech>

It is fair to say the planning laws are only as good as their enforcement and each local authority has a different approach.  In addition, the courts are often involved in the most egregious cases.  As is usual, I am dealing with several unauthorised developments at the moment, as I think is every other Deputy.  I have chosen three to give a flavour of some of the problems.</p>  <p>  The first is a garage and panel-beating business within a residential setting in Naas.  It is located to the side of a private home and it does not have planning permission.  An unauthorised development file was opened in May 2015, following which the council initiated legal proceedings later that year.  After many District Court postponements, the case was heard in September 2017.  Following that, there was an application to retain, which was subsequently rejected and which was then appealed.  When that process was exhausted, an application to declare the development an exempted development was made and rejected and is being appealed.  In the meantime, the council is back in the District Court and the case has been mentioned but postponed until the appeal is decided.  In the meantime, the neighbouring home is subject to noise from early morning until late at night with activity at weekends and their garden is now simply off-limits to them.  I am also told that the licence for chemicals has expired, so there are potential health and fire risk implications.  No commercial rates are being paid because there is no planning permission.  That is totally unfair on other businesses which are trading in an unequal environment.  No development levies are being paid either.  In May of this year, it will be four years since the unauthorised development file was opened and it looks like it will still be in operation four years later.</p>  <p>  The second example is a large quarry in Ballysax beside the Curragh in south Kildare.  The Ceann Comhairle will be more than familiar with this particular one, which is not in my constituency.  The site in question has no planning permission and its footprint has expanded to more than 60 acres.  It has gone through the whole entire unauthorised development process, including warning letters and enforcement and has gone right up to the High Court which made an order to cease operation.  The decision specified that quarry owners were to wind down the activity.  They were given a very generous six months to do that.  They were to cease all activities on 1 February of this year.  What has happened is that the activity has accelerated and the footprint has widened.  The amount of traffic has noticeably increased.  I have photographs that show this and are truly shocking.  The council has applied to the Circuit Court to enforce the High Court order.  The council is now in the hands of the court as to when the case will be heard.</p>  <p>  There is an interesting contrast between how Kildare County Council and Wicklow County Council apply the law regarding quarries.  Wicklow takes a no-nonsense, straight in with the injunction approach, while Kildare takes a more lenient approach.  There is a noticeable contrast in the behaviour by quarry owners when a different approach is applied.</p>  <p>  This quarry has no planning permission and, therefore, there are no funds for reinstatement, there are no bonds, there are no development levies and there is significant ongoing damage being done to the roads which the council is repeatedly repairing.  It is being argued that the road repairs are being funded from the public purse to facilitate what is essentially an illegal development.  The neighbouring homes are living with dust, noise, heavy commercial activity, significant damage to the landscape and the water table has been altered.  There are mountains of soil there that did not exist before.  I have numerous photographs which I can give to the Minister as to the operation and planning breach here.</p>  <p>  I will continue with what I was going to say in my response later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900035#HH00400"><p>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this important issue which is the enforcement of planning law regarding unauthorised developments and consequential damage and maintenance issues concerning surrounding infrastructure.  I am conscious that in her presentation she mentioned cases, the details of which I do not have and of which I am not aware.  She has put them on the record and we can check them out.  That may help to inform future decision-making but I cannot comment on something I did not know about until it was presented tonight.</p>  <p>  On the issue the Deputy raised, I take this opportunity, as Minister of State, to outline my role in relation to the planning system which is mainly to provide and update the legislative and policy guidance framework.  The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the associated planning and development regulations.  Furthermore, my Department issued a large number of planning guidelines under section 28 of the Planning Act to guide planning authorities in relation to the implementation of the wider planning policy framework which they and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard to in the exercise of their planning functions.</p>  <p>  However, the day-to-day operation of the planning system is a matter for the individual planning authorities and under section 30 of the Act, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I are specifically prohibited from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue with which a planning authority or the board is or may be concerned with.  The Deputy has outlined a number of cases, and will probably mention more later on, of which I have become aware but in which I do not have a role.  It is worth hearing about them because, as we review policy, it is important we keep all scenarios in mind.</p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, any development which requires permission and does not have that permission is unauthorised development.  This is also the case with a development which is proceeding in breach of conditions laid down in the planning permission or any exempted development that is carried out that does not comply with the limitations of that exemption.</p>  <p>  The planning code also provides that enforcement of planning control is a matter for the individual planning authorities, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  In this regard, planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the Act.</p>  <p>  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice in connection with an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority is further empowered to enter on the land and take such steps, including the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure, as is deemed necessary as well as to recover any costs incurred in undertaking such actions.</p><p>Second, a planning authority may also seek a court order under section 160 of the Act requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  For example, a person can be required to cease carrying out unauthorised development or can be required to restore any land to its condition prior to the unauthorised activity being carried out.</p> <p> Taking account of these points, responsibility for enforcement action in respect of any breach of the planning code is a matter for individual planning authorities under the powers available to them under the Act.  Accordingly, individual cases of unauthorised developments or non-compliance with planning permissions should be brought to the attention of the relevant planning authority, which can then take the necessary and timely action as provided for in planning legislation.</p></speech>

Like any of us who have been through the local government system, I am well aware of the process.  I accept that there are guidelines but are they being adhered to?  The Minister of State mentioned that planning authorities must have regard to them.  In theory, local authorities can enter onto lands but that never happens and there are undoubtedly people who use every avenue to prolong a process.  That is in their interests.  They are not paying the commercial rates, levies and so on that go into the public purse.</p>  <p>  This problem undermines the planning process and is unfair on the developments' neighbours.  In some cases, public funds are being used to carry out repairs.  In the case of a quarry, for example, who will pay for the reinstatement?  No commercial rates, bonds or development levies were paid over.</p>  <p>  Standards are set across a range of areas, but where someone has an unauthorised development, there is no testing or enforcement of those standards.  Are data collected regarding how many unauthorised commercial developments are not subject to commercial rates?  Is there a risk assessment of liabilities?  In Naas in my constituency, we ended up with a mountainous dump that went on fire and cost more than &euro;20 million to reinstate.  It was an unauthorised development that had consequences.</p>  <p>  Are there plans to tighten up the unauthorised development process?  Is there oversight of attempts to get consistency in local authorities' application of unauthorised development laws, given that that application can vary?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, I cannot get involved in or exercise any power in respect of any particular case, including an enforcement issue with which a planning authority is or may be concerned.  Recently, though, I have stated that we are prepared to examine this area.  We set policy and guidance, which I am happy to have reviewed to see if we need to strengthen it.  We are in talks with local authorities around the country concerning various issues.  In terms of dereliction and vacant properties, for example, we have examined whether their enforcement powers need to be strengthened and whether the Act is strong enough.  That is something that I can talk about and am happy to discuss.  We can review the policy and legislative situation in respect of the cases the Deputy raised but the cases themselves must be dealt with individually by each local authority.  Responsibility for enforcement action in respect of any breach of the planning code is a matter for individual planning authorities.  In the cases the Deputy referenced, that is Kildare County Council.</p>  <p>  Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the comprehensive enforcement powers that are available to planning authorities.  If we need to strengthen them in general, that is something that we can review.  Indeed, we review it on an ongoing basis, and changes were made a number of years ago to the planning code.  I agree with the Deputy that local authorities should be in a strong position and be able to use their powers when they feel doing so is appropriate.  I also agree that there can be delays in planning authorities taking enforcement action against unauthorised developments and that situations may arise in which those developments impact on the surrounding infrastructure.  For instance, if damage is caused to roads by certain construction activity and is not acted upon, it can at the very least be a source of annoyance or inconvenience for local residents, never mind the additional cost it incurs for us all.</p>  <p>  It is important that there be enforcement, and at an early stage where possible.  The earlier that an instance of unauthorised development or non-compliance with planning permission is brought to the attention of the relevant planning authority, the earlier the relevant enforcement powers provided for in legislation can be activated by the authority.  Where authorities deem it fit, these powers should be activated as quickly as possible in such situations.</p>  <p>  In general, I would be happy to examine enforcement powers to see if they can be strengthened.</p></speech>

In commending the motion to the D&aacute;il, I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and the background to the programme in which Ireland wishes to participate.</p><p>The EDA is an agency of the European Union established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004 &quot;to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future&quot;.  On 6 July 2004, the then Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the EDA.  Ireland has participated in a number of EDA projects since we commenced our participation in the agency in 2005.  They included projects in the area of maritime surveillance and networking, a force protection project that involved measures to protect military forces engaged in operational activities, a programme relating to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection, projects focused on counter-improvised explosives devices manual neutralisation techniques, and a project on co-operation on cyberranges in the EU.</p><p>This proposal seeks approval for Ireland to participate in the EDA military search capability-building project.  This is a key capability when working in a contested environment.  The Defence Forces engage extensively in specialist military search activities, dealing with unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices and ensuring a safe and secure operating environment for military operations.  The Defence Forces engineer specialist search and clearance teams are regularly deployed on both home and overseas operations.</p><p> There are two specialist search teams operating overseas in UNDOF and UNIFIL and they predominantly conduct route searches and area clearances in advance of vehicle or foot patrols.  The Defence Forces have also provided this capability to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in support of aid to civil power operations during high profile visits by foreign VIPs and for searches for bodies and weapons.  A recent example of this was the deployment of military search teams to search buildings and open areas involved in the Papal visit last summer.  There have also been a number of searches for the bodies of missing persons and more conventional operations against paramilitary groups and criminal organisations.</p> <p> The Defence Forces corps of engineers does not have specialist search teams at an advanced search capability level.  Advanced search personnel are capable of conducting hazardous environment search, working in confined space and operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  Participation by the Defence Forces in this project addresses this capability gap.</p> <p> It was very clear to me following the discussions with the select committee that the committee members all recognised the importance of ensuring our Defence Forces personnel are equipped and trained to meet the needs of Government and ensure the protection of our State.  The aim of the project is to develop common processes, techniques and procedures for military search for contributing member states. </p> <p> The overall cost of the project is &euro;2.28 million over six years and it will be funded by eight participating member states.  Funding comprises both financial contributions and contributions in kind.  Ireland's contribution over the lifetime of the project is &euro;157,500.  This comprises &euro;102,500 contributions in kind associated with hosting an international seminar and a number of training events, and a direct financial contribution of &euro;55,000.  Costs will be met within the defence Vote.</p> <p> The anticipated benefits of the Defence Forces participation in this project are that it addresses a current deficiency at the advanced level of engineer specialist search and clearance capability, that the training to instructor level in this project will ensure that this requirement may be met in-house going forward and that the project provides an efficient and cost effective means of qualifying teams to advanced search level and maintaining their currency, which would otherwise be prohibitive if it had to be procured in the market. </p> <p> Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this project affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment in a cost effective manner, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  Participation in this European Defence Agency project has the full support of military management.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.573" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900037#KK00200"><p>I note the breathtaking speed with which the Government and the Minister of State have advanced this business through the House.  It is disappointing the defence matters of pay and conditions that we often discuss do not receive the same level of attention.  We have had many promises about deadlines around quarter 1 - quarter 2 and we have had continuous delays, yet this proposal is being advanced within a two-week window.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address pay and conditions and the core issues regarding defence-related expenditure in this House with the same degree of urgency and at a similar pace.</p>  <p>  I welcome that we have a formal declaration of support from military management for this project.  I support it and I will outline the reason I do so shortly.  However, we know that military management has not supported everything the Minister of State's Department has progressed in recent months.  It is unfortunate that some of the recommendations from military management around the pay commission were dropped and ignored by his Department.  We need to see greater collaboration and agreement on many defence matters.  I ask the Minister of State to bring a similar urgency to bear on other matters this year.</p>  <p>  Everyone in this House will be aware of Ireland's proud history of peacekeeping.  As I said previously when debating this motion, my party is supporting this proposal as it allows for us to develop our role further as a nation committed to promoting peace, understanding and co-operation.  Having listened to the Deputies who spoke against this motion on the last occasion, it seems this point is lost on them.  I note that Deputy Barrett, who is seated behind the Minister of State, has voiced many grievances but the Deputy needs to engage in internal discussions within Fine Gael.  It will be interesting to see how his votes on this matter if he is fully supporting the Government's position on this defence motion.</p>  <p>  Many of the Deputies opposed to this proposal argue that our involvement in projects such as this somehow contravenes our role as a neutral country which proactively engages positively with other European states in the pursuit of peace.  This is not true but I expect we will hear more of the same arguments again today.  Matters such as a European army were mentioned time and again at the committee.  It is important we outline, as stated by the Minister of State at the committee, that the European treaties do not allow for that rhetoric.  People can talk about it at a European level in an Irish context but it is not allowed for within European treaty law.  It is important we reiterate that whenever we are debating defence motions in this House.</p>  <p>  From my perspective, it is vital that the men and women of our Defence Forces have access to the very best in training, expertise and modern technologies in order that they are property equipped in their peacekeeping duties.  Ireland's internationally renowned reputation for peacekeeping is only strengthened by our involvement in the European Defence Agency projects such as this one.  As I have said previously, we have been participating in programmes under the European Defence Agency for the past decade and have benefited enormously from this participation.  Our Defence Forces now have world class skills and abilities in the area of peacekeeping that we would not have otherwise.</p>  <p>  Participation in the European Defence Agency has also allowed us the chance to foster better relationships with fellow EU member states, which has netted considerable savings for this State.  As we look at what is happening next door in Britain, and other isolationist policies being pursued in other parts of the world, everyone in this House should support and allow for co-operation on matters such as this.</p>  <p>  Ireland's involvement in European Defence Agency projects is underpinned by the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  It is important to remind everyone that the legislation states that any participation in such can only be for the purpose of enhancing capabilities for UN missions.  In addition, our participation is also contingent on the UN missions having the stated aim of peacekeeping, crisis management and conflict prevention.  The project being debated today, military search capability building, fits into this space.  Moreover, participation in European Defence Agency exercise is also subject to the triple lock mechanism we use for Defence Force involvement in overseas operations, meaning we must secure approval from the Government and the D&aacute;il before participating in UN peacekeeping missions.  This mechanism further strengthens our right to opt in and out of any missions as we deem appropriate, worthwhile and beneficial.</p>  <p>  All member states retain full control over defence budgets.  By approving this motion, we are approving the continued co-operation with eight other European countries, namely, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.</p>  <p>  Our position as a nation that is serious about playing an active peacekeeping role also provides us with opportunities to benefit ourselves.  Participating in projects such as this allows us to keep track of the most modern and up-to-date peacekeeping practice, including training and IT developments, while also managing to keep costs down.  Ultimately, this means our Defence Forces are fully equipped and prepared to take part in these peacekeeping operations.  Furthermore, those who participate in this project are trained to instructor level and the value of what they have learned can then be shared with other personnel.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this motion.  It is important we build capability at a domestic level in order that we can defend ourselves and have the relative capability if there was a threat.  Participating in this project facilitates that.</p></speech>

This is one of those European Defence Agency projects which the Minister of State has tried to present, both in this House and at the committee, as innocuous, inoffensive and beneficial to the Defence Forces, but that is not the case.  This motion and the sum of all of those motions that have gone before it are further steps to ingrain our Defence Forces, our foreign policy, into the European military project, to make our Defence Forces more dependent on and more integrated into an EU army.  I can hear Deputies say: "Foul, foul, there is no such thing".  They should look around them, listen and see for themselves what those counties in Europe are saying.</p><p>The Minister of State is either blind or something else.  Only last month we heard from France and Germany that they had signed a new agreement between themselves, and so they may.  Part of that agreement, however, was to make our contribution to the emergence of a European army.  We have heard Jean-Claude Juncker state that we will have an European army by 2021, or at the very latest, 2025.  It is coming.  We are on the edge of it.  Every single one of these motions - and I include this motion - is a further step towards that inevitable aim.  These are also further steps to make it more difficult for Irish soldiers and the Defence Forces to stand alone.  Ireland should have nothing to do with this.  Our magical, mystical triple-lock will not prevent us from being tainted with what the European Union will do in the future.</p> <p> The Minister of State and his predecessors in Fianna F&aacute;il have been doing the EU's bidding with this and other motions for quite a long time.  They have moved further and further away from the laudable UN peacekeeping operations and have become an integral part of the European military apparatus.  We have soldiers at the NATO headquarters, at the European military headquarters and we had soldiers on operations abroad that were not UN blue-hatted operations.  Despite promising the contrary, under Fianna F&aacute;il the State signed up to NATO's Partnership for Peace, PfP.  We also signed up to the European Defence Agency, PESCO and Operation Sophia.  There is no non-military rescue ship in the Mediterranean Sea any more, because the EU demanded that they all leave.  Now, poor creatures drowning in the Mediterranean Sea are rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard, from whom they are trying to flee, and they are put back into the hellhole prisons from which they have tried to get away or paid to escape.</p> <p> Fortress Europe is being planned and facilitated by this arms race.  This is part of that.  Funds are being diverted away from the EU Structural Funds, including the European Social Fund, into grants for the arms industry.  In many cases the majority of funds for research in those countries come from the EU funds.  The European Commission is allocating &euro;590 million to the European Defence Fund for 2020.  It will increase to &euro;13 billion thereafter.  That is some diversion.  That is an arms race and arms industry.  It all fits into the militarisation agenda of the EU leaders and of the likes of Trump, the NATO leader who has demanded that European states spend an increasing amount on their military capacity.</p> <p> Would it not be better to spend this on developing the capabilities of the Army here at home?  It could develop the Defence Forces' morale, which is at rock bottom.  It could pay proper wages.  It could build up the Medical Corps again or the Engineering Corps, which had been decimated because of changes within the structures.  It could deal with the legacy of Lariam and the Air Corps legacy.  It could deal with the shortfall in the current capacity of the Army to send personnel abroad on operations or of ships to leave port to partake in maritime operations or of the air force to support the civil authorities when required.</p> <p> I put it to the Minister of State that this is another one of those disgraceful motions and I will oppose it.</p></speech>

Increasing the skill set of our military forces in the search and detection of improvised explosive devices is a much-needed skill.  We got a stark reminder of this need a few weeks ago in Derry when a car bomb was detonated within the city walls.  Most of us in this Chamber have memories long enough to a time when bombs and bomb threats were a part of our life.  What happened in Derry reminded us that a return to such times could happen if we lose sight of what is important and weaken our commitment to peace.  It is our job as politicians to strengthen peace, to build it, to nurture it and to protect it, not just on our island but throughout Europe and the world.  It is the job of our Defence Forces to be prepared to act to protect us if we fail.</p>  <p>  Across the water, the politicians are failing and the UK seems to be careering towards political insecurity.  What will that do for overall security in Ireland and Europe?  I believe that straw man arguments about a European super army are not relevant here.  The Labour Party is implacably against such a prospect but is not against training our Defence Forces to be as professional as possible and to ensure they can act to protect our safety.</p>  <p>  The threats that the world faces today are much different than the threats we faced in the past.  The level of military search capability directly impacts their ability to resolve those conflicts.  Our Defence Forces&rsquo; training needs to evolve as explosive weapon development also continues to progress.  If our forces are going to continue to do effective work while maintaining their own safety, they must be trained in modern techniques and skills.  Agreeing to this project is a good step towards modernising our Defence Forces without backing down from the country&rsquo;s agreement with the people to remain uninvolved in shows of military aggression or in compromising our neutrality.</p>  <p>  We cannot continue to be distracted by these false arguments.  It does the issue itself a disservice and it does a disservice to our Defence Forces.  The current Lisbon treaty in effect prevents the formation of an EU army and if motions to create one were seriously proposed, Ireland obviously steadfastly would oppose such a plan.</p>  <p>  With regard to this specific project, the Netherlands and Sweden - two countries that have already agreed to this project - have both made statements saying that they do not see the need for an EU army.  In this time of EU uncertainty, Ireland should be more focused on showing the current strength of the Union Ireland holds with the rest of Europe.  With the threat of a no-deal Brexit a mere 38 days away, any show of division threatens the stable future of the Continent.</p>  <p>  I believe we absolutely should be having this discussion today in order that Ireland can defend its decision to defy an EU army when the time comes, but this is not the time to do so.  Beyond displaying an act of solidarity with the EU during this tumultuous time of uncertainty, this training provides our Defence Forces with very important new skills.  The State's unwavering commitment to neutrality has not only left the Defence Forces underfunded, it could also put our forces in danger as they complete peacekeeping missions abroad.</p>  <p>  Maintaining a strong and effective peacekeeping force requires up-to-date training.  Not joining the project in order to send the EU a message would only put Irish lives at risk.  These Defence Forces act with the intention of one goal, which is protecting innocent civilians from violence and conflict.</p>  <p>  Expanding the Defence Forces engineer specialist search and clearance, ESSC, teams&rsquo; military search capabilities allow for the teams to protect these civilians to the best of their ability.  By no means should Ireland move away from its status as a neutral country but that neutrality must be viewed in a greater context.  Joining this project allows the Irish Defence Forces to work capably and safely with other peacekeeping groups where they have been mandated to participate in such missions by the UN.</p></speech>

We cannot dress this up any other way.  This motion provides more nails for the coffin of Irish neutrality.  The Minister of State spoke about the European Defence Agency in the Oireachtas Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence.  To paraphrase, the Minister of State referred to a force protection programme, a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection programme; enabled Defence Forces; counter improvised explosive device neutralisation manual projects; surveillance networks projects; security levels; cyberresilience; satellite communication aims for Defence Forces and international crisis management operations.  I put it to the Minister of State that this does not read as a peaceful organisation.  It undermines the whole basis of Irish neutrality, which is being eroded motion by motion as this goes on - as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has said.  The Minister of State's party and Government seem to be very happy to go along with the militarisation of the European Union.  It is measures such as this motion, PESCO and the EU status of forces agreement, SOFA, that are compromising Irish neutrality.</p><p>At a time when people seek more accountability and democracy, the European Union and the Government have given us more militarisation and conflict.  This Chamber should conscientiously reject the motion because, no matter what people say, it is the precursor to the European army the EU wants.  The supermarket of the European Union needs a European army.  We must conscientiously object.</p></speech>

They say that, right now, the project is so limited that we will, of course, be involved.  It misses the point about mission creep in the development of the European Defence Agency and the interlinking of the Defence Forces with other member state armed forces.  It misses what the EDA is all about in reality.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, stated that the purpose of the establishment of the EDA in 2004 was to support the member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in various fields.  More recently, we have had very explicit statements from European leaders.  In 2017, Jean-Claude Juncker said we needed a fully-fledged European defence union by 2025.  He said "We need it and NATO wants it".  Before Christmas, Angela Merkel proposed in the European Parliament a European security council in which important decisions could be prepared more quickly.  She said that while major steps had been taken in the field of military co-operation, there was a requirement to work on a vision to establish a real European army one day.  The European Defence Agency is an integral part of that.  It is the brainchild of the multi-billion euro European arms industry - the purveyors of death for massive profits.  That is what it is about.</p>  <p>  In the here and now, signing up to such a project is to commit to and participate in that European drive for militarisation.  One of the ways in which it is so is that in pooling and sharing resources, even on projects which appear relatively benign, the Irish State and Defence Forces take on responsibilities which free up other armies and their resources for things that are evidently less benign and more overtly imperialistic in nature.  I refer to the inter-relationship between the Defence Forces and EU forces.  The idea is to make the Irish Defence Forces so interlinked with European armies that it becomes impossible to say "No" when the day comes for the fully-fledged European army Angela Merkel would like to see.  We should have nothing to do with the project of European militarisation and nothing to do with the European Defence Agency.  Instead, we should join with all those across Europe who oppose this further drive to open militarisation.</p></speech>

I do not and cannot understand why we are taking this road and jeopardising our good name.  It is a good name that came from our neutrality and involvement in UN-mandated peacekeeping mission.  It also came from our development voice, which has been non-aligned, impartial and humanitarian-focused.  Why are we allowing ourselves to be drawn into this increasing securitisation and militarisation agenda of the EU?  Of course, it started with Shannon Airport through which 3 million troops and their military equipment passed and continues with the agenda of PESCO compatibility with NATO and the report, which was overwhelmingly agreed by the EU Parliament, recommending that the EU should be capable of launching autonomous military missions.</p>  <p>  The EU army will be a proxy of NATO of which Ireland is not a member.  The Taoiseach referred to his visit to Mali but the EU mission there is propping up France's colonial power in its former colony.  It is no coincidence that Mali has plentiful uranium deposits which France needs.  How are our development work and the respected voice we have in that regard compatible with being part of a European Defence Agency project?  The Taoiseach's reply referred to the need for a secure environment for that work to happen.  I agree that everyone should be able to live in a conflict-free environment.  The Taoiseach saw no conflict between involvement in peacekeeping on the one hand and international development on the other and that is fine.  There is no conflict between peacekeeping and development work.  However, being part of an EU army is not peacekeeping.  PESCO is about enhanced military collaboration and its rationale.</p>  <p>  Regarding the cost, we were told there is no extra spending.  However, we are also told that future spending in this area may change as capabilities are developed through PESCO projects.  NATO's goal is, of course, for member states to spend 2% of GDP on defence and that is where we are heading.  A discussion paper prepared by four MEPs from Fine Gael was entitled "Defending our Common European Home."  From whom are we defending it?  Who is invading us?  That paper was certainly about moving Ireland to weaken its policy of neutrality.  This is all being done without any real discussion here and certainly without discussion with the electorate.</p></speech>

While the motion may not in isolation appear to provide for ongoing militarisation, we must consider everything that is happening across Europe.  The motion is timely given the fact that the 55th Munich security conference was held on Friday, 15 February last.  More than 600 politicians, including three Heads of State and Government and more than 80 Ministers attended along with high-ranking military officials and representatives from business, science and international organisations.  They met this weekend in Bavaria's capital to discuss international security and defence policy in Europe.  Chillingly, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the EU Commission was quoted as saying to our "soft power" we are "finally adding ... hard power".  The Franco-German treaty signed last month represented what Angela Merkel described as a step towards the creation of a future European army.  The language of war is getting coarser and Europe is no longer attempting to disguise its intent.  It means we are at a terrifying impasse.  War is being normalised.  Angela Merkel said of the Franco-German pact that it solidified the common military culture of the two countries.  That military culture has been normalised by governments like that of Ireland, which participate in and legitimise military projects like PESCO using language of denial to mask the reality of the violence it is intended to inflict.  The Government has allowed our own terms of neutrality and peacekeeping to be exploited in its name.</p>  <p>  The proposal put forward today seeks further approval for Ireland to participate in military search capability building.  The Minister of State has confirmed that the Defence Forces have engaged extensively in specialised military search operations dealing with unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices and ensuring a so-called "safe and secure operating environment for military operations."  Whose are the military operations the safety of which they were ensuring?  Ireland can no longer bury its head in the sand.  We are already neck-deep in the common military culture as dictated by France and Germany.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have already signed Ireland up - the Labour Party is now part of it too I see - to become a pawn in a lucrative chess game; more so since the Brexit negotiations took place.  Ireland will continue to justify and contribute to the European Defence Agency in exchange for EU support through the Brexit negotiations.  Franco-German military interests want to develop their defence industries further to control EU defence policy while globally competing with US and Russian defence companies.  Global security will, in turn, secure Franco-German influence at home in Europe.  Let us not forget how this undermines democracy.  Militarisation, EU defence integration and the overall global militarisation agenda is being pushed and shaped by private sector interests.  Ireland can be sure that it will pay for the privilege financially and politically for some time to come.</p></speech>

Clearly, we want to protect our troops and ensure they have the best training, advice and skills in respect of those critical military capabilities.  The Green Party supports our troops strongly and wants them to have those resources and capabilities.  However, we cannot ignore the wider question about the future of Europe.  The proposal before us to avail of the European Defence Agency as the vehicle to develop those skills raises real concerns.</p><p>We do not believe the future of the European Union is in stronger military integration, as some other national leaders and governments are presenting it.  We do not believe the European people are clamouring for a European army or that it would serve the interests of the people in addressing the challenges we face.  Yes, we should and must maintain the skills of our military personnel and do what we can to ensure that, but we must also be careful not to sacrifice the real strength of our country in terms of military intervention, which comes from our neutrality and peacekeeping experience and expertise.  That is needed as well as having the ability to cope with unexploded ordnance or knowing how to clear a route of improvised explosive devices.</p> <p> That is a concern we have raised on every occasion in the development of PESCO and in wider debates about the European Defence Agency.  I repeat it today even on a subject where nobody would disagree we must have skills.  We cannot ignore the wider strategic developments that are taking place.  The forthcoming European election will be a critical election for the future of Europe.  My Green Party colleagues in Europe, like our position at home, will be seeking to have strong Green Party representation from all countries in Europe.  All of them are standing on the position that the defence agency project, the armaments projects and the big European army projects that certain parties and countries are leading are not the way forward.  I am proud to stand in that tradition.  I recognise the need to give our troops skills, but the constant use of the European Defence Agency as a mechanism to do that raises wider concerns that we cannot ignore.</p></speech>

I will continue to express concerns about the direction in which we seem to be getting pushed.  I did not sign up to a European army.  I did not sign up to the European Union joining with other states eventually to have a European army.  We have our Defence Forces, of which all of us are very proud.  I am proud that I am a former Minister for Defence.  I saw at first hand the great work our people have done in peacekeeping.  I emphasise that it was peacekeeping.  I do not want to join the big boys and be part of a European army that gets involved in all sorts of crisis management and many other things that are doubtful.  I want our Defence Forces to be fully equipped and available to serve in peacekeeping missions.</p>  <p>  I rejected the Deputy from Fianna F&aacute;il having his usual smart go at me because I happen to be a member of Fine Gael.

I do not know if he wrote the speech but he read it very well.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear on what we are doing here.  This is a creepy-crawly, step-by-step situation where we want to be among the big boys.  The work the Army does as peacekeepers, and has done over the years, has been respected.  When I went abroad as a Minister I saw the respect in which our troops were held.  They integrated into the local community and became part of it.  They were not outside as army people but part of the community.  I do not understand why we want to join the big boys.  Our Army can do far more by staying on the road it is on and in which it has been very successful.  When we joined the European Union we did not join a European army or obligations in that area.  It is very easy to be sucked in because one wishes to be among the big boys.  We must stand up and say we are in favour of peacekeepers and that we are proud of the peacekeeping work the Irish Defence Forces have done over the years in various parts of the world.</p>  <p>  People who get the opportunity should go and see how they operate.  They do not arrive with modern equipment and armed to the teeth.  They arrive with groups of people who have been trained on how to integrate into the local community, to become trusted by that community and to bring about a peaceful solution.  I have no wish to see Ireland as part of a European army.  I did not sign up to that.  I reckon I am a good European but being a good European does not necessarily mean one must be part of a European army.  There are enough people available in the world to create trouble.  There are very few, and the number is decreasing, who sign up to try and bring peace.  I am of the latter brigade.  I want the Irish Defence Forces to engage in genuine peacekeeping.</p>  <p>  I find this very difficult to understand.  It is clearly stated that the European Defence Agency is a defence agency to support the member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities.  It is about European defence capabilities.  Rather than being pushed into something, I would prefer a proper and wide debate on where we are going, where our Defence Forces are expected to go and what we are going to do about participating in various missions.</p></speech>

The primary function of training and educating members of the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain capabilities necessary to enable the personnel to fulfil the roles laid down by the Government.  Deputies have highlighted the importance of supporting the Defence Forces in capability development, and it is my responsibility to ensure they are afforded the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice among defence forces.  The debate this evening surprised me.  Members have high regard for members of the Defence Forces, and nobody questions anybody's high regard for Defence Forces personnel, but when they say they should not participate in this project they are really saying to send our personnel overseas but not to give them the proper training.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brendan Ryan of the Labour Party said something very important, which is that the modern techniques and skills required of the Defence Forces and military personnel today are totally different from those required many years ago and the threat we face today is very different from the threat we faced years ago.  I commend the Deputy on what he said in the debate.  As I said earlier, the Defence Forces specialist search and clearance teams are regularly deployed at home in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and overseas in UNIFIL and UNDOF where they predominantly conduct route searches and area clearances in advance of vehicle or foot patrols.</p><p>These projects in which we are participating are linked to the work that our Defence Forces do day in, day out on peacekeeping missions overseas.  This project, for example, will develop an advanced capability that has the potential to protect our personnel on overseas missions.  This is the type of training and day-to-day stuff in which the Defence Forces engage during peacekeeping operations.</p> <p> As stated in the Government's White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, Ireland will continue to identify opportunities to participate in multinational capability deployment projects within the framework of the European Defence Agency and in support of the Defence Forces' operation capacity and capability.  I have detailed how the European Defence Agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development, obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research technology and procurement of defence capabilities.</p> <p> Day in, day out, whether in this House, in committee or in a general debate about defence matters, I am accused of leading the way to a European army.  To all the Deputies who have questioned my stance on this I say I do not believe there will ever be a European army.  I am not changing our defence policy on neutrality.  If that policy ever is changed, whoever will be standing in this position, it will not be me.  It will be the Members and the general public who will have the final say on a European army.  If Deputies read the provisions within the Lisbon treaty, they would see that they clearly set out this policy.  I ask Members to read those provisions.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said this person, that person and the other person were talking about a European army.  I have known the Deputy for a long number of years.  He does not always believe what I say, so he should not believe what everyone else says either.  I ask him to take that on board.</p> <p> I could go on for the next 20 minutes.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to bring the Bill before the House.  The Bill is short and technical but very important.  It completes a series of amendments to the Companies Act 2014 that will enable simplified procedures for all companies meeting their annual filing obligations.  The Bill has been through the Seanad.</p>  <p>  Companies can have a maximum of nine months after the financial year end to prepare an annual return and the associated financial information.  There is currently a two-step procedure for a company in filing an annual return with the Companies Registration Office.  First, the company must file the annual return 28 days after its filing deadline, and second, a further 28 days are allowed to complete its filing by uploading its financial statements and submitting a completed signature page.</p>  <p>  The Bill will amend section 343(2) and 343(3) of the 2014 Act to amalgamate the two-step process into a one-step 56-day period to complete the process.  In this way companies will have more time to file their annual returns.  There will also be fewer procedures in filing, delivering a more efficient system that makes it even easier for companies to meet their filing deadlines.  Public filing by companies is an essential protection for other companies, suppliers and employees that rely on this meaningful financial information as being as up to date as possible.  We must make the filing of annual returns and financial statements as straightforward as possible for companies.  The law already allows companies up to 11 months to prepare and file financial statements.  In 2017 we legislated to simplify and reduce the content of those financial statements for small and micro-sized companies.  This year the Companies Registration Office is upgrading its IT system to make it even easier for all companies to file on time by moving to a process that can be done in a single step and entirely online.  The amendment contained in this Bill is the last piece of the legislative framework to support this simplified process.  The early enactment of the Bill will allow time for the CRO to make companies aware of the new procedures in advance of the IT upgrade.</p>  <p>  This is a modern and practical measure that represents good common sense.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.630" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900042#PP00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this important legislation to the House.  We live in a changing society that has a more diverse range of family formations than in the relatively recent past.  It is important that we reflect this in our laws and how we recognise family units.  I fully intend for civil registration legislation to keep pace with the evolving nature of our society and how this diversity is provided for in legislation generally.  In that way, we can assure we will treat all citizens equally.  In that vein, the Bill will update and improve civil registration legislation and, in particular, address certain issues that have had a serious impact on the lives of a small number of citizens.  The civil registration system works well for the vast majority, but for some, that is not the case.  I hope that, as a House, we can rectify this.  The provisions included in the Bill were either contained in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 or drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and approved by the Government as Committee Stage amendments to that Bill.  Although I am mindful that the current legislative programme is increasingly focused on Brexit, I hope that in introducing already drafted provisions the amendments can be progressed quickly with minimal impact on drafting resources.  </p>  <p>  I have received a number of inquires on the issue from Members of the Oireachtas and appreciate concerns about the negative effect the current law has on same-sex female couples.  I have met and spoken to many of the women affected and want to see these concerns resolved as quickly as possible, which is why I wish to see these important, largely technical legislative provisions progressed as a matter of priority.  Prioritising the Bill involves making technical amendments to existing legislation that will make possible the registration of births of donor conceived children of same-sex female couples to include particulars of both partners as parents in the register of births.  This will allow both partners to have their particulars displayed on birth certificates and affirm their parental rights in matters such as access to passports and school enrolment.  Bringing the provisions into operation also depends on the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  As Deputies will be aware, this is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who is working to ensure the commencement will occur as early as possible following the passing of the legislation.  These are complex issues that require the involvement of more than just one Department, but officials from my Department are working with the General Register Office, GRO; the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure the appropriate legislative, regulatory and operational mechanisms will be in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registrations of donor conceived children.  </p>  <p>  Another key provision in the Bill that I would like to see enacted quickly is to bring civil registration legislation into line with current legislation governing presumption of paternity.  It will make it less onerous for a woman to rebut the automatic presumption of paternity of her estranged husband in the birth registration process.  In particular, I want to avoid the need for contact with a woman&rsquo;s husband where the separation may have been acrimonious or even involved incidents of domestic violence.  There are other provisions in the Bill about which I intend to speak as I address the individual sections of the Bill.  </p>  <p>  Section 1 outlines the definitions of certain terms used in the Act. </p>  <p>  Section 2 amends the definition of the "Act of 2015" in section 2 of the Act of 2004 which will facilitate the commencement of legislation that will provide for the registration and re-registration of births of donor conceived children. </p>  <p>  Section 3 makes technical amendments to section 19A of the Act of 2004 which will facilitate the commencement of legislation that will provide for the registration of births of donor conceived children. </p>  <p>  Section 4 brings civil registration legislation into line with current legislation governing presumption of paternity and makes it less onerous for a mother to rebut the automatic presumption of the paternity of her husband in the birth registration process.</p>  <p>  Section 5 makes technical amendments to section 23B of the Act of 2004 which will facilitate the commencement of legislation that will provide for the re-registration of births of donor conceived children. </p>  <p>  Section 6 provides for the inclusion of a family member as a qualified informant in the registration of a death where a coroner is involved.  This will allow the family of the deceased to have a greater role in the registration process and should result in the registration of a more complete set of particulars in certain cases. </p>  <p>  Section 7 provides for the inclusion of the forename and birth surname of a parent where a person born following donor assisted human reproduction dies abroad and it is sought to have the death recorded in the record of deaths abroad when it is operationalised.  This follows as a consequence of the addition of details of a parent to the required particulars for the registration of a birth. </p>  <p>  Section 8 provides that records of births, deaths and marriages may be shared by the GRO with a body under the aegis of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht such as the National Library of Ireland.  Bringing these provisions into operation will require extensive consultation between my officials and their colleagues in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  </p>  <p>  Section 9 provides for the application of fees payable to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in respect of any performance by that Minister of functions carried out under the provisions amended by section 8 of the Bill.  This is a standard provision in most legislation. </p>  <p>  Section 10 provides for the inclusion of details of a parent in the required particulars to register a birth or stillbirth.  This will facilitate both partners in a same-sex female relationship to have their particulars registered in the register of births.  Registration of particulars of &ldquo;mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;father&rdquo; will continue to be available, but either parent may choose to be registered as a &ldquo;parent&rdquo;, if he or she so wishes.  The section also provides that the country of birth and the country of citizenship of a deceased person are to be added to the particulars of a death to be entered in the register of deaths.  This provision, as well as providing a richer source of data in the records of deaths held by the GRO, responds to the State&rsquo;s obligations under the relevant EU regulation governing the provision of statistical data for EUROSTAT by the Central Statistics Office.</p><p> Section 11 provides for a technical change to ensure certain amendments in section 6(1) of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 may apply to the registration of births where the birth occurs before the date of commencement of the section and is registered after that date.  </p> <p> Section 12 provides for the Short Title, construction, collective citation and commencement of the Bill.  </p> <p> The amendments are mainly technical in nature, but they will have a profoundly positive impact on the citizens who are affected by them.  They are specific, targeted measures that have already been drafted and I intend to fast-track them in a stand-alone vehicle.  I am aware that there are other areas of civil registration that need to be addressed and other issues broadly related to provisions contained in the Bill, but they can I hope be dealt with separately at an early future date.  I want to progress the measures contained in the Bill with the co-operation of both Houses as quickly as possible.  I look forward to hearing Deputies' views and working with all Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann to progress this legislation as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The Bill marks welcome progress in finally commencing key parts of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, four years after it was passed.  I wish to comment on the delays in its commencement.  </p><p>The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 represented the first time the State recognised the diversity of families, including same-sex parent led families, and was pivotal in winning the referendum on civil marriage equality.  It was a referendum in which there were plenty of hurtful conversations about the ability of same-sex couples to raise families.  Thankfully, all parties strongly endorsed the notion that family formations were varied and should all be embraced and protected by the State.  Four years on from when the legislation was passed by these Houses, Parts 2, 3 and 9 have yet to be commenced.  In effect, our laws do not protect these families.  Families have started and the children have grown without the legal protections that they should be afforded.  This means in reality that under the current law, the non-birth mothers have no legal relationship to their child.  They cannot give consent for emergency medical treatment, extend their citizenship for passports, access parental benefits, do not have automatic succession rights to their children and cannot fight for custody as legally recognised parents if their marriage breaks down.  The birth mother has to sign a legal affidavit proclaiming herself to be the sole parent if she wishes the child to be recognised at all, which is an insult and an unnecessary stigmatisation process.  As Part 9, with which the Bill deals, has not been dealt with in the four years since its enactment, there have been some very harsh situations related to the lack of parental rights.  Many more families speak regularly to Sinn F&eacute;in representatives about the feelings they have about their families not yet being legally recognised.  One such mother said:</p><blockquote>[A]s the non-biological mother, one of the biggest emotions I feel right now is anxiety.  It is taking over what should be some of the happiest days of our lives.  This anxiety comes from knowing that despite being a mom to my baby, my name won&rsquo;t go on the birth certificate, and that I will have no legal rights to my own child, solely due to the fact that it is my wife who is the birth mother and not me.  Anxiety from being made a second class citizen, fighting to have our rights as parents recognised.  Anxiety (and a bit of humiliation) from having to email my employer&rsquo;s HR department and ask them to please ensure my parental benefits will be intact, even though legally I won&rsquo;t be a parent at all, despite being a mom.  Anxiety that comes lying awake at night from wondering what will happen to our child if something were to happen to my wife.</blockquote><p>When this issue was last debated in the House, when the Minister brought the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the House to fix typographical errors in the principal Act, he stated Parts 2 and 3 which were to be commenced in tandem with Part 9 would be commenced by October 2018.  He has failed to deliver on this commitment.  It was the sixth time his Department had failed to meet its own deadlines in commencing Parts 2 and 3.  The lack of Government priority given to the issue is shocking and reflects very poorly on the Departments involved.  In June 2018 the Minister's Department was quoted in an article in <i>Gay Community News</i>as stating there was no legislative barrier to commencing Part 9, that it was down to scheduling the training of HSE registrars.  That was over three years on from the enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Bill and the typos we are discussing tonight still had not been identified.  It is becoming increasingly clear that the Departments involved simply have not prioritised the commencement orders highly.</p><p>The commencement orders were due to be made one year after passing the legislation.  It is now just under four years since both Houses endorsed the legislation.  Families have spent those four years aghast at the Government consistently letting them down and missing deadlines.  They have written to our representatives about the upset they feel when the Minister's Department circulates press releases that do not state this is a typographical Bill that still requires the commencement of Part 9 and that the Children and Family Relationships Act only applies to some same-sex parents, with no reference to the upset or frustration the Department has caused owing to the delays.  It was largely seen as Government spin in trying to gain good public relations from being inattentive in its duties and it insulted many who await recognition.</p><p>Will the Government give us any indication as to when the families will, at long last, be recognised before the law and when Parts 2, 3 and 9 will finally be commenced?  We should consider that every time either the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Department of Health has given commitments or deadlines to the parents affected, they have been let down repeatedly.  Members have received these deadlines via the replies to parliamentary questions and relayed them to the parents in good faith, but they have been let down.  This is the time for an honest appraisal of where we are in the commencement of Parts 2, 3 and 9.  It is not for us but for the parents who have been waiting for four years or who are expecting children and are concerned that the legislation will not be in place prior to the birth of their child.  Will the Minister address this issue?  I understand a number of parents are watching online.  Some of our party staff were told yesterday in the Department's briefing that the most recent delay was on Department of Health's side.  The latest delays are not on public record.  It is something of which the parents affected should be aware.  We will support the Bill, but our patience has grown very thin with the Government's inaction on the issue.</p></speech>

I understand the inconsistencies and oversights which this legislation seeks to correct.  I also understand the other issues that it seeks to address.  I will speak about the technical changes and the impact they will have for same-sex couples.  </p>  <p>  While I welcome the legislation, it is important that we be cognisant of the difficulties the State has caused for same-sex couples because of the slow pace at which the legislation has been progressed.  Given that the Bill will address typographical errors made in the Civil Registration Act 2004, as amended by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, I seek the Minister&rsquo;s guidance on when it is envisaged that Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act will be commenced.  Same-sex couples have been waiting for years for all Parts of the Children and Family Relationships Act to be commenced in order that they can register as the legal parents of their children.  Currently, only the birth mother can register after she signs an affidavit stating she is the sole parent.  The non-birth mother has no legal relationship to her child.</p><p>This is a ridiculous state of affairs when a child has two mothers, two parents, but only one can register as his or her parent.  It is not fair on those kids or parents.  Its outworking means that beyond the non-birth mother not being able to register as the child's mother, she can face difficulties in giving consent for emergency medical treatment for her child, having custody rights to her child, should the relationship breakdown, applying for a passport for her child under her citizenship and having succession rights to her child if the birth mother dies without a will.  This is really unfair.</p> <p> I have met parents affected by the outworking of these anomalies and the implications of the failure to commence Parts 2, 3, and 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 for them and, more importantly, their families.  Had this matter been prioritised by previous Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection we would not be here today; it could and should have been sorted before now.  The State has a long history of leaving members of the LGBTI community behind.  We have tried to move past it, but the failure to fully commence legislation to help same-sex couples leaves them behind again.  I know that is not the premeditated intention, but it is the outworking of a failure to prioritise the legislation.  The Government originally stated Parts 2, 3 and 9 would be commenced 12 months after enactment, but that did not happen.  Following this, the Minister for Health gave deadlines to commence Parts 2 and 3.  Not only did that not happen but the deadline was missed five times.  In July 2018 the Minister for Health brought the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the Oireachtas to clear up typographical errors in Parts 2 and 3.  He stated his intention was to commence them in October 2018.  That did not happen and no further deadline has been set.  Why has the Government taken four years to commence these key parts of the legislation?  If it is not negligence, what is it?  Furthermore, why did the Department only realise in the past eight months that it needed to fix typographical errors?  Why was it not realised in the intervening 38 months?  While I welcome the legislation, same-sex couples need full information and committed timelines in order that they can be certain that their rights will be delivered on and when they will cease from being forced to live in a worrying grey area owing to Government inaction.  I hope the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection will be able to give some of these commitments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900044#RR00200"><p>We will certainly not be opposing the Bill.  We welcome it, but if anything should come from this debate, it is knowing when we will have a commencement date.  Will the Minister give us a reasonable indication as to when there will be a commencement date for Parts 2, 3 and 9?  This has been promised on various occasions in the past three or four years, meanwhile the people who are depending on those Parts being passed continue to exist in a legal limbo.  Frankly, that is very unfair.  Will the Minister, when she is closing this debate, indicate a realistic timeline for bringing these very necessary provisions which merely reflect social change in the country into operation?  That is the least the people concerned are entitled to expect.</p>  <p>  Irish society has changed enormously and the law has to reflect those changes, but law written in the Statute Book is no good unless it is in operation.  I was reading the Bill this morning.  It is extremely complex because it involves amending the parent legislation, the two Acts of 2014.  The Bill consists of a series of amendments to sections that have been amended at least once, in some cases more than once, not only by one Act but by a health Act and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  It is difficult to read.  I have always believed legislation should be reasonably comprehensible to the man on the street, non lawyers.  This is a textbook example of how not to write legislation if we have that objective which is a worthwhile one.  There was a plain English campaign in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago.  We will have to revive it here.  I realise the technical complexities, but will the Minister consolidate the legislation as quickly as possible and publish a comprehensive guide to give people some idea before they engage the services of a solicitor which in most cases they will have to do of what they are talking about?</p>  <p>  I welcome the provisions for donor assisted births and the right to register both parents.  It is welcome that the names of same-sex parents will both appear on the birth register under the heading of parent.  I would like and everybody deserves to see this provision being brought into operation as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  The legislation also contains a provision to rebut the presumption of automatic paternity if a couple have been married.  It is more of a Committee Stage point and I will engage with the Minister on it then as I am not quite sure it achieves the objective it sets out to achieve.  I would like the Minister to indicate precisely how it achieves that objective, in case I am reading it wrong or we are wasting time.  </p>  <p>  The provisions in respect of death certificates are also dealt with.  I welcome the idea of having to include the country of birth or citizenship.  They are necessary addenda to a death certificate.  However, I seriously question the Minister's claim that she is involving the family more in cases where coroners are involved.  As I recall from reading the legislation this morning, all it seems to do is put an obligation on the coroner to contact the "qualified informant" as defined in section 37 of the 2004 Act to include a relative or anybody who knows anything about the death, including somebody who happened to be in the same building when the death took place or somebody who had charge of the body afterwards.  As I understand the current position, if a coroner is making inquiries, he or she will contact all of these people.  What substantial change is being brought about by the section? </p>  <p>  We have come a reasonable distance, but we have a lot further to go.  We look forward to future progressive changes in that regard.  The least the LGBT organisations which have been in touch with me and which represent people who have been forced to live in a legal fog for several years in awaiting these necessary changes which they have been promised repeatedly can now expect is a definitive deadline from the Government for implementation of these very necessary changes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.636" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900044#RR00300"><p>This is a very important Bill.  The Labour Party is unambiguously and unequivocally in support of early implementation of this legislation.  We are all aware of the objectives of the Civil Registration Bill 2019 which is bringing forward several amendments which are extremely technical.  I concur with Deputy O'Dea that it is extremely difficult for an ordinary individual who has no lawyerly inclination to interpret or comprehend the legislation.  I spent a few hours trying to read it today and was baffled by some of it.  It amends the Civil Registration Act 2004.  I recall spending a considerable length of time in the bunker debating it and will never forget it because it was an intrinsically complex Bill and we were hardly out of the bunker when it had to be amended again.  It is no surprise, in the context of further advances in law and science, that it requires further amendment in line with our evolution as a society, the diversity of family formations, types of relationship and everything else.  </p>  <p>  In brief, the Bill makes several amendments to the civil registration process in the registration of donor assisted births and in respect of the presumption of paternity in the registration of births.  It expands the role of next of kin in registering a death in cases where the coroner is involved.</p><p>I concur with Deputy O'Dea.  The Bill does not seem to be as expansive as it sounds.  It permits the sharing of the General Register Office's historical data and records with the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland under the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and facilitates collection of additional details of deceased persons in order that the CSO can comply with EU obligations pertaining to EUROSTAT which furnishes statistics and so on.<br/><br/>While the Bill is relatively short, it is significant in its impact and import and of huge importance to the families affected.  Like everybody else, my Labour Party colleagues and I have been contacted by a significant number of people.  We were in the vanguard in promoting this legislation during the years.  The Bill corrects an error.  Two Acts passed in 2015, the Gender Recognition Act and the Children and Family Relationships Act, both made amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004 by inserting additional definitions into section 2 of that Act.  The Children and Family Relationships Act inserted the following definitions:</p><blockquote>&lsquo;Act of 2015&rsquo; means the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015;<br /><br />&lsquo;donor-conceived child&rsquo; has the same meaning as it has in Part 2 of the Act of 2015;<br /><br />&lsquo;parent&rsquo;, in relation to a donor-conceived child, means the parent or parents of that child under section 5 of the Act of 2015.</blockquote><p>The Gender Recognition Act inserted the following:</p><blockquote>&lsquo;Act of 2015&rsquo; means the Gender Recognition Act 2015;<br /><br />&lsquo;gender recognition certificate&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2015.</blockquote><p>The amendments were at cross purposes.  That was part of the reason for the delay, as was the ambivalence in trying to bring legislation through.  We ended up with two Acts of 2015 being referred to and because of the impossibility of interpreting the legislation properly, the relevant parts of the Children and Family Relationships Act could not be commenced.  The change provided for in this Bill facilitates the commencement of legislation that will provide for the registration of births of donor conceived children, but it has been awaited a long time.  A massive error was made.  The Bill amends the reference in section 2 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 to the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 as the &quot;Act of 2015&quot; and instead refers to that Act by its full name, which gets rid of the problem.  <br/><br/>The technical amendment facilitates commencement of existing legislation to allow both partners in either a male-female or same-sex female relationship who have been through a donor assisted birth process to have their details shown on birth certificates.  The result will be that the gestational mother will be listed as &quot;mother&quot; on a child's birth certificate, while a second female parent will be registered as a parent.  It should be noted that while the 2015 Act provides for either a man or a woman to be the second parent of a donor conceived child, there must be a birth mother.  The Act, therefore, does not apply where two men seek to be registered as the parents of a child, of which one is the birth father.  Same-sex male relationships are still excluded since, under the 2015 Act, in every case of donor assisted reproduction the birth mother is always the parent of the child.  A male couple may well have to go down the adoption route to deal with this issue.<br/><br/>The evidential value of birth certificates is a hobby horse of mine.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not mind me going off on the issue.  It may be worth noting that all of the amendments to the law are based on the notion of the birth certificate actually proving the relationships to which it relates.  As a matter of strict law, they are, in fact, of no evidential value in proving age, identity or parentage.  Most of us rely instead on the presumption that the husband who was living with his wife for the ten months before she gave birth is the father of the child or, if necessary, on DNA tests in order to establish paternity.  In criminal law, however, the rules of evidence have been changed to make a birth certificate admissible in evidence.  Section 5(5) of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 provides:</p><blockquote>where a document purports to be a birth certificate issued [pursuant to law] and (b) a person is named therein as father or mother of the person to whose birth the certificate relates,the document shall be admissible in any criminal proceedings as evidence of the relationship indicated therein.</blockquote><p>We should take the opportunity to reform civil law along the same lines and make sure birth certificates are admissible in civil proceedings.<br/><br/>The Bill seeks to amend existing legislation to allow a mother to more easily rebut the presumption of paternity of her estranged husband in registering a birth by filing a statutory declaration.  This is certainly a welcome amendment, particularly in cases in which there have been difficult relationships, total estrangement, or even violence.  It makes it less onerous for the mother to rebut the presumption in respect of the child being registered, which will now be automatic in nature.<br/><br/>The Bill seeks to provide a role for the next of kin in registering a death in cases involving a coroner.  According to the explanatory memorandum which was the only way in which I could figure it out, the relevant section &quot;provides for the inclusion of a family member as a qualified informant in the registration of a death where a coroner is involved.  This will allow the family of the deceased to have a greater role in the registration process which, in some cases, may result in registration of a more complete set of particulars&quot;.  That is useful.<br/><br/>All in all, the Labour Party unequivocally welcomes this legislation and supports its quick passage.  The people affected wanted it to be passed yesterday.  There should be no more unnecessary delays.  Like my colleagues, I received a call yesterday from two people about the Bill.  Its text is fine from the perspective of most people in recognising same-sex parents in official documentation, but everybody has concerns about timing.  How quickly can the legislation be enacted and implemented?  This is an issue that has affected same-sex parents for a number of years.  The Minister can understand that the people affected are anxious to see the amendments being implemented.  A number of organisations that have been in contact with me and my Labour Party colleagues have asked whether the Minister could give an indicative date for when the legislation will complete all Stages in the Oireachtas and be enacted.  Will there be a gap between enactment and commencement?  That is critical because it is the lack of commencement that will kill the whole thing.  We might work very well and the Minister is working well to get the legislation through and I am sure she will be facilitated in the Seanad, but we need an indicative date for when the legislation will actually take effect.  <br/><br/>I know that some of the provisions depend on the commencement of specific parts of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, including perhaps Parts 2, 3, and 9 which have been referred to extensively by my colleagues.  Since responsibility for the commencement of these Parts lies with the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, I hope there will be no procrastination or undue delay on his part or under his stewardship or supervision.  It is important that the Minister give us unambiguous and unqualified replies on the question of when the Bill will be commenced.</p></speech>

We want to fix this anomaly in order that we can aid the families about whom we are talking and about whom Deputy Penrose spoke eloquently.</p>  <p>  Deputy John Brady is right in saying the birth mother is the sole legal parent and guardian.  That is exactly what we are trying to fix in order that the other mother or parent will have as many legal rights and responsibilities in respect of their child as the birth mother.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire talked about the commencement of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, while others talked about the commencement of Parts 2 and 3.  There will be no delay.  I know that probably sounds empty as we have been talking about this legislation or delaying it for four years.  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act have been passed.  They just need to be commenced.  In order to do so a small amount of administrative work needs to be done in the Department of Health and the HSE.  The Minister for Health is working on the matter.  We are establishing the national donor conceived persons register.  It is being worked on.  A small amount of work needs to be done in the context of the GDPR.  It is also being worked on.  </p>  <p>  If I were to provide an exact date tonight, I would be making it up.  As it also sounds a little empty to say I will provide it as soon as possible, I will endeavour to come back on Committee Stage or before the Bill reaches the Seanad to at least given an exact month for commencement of the legislation.  There will, however, be no more delays in that regard.  I personally made that commitment to some of the mammies I met at the demonstration outside which had been organised by the Labour Party.  They are rightly fed up and have been waiting for far too long.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dea said he was not sure how it would be made less onerous for a woman not to register her husband or estranged husband as a parent.  It will be as simple as making a self-declaration.  At present one has to complete a statutory declaration and seek a commencement order from the court.  There will be no more of that bull.  A lady will be able to self-declare the exact situation and particulars.  Anything that was onerous in the past will be removed.  The Deputy also mentioned changes in respect of the coroner.  The changes are being made in practice, even though there is no legislative basis in the majority of cases.  The new provisions will give more weight to the family member in providing particulars in the case of a death abroad.</p>  <p>  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his forbearance.  The amendments included in the Bill are mainly technical, but they will have a massive and real emotional impact on the people affected.  I am looking forward to working with Members on Committee and Report Stages to have this legislation passed as soon as we can.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900046#TT00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am sharing time with Deputies Cassells, Fleming, Thomas Byrne and O'Loughlin.  It gives me great pleasure to move Second Stage of the Management Fees (Local Property Tax) Relief Bill 2018.  I am looking for support for the Bill from across the House.  It was first published during the last D&aacute;il and was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Fleming.  It endeavours to bring about some fairness to the local property tax, LPT, regime.</p>  <p>  All of us in our different parties have different views on the local property tax.  However, there is a large cohort of about 500,000 people who are living in multi-unit developments, managed estates, apartments, duplexes and the like.  They are paying management fees as well as full local property tax.  This Fianna F&aacute;il Bill endeavours to bring about a small recognition of this and to give a reduction in the local property tax for owner-occupiers only, principal private residents who are fully paid up in their management fees.  This reduction would be to a maximum of &euro;300 or one third of the LPT.  The average reduction based on our research would be in the region of &euro;86 per annum.  While this is not significant, it does provide an acknowledgement for those living in managed estates who are paying full local property tax and management fees.</p>  <p>  I would remind colleagues that in many instances, management fees equate to an additional month's mortgage.  There are elements within these fees that are unique to a particular apartment block or managed estate, such as block insurance, common areas and so on.  However, other elements such as maintenance of roads, paths and open spaces, public lighting, wastewater treatment and water treatment are paid for through the local property tax.  In some instances, some of the services are effectively being paid for on the double.  We believe this is a fair approach.  It also opens up a wider discussion about the 500,000 people who are in multi-unit developments with owner management companies.  My colleagues from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Jan O'Sullivan, are in the Chamber.  That committee has raised on a regular basis the ticking time bomb that is owner management companies and the lack of financial sustainability of many of them, particularly in the areas of defective estates and latent defects.</p>  <p>  The effect of the Bill is twofold.  It acknowledges that for some services, people are paying on the double, which is not fair.  It would also act as a small incentive for ensuring that management fees are paid up to date.  I have consulted widely on this legislation over the last years and it has been broadly welcomed.  I think it is very doable.  Fianna F&aacute;il included it in its submission to the review of the local property tax.  The report from that review of the LPT has been outstanding for a long time now.  I understand it has been with the Minister for Finance since last summer, or since September at the latest.  Our party made a detailed submission, as I am sure did others, to look at areas within the local property tax that need to be changed to make it fairer.  This Bill is one element of that, while another is ensuring that there is a lower rate of interest charged on deferrals.  Another element concerns income thresholds.  When is that review going to be published?  We need to ensure that it comes out very soon as it needs to be debated here, to ensure that people's local property taxes are not doubled next year.  That is effectively what will happen.  I keep reminding Government that we are against the clock.  I do not understand the inordinate delay.</p>  <p>  It is timely that we are debating Second Stage of this Bill this evening.  It is part of a suite of measures that we would bring forward for people living in apartments and managed estates, recognising that they are paying on the double in some instances.  That is one of the changes we want.  I seek support from all Opposition parties and from Government to let this Bill go to Committee Stage at the very least.  I firmly believe that it makes sense and would bring some fairness into the situation.  We also have to consider what statutory provision there should be for management companies to provide sinking funds.</p>  <p>  Another area in which we can provide assistance would be an ombudsman for the sector.  There are a lot of lay directors out there of about 5,000 to 7,000 owner management companies.   Of the 500,000 people I mentioned earlier, most are in other professions and do not have legal backgrounds to deal with complex company law with regard to the operation of management companies.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes they should be given support and that there should be a section within the Property Services Regulatory Authority to provide assistance to them.  That is another Bill that we have published.  This is one of three Fianna F&aacute;il Bills in this area aiming to recognise the issues and assist people who are living in multi-unit developments.  I ask colleagues to look in detail at this legislation and seek their support in allowing it to go to Committee Stage.  It is a modest reduction but it is an important acknowledgement that in many of these estates people are paying on the double for services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.645" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900046#TT00300"><p>I welcome the proposals in this Bill.  My colleague has made a very valid case for the modest reductions that are being sought.  There is an inherent unfairness for citizens who are living in apartments or multi-unit developments and are subject to management company fees which, in effect, form a kind of double taxation when they are hit by the local property tax as well.  The reality is that these people pay their local property tax, which is collected by Revenue and goes to the local authority, while they are also hit with a substantial management company fee.  The fact that there are different collectors at the door is of little consequence to them.  They do not care which fund it is going into, whether it is going into the public purse or the private one.  All they know when Zacchaeus comes to the door is that their purse is going to be a lot lighter when he is gone.</p>  <p>  There definitely needs to be a more progressive way.  We need to look at how people are being charged for services and should ensure that they are not charged on the double.  There should be some provision, as outlined by Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ease the burden that is placed on them, especially when we see the type of developments that are being constructed.  Such developments have changed massively over the last 20 years, predominantly in our cities in terms of the number of apartments being built in Dublin, as stated by my colleague.  However, these patterns are also changing in our towns.  As a result, management companies are more prevalent in our towns, especially in commuter counties.  I see it in my own county of Meath, in towns like Navan and Trim in my constituency and Ashbourne in Deputy Thomas Byrne's constituency, where development is under way again, that the mixed type of development is predominant, with duplex and apartment developments sitting side by side with estate development.  That is what has been demanded of developers by planners, because of the densities that councils are seeking in these commuter counties.  In Clonee in County Meath, just a few miles down the road, two out of every three households live in apartments.</p>  <p>  On the subject of management companies and the value that people get, in many cases the fee they pay results in a great deal for them in their estates.  They can see the net benefit in their area as the fee goes towards upkeep and maintenance.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, talks to people who live in estates where there are no management company fees.  Residents' associations go around collecting subscriptions so that they can conduct the grass cutting in the estate for the year, get some planting done and generally keep the estate in good order.  The job is getting harder and harder each year and I know from working with many residents' associations that the level of subscriptions continues to fall.  They are hit at the doors with the line, "Why would I pay a residents' association fee when I am paying local property tax?"  Of course the council will not come around and cut the grass or maintain the estate.  However, the seeds for that misconception were sown when the Government had the household charge and sent glossy leaflets to every home in the country giving the perception that this is exactly what it would pay for.</p><p>Fast forward one year; the local property tax was introduced when it was realised that the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, could not collect the money for the household charge.  Revenue appeared on the scene, Zacchaeus hit the streets and the money was collected.  There was sleight of hand, conveniently around the same time that the Government butchered local democracy and killed town councils.  The general purpose grant system was eliminated.  It was a significant amount of funding for anyone who was on a council.  Instead of councils being in a healthier financial position after the introduction of the local property tax and being able to achieve all that was promised in the glossy leaflet sent at the time of the household charge, all that was accomplished was one fund coming in and another going out the back door.  Councils were no better off and unable to accomplish what was being promised.  It is only right and proper that we ease the burden on those faced with management company fees by virtue of the types of developments being sought in counties, where such developments are wanted.  The proposals put forward by Deputy Darragh O'Brien are modest, fair and equitable.</p></speech>

These fees were brought in to fund things such as the maintenance of public lighting, roads, paths and grounds in an area.  We should stand back and look at some of the estates that have been built in the last number of years, and consider those which will be built in the future.  In Portlaoise there are a number of estates with 600 or 700 housing units and populations of 2,000 people in them.  Those estates are effectively large towns in rural Ireland in their own right.  The entire cost of maintaining such an estate will fall to the management company in terms of the area that is owned by the residents in that estate.  We are not talking about small estates with ten or 20 house, but significant urban areas.  It has to be looked at in that way.</p>  <p>  The amount of relief being considered in this legislation is very modest.  It is a token recognition for the work that is carried out by these management companies and will work out at less than &euro;90 for each of those locations.  It will only apply to people who are owner-occupiers rather than those who rent houses, and is designed to prevent, in some way, people from having to pay tax on the double.  </p>  <p>  People will be concerned about this.  The collection rate of the local property tax is approximately 97%.  In Laois it is 98%, which is one of the highest rates in the country.  This is being done by the Revenue Commissioners, and so it does not impact on the workload of the local authorities.  If Revenue has a system whereby credit can be issued against the local property tax it could be implemented seamlessly, without any interference.  Revenue is very sophisticated and would be able to do that.  It would also have a great side effect.  Everyone living in estates would want to pay their management fees in order to get this credit from the Revenue Commissioners.  That would help to ensure that the management companies, which in effect are managing small towns, would have sufficient funds to enable them to continue to do that.  That would be a very important side effect.  </p>  <p>  People will also be concerned that this will have a bigger impact in major cities such as Dublin and surrounding areas where a lot of local property tax is collected.  That tax goes towards a fund that is distributed to other areas where a smaller amount of local property tax is collected.  This legislation would have a minimal effect on some of the smaller counties that do not have large collections from the local property tax and where there are not as many big management companies in big estates.  It would be very fair and balanced.  I ask people to be very fair and very balanced when considering this.  We can tease out the details on Committee Stage.  I believe there is the germ of a good idea that should pass into legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="21:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900047#UU00300"><p>Management fees have been a creeping feature of the housing estate scene in the last ten or 15 years.  While people who are not familiar with them may think they are confined to apartment developments, in fact they are not.  There are many estates in my constituency in County Meath that are not entirely apartments - they mostly have houses - which have management fees.  These include Dunboyne Castle in Dunboyne, The Briars in Ashbourne, Steeplechase in Ratoath, and large estates such as Grange Rath in east Meath.  We want to ensure that people are not paying double tax, and this legislation covers that.  It makes sure that we give some sort of recognition, in a small way via tax refunds, that they are paying on the double for services.  While it is the case that on some of these estates the management companies provide some advantages, as well as disadvantages, it is also the case that it adds another financial burden on those who are living there.  In many of these estates, the financial burden from management fees is in addition to the substantial mortgages many of the homeowners took out.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that this legislation solely relates to people who are owner-occupiers of houses.  This is not a subsidy to landlords or tenants who are not liable for the property tax or management charges in general.  This matter needs to be brought forward, and there has to be greater recognition of the situation that homeowners find themselves in when they are paying on the double.  The Bill deserves the support of this House and should be brought in as quickly as possible.  I sincerely hope the Government supports it.</p>  <p>  I want to briefly mention the Multi-Unit Development Act 2011 on the record of the House.  It was a necessary piece of legislation, but there is a provision within it on house rules.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could inform the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment of that.  The house rules provision in that legislation is being interpreted in a very wide sense by some of the management companies, particularly in housing estates.  The companies see that they have the right to make rules, which members can approve of, that relate not just to the landings in apartments or how one conducts oneself, but how people in houses, roads and streets operate.  That really is a usurpation of the functions of the Oireachtas to make laws, and indeed the making of by-laws by local councils.  I would certainly be in favour of the Department regulating where those house rules can apply.  There is an extremely broad application of these rules at the moment.  If they are interpreted to the extent that some people want to interpret them, the management fee really becomes a type of poll tax which enables residents to vote on these house rules.  I would like to see some action taken in that regard.  House rules are necessary in developments where people are living side by side, but they are not necessary to the extent that some people believe or as the legislation permits, as far as I can see.  </p>  <p>  The legislation before us is positive, helpful and relates to a small set of people who are paying on the double.  It involves a maximum payout from the Revenue of approximately &euro;17 million nationwide to some of those who are hit hardest by these charges.</p></speech>

It is a very practical piece of legislation and is very positive.  It could make a real difference to a significant number of people, perhaps as many as 500,000.  In the census of 2016 there were 206,000 apartments in the country, and a number of other types of multi-use and terraced buildings that would fall under this area as well.  It would be very significant.  Local property tax funds very important services within our towns and communities, such as public lighting, roads, footpaths, maintaining green areas and providing public parking.  It is regrettable that as soon as the local property tax came in - with the aim of enhancing the existing services provided by councils - much of the grant that local councils were getting from central government was taken away.  Local property tax funding was not increased funding to help support those necessary services, but instead replaced that funding.  Local councils were stymied in terms of the extra work they wanted to do.</p>  <p>  Examples have been given of different areas within our constituencies.  There are quite a number of such developments in my area, particularly in Newbridge.  Millfield is an area I have spoken regularly about, in terms of the issues and challenges it has faced.  Once there is a management company in place in a particular area that area cannot be taken in charge by a local authority.  If there is an estate which is only partly covered by a management company the whole estate cannot be taken in charge while the company is functioning.  It causes many problems.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien said, this is one of three Bills Fianna F&aacute;il has introduced which seek to support those living in apartments and multi-owner developments.</p><p>Too often, owners and residents of multi-unit developments have been absolutely forgotten about and left behind.  We want to ensure that we have a fair property tax system that is equitable.  We do not want people to have to pay double for the same services, which is what is happening.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party committed to ensuring that there is no increase in the local property tax for homeowners and that a fairer more equitable system is put in place when the review is finalised and the report finished.</p></speech>

I understand the Bill proposes to make provision for a partial relief from local property tax payable by a relevant owner whose property is located in a managed estate on which the owner of the property is liable to the payment of management fees.  Specifically, where a liable person is obliged to pay an annual management fee in respect of a relevant residential property and the management fee is paid in full, such person would be exempt from having to pay a part of his or her local property tax in a relevant year.  The amount of the exemption would be the lower of one third of the management fee, &euro;300 or one third of the local property tax.</p><p>The premise of the Bill appears to be that people in the circumstances described are effectively paying twice for services in their estates or apartment complexes and that they should therefore receive a partial relief from local property tax.  I imagine Deputies will agree with me that when we set out to consider the design and implementation of any proposed taxation measure it is important to employ an appropriate set of guiding principles.  This is the approach that informed the Government strategy for the original design of the local property tax.  In 2012, the interdepartmental group, chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill, examined how best to structure a property tax.  Acting on the recommendations in the group's 2012 report, the Government introduced a local property tax that is designed on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  Under the local property tax, a liability applies to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  By limiting the exemptions available, scope is provided to keep the rate of the tax to a minimum for all those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  There is no specific relief in the payment of management fees but those liable for such fees may be exempt or eligible for relief from local property tax for another reason or may be entitled to avail of the deferral arrangement under the legislation.</p><p>We must have at the heart of our consideration of taxation proposals the fundamental requirement of any tax measure, namely, that it is equitable.  There are two dimensions to tax equity.  The first is the principle of horizontal equity, which requires that taxpayers in comparable situations should pay comparable amounts of tax.  The importance of applying this principle in the design of taxation measures is self-evident.  However, the proposal in this Bill would appear to be inequitable <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the bulk of local property taxpayers who do not pay management fees.  When a person pays a management fee, he or she receives services such as bin collection, maintenance of common areas and a sinking fund for any needed repairs.  These are costs that those who do not pay management fees or those who live in housing estates that do not pay management fees must meet from their own means.  The contention that people paying management fees are somehow paying on the double does not stand up to scrutiny.  In consequence, the Bill may fail to satisfy the fundamental test of horizontal equity.</p><p>As with any tax relief proposal, it is vital to assess the likely costs involved.  In the course of introducing the Bill on First Stage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien indicated that he had fully costed his proposal.</p></speech>

I note in this regard that for tax exemptions with an annual estimated cost of between &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million, the Department of Finance guidelines for tax expenditures state that they must be subject to a detailed <i>ex ante </i>assessment, entailing a scenario-based analysis or similar, and are also to include a statement of proposed methods and data requirements for full <i>ex post</i>cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>I also note that the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Fleming, introduced the Management Fees (Local Property Tax) Relief Bill 2015 which contained provisions identical to those of the Bill now before the House.  Deputy Fleming estimated that the cost of that Bill's measures was approximately &euro;17 million in a full year.  He also indicated that this estimate had been made on the basis that approximately 200,000 dwellings would benefit in the amount of &euro;86 each on average.  Having accepted that local property tax is an important element of local government funding, where does Deputy O'Brien now propose that this significant funding gap be made up?  What particular categories of taxpayer is he proposing should pay more to make up the shortfall?  Perhaps he has ideas on the particular services in communities that would suffer cuts as a result of his proposal.</p></speech>

I note that during First Stage, Deputy O'Brien made reference to the relief proposed applying only to principal private residences.  However, that restriction does not appear to be provided for in the text of the Bill.  It is an important point as many landlords would be liable to pay management fees.  Under the Deputy's proposal, they may be in a position to deduct the cost of those fees from their tax liabilities.  Perhaps the Deputy would clarify precisely what his intentions are in this regard.  For instance, does he favour landlords being able to benefit potentially on the double from his proposal?</p></speech>

Essentially, the concept is that people who are better off should contribute more than those who are less well off.  The local property tax fulfils this important principle as the owners of the most valuable properties pay the most.  Properties valued at more than &euro;1 million are subject to a higher rate of local property tax, at 0.25% on the excess over &euro;1 million.  The local property tax legislation also provides appropriate measures on ability to pay and is now established as an important element of our taxation system.  For individuals on low incomes, the local property tax legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to local property tax in certain circumstances.  To qualify for a deferral the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for such a deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, regardless of whether they are married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A higher income threshold applies where a residential property is occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that another review of the local property tax has been under way involving a number of Departments and the Revenue Commissioners.  The review has been focusing on the impact of property price developments on local property tax liabilities.  The review is informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, over the short and longer terms, in local property tax payments of those liable for the tax and the need to provide clear direction on the likely payments faced by households in 2020.  A number of submissions were received in response to a public consultation process that was conducted as part of the review and these have provided important input to the review.  The Minister for Finance will receive this report and make recommendations to the Government thereafter.</p></speech>

When one considers the LPT, one realises that it is probably one of the worst or most poorly designed taxes in the history of the State.  It is a tax not only on assets but also on debts.  Anybody who was or who continues to be in negative equity is still charged the same as if he or she were sitting on an asset.  It results in a charge on people who are asset rich but income poor, particularly older people in rural areas who may have properties with higher values but who simply do not have the income to pay the tax.  The LPT also leads to those who are unable to pay being penalised.  The Minister of State conveniently forgot to mention that there is a 4% annual interest charge on deferrals and that this accumulates year on year.  That seems to be a particularly callous way to allow people to defer paying the tax.</p>  <p>  Crucially, contrary to what was claimed when the LPT was introduced, no additional money has been given to local authorities.  Those of us who were local authority members at the time saw that - euro for euro - as grants for roads and housing were taken away, they were replaced by the local property tax.  During that period, a number of key services, such as those relating to water and waste management, were removed from local authorities.  Not only are people paying more, they are paying more for fewer services.  One of the reasons we will be enthusiastically supporting the Bill is because people in multi-unit developments are paying on the double.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State's comments on how people who pay management charges are paying for other things that regular homeowners have to pay for out of their own pockets are wrong.  Some of the insurance costs incurred by people in multi-unit developments do not exist in the context of standard, stand-alone houses.  The average cost of management charges, in Dublin and the commuter belt in particular, is three or four times the average local property tax charge.  While management charges sometimes include collection of waste, for example, those things are included in addition to the costs to which Deputy Darragh O'Brien rightly referred.</p>  <p>  Our view is that the LPT should be scrapped.  We have argued strongly that it should be phased out over three years.  The cost of doing so would be &euro;155 million annually.  I am sure the Minister of State will be delighted to know that we have set out, by means of parliamentary questions, exactly from where that revenue could obtained.  We could, for example, start to fairly tax excessively high earners and impose the right tax credits on incomes over &euro;100,000.  This would yield something in the region of &euro;185 million a year.  A 5% income levy could be introduced on incomes over &euro;140,000, which would yield &euro;310 million a year.  We could, as is the case in many other successful European economies, impose a wealth tax on net assets in excess of &euro;1 million.  Deputy Noonan stated in the House some years ago that such a tax could yield in excess of &euro;500 million a year.  When one has a bad tax, one does not keep it; one scraps and replaces it with something better.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to propose.</p>  <p>  As to the Bill , which is good and which Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of occupants of multi-unit developments, many of whom are, in addition to the LPT, paying between &euro;1,000 and, in some parts of Dublin, &euro;2,000 annually in management fees.  Many of these are people struggling to pay mortgages.  They are also struggling to meet the rising cost of living, childcare and healthcare costs, etc.  This is simply an additional burden which they have to unfairly bear.</p>  <p>  It is important to understand for what these people are paying.   When a person pays his or her management fee, it covers, for example, the maintenance of open space, which includes the cutting of grass and things that the council would ordinarily do in residential council estates and private estates.  It also covers street lighting and repairs to paths and roads, which, again, would ordinarily be dealt with by the local authorities in standard urban housing estates, public or private.  On that basis, it is legitimate to state that there is an element of double charging here.  People who are paying management fees and the LPT are paying for services which they do not get because the council does not provide such services in large multi-unit developments.  In some of the mixed developments, householders are paying lower management fees and the LPT, which is equally unfair.  The provision in the Bill to the effect that it will apply only to principal private residences is very sensible.  Landlords obviously generate income for themselves and they can pay the LPT from that.</p>  <p>  I echo Deputy Darragh O'Brien's point in stating that many of the people who are paying this charge are struggling in other ways.  The issue with latent defects is a case in point.  We are seeing a significant increase in the number of homeowners who, through no fault of their own, are in properties with latent defects - whether they relate to fire safety, water ingress or whatever - that are going to cost them somewhere between &euro;10,000 and &euro;40,000 to rectify.  While the Government continues to state that this is really a matter for the home purchaser and the seller, those latent defects were only possible as a result of a regulatory regime which, essentially, involved self-regulation and which this House approved and stood over for far too many years.  The Government has a level of responsibility and culpability in that regard.  The fact that it continues to bury its head in the sand and refuses to provide some level of support in respect of those properties with latent defects is deeply regrettable.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien and I have pointed out at meetings of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, there is a need for a fundamental review of the way in which the management companies of multi-unit developments operate.  The Apartment Owners Network, a fantastic voluntary network of apartment owners, has made multiple submissions to the Government and joint committee in which it has urged the former to examine how those companies can be better equipped and supported to do the job bestowed upon them under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  It is not all about money.  Some of what the network is seeking involves support.  It wants training, professionalisation and assistance in terms of ensuring that when its members are on management companies, they will be able to deal with the complexities of governance and management.  Such supports could easily be facilitated by the Government.  The network also wants assistance in the context of accessing finance.  It is not looking handouts.  Rather, it wants low-interest finance to be provided through Home Building Finance Ireland in order to fund remedial works or to assist in the provision of sinking funds.  Obviously, they go beyond the scope of the Bill but it is right to raise these broader issues.</p>  <p>  Small and all as the measure provided for in this legislation is, it would send out a clear signal that the Government actually recognises that people in multi-unit developments need assistance and that a small bit of financial support would be the right way to start.</p>  <p>  There is nothing in what the Minister of State said that stands up to any sort of credible scrutiny.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in will be happy to support the Bill.  We will be supporting Deputy Darragh O'Brien in ensuring that the Bill passes all Stages as quickly as possible in order that we might give struggling homeowners a bit of a hand up.</p></speech>

The Sinn F&eacute;in position is that it would abolish the property tax.  We made this clear in our alternative budget.  The property tax is effectively a tax on family homes and because of the mismanagement of the economy by Fianna F&aacute;il and subsequent Governments, many families, often paying high rates of property tax, remain in negative equity.  Sinn F&eacute;in councillors have been to the fore in reducing the property tax, where feasible.  While this is not a complete remedy, it can be seen as an interim measure towards the ultimate abolition of the property tax.  Residents in managed estates can legitimately argue that they are getting no effective financial relief when, in essence, they are being taxed on the double.  Residents pay management company fees for lighting, roads, streets, cleaning, maintenance and so on.  Such services fall within the remit of local authorities.  They are provided by the latter in those areas not under the care of management companies.  This is the purpose of a property tax and it is why funding from the property tax is ring-fenced for local authorities.  If local authorities were properly funded, however, there would be no need for a property tax.</p>  <p>  Some here like to equate the property tax with the payment of rates in the North, as if those paying property tax in the South are somehow getting a better deal.  Those who try to make that this comparison between the two are fundamentally wrong.  They are either deliberately in denial or do not understand how the system in the North works.  People do not pay property tax in the North; they pay rates that are progressively levied.  What they get for paying their rates is a quality of service that is just not provided in the South.  People in the South are expected to pay rates and a local property tax.  In addition, many of the services previously provided by the local authorities have been farmed out to private companies.  As a result, people often have to pay additional fees for the provision of these services.  The fees for bin collection are an obvious example.</p><p>In some areas, people are paying ridiculous annual bin collection fees while also paying weekly collection fees.  Previously, that service was provided by local authorities.  It should be returned to them.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to scrapping the local property tax and to the proper funding of local councils.  We should not have to rely on a regressive family home tax in order to provide essential services for local communities.  Give proper funding to local authorities and abolish the property tax.</p></speech>

Many people who bought houses are caught up in this situation, especially in larger towns and cities, and must pay property tax as well as these fees.  Something must be done, as many of the people in question bought their houses at a time when prices were high.</p>  <p>  The property tax is the most unfair tax.  It would at least be something if people got a service out of it.  Some people have their tongues out repaying their mortgages.  Property tax is a tax on the family home and one's bed.</p>  <p>  I would like Deputy Darragh O'Brien to take something into account.  While I support his Bill and my sympathies are with people who have to pay these exorbitant fees as well as the property tax, someone applying for planning permission in a rural area pays the same contribution as someone within a town but does not get a sewerage service.  If the person was in a larger town, he or she could connect to the sewerage system.  The person in the rural area has no street lights or footpaths.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, speaking earlier this evening about lights, footpaths and the various services in different areas.  Unfortunately, if a person is, as some call it, out in the sticks in rural Ireland - we call it the most beautiful part of the country - he or she must pay property tax and contribution levies.  Apart from the Bill, the Government should consider this matter and stop crippling people living in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Equally, people in cities are being shafted by having to pay twice in this way.  One would have to sympathise with them.  House prices are increasing for the simple reason that we do not have enough houses.  A pensioner's father or mother might have bought or built a house years ago when some part of Dublin, Limerick or Galway was out the country before the city grew up around it.  It is not the pensioner's fault that the house became more valuable.  At the end of the day, all anyone can do is live in it if it is his or her home.</p></speech>

I will explain some of the issues that concern me.</p>  <p>  There is a problem with people having to pay management fees and what management companies can require of residents in managed estates needs to be regulated.  I acknowledge the interdepartmental review.  The multi-unit developments legislation needs to be amended.  I have met the Apartment Owners Network which has genuine concerns about, for example, people who are not owner-occupiers not paying their management fees and sticking the owners with the entire amount.  Other concerns relate to sinking funds and how the long-term, more expensive elements that can arise might simply become unaffordable.  These genuine concerns need to be addressed via regulation.</p>  <p>  My problem with the Bill is that it does not distinguish between apartment blocks and housing developments that have management fees.</p></speech>

As someone who believes in equity, I do not see why the majority of housing estates where homes are privately owned and people maintain their own back gardens and driveways should be subsidising gated communities, for example, that they cannot even access.  There is a problem in that respect.  Apartment blocks are different and genuine issues relating to them must be dealt with in a way that is fairer to those who have to pay.  However, the Bill's focus is on what can sometimes be expensive management charges without addressing the question of, for example, whether communities are gated or have concierge services, gyms and so on.  Are such facilities to be subsidised by the public purse?</p></speech>

If this Bill essentially subsidises people who are very well off - I believe it was Deputy Fleming who originally stated the cost would be approximately &euro;17 million - using public funding that would otherwise go to parks, libraries, public roads, footpaths and playgrounds, I would limit it and not have it open to whatever the management companies want to charge and provide.  The Bill limits the amount to one third of the management fee or &euro;300, whichever is the lower, so there is some control.</p></speech>

In some cases, estates are pushed into remaining in private ownership even though the norm in most parts of the country is for local authorities to take estates in charge after a certain period of time and then maintain their open spaces, grounds and so on.  That is a better principle.  Where a number of people live together, the roads and public spaces should be public.</p><p>They should not be only for the people who happen to live in that area.  As a principle, I am concerned that we would consolidate that practice.  I am particularly concerned if they are gated communities, that is, if the public cannot go in and out of them.  By all means, let one's private home and what is inside one's front gate be one's property but an entire estate that is only for people who live in the area seems to be dividing communities.  That is not a good principle.  </p> <p> I understand there are issues.  I do not believe people are against the principle of a property tax.  I find it confusing to hear the opposite view from people on the left.  My view, as a left wing person, and the view of left wing parties in European countries generally, is to take some of the tax burden away from work, whereas in Ireland a high proportion of tax is taken from our income, but we need to spread that to include wealth, and in some cases homes are wealth, particularly expensive homes.  The principle of having a tax on property makes sense from a left wing perspective.  There are other left wing parties in this Chamber who do not take that position but they are quite out of step with left wing parties in Europe generally.  I have no problem standing up and saying that I believe there should be tax on property, simply because there is only so much tax to go around to pay for all the public services we want.  If we want good public services, they have to be paid for by tax.  By all means tax the wealthier people, and I have no problem with increasing tax on wealthy people, but other forms of wealth as well as income also need to be taxed, and that, in some way, has to include property.  That is where I am coming from on this issue. </p> <p> I can understand there is a problem and that Deputy O'Brien's Bill is designed to deal in some way with that problem, but it is spread too widely.  Basically, it encourages the idea that if people have private expensive homes that have management fees then we are never going to ask the council to take them in charge and make them equal to the types of housing estates the rest of us live in.  </p></speech>

I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for highlighting the anomaly that arises in estates where residents to have to pay twice to live in whatever house or apartment they are in.</p>  <p>  The property tax is a contentious matter in some areas, especially in rural areas where homeowners do not get much in return for paying it, not even a water service.  People do not have a public water supply in many parts of the county I represent and have to provide their own supply.  We all know that the property tax was to be reviewed in recent years but that has been deferred by the Government because it was afraid it would get roasted in the local elections and in the next general election.  It is delaying this review until after those elections.  </p>  <p>  We have an anomaly in Kerry in that all along the Kerry border with Cork, the people in Kerry pay way more in property tax than the people in Cork for property of the same value, however that has come to pass.  We have highlighted that often enough in the chambers in Kerry County Council but that is still the way it is.</p></speech>

More often than not it is very hard to get the local authorities to attend to some of these villages.  They are doing their best with the limited resources they have.  People are angry in rural areas because they have to pay this and that charge, their property tax, their insurance premia and all their other expenses but what are they getting in return for that?  They are being told now that they cannot drink a pint or eat a bit of meat.  They are still driving over the same little bridges and small roads that were built 200 years ago.  Some 800 applications have been submitted for local improvement schemes in our county.  I do not know when we will get funding for the 800th one but it will be a long way down the road.</p>  <p>  We cannot build a hospital for the children of the country or houses for the people.  People did not have anything in the 1800s but a railway was built from Killorglin to Caherciveen in two years.  That is the truth of it.  They have every kind of a system now, every type of machine, every technology for drawings, other types of equipment for taking deliveries and all the modern gear.  Traffic was held up on the M50 for six months because no one could give those doing the work a plan.  The middle of the road was taken over and the traffic was slowed down.  No blame attaches to the company that was doing the job, as it was waiting for six months for someone to land with a piece of paper setting out what those in charge wanted it was to do.  Lorries were drawing waste soil from the new children's hospital as the big hole was been dug out on the site.  Only two loads of waste material a day could be brought by some of those involved in the project to the facility in Monasterevin, and that facility was limited to taking in 100 loads a day because Kildare County Council would not let it take any more than that.  If Members are wondering where the money has gone, it has been spent on things like that.  Another 100 loads of waste material was being brought to a facility in Longford.  That happened because some environmentalist said the material could not be levelled out in some hole that could have been found and surely there was hole in this county to which that waste material could have been brought.  </p>  <p>  A wind farm project was being developed in Kilgarvan but all the waste soil from that site had to be brought to an infill site in Killarney and some of it had to be brought to Kenmare.  What is the cost involved in that?</p></speech>

We have all these smart alecs saying we should save the planet and to hell with the people in the meantime.  I say that people must live.  They will do their best to pay their taxes but the Government must be fair with them and allow a small bit of latitude so they can survive.  Rural Ireland is a very dull place at the moment.

Everyone in this House is entitled to his or her viewpoint and opinion.  I and my colleagues will listen to everyone.  I can understand where Deputy Healy-Rae's concerns are coming from, especially with regard to rural areas.</p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Darragh O'Brien on the considerable amount of work he has done on the Bill.  We have a new problem in that many people who bought homes at the height of the market are paying substantial management fees of up to &euro;2,500 per annum.  These fees apply in cities and many other urban areas and are a major cost for the 500,000 people who pay them.  There are more than 7,000 management companies.  Deputy O'Brien is right to bring this Bill forward and it is right that we are having this conversation on legislation that would ease the burden on these people who must pay twice.</p>  <p>  As has been noted, the local property tax was established to fund services such as maintenance of public lighting, roads, footpaths, groundskeeping, management of public parks and so on.  Apartment owners and residents of managed complexes, however, already pay for many services, including lighting maintenance, road surfacing, footpaths and public green spaces, through their annual management fee.  This means that some homeowners are paying for the same service on the double.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, referred to property taxes and planning fees as they apply in rural areas.  People query politicians about the reasons they have to pay such large fees and ask what these fees are used for.  When we tell them they are to pay for services, they tell us they do not have footpaths, public lighting or public green spaces in their area.  I acknowledge that people use libraries and parks and most of them do not have an issue with making a contribution towards the costs.</p>  <p>  We need to address this issue and advance the legislation.  I am sure Deputy O'Brien will be open to suggestions from any side of the House.  I welcome that Sinn F&eacute;in has given strong support to the Bill through Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Ellis.  Deputy Fitzmaurice has also been very supportive.  It is acknowledged and accepted that there is an issue that needs to be addressed.  This legislation is about ensuring we have a fair property tax system where nobody pays on the double for the same services.  We hear a great deal about double taxation.  That is not on and Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to ensuring there is no increase in the local property tax for homeowners.  We want to ensure a fairer more equitable system is put in place when the review is finalised and the report published.  We will work with all people and other parties to achieve this objective.  I accept that there is a cost factor and money has to be found for services.  We should tackle this issue head on and sort it out.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy O'Brien, on introducing the Bill.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.714" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1344" speakername="Eamon Scanlon" time="22:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900052#ZZ01400"><p>I commend Deputy O'Brien on bringing the Bill forward.  The Bill provides for property tax relief for homeowners who are paying management fees and is one of a suite of measures that Fianna F&aacute;il proposes to help people living in multi-unit developments.  This is practical and long overdue legislation.  The Government has continually neglected these owners and their issues, despite the fact that more than 500,000 people live in these types of properties.  Under the legislation, apartment and homeowners would receive a discount on property tax, which would be worth one third of their management fee or property tax, whichever is lower.  The discount would be capped at &euro;300 a year provided the owner has paid the management fee in full.  The local property tax was established to fund services such as maintaining public lighting, roads and paths, groundskeeping and management of public parking.  Apartment owners and residents of managed complexes already provide many services themselves, including maintenance and upkeep of local recreation areas, through their annual management fee, yet they have to pay the same level of local property tax.</p>  <p>  I have been contacted by people living in an estate who pay management fees that cost more than &euro;2,000 per year in some cases.  These residents should at least have a reduced fee because it is completely unfair to be charged twice for the upkeep of their area.  The legislation is about ensuring we have a fair property tax system and nobody has to pay on the double for the same services.  According to the Thornhill report on local property tax, based on an average local property tax of &euro;257, the average benefit of the tax relief to a recipient would be &euro;86 and at least 200,000 households would benefit, at a total cost of &euro;17.5 million.</p>  <p>  Many people who bought homes at the height of the market are paying high management fees of up to &euro;2,500 annually.  This can be the equivalent of two months of mortgage payments.  The uncertainty surrounding the delay in the review of local property tax is causing major stress for homeowners and local authorities nationwide.  This legislation will offer some comfort to those affected who do not know whether to prepare for an increase in the payment.  Fianna F&aacute;il made a detailed submission to the review in which we firmly outlined our opposition to the introduction of any increases in local property tax.  We are committed to ensuring a fairer, more equitable system is introduced once the review has been finalised and published.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the provisions of the Bill would apply to owner occupiers only and would not apply to investors.  Many owner occupiers bought apartments in the boom and paid high prices of between &euro;250,000 and &euro;350,000.</p><p>That is what the prices were at the time and there is no doubt that they are struggling now and need any help they can get.  Hopefully, it will also encourage people to pay their management fees in full.  There is a problem in that regard and a great deal of money is owed to management companies in circumstances in which people, quite simply, cannot afford to pay.  They have to live.</p> <p> Another issue was raised by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony.  People applying for planning permission in rural areas face development charges of &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000, even though they provide their own site and sewerage.  They have to pay for their own water, of course, but that is not the problem.  They have to pay these extraordinary development charges which are said to be for libraries, lighting and footpaths, but those people get little benefit.  There is a great deal to be done.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Government Whip allowing me to use a small bit of time.  I record a declaration of what might be perceived as a conflict of interest in the debate.  I refer to the concern I have for the constituents I represent who are dual paying, as Members have said.  They are struggling to pay management fees in complexes and pay their local property taxes.  They are very fearful about what will come in future following reviews.  Any effort that could be made here, whether through this or another proposal, would merit support due to my concern for my constituents who have raised the matter with me on numerous occasions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-19a.720" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021900053#AAA00600"><p>I thank all Members for their contributions to the debate.  It is important to bear in mind that the objective of the local property tax is to broaden the domestic tax base and to replace some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes with an annually recurring property tax.  We know to our cost how, in the past, our reliance on transaction-based taxes proved to be an unstable source of Government revenue.  In contrast, international experience has shown that property taxes are a secure and stable source of funding.  I need not remind the House how important stability in our public finances is to the success of our country and economy, particularly as we head into a period of uncertainty.  Given that context, it is surprising to hear calls from certain Opposition benches for the removal of the local property tax.</p>  <p>  The LPT is producing a stable revenue yield for local authorities although both yields and tax rates are modest by international standards.  The charging structure for LPT is progressive.  The basic rate of 0.18% applies to property values of up to &euro;1 million with a higher rate of 0.25% applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 million threshold.  In addition to the progressive rate structure, and to the extent that those with higher income or wealth tend to own properties with higher values, this is a progressive tax, particularly over the life cycles of taxpayers.  From 1 January 2015, local authorities have had discretion to vary LPT rates by plus or minus 15%.  A number of local authorities have exercised this option.  Where a local authority decides to reduce the rate, it forgoes the equivalent amount of the reduced LPT yield from its allocation.  If a local authority votes to increase the rate above the basic rate, it receives the full amount of the increased yield.  I understand that five local authorities voted to increase the tax above the basic rate in 2019 and that four decided on a reduced rate.</p>  <p>  By the end of 2018 and since its inception, local property tax has contributed &euro;2.7 billion to the funding of local authorities.  The Revenue Commissioners publish comprehensive LPT statistics on quarterly and annual bases, which include information on collection and compliance, exemptions and deferrals and payment types.  Some of this is broken down by local authority.  The compliance rate for 2018 was 97%, which is line with rates in previous years.  Another positive feature of the LPT is that, as a tax on assets not employment, it will not adversely affect job creation.  Regarding ability to pay, the LPT legislation has a number of features providing that in certain circumstances a person can defer or partially defer the payment of local property tax.  Deferral arrangements are available where there is an inability to pay and certain specified conditions are met.  These deferral arrangements were outlined in some detail in earlier remarks.</p>  <p>  The LPT is an annual self-assessed tax charged on the market value of residential properties.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the administration, collection, enforcement and audit aspects of LPT.  The property valuation must be determined on a specific valuation date and it forms the basis for the LPT charge until the next valuation date.  The first valuation date for LPT was 1 May 2013 and the valuation of a property set on that date remains valid until 31 October 2019.  The 1 May 2013 valuation is not affected by any subsequent improvements or extensions to a residential property.  Likewise, where a property is sold during the valuation period and the value of the property has increased, there is no additional LPT liability, provided the initial 2013 valuation was accurate.  The local property tax is now a well-established element of our overall taxation system and I consider it important that its position be maintained, as research and experience internationally consistently show that taxes on immovable property are among the taxes that are least detrimental to economic growth.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that following a review in 2015, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, proposed to Government that the revaluation date for the tax be postponed from 1 November 2016 to 1 November 2019.  This postponement meant that homeowners continued to have their homes valued for LPT purposes on the basis of their 1 May 2013 declared valuation and so were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017, 2018 and 2019 as a result of increased property values.  If there was no change in this position, the valuations of properties on 1 November 2019 would be the basis for calculating LPT liabilities in 2020 and beyond.  That is why the Minister for Finance considered it essential that the terms of reference for the review of the LPT that is concluding should include the principle of achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer terms.  In conclusion, the report on the current review of the tax is being finalised and the Minister for Finance will then be in a position to make recommendations to Government about it.</p>  <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae referred made a comparison between Kerry and Cork in respect of similar properties.  I understand that Kerry County Council applied a 5% local adjustment factor or increase to LPT, which may account for some of the difference for homes of similar value.  A number of Deputies raised issues regarding the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  It is not correct that in paying their annual maintenance fees and LPT, owners in multi-unit developments are paying on the double for the same services.  They are two distinct and separate charges.  The annual maintenance fees associated with multi-unit developments are used to meet the costs incurred in maintaining, managing and refurbishing developments within their boundary walls as well as all related ancillary services for the exclusive benefit of the property owners concerned.  LPT proceeds, on the other hand, are used largely to provide and maintain infrastructure, services and other amenities in a general locality which are of benefit to all residents, including the owners in multi-unit developments.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies referred to the taking in charge of estates.</p></speech>

I refer to the taking in charge of residential developments, the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2019, and the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.  Normal housing estates fall under the provisions of the Planning and Development Acts while multi-unit developments are covered by the Multi-Unit Development Act.  The taking in charge of estates is provided for in section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and there are a number of stipulations on roads and so on.  The procedures for taking in charge are to begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of residents in a development or by the developer, as appropriate.  Protocols, including timeframes, must be put in place by the planning authorities in response to requests for taking in charge.</p>  <p>  While a number of issues were raised by Members, the basic charge that people are paying on the double is not borne out.  People in multi-unit developments pay for the exclusive use of their properties whereas LPT relates to the use of facilities by the public, including the occupiers of multi-unit developments.</p></speech>

I commend my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for bringing the Bill forward.</p>  <p>  We hear a great deal about the squeezed middle and this is a perfect example of where that squeezed middle is continuously being exploited.  Management fees, by definition, are fees that property owners pay for services provided by their development's management company.  Essentially these fees cover services such as maintenance, lighting, green areas, footpaths and parking.  Those costs are generally also contained in the narrative associated with the property tax.  In many cases the people concerned purchased an apartment as a step on the so-called property ladder but were forced to remain in the apartment due to spiralling house costs, regardless of whether they wanted to.  They are now paying on the double.</p>  <p>  One of my constituents in Cork South-West pays &euro;1,500 in management fees and a further &euro;300 in property tax.  This constituent bought the apartment at the height of the property boom and the management fee is equivalent to two mortgage repayments.  Under our proposal this constituent would make considerable savings on the property tax, which can only be deemed fair in the circumstances.  Clearly, this option will only be made available to those who have paid their management fee in full.  The Bill provides for this.  Such situations will be more prevalent in major urban areas, but the number of apartment complexes is increasing.  At this stage many of the larger towns and villages in west Cork are dotted with apartment complexes.  Obviously, there are other situations where management fees are also paid.  I am seeking to look after these constituents.  What makes the situation more difficult in west Cork is the fact that salaries are often generally lower.  While this is relative, it is, nonetheless, an additional burden and expense that could be lessened.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that this measure could benefit approximately 200,000 households.  These homeowners deserve a break, and I ask the Minister to give it to them.</p></speech>

I will respond to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's queries shortly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne's, contribution was a type of history lesson on the LPT and an outline of the review.  We know that, which is fine.  However, this Bill is a genuine attempt to right some wrongs.</p>  <p>  I was taken aback by the contribution from the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.  It was not just the fiscal gymnastics in which he engaged when he spoke about matters such as the principle of horizontal equity and the principle of vertical equity.  I have never previously heard him speak in such a manner on this.  I learned new phrases this evening so perhaps every day is a school day.  I am trying to right a wrong and make the LPT a little fairer.  Thousands of homeowners in my constituency in Fingal County Council are not living in big mansions or big gated communities.  I refer to teachers, garda&iacute; and nurses living in apartments.  Many of them bought them at the top of the market and they are paying between &euro;2,000 and &euro;2,500 in management fees.</p>  <p>  I contest the Minister of State, Deputy Canney's, response that this relates to the horizontal equity test, which he was teaching us about earlier.  He said the contention that people paying management fees are somehow paying on the double does not stand up to scrutiny.  He should ask anyone who is paying LPT in full, particularly in areas where property prices have risen and the person is paying a decent amount from net income.  The property tax does not take account of people's income, nor do management fees.  They are paying for items such as wastewater treatment, parks in the estate, open spaces - I am not referring to shared landings or the like - and the roads they use through their LPT.  Management companies are in a very difficult position right now because there is an overall issue.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to what the Labour Party would do.  I have published three Bills on this and I was not a Minister of State with responsibility for housing in the Department.  There are actions that must be taken to rectify this.  One relates to fairness and that is what this Bill is about.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, gave the Government's response after he asked us to park our Bill for six months during which time he said the Government would have a look at it in more detail and cost it properly.  I was open to that initially before he gave what was a condescending, dismissive, trite and petty response on behalf of the Government.  To be fair, he is not like that, but that is the official Government response.  That is how it treats Opposition legislation.  Frankly, it is disgraceful.  They should talk to the thousands of people concerned across the country.  Some 200,000 homeowners or approximately 500,000 people say this is an issue.  These are owner-occupiers, not landlords and investors, and I take Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's point that we should be far more specific about that on Committee Stage.  I know it is an issue, despite the Government's response to a Bill, which is a proposal by an Opposition party that does not have the Revenue Commissioners' resources to cost all our proposals, yet another criticism that was made.  Of course, it is an approximation and we have done the best we can.  That is something that would be done on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Minister of State's response, it would be impossible for me or my party to accept the request from the Government to delay the Bill for six months to allow for more detailed consideration.  That should be done at the housing committee.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has one of her Bills before the committee tomorrow.  Let us do it through the committee because I do not trust the Government to do it within six months.  When the Minister of State's colleagues in Fine Gael are out and about over the next few months they should talk to people, mainly in urban areas, and ask them if this is an issue and if they are paying &euro;2,500 a year in management fees.  It is an issue when they are paying full LPT.  This Bill is a recognition of that.  There is a maximum of &euro;300 and, incidentally, that would be in a minute number of cases.  We are looking at an average reduction of approximately &euro;86.</p>  <p>  This is an acknowledgement that there are managed areas, managed estates and apartment blocks that are providing the services themselves whereas in other areas the local authorities do so.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised a fair question when she asked if this would be a way of ensuring that some estates which should not be private estates would remain private and not go under the council.  That would not be our desire at all.  I believe more estates should be taken in charge.  Indeed, in my area of Fingal, the council is moving to take some estates in charge.  However, we should not forget why these are private estates.  The reason is that in the original planning permission it was a condition of the local authority that they would be managed estates.  We have to look at estates that can be brought back under the local authorities by taking them in charge.</p>  <p>  This is a measure to recognise the fact that thousands of families need a break on these.  These are the people who, to quote the Taoiseach, "get up early in the morning".  They are working families.  Many of them bought their homes and apartments at the height of the boom and they are paying management fees.  The Minister of State mentioned the review of the LPT.  We are still waiting to see what the Government will do with the property tax.  At present, if nothing is done LPT will be doubled across the country.  I cannot understand the reason for the continued delay by the Government in publishing the review.  I have a fair idea, however, that it is down to pure politics.  The Government wants to produce it in April or May in advance of the local elections.  It wants to say what all of us want, which is that there will be no increase in the LPT.  Fianna F&aacute;il's position is that there should be no individual increase in the tax.  Why not produce it now?  What is the delay?</p>  <p>  With all due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, I would have expected him to give us an indication of when that will be, but we do not know.  Instead, we have people in the Department of Finance and in the Revenue Commissioners writing a script for the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, that does not warrant any further comment.  If the Opposition brings forward Bills with its limited resources, at the very least the Government should show some respect for the spirit of the legislation.</p><p>I agree that changes to the Bill are needed and I hope to work with colleagues in this regard.  I welcome the support of Sinn F&eacute;in, the Rural Independent Group and others for the Bill and I hope I will have Labour's support for it in order that we can move it on to Committee Stage, deal with some of the very valid questions Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised and work on the specifics.</p></speech>
