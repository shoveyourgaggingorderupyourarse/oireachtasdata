In January 2017, a national curlew task force was formed, to include various stakeholders with an interest in the management of the curlew and its habitat.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is currently considering the recommendations of the curlew task force, which were published in September 2019, in order to inform the vital next steps for curlew conservation.  The possibility of the curlew becoming extinct as a breeding species is one of the most serious conservation concerns in Ireland at the moment.  Decades of habitat loss and fragmentation, and losses to predators, have seen the species decline in numbers by 96% since the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Unfortunately, these threats are very much still present and active.</p>  <p>  The curlew conservation programme, which was established in 2017 to pioneer curlew conservation efforts in Ireland, will continue in 2020, co-ordinated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The programme, which had a successful year in 2019, includes surveys, habitat maintenance, enhancement and creation, nest protection and public and community engagement.  The aim of this locally-led programme is to reverse the population declines by supporting the creation and maintenance of suitable breeding habitat and employing nest protection officers, aiming ultimately to improve breeding productivity, that is, the number of young curlew successfully reared in a given year.  Curlew productivity in key areas has improved year-on-year as a result of the works of the programme.</p>  <p>  Landowners and local communities have been central to the success of the programme so far and co-operation with stakeholders will continue to be crucial to the programme's success.  The efficacy of these ongoing conservation efforts will be determined by a research project in due course.  The pilot phase of the curlew conservation programme, just three years in, has shown that prospects can be improved by following the model of locally-based teams, engaged positively and proactively with relevant stakeholders, most especially landowners, to find and safeguard the breeding attempts and improve the immediate habitat and environment for breeding attempts.  Curlew conservation efforts will continue to be a key consideration in my Department's overall nature conservation strategy in 2020. </p></speech>

As the Minister rightly laid out, the evidence is that the breeding productivity of the curlew in the conservation areas has improved as a result of the action on the ground of the local curlew action teams, which are to be highly commended for their work on this issue.  The report concludes that the work needs to be sustained on an ongoing basis and that, ultimately, the environment and landscape into which the curlew return will need to be greatly improved if the population is to be placed on a truly sustainable footing.  The report concludes that wider policy changes are required to ensure this is so.  Will the Minister outline how her Department intends to ensure this happens?</p> <p>Will the programme be scaled up on a national level and replicated throughout the country?</p></speech>

Both pillars are closely intertwined and complementary.  The third year of the curlew conservation programme, which is this year, saw direct efforts in the following areas: the Stack's Mountains, the north of Lough Corrib; Lough Ree; north Roscommon and Mayo; mid-Leitrim; north Monaghan in the Deputy's constituency; and Donegal.  Some 54 pairs were located in these operational areas in 2017, 45 in 2018 and between 41 and 56 in 2019.  When the core areas that were covered in each of the three years are compared, those figures are as follows: 46 in 2017; 42 in 2018 and; 41 to 56 in 2019.  Further habitat improvements were planned and undertaken this year, which should benefit curlews into the future.  The pilot phase of the curlew conservation programme, just three years in, has shown prospects can be improved by following the model of locally-based teams engaging positively and proactively with local landowners and relevant stakeholders to find and safeguard the breeding attempts and to improve the immediate habitat and environment for these attempts.</p></speech>

The conference covered the environmental section of that as well.  The Minister mentioned north Monaghan, an area in which the conservation of the curlew is being developed, and that programme is welcome.  Based on the figures the Minister outlined, am I correct that the number of pairs has reduced rather than increased?  She might confirm that for me.</p>  <p>  In August 2019, the sixth report of the UN convention on biological diversity confirmed potential catastrophic species loss and the deterioration of important habitats was accelerating.  Ireland has a legal obligation to conserve biological diversity.  An Taisce described the report as a damning indictment of the state of biodiversity, with insufficient progress reported across most targets.  Birdwatch Ireland and the Irish Wildlife Trust have echoed An Taisce in calling on the Government to move quickly to arrest a species extinction crisis in Ireland.  One third of all Irish bee species could be extinct by 2030 and the Irish butterfly populations have declined by almost 12% over the past decade.  Some 50% of Irish freshwater areas are polluted and as a result, there has been a decline in our most sensitive aquatic species such as salmon.  More than 90% of protected habitats are classified as having unfavourable conservation status.  What provision was made in budget 2020 to tackle these staggering figures?</p></speech>

I commend Our Lady's secondary school on its efforts in respect of the conservation of the curlew.  The recommendations of the report are being strongly considered by the Department.  It is broken down into eight main areas: the curlew ecological requirements; farming and agri-environment; forestry; bogs; predation and nest protection; planning and development; curlew and people; and synthesis.  The efforts of the curlew conservation programme, particularly in the local teams, in building and maintaining a positive profile for the curlew cannot be overstated.  Conflict can often arise between the desires of those involved in conservation and the desires of landowners to manage their land as they see best.  The understanding and communication skills, which involve listening as well as talking, of those involved in the programme, have been exemplary.  The experience to date has been largely positive, with countless landowners and local people helping with reporting sightings, facilitating access, providing advice and undertaking efforts to help the curlew.  This year, we increased the amount in budget 2020 for the heritage sector by 15%.  Unfortunately, if we look back to the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party budgets of the past, funding to the sector was cut by 75%.</p></speech>

The responsibilities of the Arts Council are laid out in section 9 of the Act.  They are to stimulate public interest in the arts; promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; assist in improving standards in the arts; advise the Minister on the performance of any of his or her functions under this Act, when so requested by the Minister; assist the Minister in the performance of his or her functions under this Act and in the implementation of Government policies and objectives in respect of the arts, when so requested; furnish advice or information to a Minister of the Government, including the Minister, on any matter connected with its functions, whenever the council considers it appropriate or is requested to so do by the Minister; furnish advice or information to a public body on any matter connected with its functions, whenever the council considers it appropriate or is requested to so do by the public body concerned; and co-operate with a public body in on any matter connected with its functions, whenever the council considers it appropriate.</p>  <p>  These functions have not changed.  In budget 2020, I announced an increase in council funding of 6.7%, bringing its annual allocation to &euro;80 million.  In consultation with the council, a number of funded initiatives, such as Culture Night, will be transferred to it from the Department.  Culture Night was an idea originally developed by my Department and grown from a small scale Dublin event to a national cultural event that has captured both the public imagination and the enthusiasm of artists and arts organisations.  Given its national status, it is now appropriate to transfer it to the Arts Council.  Other initiatives are under similar consideration and the final list will be agreed with the council in time for the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume before the end of the year.</p></speech>

We were told it would take over the Department's role regarding both Culture Night and creative schools.  However, it is not clear whether this is the total extent of the broadening of its role or whether it is envisaged other initiatives will be transferred to its remit.  Will the Minister clarify that and whether funding from other organisations will be relocated from the Department to the Arts Council?</p></speech>

The precise breakdown of the &euro;5 million remains under consideration but we have stated it includes &euro;1.25 million in additional funding to enhance the work of the council to support performing artists, art festivals, street arts and family events.  This funding also includes &euro;3.75 million reallocated from within the Department's existing Vote.  It will further underpin the council's role, particularly regarding Culture Night and creative schools.  Details of this allocation, as I said in my initial reply, will be finalised in the context of the Revised Estimates Volume, which will be published later this year.</p>  <p>  In general, the Arts Council, where possible, should be delivering all initiatives relating to the arts.  That would allow the council to ensure interventions in the arts sector are complementary to each other and are delivered as a strategic whole.  There may be occasions where this is not straightforward to achieve, for example, where we are engaged in cross-cutting or interdisciplinary initiatives to support broader creative objectives such as under the Creative Ireland programme.</p></speech>

It is a bit disingenuous to say that the council's funding has been increased by &euro;5 million when all the Minister has done is given it the remit to do what it should have been doing in the first place, which is to deliver Culture Night and creative schools.</p>  <p>  The council is the main funding agency for arts and artists and it plays a critical role in directing funding.  It was established by statute to do this.  Research by Theatre Forum into pay and conditions for performing artists earlier this year showed that one third earn less than the minimum wage and that work in the performing arts sector is characterised by poor working conditions and precarious employment.  It was hoped that budget 2020 would have a positive impact on the living conditions for artists.  Can the Minister outline how she envisages the budget will improve the income for artists?</p></speech>

The funding will also strengthen the reach of council's role, particularly regarding the arts in education, for which it will then take on responsibility, as well as Culture Night.  It will beef up its remit.  To a certain extent, it will add further gravitas to the organisation.

My Department and several of the bodies under its remit have a number of initiatives to support the recording and celebration of Traveller culture and heritage, including the Travellers' Journey exhibition presented by the National Museum of Ireland.  A sum of &euro;150,000 was allocated to the development and realisation of the exhibition at the National Museum of Ireland in County Mayo in 2018.  The National Museum is funded from my Department's Vote and the allocation for the Travellers' Journey exhibition accounted for some 50% of the museum's exhibition development budget in 2018.  The exhibition, which ran for a year, was opened in July 2018 by President Michael D. Higgins and included a series of events and talks on aspects of Traveller culture and identity.  The National Museum has also been involved in a number of other events and initiatives in recent years in partnership with the Traveller community and is in the process of establishing a steering group of museum staff and representatives of the Traveller community to inform its permanent exhibitions and the representation of Traveller culture and heritage in its upcoming history of Ireland galleries.</p><p>On 18 July last, I launched the permanent national inventory of intangible cultural heritage, celebrating living cultural heritage practices in Ireland.  This initiative represents official State recognition of cultural practices all around Ireland, two of which are Traveller tinsmithing and Cant or Gammon, the traditional language spoken by Irish Travellers.  The development of the national inventory of Ireland's intangible cultural heritage is an integral part of my Department's work under the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which requires signatory states to recognise, protect and promote the living cultural heritage of their countries.  Following on from the launch, my Department showcased a number of the traditions on the national inventory over the three days of the 2019 National Ploughing Championships.  One of the exhibitors was the renowned tinsmith, Tom McDonnell, who exhibited the craft and skills of tinsmithing in my Department's marquee, drawing huge interest from visitors to the marquee.</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>The national inventory is not a funding programme, but an initiative to celebrate and work with practitioners and agencies in Ireland to recognise, promote and safeguard these key living cultural heritage practices.  My Department is working with its expert advisory committee to examine how it can most effectively work with both custodians of the valuable cultural heritage practices on the inventory and existing agencies to raise awareness of and safeguard these practices for generations.  The next meeting of the committee will take place this coming Friday.</p></speech>

From what the Minister just outlined, I note that she is now going to establish a committee on Traveller culture in the National Museum.  What Travellers want to see is a sub-committee of her Department established to address Traveller artists, musicians, performers, playwrights and people who make television programmes.  I am sure the Minister has met many of the people involved.  I would like to hear from her the reason she refuses to engage with Travellers, other than in terms of programmes she has inherited rather than created.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred the matter to the Ceann Comhairle.  There is a very simple reason for transferring the questions and we wrote back to the Ceann Comhairle yesterday to explain it.  I believe my Department also gave the Deputy some further information on the matter.  The simple reason is that the Department of Justice and Equality is the lead Department in overall terms on Traveller culture, identity and heritage, with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, having responsibility for this area.  While the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht participates in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy steering group, it is only one of a number of Departments delivering on the commitments included under the heading of Traveller culture, identity and heritage which is supported and valued within Irish society.  As I said, the Department of Justice and Equality has the lead role for the overall strategy.  In his reply to Deputy Burton on that occasion, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, noted that my Department is responsible for specific allocations of funding in certain areas to which Deputy Burton alluded.  The Department has provided details of funding for specific projects in arts and heritage for the Traveller community in response to previous parliamentary questions.</p></speech>

I will read out what the Ceann Comhairle said in his letter to me.  </p> <blockquote> 	I can understand the frustration of transfers of PQs such as the one cited by you.  [This was funding by the Department.]  You make a cogent argument in your letter to me as to why the PQ should have been answered by the Minister for Culture rather than the Minister for Justice. </blockquote>  <p>The Minister has made remarks on previous occasions about Traveller housing and other issues related to Travellers.  As the Minister with responsibility for culture, why will she not directly answer questions on Travellers, including the question she previously rejected?

It is certainly not coloured by my own views on Travellers.  I am sure Deputy Burton is not suggesting that.  We have written back to the Ceann Comhairle on the matter.  The national cultural institutions, which are under my Department's remit, and the Arts Council, have a number of initiatives to support the showcasing and celebration of Traveller culture.  They are supported by funding from my Department.  I trust that should clarify the position on the Department's role in the implementation of the Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, to which I alluded.  There was a reason for the approach taken in respect of the question tabled by Deputy Burton.  I also provided the Deputy directly with information on specific projects in arts and heritage for the Traveller community, funded by my Department.  Suffice to say, it is something that we are very aware of in my Department.  Going back to the national inventory of intangible cultural heritage, tinsmithing, Cant and Gammon have now been recognised and protected for future generations.</p></speech>

I am asking specifically about the Iveagh Market and the Moore Street market.  The Minister has indicated previously that she has had some discussions on Moore Street with Dublin City Council.  It would be a gross understatement to say that both Moore Street and the Iveagh Market are in a sorry state.  They are in a vicious circle of decline.  The buildings are dilapidated.  Like other Deputies, I have been a member of the Moore Street advisory committee.  I would like to know what level of progress is being made to give life back to Moore Street and to the Iveagh Market.</p></reply>

Inclusion on a record of protected structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and gives planning authorities the power to deal with development proposals affecting such structures and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  The Iveagh Market is a protected structure in the ownership of Dublin City Council.  It is currently on lease from the council to a private developer.  Therefore, the matter is primarily one between those two parties.  As the owner of the Iveagh Market, the local authority has a duty under legislation to ensure the structure does not become endangered.  My role with regard to protected structures is mainly advisory.  However, officials from my Department have contacted Dublin City Council to ascertain its plans.  They remain available to advise in any manner as required.  Dublin City Council has informed the Department that it is actively pursuing the most efficient means available to it to ensure the Iveagh Market building is refurbished and returned to beneficial use.  My Department has not discussed the renovation of any other historic market building with Dublin City Council.</p> <p>The Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the historic structures fund and the built heritage investment scheme, which are administered by local authorities.  I announced funding of &euro;4.3 million for 478 projects under these schemes in March but I understand, however, that the scale of investment needed for the structure mentioned would mean that the levels of grant funding available under those schemes would not be sufficient.</p> <p> My officials will remain in contact with Dublin City Council about the Iveagh Market.</p></speech>

The Iveagh Market was just a particular example because its dilapidation is extreme.</p>  <p>  The Minister is from Dublin and has responsibility for culture.  There is an enormous opportunity for her to step in and play a vital role in saving the Iveagh Market which is in serious danger of permanent destruction given its dilapidation.  I do not know if she has taken the opportunity to visit the market on Francis Street.  That area is heavily patronised by tourists although, unfortunately, the theatre opposite the market was recently knocked down to make way for a hotel.  I ask the Minister, given that she is from Dublin and has a knowledge of the city, to step in.  She should use the great power that she has for a period of years to do something to save two really important features of Dublin.</p>  <p>  What progress has been made on Moore Street?  I thought the Minister was to take some additional initiatives.</p></speech>

The Iveagh Market is not a matter for our Department, plain and simple.  That is a matter for Dublin City Council and it is through the council that the Deputy or her colleagues should pursue the matter.</p>  <p>  The cost of refurbishment, renovation and restoration is exacerbated, as the Deputy said, through the years of inaction from the council and the lessee.  It is not fair to shift the burden of that neglect onto the taxpayer.  Dublin City Council commissioned a report on the condition of the building earlier this year that estimated the cost of restoration at &euro;30 million.  That cost was what the report commissioned by the city council came up with.  We did not commission the report because it is not our business to do so.  It is a matter, in the first instance, for the council.  The cost is in the public realm and is equivalent to the entire annual budget for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and three times our annual built heritage budget.  This needs to be put into perspective because the solution is not to drop every poorly kept building in public ownership at the door of the Department.  The city council has to step up because it is the owner.</p></speech>

I do not know if she has ever been to Francis Street, the Liberties or the Coombe, but the Iveagh Market is an extraordinary feature of the area.  It is a famous and historical building.  Not only is the word "culture" in the Minister's title but "heritage" is too.  This is sad to hear from a Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This Government can spend millions and millions of euro on messaging and yet can allow an amazing building such as the Iveagh Market, which in other cities would be a vibrant market area drawing tourists and providing jobs for artisan producers, artists and the local community, fall into ruin.  The Minister is missing an enormous opportunity, maybe through a lack of imagination.</p>  <p>  I would like to know what are the next steps for Moore Street.  Is Moore Street just being handed over to Dublin City Council?  I would be sad if that was the case because the Government of which I was a member bought and secured the purchase of the houses in Moore Street where the ceasefire was signed in 1916 and the Minister knows there has been considerable discussion and significant work done by people across the House on this issue.</p></speech>

The years of inaction is not because of Dublin City Council but because the council, foolishly in some ways, gave a lease to a developer who has sat on it and caused the dilapidation in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Minister received a progress report from the Moore Street advisory group at the end of July or early August and there were a number of recommendations in that.  I hope she will let us know what progress has been made in acting on those proposals.</p></speech>

I disagree with my colleague because I think Dublin City Council has a huge responsibility for not developing the Iveagh Market.  It has been another failure of responsibility from the management of Dublin City Council over the years, along with the Government.</p></speech>

The advisory group has confirmed its support for the Office of Public Works in carrying out this process as soon as possible and opening up the houses to limited tours not later than summer 2021.  We are looking at the recommendations and will be doing everything to support the expert advisory group on that.</p>  <p>  I know the area around the Iveagh Market well.  I know the Coombe because both my sons work in the Coombe Hospital.  I have made it clear that my role is only advisory on this matter and, ultimately, I know that there are discussions and telephone contact, at least, occurring between the Department and Dublin City Council in order to try and assist the council with the Iveagh Market.  The council is looking at its options and has committed to keeping the Department informed of its discussions with the developer who holds the lease whom Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned.  I agree with Deputy Broughan that it is a matter for the council.  The developer was advised by Dublin City Council that the estimated cost would be in the region of &euro;30 million, as I mentioned already, and the entire project has been estimated at approximately &euro;30 million.  The council is awaiting the developer's comments on the projected financial cost of the project before it takes final action.</p></speech>

The partnership also involves other key stakeholders such as the Dublin Port Company and representatives from F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The partnership works with community groups, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, businesses, universities and schools.  Over 300,000 people live within the newly enlarged biosphere area.</p>  <p>  Biospheres are internationally recognised for their natural resources and biodiversity, where nature and human activities connect.  They are actively managed to promote a balanced relationship between people and nature through conservation on the one hand and sustainable economic development and human activity on the other hand.</p>  <p>  Another important goal of biospheres is promoting research and learning.  Biosphere status is a designation granted by UNESCO, as part of its man and biosphere programme, launched in 1971, where it has been established that there is a co-ordinated approach to the conservation of habitats, species and landscapes through monitoring change and supporting research which fosters the potential for human activity and development.</p> <p>Areas are awarded biosphere reserve status by UNESCO and are managed in partnership by communities, NGOs and local and national governments.  It should be noted, however, that there are no specific additional planning burdens or conservation requirements associated with biosphere status.  In most cases, as with Ireland's two biospheres, in Kerry and Dublin Bay, the areas are designated as special areas of conservation, SACs, or special protection areas, SPAs, and, accordingly, are already afforded statutory protections.  Development within biospheres is subject to the existing comprehensive legislative and policy planning framework implemented by all levels of government.<br/><br/>The management of the Dublin Bay biosphere is led by the three local authorities.  While my Department is not the anchor component of the biosphere, it has nevertheless provided significant additional and expert support through the auspices of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and it also provides small amounts of project funding from time to time.  Approximately &euro;30,000 has been provided in the past two years.<br/><br/><i><font color="#2F2F2F"> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i><br/><br/>The biosphere is part of the European Union's Natura 2000 network of protected sites in accordance with the birds and habitats directives.  As such, Dublin Bay biosphere is protected under the national legislation implementing these directives - the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and the wildlife Acts.  The NPWS investigates on an ongoing basis breaches of the regulations and the wildlife Acts and undertakes visits to Natura 2000 sites, as required.<br/><br/>The EuroMAB 2019 conference was hosted by Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership, with assistance from my Department, between Tuesday, 2 April and Friday, 5 April.  This four-day biennial conference for stakeholders from 302 UNESCO biospheres in 36 countries across Europe and North America welcomed practitioners, managers, policymakers, researchers, educators, ecologists, scientists, social entrepreneurs, creatives and community leaders.  Ireland sits on the steering group of the man and the biosphere programme and is represented by Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership.<br/><br/>Through its ten-year capital plan for investment, Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018&mdash;2027, my Department has committed to safeguarding our unique natural heritage and biodiversity and ensuring a sustainable future.  We intend to celebrate and highlight Ireland's remarkable heritage on the international stage through investment in the management of our UNESCO biosphere reserves.</p></speech>

There is almost no funding.  She said on the previous occasion I questioned her about this that something like &euro;30,000 was available to protect the Dublin Bay biosphere.  We have only two biospheres, in Kerry and Dublin, but there is a tiny amount of money.  As the Minister admitted, her Department is not an anchor organisation for the management of the biosphere, which is extraordinary.</p>  <p>  Dublin Bay biosphere was never more threatened.  There have been overspills from the Ringsend plant time and again.  Wastewater has been released into the biosphere.  There have been cases of raw sewage being released into the biosphere up and down the coast.  In a few days, we expect a decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la on a second major wastewater treatment plant in the Dublin region.  Incredibly, Irish Water proposes that the wastewater should go out through Baldoyle Bay, affecting Velvet Strand in Portmarnock.  There is intense opposition to this in my constituency.  Surely the Department has to get more involved.  It is not acceptable to have funding of only &euro;30,000 and no legislation.</p></speech>

The latter is operated by Irish Water, as the Deputy knows.  The discharge into Dublin Bay is regulated by licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  Any matters related to the regulated discharge, therefore, should be directed to the agency.</p>  <p>  The NPWS does, and will continue to, investigate breaches of EU regulations and the wildlife Acts and, therefore, there is statutory protection.  The NPWS undertakes to visit Natura 2000 sites as required and within the resources available to it.  It is important to note, however, that biosphere is not an environmental designation.  The environmental protections afforded to biospheres are determined by their status as Natura sites.  I mentioned that many of them are designated as SACs or SPAs in the first instance.  They are internationally recognised for their natural resources and biodiversity and are therefore important but no specific additional planning burdens or conservation requirements are associated with biosphere status.</p></speech>

A project called Acclimatize was funded by INTERREG to assess the environmental pressures on the bay.  When will the report be available?  There was to be a meeting just last month between Irish Water, the EPA, HSE and the three local authorities to discuss the pressures on the bay.  Is the Minister aware of the outcome of that?</p>  <p>  Other major pressures will be exerted in the near future.  There is a constant campaign by wind turbine manufacturers to promote the Dublin Array.  We have heard about a project costing &euro;1.5 billion whereby developers of wind energy facilities want to site more than 100 large turbines on the Kish and Bray banks.  Those concerned have been pressurising the Government, including the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, to bring forward the foreshore licensing so they may do this.  The bay is, therefore, under enormous pressure.  Surely, the Department should have a core role in protecting it.</p></speech>

Areas are rewarded biosphere reserve status by UNESCO and are managed in partnership by communities, NGOs and local and national governments.  The partnership is led by the three relevant local authorities, namely, Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council.  It also involves other key stakeholders, such as Dublin Port Company.</p>  <p>  Ireland has two biospheres.  The one in Dublin Bay is managed by Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership, which comprises the three local authorities.  The NPWS does not own any part of the area making up the Dublin Bay biosphere.  The Kerry biosphere is managed by Kerry County Council.  In this case, the NPWS has an input because Killarney National Park forms a significant part of the core area.  It is more than 300 sq. km.  The main areas of the Dublin Bay biosphere are North Bull Island, Howth Head, Killiney Hill, the Tolka and Baldoyle estuaries, Booterstown Marsh and Dalkey Island.</p></speech>

The very first National Biodiversity Conference, which I hosted this year, the development of the Seeds for Nature initiative, the wide-ranging public debate on the Heritage Ireland 2030 plan and the extensive engagement across government on climate action were instrumental in my securing significant additional resources for this important part of my remit for 2020.  I acknowledge this is a concern of the Deputy.  In this context, I have secured total funding for our built and natural heritage sector in 2020 of &euro;62.5 million, which is up from &euro;54 million last year.  This represents an increase for 2020 of more than &euro;8 million, or 15.5% on 2019, comprising an additional capital provision of &euro;6.75 million, representing an increase of 44%, and additional current funding of &euro;1.46 million.</p><p>A total of &euro;7 million of this funding is to embark on an accelerated programme of peatlands restoration and conservation works.  This programme will result in more than 1,800 ha of restored peatlands in 2020, generating up to 100 jobs in the midlands region and ultimately the storage of 28 million tonnes of carbon.  Restoration and rehabilitation of raised bogs will provide multiple additional ecosystem services, such as water and air quality improvements, flood mitigation, enhanced biodiversity, and opportunities for tourism development, and it will contribute to the social and economic well-being of local communities.</p><p>I have also secured an additional &euro;1 million to accelerate key nature conservation biodiversity programmes under the NPWS to include the recruitment of front-line conservation specialists.  I will also enhance the farm plan programme by doubling the fund available to &euro;1 million to support measures to protect biodiversity and assist farmers with lands designated as SACs in their role as custodians of nature.</p></speech>

Biodiversity is key.  When we talk about just transition and the challenges we face regarding climate action, we realise peatlands restoration is a key component.  What role, if any, will the Department play through the NPWS?  The Minister mentioned 100 jobs.  I deal regularly with workers in Bord na M&oacute;na, many of whom are from my constituency.  Many want to be retrained and to have new opportunities.  Will there be opportunities for just transition for existing Bord na M&oacute;na workers whose jobs will not exist in the long term?</p> <p>Is there a possibility for them to be directly employed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service or for the latter to give that work directly to Bord na M&oacute;na?  I presume there is a tendering process for that.  If the Minister could provide any information on that, it would be helpful.</p> <p> The Minister spoke about biodiversity measures.  I wish to raise the issue of invasive species.  Are steps being taken to address very serious issues such as those relating to Japanese knotweed?  What progress has been made on the built heritage investment scheme and the historic structures fund?  I presume there will be a new round of funding this year as a result of the budget allocation for the Department.</p></speech>

Regarding bog rehabilitation and restoration, I will be working closely with Deputy Bruton on the issue of the Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  Some 100 jobs will be created.  This issue has prompted the biggest increase in funding that the heritage side of my Department has had for many years, an increase of 15.5%.  Some &euro;5 million of that will come from the carbon fund and will specifically tackle peatlands and bogs in the midlands.  That will be significant.</p>  <p>  We are putting significant funding towards the issue of invasive species, on which Deputy Burton has also tabled a question.  Invasive species that originate in other countries are a scourge from both a national and an international perspective.  We are doing our best to tackle each and every one of these species, some with management plans and some in other ways.  I can discus that later when I reply to Deputy Burton's question.  I will talk about the built heritage investment scheme in my next reply.</p></speech>

The built heritage investment scheme and the historic structure fund have been of great benefit to organisations in Kildare, and it would be great to see that again.  The Minister knows the importance of heritage, both the need to protect and maintain it for future generations and its huge tourism potential.  We have received very positive news from the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, of an allocation of more than &euro;5 million, with &euro;67,941 allocated to the Barrow blueway project.  In that context, I thank the Minister, Deputy Madigan, for the work she and the officials in Waterways Ireland have done.  She very kindly gave up her time last August to come to a very well-attended public meeting of over 200 people in Monasterevin.  Officials like Mr. John Boyle at Waterways Ireland deserve special mention for the huge amount of work they put into a really good application.  The full amount that was applied for by Waterways Ireland and Kildare County Council has been allocated, through the rural regeneration and development fund and Project Ireland 2040, to make the 46 km dream that we in south Kildare have had a reality.  The blueway will include Athy, Monasterevin, Rathangan, Roberstown and a significant part of Laois.  I thank the Minister and her officials for the part they played in that regard.  This is how the funding of heritage and other projects in rural Ireland through rural regeneration funding should work.  It will support those communities' futures from economic and heritage perspectives.</p></speech>

It is really important to the constituency Deputy Heydon represents.  Jobs will be created in the detailed design and construction stages.  As the Deputy says, increased tourism will bring economic benefits to the area through direct and indirect visitor spending.  That is the bottom line.  Apart from the monetary benefits, there will also be benefits for new businesses and the vacant and disused properties along the waterways.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the built heritage investment scheme and the historic structures fund.  I note that in Kildare the Sean Chill and the Grattan Vault in Celbridge, the Mill Cottage in Sallins, the graveyard and church in Johnstown and the Church of the Holy Saviour in Narraghmore all received funding this year, along with Ard na Gr&eacute;ine in Sallins, St. Michael's Church in Athy and Pebble Hill House in Maynooth.  The Newbridge clock tower received &euro;25,000 under the historic structures investment fund.</p></speech>

Prior to the budget, the National Campaign for the Arts pleaded with the Minister to honour the Taoiseach's commitment to double arts spending, which has merely crept upwards.  The most recent budget saw a very marginal increase in arts funding which will do nothing to address the widespread poverty and income and employment insecurity facing artists and people working in the arts.  I have repeatedly pointed out to the Minister that film crew in this country enjoy absolutely no income or employment security.  Why was the budget so poor in this regard and what is the Minister going to do to address this issue?</p></reply>

Only one Deputy can pose the introductory question.</p></speech>

Since becoming Minister, I have put in place a number of initiatives and additional supports for the arts that will make a significant difference over time to the income of people working in the performing arts.</p>  <p>  Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2020 will increase by more than 2%, from &euro;189 million to almost &euro;193 million, an increase of &euro;4 million.  This funding will comprise &euro;153 million in current expenditure and &euro;39.7 million in capital investment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Arts Council of Ireland, through which primary support for the arts is delivered.  Its funding has increased in recent years and will reach &euro;80 million in 2020.  This is an increase of &euro;5 million, or 6.7%, on the figure for 2019.  The Arts Council of Ireland, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published ten-year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work.  This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, the impact of the arts on the creative economy and the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.</p>  <p>  The cumulative impact of these funding increases is further testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the arts, culture and heritage sector by 2025, which the Deputy mentioned.  In this context I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for my sector under Project Ireland 2040 and thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.  </p>  <p>  In July of this year I announced the completion of a review of the Per Cent for Art scheme.  The outcome of this review led to changes to the scheme&rsquo;s bands and limits which will make significantly increased funding available to the creative community.  Many artists have already received high-profile commissions for public art works as a result of this scheme and these increases will ensure many more will also benefit.  The new limits and bands will apply from 1 January 2020.  Details can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  I am re-establishing an interagency group to improve information-gathering and the collation and sharing of best practice within Per Cent for Art schemes.  This group will also be linked to the Arts Council of Ireland and will seek to enhance the council's existing advisory role in the scheme.</p>  <p>  Artists deserve our full support and have my full support, particularly given the significant income challenges they face.  With regards to artists' pay and conditions I would like to draw the attention of the House to the recent announcement by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and myself of the extension of the social welfare scheme for self-employed artists on jobseeker's allowance on a permanent basis to other self-employed professional artists such as those working in theatre and music.  This scheme recognises the unique creative circumstances of professional artists in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and gives them special assistance in their first year out of work, allowing them to focus on their creative output.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit.  Central to this are the Arts Council of Ireland's policies on the remuneration of artists, which strive to ensure that organisations in receipt of council funding offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.</p>  <p>  In tandem with securing additional funding, my Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit.</p> <p>My Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>It is important to note that employees in every industry, including those working in the arts and film sectors, are entitled to all existing legal protections, which includes new legislation under the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 to improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.<br/><br/>The House may also be aware that the Workplace Relations Commission is undertaking an audit of the independent film and television drama production sector with a view to examining industrial relations generally.<br/><br/>The Government will continue to give consideration to measures to further deliver on its commitments but will balance supports to ensure that they are felt across the sector.</p></speech>

It is against a background where this country's international reputation rests to a large extent on the reputation of our artists, musicians, writers, actors, theatre producers and so on.  Despite this, we spend a miserable 0.1% of GDP, the lowest in Europe, on the arts.  The Minister provided a miserable &euro;5 million increase in the arts budget recently.  The consequence for artists is that 80% of them are in precarious jobs and 60% earn less than the average industrial wage.  On average, workers in the sector earn less money and work fewer hours than others and the average wage is something like two thirds of the national average.  We treat artists and workers in the arts with contempt.  I do not see how the miserable increase in funding in the budget will do anything to address that.</p></speech>

Were Sean O&rsquo;Casey writing about the likes of the Young Covey today, the characters would be struggling artists because they are the people at the bottom of the heap, struggling on less than the minimum wage.  The data are available for the Minister.  Artists should not have to look for a minimum wage; they should be looking to have a living wage.  The second reason O'Casey would be writing about people still being in tenement style accommodation is that the artists we recently met at the forum our colleague, Deputy Smyth, helped to organise basically cannot look forward to any security with regard to housing.  Some artists now spend approximately 80% of a very small income on housing.  The Minister has responsibility for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is sad that we are talking about a social welfare scheme for artists.  The Minister should address the issue of artists' employment and not just pass it on to social welfare, which is administered by a different Department for a different purpose.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett said the increase was a miserable one.  The Arts Council stated that it welcomes the increase of &euro;5 million.  The Taoiseach has committed to doubling funding for the arts by 2025.  We still intend to do that and we are on a trajectory to achieve it but we are all aware that this was not a normal budget in normal circumstances.  Under those circumstances, the Arts Council has accepted that and it is best placed to discuss the matter.  I am satisfied that the &euro;80 million we secured this year, the highest level of funding in over a decade, was positive rather than negative.  We should not try to mislead people in that regard.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned our international reputation and I agree with him wholeheartedly.  Our artists speak volumes about our global reputation.  I wrote a novel and understand how difficult it is for people to earn a living.  I could not have given up my job to write books.  I am acutely aware of that but it is facetious to say that a social welfare scheme does not assist people because it does.</p></speech>

We are nowhere near being on a trajectory to double arts funding.  In People Before Profit's budget submission for the past three or four years, we proposed doubling the arts budget, which would have enormous benefits for this country economically and socially as well as for artists.  What else would the Arts Council say given that it is dependent on funding from the Minister?  It will not say anything too loudly against her.  The National Campaign for the Arts expressed considerable disappointment at the increase in funding.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly raised the issue of film crews.  We need to do something about the fact that &euro;80 million goes into film every year and nobody in the sector has any security because of the designated activity company, DAC, structure through which the money is filtered.  Something needs to be done to address that and to give income and employment security to film crew.  More generally, we need to look after our artists.</p></speech>

In particular, they are struggling to rent spaces in which to carry out rehearsals and other artistic work.  They are also struggling to hold on to art spaces and access rent at a reasonable rate.  Artists are the backbone of the artistic concept of Ireland and the Minister is neither here nor there.  The working artists make Ireland a country with a calling card and reputation which is so positive with regard to the arts.  Why can the Minister not champion a living wage and affordable housing for artists?  I would think that is absolutely within the remit of any Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></speech>

In an interview on the day of the budget, the new chairman of the Arts Council, Professor Kevin Rafter, expressed the hope that funding for the arts would increase by 10%.  He must have been bitterly disappointed.  Research carried out earlier this year by Theatre Forum, members of which attended a meeting in Leinster House recently, on pay and conditions for performing artists showed that one third of artists earn less than the minimum wage, and that working in the performing arts is characterised by poor working conditions and precarious employment.  People in the sector have no healthcare, job security, childcare, maternity leave or pension.  The Minister has to do something for them.</p></speech>

Thus far, the Low Pay Commission's recommendations have been accepted by the Government, with the result that the national minimum wage increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.90 per hour between January 2016 and January 2019.  The legislation relating to the setting of the national minimum wage has been in place since 2000.  I take the Deputies' comments on board.  Since I became Minister, I have increased the capital and current funding for arts at a difficult time.  That has to be acknowledged.  We have to give more funding to the Arts Council and bring other measures such as the percent for art and social welfare schemes into the mix in policy formation.  Artists have a difficult job to do and should be encouraged and supported in any way possible.</p></speech>

Today, the number is 649.  Behind the numbers are some horrific and appalling experiences for people in emergency departments.  They are simply appalling and should not be tolerated by the Government.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, yesterday described the situation as "obscene" and said, "Winter has not even started, and Irish hospitals are overwhelmed".  It went on to say that nurses are faced with an inhumane working environment, while patients are put at ever-increasing risk.</p>  <p>  I spoke to an eye witness in Cork University Hospital.  The person went there on Tuesday at 3 p.m. with a family member and was there until 5 a.m. the following morning.  He said that what he had witnessed was simply unbelievable.  He said the doctors and nurses were under "savage pressure", to use his own phrase.  He could not comprehend how they were able to work under such circumstances.  People were sitting on chairs and lying on trolleys everywhere.  They ran out of seats to sit on.  The chronically ill were in a desperate situation, to the great anxiety of their relatives.  There were many elderly people there.  I can give another illustration of these experiences.  If one travels to Clare, Limerick or north Cork, and this did not start today or yesterday, the overwhelming issue on the doorsteps or when one meets people is their experiences at the emergency department of University Hospital Limerick.  There is real anger from the relatives of loved ones who have gone through terrible experiences due to the overcrowding.</p>  <p>  Critically, the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine has said that this is costing lives as people are dying as a result of the overcrowding.  It says that 350 to 400 excess deaths are occurring each year because of the state of the emergency departments, the overcrowding and the long delays in treatment in those departments.  This was confirmed to me by experienced medical authorities in Cork University Hospital, who reluctantly said that they had to admit and confirm that some people who attend the hospital will die as a result of the overcrowding and delayed treatment.  In addition, there is a chronic shortage of consultants and a lack of rehabilitation beds, step-down facilities and home care packages.</p>  <p>  When will the moratorium on the recruitment of staff be lifted?  There are approximately 1,000 posts on the front line unfilled currently.  When will the winter plan be announced?  It is incredible that this is November and it has not been announced.  Why is there this reactive approach as opposed to a proactive one from the Government?  Will the Taoiseach, at a minimum, commit to lifting the embargo?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="11:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600012#K00900"><p>I am very much aware that our emergency departments are very overcrowded today.  Indeed, they have been for quite some time.  However, there has been a reduction in overcrowding today versus yesterday and we expect that reduction to continue through to tomorrow and Friday.  As regards the actions the Government is taking, we are adding more beds to the hospital system.  Since 2014, as soon as we had the money to do so, we started adding new beds to the system.  That will continue.  New bed blocks are under construction in Clonmel and Limerick and we will have them open as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  We are also providing more funding for the fair deal and home care.  The budget for the fair deal will exceed &euro;1 billion for the first time next year.  That will enable us to reduce the number of delayed discharges, where patients are in hospital and do not need to be there and could go to a nursing home or go home.  We must ensure that happens much faster than it does currently.  We are also investing in community care.  We have secured a deal with general practitioners, GPs, to improve the level and depth of services they provide in the community, to ensure that fewer people go into hospitals in the first place.  Much action is being taken to deal with this problem.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's questions, the winter plan will be published next week.  In many ways it does not need to be published: what is in it is what has been in it in previous winters, which is funding for the fair deal and home care and to open any beds that are closed, although I understand that none is closed currently, and investment in transition care.  That is already happening even though the plan has not been published.</p>  <p>  There is no recruitment moratorium.  As I explained yesterday, the number of staff in the health service has been increasing for many years now.  There are approximately 15,000 more people working in the public health service now than there were three years ago.  There are 600 more nurses than this time last year and more than 100 more doctors.  However, it is the case that Health Service Executive, HSE, managers are not allowed to hire staff if they do not have the money to pay for them.  We had a recurring problem in previous years of HSE managers taking on staff for whom they did not have the budget.  That is not allowed in education, the Civil Service or the Garda.  It was an anomaly that the practice was allowed in the health service.</p></speech>

There is a disconnect between what the Taoiseach is saying in the House about the numbers of nurses and doctors and the reality experienced by doctors and nurses at the front line in hospitals and by patients and their families.  It is a huge disconnect.  Either we and the people outside are not getting it or the Taoiseach has some insight, that nobody else has, in terms of the reality of people's experiences in hospitals and particularly in emergency departments.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's comments on the moratorium are becoming very irritating and annoying.  People have come to me who came top of the panel last February and gave up private sector jobs in the expectation that they were going to get jobs with the HSE.  Those people have not been employed.  They were recruited, but the contract has not been signed because there has been a moratorium since last April.</p> <p>That is still the case.  The Taoiseach needs to drill down and to stop coming back with the kind of response that involves seeing no evil, no damage and no harm.  The scale of the Government's response to the chronic issues facing staff and patients in emergency departments is not what it should be.  It simply is not there.  The Taoiseach needs to engage in a fundamental reflection on the Government's approach to this crisis within our hospitals.</p></speech>

Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, will be well aware of this, along with all other Deputies and councillors who represent the city.  On one hand, there are significant gaps in the drug addiction services being provided while, on the other hand, there is a lack of garda&iacute;.  We have been hit with a double whammy and the situation is reaching a crisis point.  This crisis has seen drug paraphernalia and used needles being found in schoolyards and residential areas to such a degree that a young child recently picked up a bag of heroin from the garden of his home.</p>  <p>  Government policy has been moving away from addressing this issue as a criminal justice matter and towards seeing it as a healthcare issue.  I recognise that.  I have also spoken to many of the service providers within the city.  They tell me that the issue is not so much about financial resources - they recognise that money is being provided and that they have capacity - but about the recruitment of staff, a similar issue to that raised in the previous question to the Taoiseach.  Services in our city are in an absolute state because they cannot recruit staff as a result of the embargo.  There are posts that have been waiting to be filled since last February.  The failure to fill those posts has unfortunately resulted in services being stepped down.  The only victims in this situation are the addicts who are crying out for these services.</p>  <p>  Due to the fact that these posts are not being filled and the issue is not being addressed proactively, we are seeing an increase in drug-related crime.  As a result of there being 124 fewer garda&iacute; than the number recommended to service Cork city and county, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is under-resourced to deal with this increase.  As I have said, it is a double whammy.  I ask the Taoiseach to commit to lifting the embargo and allowing the service providers to fill those posts so that we can start to tackle this issue once and for all.  They are waiting to be filled and the money is there to pay the staff.</p></speech>

If the Deputy wants to pass more details about those posts on to me, I will certainly have the situation examined.  If a post has been approved and if the budget is there to fund it, there is absolutely no reason it should not be filled.  The long-standing practice of advertising posts and designating people to fill them without the posts being sanctioned and without a budget to pay for them has been ended.  That is not the norm across the public service.  It was tolerated in the health service for a very long time and was the main driver for the overruns in the health service we have seen in previous years.  That practice cannot be allowed to continue.  Perhaps the Deputy will give me details of the particular posts to which he refers.  If it is the case that the posts are funded and were approved, we will have the situation examined and get back to the Deputy in that regard.</p>  <p>  With regard to the wider issues relating to drugs, the Deputy mentioned the need to treat the matter as a health issue.  This is a health issue, albeit one that has a criminal justice aspect to it.  Whatever can be said about the health service, there is certainly no restriction or recruitment embargo in place in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There has been a significant increase in the number of garda&iacute; in recent years.  There are approximately 14,000 garda&iacute; now.  The total figure for the force will increase to 21,000, including other staff, in the coming years.  As a result of this, there has been an increase in the numbers in Cork.  There will be a further increase as garda&iacute; are recruited and attested in the coming period.</p>  <p>  We have also increased funding for addiction services.  The allocation in this regard was &euro;94 million in 2016.  This was increased to &euro;100 million in 2018.  This means that there are now 793 residential beds for people who want to go into treatment and who want detox.  That is a significant improvement on the situation in the past.  We are also working really hard to get a supervised injection centre opened in Merchants Quay.  We have run into difficulties with planning permission with Dublin City Council but we will press ahead with the project and try to get it completed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is working with Merchants Quay and leading on the project.  We also have an agreement with Dublin Simon Community to provide a 100-bed detox unit for homeless people who have a problem with addiction.  We are working on that and need to get it done as soon as we possibly can.</p>  <p>  There are also increased resources for education and information.  These are targeted at warning students and festival-goers in particular of the risks of taking drugs in the first place and at advising them how to reduce harm and stay safer if they do so.</p></speech>

We have 144 detox beds in the State.  There are no stabilisation beds outside of Dublin; not one.  We have more than 700 detox and rehabilitation beds, but we are talking about people who require some sort of stabilisation because they are required to be clean of drugs to get into a detox centre.  It defeats the purpose on the first day.  We need stabilisation beds.</p>  <p>  I take on board everything the Taoiseach said.  However, in the context of issue relating to the Garda, 2,800 recruits have come through Templemore, which was closed by Fianna F&aacute;il, since it reopened.  Does the Taoiseach know the number of them who have gone to Cork city?  It is 69.  Less than 3% of these garda&iacute; have been deployed to Cork city.  The unit which investigates sex crimes in Cork has been unable to keep up with new cases.  On a busy weekend night recently, only two garda&iacute; were available to patrol the city centre.  This is the second largest city in the State and only two garda&iacute; were available.  There has been an increase in crime, particularly that relating to drugs, and we are seeing an increase in burglaries and aggravated assaults.  Despite this, we have fewer garda&iacute;.  The Taoiseach will state that deployment is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but it is also a matter for Government when 2,800 garda&iacute; have come through Templemore and only 69 were deployed to Cork city.  That is just not acceptable to the people I represent.</p></speech>

That figure comprises 19 inpatient detox beds, 127 community-based residential detox beds, four adolescent residential detox beds, 625 residential rehabilitation beds and 18 adolescent residential beds.  We now put more than &euro;100 million a year into addiction services.  That is money well spent because, if people can be taken out of addiction, they can get on with their lives, enter employment, and once again contribute to society.  We will continue to increase resources for addiction services in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The number of garda&iacute; stands at 14,234.  The total Garda workforce is 17,275.  We are recruiting more garda&iacute; all the time.  Another batch of recruits will be passing out in the coming weeks.</p> <p>More and more, the Garda Commissioner is leading reforms within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take garda&iacute; out of administrative and office positions so we can have them back on the front line where people want them to be and where we want to see them.  How those garda&iacute; are assigned around the country is a decision for the Garda Commissioner, and it is right that it is his decision.  In my engagements with him I will raise the point the Deputy made and see if he will consider sending more of the next batch of garda&iacute; to Cork.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="12:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600014#M00200"><p>Yesterday saw the end of a court process and the sentencing of two teenage boys for the horrific murder of a young girl in the prime of her life.  It was probably the most extreme example of sexual assault and misogyny the country has seen.  We send solidarity to her family.</p>  <p>  Last month, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre stated there was a public health epidemic of sexual violence.  This time last year, thousands of people shared pictures online of their underwear with the hashtag, #thisisnotconsent, in response to victim blaming in rape trials.  Ireland trended worldwide at the time and we had to bring the issue graphically into the D&aacute;il chamber.  One year on, I ask the Taoiseach what his Government has actually done about gender-based violence.  Barristers are still trotting out the same old rape myths.  In a recent trial, where it was not even contested that the complainant had been savagely beaten, the barrister suggested that the woman had still consented to the sex.  The barrister said: "she is a worldly young girl [she is aged 20, by the way] with experience of life ... she knew what she was doing."</p>  <p>  Women are wondering why we bothered putting a definition of "consent" into the law because it is not worth the paper it is written on.  In another court this week, a complainant who was allegedly raped by two men was told by a barrister that she consented as she was not drunk enough and had the presence of mind to fix her skirt.  Being beaten, raped multiple times and having video evidence does not seem to be enough to be believed.  Is it any wonder there are reports of famous sports celebrities strutting around with impunity despite sexual assault allegations being made against them?  Are women to go into hiding every time such a figure decides to go on a night out?</p>  <p>  Following protests after the rape trial in Belfast, the Taoiseach commissioned the O'Malley report.  It was to report by the end of last year but here we are approaching the end of 2019.  The Taoiseach is already aware of the figures so I will not repeat all of them.  I will say, however, that ten women are murdered annually, one in three women experience coercive control and one in four women has experienced physical or sexual violence.  One must judge how important a Government considers an issue by how much funding it gives.  The Taoiseach's Government gave &euro;25 million to the entire support sector but saw fit to give &euro;17 million to the cruel and ailing greyhound industry.</p></speech>

The increase in funding provided by the Government goes nowhere near to meeting the demand.  Why are groups not going into schools to educate young people about the signs of abusive relationships?  Instead we have a culture of Hollywood movies and so on that normalises toxic behaviour by calling jealousy and manipulation "romance".  I put it to the Taoiseach that we have to conclude that unless people go out to protest and stage walkouts in Google, McDonalds or wherever else, nothing seems to happen in here on these issues.</p></speech>

I offer my condolences and my heart goes out to the parents of Ana Kriegel.  I saw them speaking yesterday and I cannot imagine what they are going through and will go through for the rest of their lives because of what happened to their beautiful daughter.</p>  <p>  There is an epidemic of gender-based violence in Ireland and across the world, and it needs to stop.  The Deputy asked what the is Government doing about it.  We are doing quite a lot.  We have finally ratified the Istanbul Convention.  That was long overdue but it has been done by this Government of Fine Gael and Independents, whereas it was not done by many other Governments that could have done so in the past.  We have modernised our laws around sexual offences.  These laws have been strengthened in recent years through the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Acts and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act, which makes coercive control an offence.  We have changed our laws around consent and have strengthened them in a way that needed to be done.  There is also improved recording of sexual assault and work is ongoing with the Office of the Attorney General around the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill.  Next, we will introduce a distinct offence of stalking to provide for two offences to deal with non-consensual recording and distribution of intimate images.  The Labour Party has been very involved in working with us on that.  We need to ensure that proposed image-based offences will cover the recording and distribution of sexual assaults.  The Oireachtas joint committee report will be considered in full once the committee has completed it.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also continually improving its specialist services responding to the needs of victims.  The Garda Commissioner is now rolling out digital protective service units with specially trained officers to engage with and interview victims.  These personnel are better trained and know how to deal with victims of sexual violence.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has also launched the No Excuses campaign, a three-year national awareness raising campaign on sexual harassment and sexual violence that was launched in May 2019.  The campaign aims to increase awareness of sexual violence and bring about changes in societal attitudes such as those the Deputy spoke about, with the aim of decreasing and preventing these offences.  I am pleased to say that a second burst of the campaign commenced on 2 October.</p>  <p>  With regard to funding, Tusla has statutory responsibility for care and protection from domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The budget for that has increased by 20% under this Government and stands at &euro;25.3 million.  In addition, a further &euro;1.7 million is being made available by the Department of Justice and Equality to support 57 organisations which support victim support services, and a further &euro;2 million has been allocated in the budget for 2020 to assist those services next year.</p></speech>

These are important and relatively easy things to do but they need to be backed up by change.  We can see from reading the court reports that the definition of consent, which I argued for when I spoke at the committee, does not seem to be having one jot of an impact.</p>  <p>  I welcome the No Excuses campaign.  The difficulty, however, is that while it encourages more people to disclose, will they get the help they need?  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has said it has had a 25% increase in phone calls as a result of #MeToo and a more disclosing culture.  The Government increased funding to the sector by 10% across the board, even though some areas needed more while others may have needed less.</p>  <p>  Last year, 3,000 people became millionaires in this country and 3,000 children got help from a domestic violence service.  There are also more than 3,000 children who are homeless.  The idea that we do not have the money to support services to assist women, men and children who experience violence is simply not acceptable.  Women's Aid published a report in the past month which included a finding from a survey that people believed there was no point in taking a case and the majority of respondents said they probably would not bother doing so again.</p></speech>

It is only in the last year or two that we have gone from deficit to surplus and we are talking in as much in revenue as we spend.  Government spending is increasing by about 4% a year.  As the Deputy pointed out, we increased the budget in this area by 10%, which is a recognition of the priority we place on this issue.  The fact is that we are willing to increase resources for this area at twice the rate we are increasing funding for other areas, some of which have had funding frozen or reduced.  The Deputy mentioned some of those areas earlier.</p>  <p>  In terms of what we are doing on the issue, we are reforming the law and I have given some examples of that.  We are also investing in education and public awareness campaigns and the Deputy acknowledged that this has led to an increase in the number of women and men coming forward, which is to be welcomed.  We are also improving our data in this area, which is very important too.</p>  <p> I am aware that the Deputy has campaigned successfully for us to go ahead with a new study on sexual violence in Ireland, which is being done.  We are also providing additional resources and training to garda&iacute;, as I mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

This tax has been a feature of the tax system since 1976.  The 2003 Act sets out how the tax is to be charged and calculated.  The Act provides for two types of tax, namely, gift tax and inheritance tax.  I wish to raise a number of anomalies in the treatment of certain people when it comes to this tax.  There is very favourable treatment for some individuals while others are treated unfavourably.  It is tax justice for some and injustice and unfairness for others.  One group that is treated unfavourably comprises those who cohabit.  They are treated differently from those who are married or in civil partnerships.  Spouses and civil partners who inherit from the other person in the relationship do not pay capital acquisitions tax, which is very different from the position of those who cohabit.  That is one anomaly.</p>  <p>  There is another anomaly for cohabitants.  When a cohabitant dies and provides for the surviving cohabitant, the latter will pay tax.  If one cohabitant dies without leaving anything to the surviving cohabitant, the latter can apply to court for a share in the estate.  If that is granted, he or she will pay no tax.  There is unfavourable treatment for a cohabiting couple if they are two sisters or brothers or other family relations or two friends or where one is a long-time carer.  A shared home cannot be gifted to the surviving person in those relationships without a considerable tax burden being imposed.</p>  <p>  The term "disponer" is used in the 2003 Act to refer to a person who is providing a benefit to others.  It is the relationship between the disponer and the person benefiting that will make a very appreciable difference to the tax being paid on inheritance or gifts.  The child of a disponer will have a tax free allowance almost ten times greater than another family member.  A disponer who has children enjoys far more advantageous tax terms than a disponer who does not.  While efforts must be made to ensure that wealthy people do not avoid or evade tax, certain relationships are penalised when it comes to capital acquisitions tax.  There are significant tax exemptions and concessions for relationships which are formalised through marriage and civil partnership but not for cohabitants, regardless of whether the relationship is intimate, and most definitely not for single people who do not have children.  The person receiving there pays very high tax.</p>  <p>  The Minister's reply when I raise this issue is usually to say that the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage, including civil partnership.  Really, however, this is very lucrative for the State but unfair to those who are not being treated like others.  This matter must be examined and addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600015#N00300"><p>I am at a little bit of a loss once again.  As is often the case, the Deputy perhaps knows the detail and facts around tax law better than I do.  I may have to come back to her with a more substantive response at another date.  As she stated, capital acquisitions tax involves two elements.  One is inheritance tax and the other is gift tax.  In the two most recent budgets, we have reduced inheritance tax.  The Independent Alliance was keen for us to do that and, as a Government working together, we were happy to do it.  It is our objective to allow the average person to pass on the average house in Dublin and around the country to his or her children without the latter having to pay any inheritance tax on it.  Our tax code discriminates positively in favour of inheritances and gifts between spouses and from parents to children.  That is treated very differently from an inheritance or gift given to someone to whom one is not related or to whom one is more distantly related.</p>  <p>  I understand the point the Deputy makes and where she is coming from in the context of cohabiting.  However, there is a difference between cohabiting and being married.  Marriage and civil partnership are different relationships to cohabitation.  Our law recognises this by favouring those who are married or in civil partnerships over those who are not.  It would be difficult and fraught to try to change that or even to define clearly in tax law what is cohabiting and what is not.  It is very clear whether one is married or a civil partner as one has to go through a legal process.  There is no legal process of which I am aware to show that someone is a cohabitee or not.  As the Deputy knows, the Finance Bill is currently being debated.  She may take advantage of those debates on the Bill to propose amendments which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, could consider.</p></speech>

With regard to cohabiting, one could have two sisters or brothers who never marry and share a home.  There will be a tax burden for the surviving sister or brother unless he or she can prove dependency, which is unfair.  Someone who does not marry or have children and works for 40 years may be able to buy a house and have some savings but the tax burden for whoever inherits that property and savings will be considerable.  It is as if they are being penalised for not marrying and having children.</p>  <p>  The reality is that there is significantly preferential tax treatment in respect of inheritances and gifts for married couples, civil partners and the children in those relationships.  We even have superannuation schemes where an employee pays for the spouse and children benefit even though he or she has not married and does not have children.  There are a great many anomalies there and there is a great deal of unfairness.  It is almost like there are tax penalties for those who do not get married or have children or for those people who live in a committed although not intimate relationship who cohabit.  We must amend the inheritance tax rules.</p>  <p>  I like the Taoiseach's optimism to the effect that I could table an amendment that would be accepted.  I do not think so.  In the interests of fairness, we should have a look at this again to ensure certain people are not overly penalised.</p></speech>

I can imagine a scenario in which two sisters or brothers are living in the one house when one passes on and the other is left with a significant tax bill, which he or she may be unable to pay, in particular if he or she is elderly.  I understand the issues the Deputy raises or which could arise and they merit examination.  It is not something I have discussed with the Minister for Finance but I will on foot of the Deputy raising it.  However, we must be careful to get these things right.  As we so often learn when it comes to tax law, one can fix one anomaly only to open up another one.  One can close one loophole but thereby inadvertently open a new one.  When one does these things, one has to be able to write them in law in a way that stands up in the courts and when the Revenue Commissioners seek to enforce them.</p></speech>

I got to know him on a mission to Brussels many years before either of us came to serve here.  It became very clear very early that Peter had three outstanding characteristics.  First was devotion to family.  Maura was rarely far from his side and she was mentioned in every conversation one had with him.  His devotion to his children and his extended family was obvious.  The second characteristic was commitment.  He had total commitment to the service of the people of Longford and of the country as a whole.  Third was loyalty to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, of which he was a life-long member.  He was a man of integrity and he had vision.  He was hard-working and, I can tell the House, he was really great company.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; gr&aacute; m&oacute;r aige do phobal a cheantair f&eacute;in.  Bh&iacute; gr&aacute; aige do dhaoine i gcoitinne agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-tugtha don pholait&iacute;ocht.  Bh&iacute; cl&uacute; agus c&aacute;il air ar fheabhas a dh&uacute;thrachta agus de bharr gur oibrigh s&eacute; go dian d&iacute;cheallach ar son mhuintir Longfoirt thar na blianta fada.  Fear m&oacute;r teaglaigh ab ea &eacute;, a raibh pearsantacht bheoga, mheanmnach aige.  D&rsquo;fh&aacute;g a bh&aacute;s easnamh orainn.</p> <p>I am grateful for this opportunity to pay tribute to a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il political family who gave a lifetime of service to our country, Peter Kelly.  With Peter Kelly, we celebrate a life well lived.  He loved his community, he loved people, and he loved politics.  Famous for his commitment and hard work, he served the people of Longford with distinction over many years.</p> <p> Peter Kelly had three great passions in life: his family and friends, Fianna F&aacute;il, and Longford.  To those who met him, he was "Peter Kelly, Longford".  I recall him introducing himself to me as that many times, even at a point when we knew each other, because that was how he always introduced himself.  A great storyteller, he told the story of the county and the community he loved so much with wit, eloquence and ability.  </p> <p> A funeral director as well as a publican, Peter&rsquo;s favourite job was undoubtedly being a Deputy.  In 2011, after nine years in this House, he decided to stand in the general election, even though he knew he would probably lose his seat.  When others bowed out, he stayed the course, because he believed the people should have their say, even if it meant they were choosing someone else.  That is an admirable characteristic.  However, his defining characteristic was loyalty.  He was loyal to his party, his family, and his county.  I am also told Peter was a great singer and loved a good singsong at the bar.  I may have gone home at that stage.  When he got going, it was said that even Elvis Presley would not hold a candle to him.  </p> <p> Peter was slow to embrace new technology, and I am told he was the last remaining Member to use a fax machine.  A few years ago he was making a representation to the HSE and asked for the fax number in their office.  When told they did not have a fax machine, he asked "Where are you?" to which the official replied: "Well, I don&rsquo;t know where you are, but I&rsquo;m in 2016".  It is a measure of Peter&rsquo;s graciousness and good humour that he loved to tell that story at his own expense.  In later years his wife, Maura, who I believe he always called "The Rose of Castlerea", looked after newfangled innovations like email for him.  I offer my condolences and that of the Fine Gael party to his loving wife, Maura, and to their three children, Emily, Peter and Joseph, their grandchildren, and to all their family and friends.  </p> <p> People who knew Peter tell me that his defining characteristic was that he always put people first.  He wanted to spend time with people - a valuable attribute in today's very busy times - he wanted to work with people and, above all, he wanted to help people.  The words used to describe him capture the man: decent, honourable, old school.  Longford will always remember Peter Kelly, their political colossus who did so much for the county he loved.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; an caidreamh sin soil&eacute;ir ag a t&oacute;rramh, go h&aacute;irithe idir &eacute; f&eacute;in agus M&aacute;ire.</p>  <p>  Peter Kelly was an outstanding public servant, a man deeply rooted in his own community and a truly great character in the best sense of that word.  His family background, growing up and working in his family business, gave him a unique insight into the lives of Longford people.  He lived their lives with them.  He shared their highs and lows, trials and tribulations.  He had the personal touch and was a firm believer in Tip O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s adage that all politics is local and personal.  He was committed to making life easier for families during the most difficult of times.</p>  <p>  Peter fought tenaciously for Longford town and he was intensely proud of its traditions, culture, music and political contributions.  He was first elected to public life in 1985 to Longford County Council &ndash; a breakthrough election at the time for Fianna F&aacute;il in that it ushered in a new generation of public representatives who later graduated to the national stage.</p>  <p>  He was particularly inspired by and proud of his friendship with the late, former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds and of Albert&rsquo;s achievement, with others, of securing the Downing Street Declaration paving the way for peace on the island of Ireland.  He had a genuine affection and admiration for Albert.  </p>  <p>  Peter was also a man who championed enterprise and the self-employed, a voice that needs to be heard in this forum.  He understood through experience the concerns and needs of those who create jobs. </p>  <p>  He was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2002 upon the retirement of Albert Reynolds and he quickly became known around its corridors and canteens, endearing himself to staff and colleagues and political opponents alike.</p>  <p>  He had extraordinary wit and humour.  He was a great conversationalist, a great storyteller and a great mimic.  The Taoiseach spoke of his difficulty in catching up with technology, but he always believed that his tie was far better than the microphone when he was doing impersonations of Elvis Presley.  If one ever went into the canteen or restaurant and saw Peter at a table, one would join him immediately, guaranteed to be entertained by his charm, humour and the latest story.  Peter loved company.  </p>  <p>  By his side at Leinster House and at party functions was his beloved wife, Maura.  They were a beautiful couple, relaxed in each other&rsquo;s company and philosophical about life itself and political life, in particular.</p>  <p>  Peter, it is fair to say, was different politically, in that, anyone wandering around Leinster House will find a lot of stressed people with worried, grim faces, particularly at election time or in advance of election time, but in the midst of all of this, Peter&rsquo;s space was an oasis of calm contemplation and good humour.  He conducted politics with an easy grace, understanding how it all worked, and never allowing it to suppress his enduring qualities of kindness, courtesy and good humour.  He understood life better than most around Leinster House.</p>  <p>  He had, of course, an enduring love of Longford.  No matter where he travelled, who he met, he always introduced himself simply as &ldquo;Peter Kelly, Longford, Ireland&rdquo;.  This was clearly illustrated when he met Justin Timberlake, who was enjoying a quiet pint in that favoured Longford watering hole in Dublin, O'Donoghue's, when Peter introduced himself in typical fashion.  They chatted and laughed for a good 20 minutes until the young superstar had to leave and afterwards Peter told the barman. &ldquo;That was a lovely young fella&rdquo;.  The barman was somewhat perplexed that Peter had no concept of who he had been talking to, and he simply told the barman, &ldquo;I have no idea who he was but I tell you, he knows all about Longford now.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Peter loved sport and especially the GAA.  He followed Longford at every opportunity and enjoyed enduring friendships with the Longford stars from the 1960s.  Peter was a lifetime member of Longford rugby club and, of course, the closest sports arena to the family home was Longford tennis club.  He was involved in its endeavours for most of his adult life. </p>  <p>  Peter was happiest out among local communities.  Whether it was Ardagh winning the national Tidy Towns competition or the Longford minors winning the Leinster championship, nobody beamed a broader smile than Peter.  It was that same sense of community that helped ensure that Peter forced steadfast links with the Longford diaspora.  He was a staunch and enthusiastic supporter of the Longford associations in London, New York, Dublin and Manchester.  He rarely missed their functions and greatly valued their counsel.  Peter once said three words could sum him up: &ldquo;Longford, Longford, Longford&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  Peter Kelly&rsquo;s was a life well lived - a proud Longford man who understood the concept of serving the public good; a representative who used public office to look after the well-being of those most in need; a clear voice for enterprise.</p>  <p>  He was a great father, husband and friend and colleague of ours who, with great commitment, built further on a proud republican tradition.</p> <p>The loss of Peter is a loss to us all but that loss will of course be particularly felt by Maura, Emily, Peter and Joseph, his brother Vincent and his family and friends, whom he loved so dearly and spoke so often about.  They will be consoled by the beautiful memories they have and the many happy times they shared together, as well as the rich legacy of public service that Peter has left behind.

Peter was an elected Member of this House until 2011 but unfortunately I never had the honour of meeting him as I only entered the House in that year.  Having listened to the stories of the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and the Taoiseach, I am sure if I had met him, he would have passed on great wisdom to young Deputies like me at the time coming into the Chamber.  Deputy Martin is correct as we see many stressed faces, and not just at times of election.  I have probably aged approximately 20 years since coming here despite being a Member for less than half that time.  An old school politician who was able to balance family and political life, as well as his personal time for interests and hobbies, is somebody from whom we could all probably learn.  We could all probably learn to take ourselves a little less seriously, particularly in this Chamber, as life can be very short.  I again express sympathy on my behalf and that of my party to Peter's family, his wife, Maura, his children and grandchildren.  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="12:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600017#P00300"><p>On my behalf and that of the Labour Party I tender deepest sympathies to the Kelly family, particularly Maura and the children, Emily, Peter junior and Joseph, as well as his brother, Vincent, and the wider Kelly family on their sad loss with the death of Peter in January 2019.  I am the last constituency colleague left standing who served with him here.</p>  <p>  Peter was a politician of the old school and all the better for it.  He was dedicated to public service and the community he served.  He was a man with sharp business acumen and a very good business brain, so one would underestimate him at one's peril.  He was well known in the publican circles and he was an undertaker throughout his life.  He developed the iconic Kelly's lounge bar, which was something of a local institution and it wrote a large chapter in Longford's social history until it was finally sold.  His DNA was certainly Fianna F&aacute;il and his loyalty to the party was second only to that to his family.  He followed in his father's footsteps in politics and became chairman of Longford town council, as well as the county council.  He served as party leader there, as Deputy Martin mentioned, from 1985 to 2003.</p>  <p>  He was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 2002 from the Longford-Roscommon constituency.  He succeeded the late Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, serving the people of Longford with great distinction for the next decade.  As Deputy Martin said, Peter always had a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye and it would inform people that he had arrived at the pinnacle of his achievement, a seat in the D&aacute;il.  He was a great friend of the late Albert Reynolds and the later Mickey Doherty, whose stories are legendary.  He had a great laugh at the time Mickey inadvertently sparked turmoil in the European money markets when discussing Albert.  I was here at the time.  I do not believe German Chancellor Kohl was too happy as there was trouble with the European Monetary System and there was a market frenzy that took several pfennigs off the Deutsche mark at the time.  Mickey and Peter would have had a great laugh at that.</p>  <p>  I asked him once how he managed to be voted political rookie of the year at the sprightly age of 58.  He always had a self-deprecating sense of humour, which was great.  We all know of his pride in Longford; the savage loves his native shore and nobody loved the shore of Longford more than Peter.</p>  <p>  I remember a story from his first term and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party leader might know of it.  Several Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers were smarting at the lack of promotions and Peter told colleagues how he met the then party leader in the corridor and addressed the promotion matter head-on.  I asked him what he said and he told me that he informed the leader he did not want a junior ministry, and under no circumstances should he be part of the Cabinet.  An impatient colleague, now probably gone, was irked by the mocking tone and quickly accused him of lacking ambition.  Peter said he had a deep ambition and wanted to be a Deputy for Longford.  He did that and continued to work for the people in Longford.  That highlights his love for his native Longford and he remains the last Deputy from Longford to have represented that constituency here in Dublin.</p>  <p>  He will be long remembered as a great character, a people person and somebody who both loved and was loved by the people of Longford.  As a constituency colleague he had something we should all value, although perhaps it is not as prevalent today as it was in his time.  His word was his bond and that is very important to me.  There have been famous battles in Longford and Westmeath over borders.  Peter knew his borders in Abbeyshrule, Lisryan and Edgeworthstown.  He never went beyond Tang bridge, which separates Ballymahon from Tang, so he did not cause another battle of Tang bridge, which happened in olden times.  He was a man of his word and a loyal person, even to colleagues of different parties.  We all enjoyed his company and his tie was a great asset; it replaced a microphone when the Elvis impersonation was required.</p></speech>

As everybody has said, Peter was a wonderful colleague.  I served with him on the communications and energy committee and he certainly brightened every room he entered.  As colleagues have said, he had a tremendous knowledge of politics and political lore as Albert Reynolds's chief lieutenant and in his career as a councillor and Deputy.  One of his mantras was that, as politicians, we all need the odd mention in a newspaper, both locally and nationally, but it is really important not to become the story.  He used to give chapter and verse of unfortunate colleagues who had become the story.</p>  <p>  He used to do a famous canvass on Christmas Eve down the main street in Longford with carol singers to raise funds.  He would always give us an interesting account of the people he met.  It is interesting as this year we will all probably be canvassing to some extent over the Christmas holidays.  We can appreciate Peter's achievements in that regard.  He was a fantastic colleague and a highly valued Member of the Oireachtas.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

He was first elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann from Longford-Roscommon in the 2002 general election.  When I came here in 2007 I gained no greater friend than Peter.  I also gained his advice and counsel, as well as his laughter and fun.  He regaled us with many stories about his trips to London and New York in dealing with Longford Irish associations.  He loved his family but his native Longford was also a great love.  I was present in the parliamentary party room on the evening he mentioned the story about promotion that Deputy Penrose described and people fell around with laughter.  He could turn the most tense occasions into something funny or joyous.  He was a true character.</p>  <p>  He was a dedicated businessman as a publican and undertaker.  He was an astute politician and I served with him on the communications committee as well.  He was always in good form.  I had the benefit of his hospitality in Dublin once or twice when we could not get accommodation.  Peter looked after many of us.  I express our deepest sympathies to his wife, Maura, and the family here today.  I know how much they will miss him.  We all miss his wit and enthusiasm.  He demonstrated great political prowess, having been the late Albert Reynolds's right-hand man.  He had many stories about that as well.  He was a true Gael and Longford man, a true family man and a great politician.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

Politics is a noble profession when practised morally and ethically.  Those of us who practise the profession can make a positive contribution to society.  Peter Kelly loved being a politician, not for the honour and glory but because he loved working for his community.  He loved working for his beloved Longford and for her people.  Throughout his career, whether at local or national level, he made a major and positive contribution to the town of Longford and the county of Longford and to so many people who live in the constituency.</p>  <p>  Politics can be an emotive and competitive profession.  I got to know Peter as part of a three-candidate strategy in the 2011 general election.  Let us just say we were not at our best.  There was a real fear that we might not get a seat at all in Longford-Westmeath.  I have to say that throughout that election he ran such a fair and honest campaign.  On not being re-elected he held no ill feeling towards me.  On the day I came to sign in to Leinster House, Peter Kelly was in the Clerk of the D&aacute;il's office thanking the staff for the courtesy they had shown him for the previous nine years.  He offered to stand in for a photograph with me.  On the wall was an outbox and an inbox for the post.  Peter suggested that he should point to the outbox and that I should point to the inbox.</p>  <p>  His loyalty to the party was evident in that general election and subsequently because he offered me his constituency office to hold my clinics.  Even on days when I could not hold my clinics in Longford, he would offer to sit in and meet constituents on my behalf.  He would frequently ring me about what was going on in Longford.  As previous speakers said, he loved Longford, in particular, Longford GAA, Longford Town Football Club, Longford Rugby Club, and the Longford associations.  He would be immensely proud of the large turnout of people from Longford who are in the Gallery today.  In particular, I see Pauline, his secretary, who was so loyal to him throughout the years.  I have no doubt that if Peter was around today, he would be out canvassing for Joe Flaherty, who is in the Gallery, because he saw in Joe some of himself, someone who, like him, had a real passion for Longford.</p>  <p>  He was a very popular man.  He was highly respected and loved by many.  He had an enviable way with people because he would always stop and listen.  He always had an interest in what the person he was with was saying.  Regardless of whether he was dealing with the Taoiseach or some constituent who was down on his luck, Peter Kelly was the same.  He was great company.  Wherever I go, whether to the Council of Europe or any part of Ireland, and say that I represent Longford-Westmeath, I am asked whether I knew Peter Kelly.  People always say he was great company, warm and engaging.  They say he always made people feel good about themselves.</p>  <p>  While Longford, public service and Fianna F&aacute;il were all dear to Peter Kelly's heart, he was immensely proud of his family.  When he dropped me a note with a constituent representation he would always finish off by saying that Maura sent her regards.  When I was in the office with him meeting constituents, he was always immensely proud of how well his three children were doing in their respective fields.  Today, we are joined by Maura, Emily, Peter - I know Joseph cannot be with us - and some of his siblings.  To them I offer a heartfelt sympathy.  He was a man of great faith and a man who believed in the next world.  I have no doubt he is in the next world entertaining and engaging.  When we meet him again, he will have many a good story to tell us.  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>

I welcome the Kelly family here today.  I wish to pay tribute to Peter Kelly, Longford, Ireland, as he introduced himself to me back in the day.  I got to know him through Emily and Peter, as they studied pharmacy with me in the early noughties.  The issue that emerged was how we would get home to vote so that I could cancel out a Fianna F&aacute;il vote.  The UK examinations did not fall in with the electoral cycle here.</p>  <p>  Peter Kelly, as everyone has said, loved Longford and his family.  He was so proud of his children and always so respectful of Maura Kelly.  In the Kelly home, I always felt that I was welcome and that I was being listened to.  As Deputy Troy said, he had the skill of being equally engaged with whomever he met, whether young or old, rich or poor, man or woman.  To Peter it was all research and development.</p>  <p>  Over the years we sat and talked politics at gatherings.  He told me stories that were essentially framed to teach me a few lessons.  Peter knew there was no converting me to Fianna F&aacute;il but he did hold a deep respect for anyone who wanted to serve the public.</p>  <p>  Peter Kelly was perhaps one of the funniest people I have ever met.  The stories are infamous.  He handed out undertaker business cards during a period of turbulence on a flight.  He managed to dampen people's fears while getting his name out there.  Each story was the stuff of urban myth but was actually carried out by Peter Kelly.  He made us laugh more than his quota and when we thought we could not laugh anymore, he landed a supplementary punchline.  His children learned early to be resilient on account of some of the stuff he did.  On one occasion a body needed to be removed from the airport mortuary.  Emily needed to get to the airport to get back to Brighton.  Peter saw this as killing two birds with the one stone, so Emily was placed in the passenger seat with her rucksack behind in the empty hearse.  They went up to Dublin Airport and he deposited Emily with great grace at the front door.  He opened the boot with drama, took out the rucksack and openly wondered what all the drama was about and why she would be embarrassed since she was lucky to get a lift to Dublin rather than have to get the bus.</p>  <p>  Peter was a real politician, a man who spent time with the people and who relayed their messages.  He loved people and engaging with people.  He loved life and lived it to the hilt.  He got to meet all of his beautiful grandchildren and share in family events that he treasured so much in his final years.  He had beside him, or, if not beside him, then not too far away, the woman who is Maura Kelly or "The Oracle", as we all referred to her as back in the day.  Maura kept the show on the road.  She knew when enough was enough after a late night.  She held everything together at home while Peter did what Peter was best at.  No one will ever forget Peter Kelly and he forgot no one he met.  We will never see the like of him again in Ireland.</p></speech>

This D&aacute;il unanimously agreed that there would be a public inquiry and a scoping inquiry was announced by the Minister for Justice and Equality last February.  He was very clear that Mr. Justice Haughton would be independent and would remain independent in the course of his inquiry, and that no restrictions would be placed on him or on his observations, deliberations and submissions.  This was genuinely accepted and he produced a set of terms of reference for a commission of investigation.  However, it seems that the Department of Justice and Equality subsequently changed the terms of reference and narrowed them, which has caused a lot of distress.  I ask the Government and the Minister to respond to this and to end the torture the family is going through, by doing what people want to be done.</p></speech>

There has been a GSOC investigation into the case and the independent review mechanism, IRM, believed there should not be a further investigation.  However, subsequent to that, the D&aacute;il passed a motion which led to Mr. Justice Haughton's review.  I am told that he met several times with the O'Farrell family to discuss the terms of reference and to seek their views.  Following this engagement with the family, the Minister for Justice and Equality received a proposal for some changes in the terms of reference for the scoping exercise.  This necessitated further consultation with the Attorney General.  Subsequent legal advices have been provided, which, in particular, emphasised the requirement to abide by the jurisprudence set down in the Shatter <i>v</i>.<i></i>Guerin judgment.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate the importance of ensuring scoping exercises are framed and conducted in accordance with that judgment, which requires due process and fair hearing for all involved.  The terms of reference are now being finalised and the Department wrote to the judge on 23 September to ask him to begin the scoping exercise and to make an initial report to the Minister by mid-November.  We regret the time it has taken but Deputies will be aware of the new legal landscape within which all of us in this House must operate on foot of the Shatter <i>v</i>. Guerin judgment.  Mr. Justice Haughton is free to make any recommendations he sees fit, including the establishment of any of the various forms of statutory or non-statutory inquiry, including a commission of investigation.</p></speech>

There were a number of Government proposals to address the issue of overspend in capital projects and a number of Private Members' Bills are on, or waiting to go to, Second Stage.  I ask the Taoiseach to sit down with some Opposition Members who have such Bills.  I have one myself, namely, the Regulation of Tenderers Bill 2019.  Can we move the issue forward to ensure we are never again in a situation where we face massive overruns in capital projects?</p></speech>

It is 20 years since a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government sold off the Telecom &Eacute;ireann network, which we now all agree was a mistake.  It still has consequences today because the State, through the NBP, will now have to pay to lease the existing infrastructure of ducts and poles which we once owned as a people.  The Government, following in Fianna F&aacute;il's footsteps, is going to pay &euro;3 billion to a private investment fund, headed by Granahan McCourt, for a broadband network the taxpayer will never own, despite a formal resolution sponsored by my party and overwhelmingly carried in this House only a short couple of weeks ago.</p>  <p>  We have also learned that the same preferred bidder, Granahan McCourt, is also bidding for Northern Ireland's Project Stratum at an expected cost of &euro;1,900 per home.  The Government is planning to sign off on a deal that will cost &euro;5,000 per home in this jurisdiction while the same product, by the same bidder and on the same island, will cost &euro;1,900 in Northern Ireland.  How did the Government manage to preside over a contract negotiation that has allowed the same company to provide the same product at less than half the price in Derry than in Donegal?</p></speech>

We have entered into a 25-year contract to design, build and operate this service, which will cost &euro;2.1 billion, plus a contingency of &euro;480 million and a VAT payment which will be recouped by the State.

Is the Government considering any laws to prevent a recurrence of this problem?  The Taoiseach is familiar with Pelletstown Educate Together national school in the Ashtown-Rathborne area, which is awaiting a new school but has now been told that it will be delayed.  The temporary premises on which the school is currently located are owned by a developer, and the lease is up in June 2020.  It has already been extended and the school has been told by the developer that there will be no further extensions to the lease.  Will the school community be evicted from this location?  What is the status of the permanent site and what is going on with the Department and the developer?  A public meeting will be held next Wednesday, 13 November.  I have been trying to get an answer from the Minister for Education and Skills about this for two weeks, but I have not heard back from him.

We are hopeful of coming to a resolution as soon as possible.  The new school will be built but has been delayed by roughly a year for various reasons.  We want to make sure the school can stay on its current site until the new school is ready.  We do not want the children attending the school to be shipped or bused elsewhere for a year.

In that context, I raise an issue close to my own area in Ardfinnan, where there are problems with a damaged bridge.  The bridge has now been repaired, but an application for a footbridge has been made in the interest of health and safety.  Many other projects have been proposed as well, but the national children's hospital is draining money from every other project.  I ask the Minister to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport whether funding can be provided for this project under some other programme, for health and safety reasons.  This bridge is used by many people from Ardfinnan and its huge hinterland.  Traffic lights and a one-way system have been in place there for the last three years, causing congestion for schools and businesses.  Above all, it is more dangerous now than it ever was before.</p></speech>

This began in July 2018 when a drug dealer was shot and survived.  A man was subsequently murdered in Clogherhead in August, and another man was recently shot dead in a lovely quiet cul-de-sac in Bettystown.  The Garda and I suspect that these gangs are becoming more experienced and are not afraid of anyone in the area.  I welcome the additional Garda resources given to Drogheda.  The Garda knows what is going on, but it does not have the resources to deal with it.  I beg the Taoiseach to address this before it gets out of hand.  People around Drogheda, Bettystown and Clogherhead are very concerned about what is happening.  The Taoiseach has it in his gift to nip this in the bud once and for all before it becomes more serious.  I am asking him, on behalf of the people of Louth and east Meath, to give more resources to the Garda in the area.</p></speech>

Additional resources have been provided by the Garda Commissioner, and it is up to him to decide whether additional resources can be provided in the next few weeks.  However, next year's budget for the Garda is being increased substantially to &euro;1.88 billion.  It is right and appropriate that the Garda Commissioner, rather than politicians, should decide how best to deploy those resources.</p></speech>

The farming community has no issue with that, but it does have an issue with the fact that farmers have to submit their applications before 15 May.  They have a few days to sort out their applications and if they go over that, they are penalised.  The areas of national constraint, ANC, payments started on 17 September and the basic payment scheme, BPS, started on 16 October.  It has now been six months since the applications were submitted and they have not been paid.</p> <p>Some farmers have not yet received a shilling.  This has been the worst year.  Farming is in crisis.  Farm incomes are on the floor.  Why not pay the 85% of the ANC and 75% of BPS to farmers now?  They need it and are desperate for it.  That would leave 15% of ANC and 30% of BPS.  There are very few issues, but if any remain after the checks are over the money can be deducted from the remaining 15% and 30%.  Farmers need money to pay contractors and their families need money for Christmas.</p></speech>

I have been in that position down through the years and I appreciate it is a problem.  We are trying to get through the list as quickly as possible.

The Brexit chaos and the demographic and political changes of recent years in the North have accelerated the conversation on the merits of unity.  Earlier this week, Ireland's Future wrote to the Taoiseach to ask him to plan for the future.  That is the core message of the letter signed by more than 1,000 citizens from civic society, including relatives of the 1916 leaders.  The signatories are proposing the establishment of a citizens' assembly, reflecting the view of citizens, North and South, or a forum to discuss the future and achieve maximum consensus on the way forward.  Does the Taoiseach accept that it is the responsibility of the Government to plan for the future?  Will he consult on this?</p></speech>

The one on gender equality is about to start and the next will be on local government in Dublin.  At this stage, I have had at least ten or 15 requests for citizens' assemblies of some sort.  We can only have one at a time, but, notwithstanding that, it is something to which I will give some consideration.

Building work was to commence in September and be completed by summer 2021.  Today the site is surrounded by hoardings and there is no sign of any new work.  It is an eyesore on the main street of Bailieborough.  This is coupled with what happened in Emyvale in north Monaghan, where the Garda station was burned to the ground last month.  In addition, the Cavan-Monaghan Garda division will lose ten patrol cars for policing in the Border area.  The Taoiseach knows that public confidence in security in the Border region is fragile.  Can he reassure me and my constituents today that the Garda station he promised will be delivered, that Emyvale will get a new station and that garda&iacute; will not be left without ten patrol cars within weeks?</p></speech>

Yesterday, 41 people were on trolleys in South Tipperary General Hospital.  Given the size of the hospital and the population it serves, that has to be a record.  The long-promised modular unit in Clonmel is still lying idle because of a failure to recruit staff.  Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel is lying idle just 12 or 13 miles away.  Nenagh General Hospital is being underutilised and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is in crisis.  The people of Tipperary are fed up with the lack of service and people are dying because of that in the county.  We want improvements.</p></speech>

Almost four years on, the health service has deteriorated at an alarming rate under the Government's watch.  The numbers of people waiting on trolleys on a daily basis is a national scandal.  A total of 649 people are on trolleys today, with Cork being the worst where 93 people have been waiting on trolleys.  There were 65 patients are on trolleys in Cork University Hospital, CUH; 23 in  the Mercy University Hospital; and five waiting for beds in Bantry General Hospital.  Two weeks ago I spent a week fighting for a prominent man in Limerick to get a bad.  He was left on a trolley for a week in University Hospital Limerick.  What steps is the Government going to take?  We are not yet in the thick of the winter.  What is the Government going to do to address this appalling situation?</p></speech>

Perhaps that was before the Deputy came to the Chamber.  We are doing a number of things.  First, we are increasing the number of beds across the country, including in Clonmel and Limerick.  Since 2014, we have been adding more beds to the hospital system.  Deputies will recall that when Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party were in power during the boom, they took a policy decision to take thousands of beds out of our hospitals.  As soon as we had the money to start reversing that, we did so and have been doing so from 2014 onwards.</p>  <p>  We are also providing more funding for the fair deal scheme and home help because hundreds of people could be in nursing homes or at home with adequate supports rather than in hospital.  We increased funding for those schemes significantly in budget 2020.  We also secured an agreement with GPs to increase the scope of the services they provide in the community so that people with chronic diseases such as COPD and diabetes can be better looked after in the community and not need to go into hospital in the first place.  Obviously that contract was signed a few months ago and it will be a while before the new services are up and running.</p></speech>

When he was Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton heard me speak about the school, which has been waiting longer for a new building than any other school in the country; it has waited for 20 years.  There have been many blips along the way.  The current Minister for Education and Skills visited the school on 2 October to see the situation for himself.  The school population has doubled in the past ten years.  There are two toilets for 207 boys.  It is a very good mixed school and the staff and principal are excellent, but the facilities are shocking.  On 2 October, the Minister gave a commitment that the lease for the new school building would be signed within the next two or, at the most, three weeks.  More than a month later, we have heard nothing.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to have an answer in front of him, but I would appreciate it if he would ask the Minister's office to contact me today to let me know whether there is an update.</p></speech>

Serious concerns were raised and shock was expressed about the fact that Garda funding for ongoing operations to tackle this feud ran out last Monday.  The Garda budget for Drogheda is gone at the height of a feud.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made inroads but without the continuation of this funding and the specialised units, not only is this feud set to escalate - there has only been a lull because of the presence of the specialised units and the extra resources there at the moment - all of the work that has been done will have been for nothing.  The Taoiseach does not need me to outline for him the ramifications of that if we do not secure further funding.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is lodging an application for the continuation of funding this week as a matter of urgency.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to meet with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the continuation of this funding is secured as a matter of urgency?  In a previous response, the Taoiseach said that it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner but we are at the height of a feud and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not even have to go looking for it again.  It should be there.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to do that before more people are killed?</p></speech>

That is, of course, in part connected to the additional resources provided for the area.  The budget allocated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for next year is &euro;1.88 billion, which is the highest ever budget, so An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never been as well resourced as it is now.

Obviously, chapters 5 and 6, which relate to health and mental health, respectively, are also relevant.  Is the Taoiseach aware that, under his Government, the HSE is applying charges to free travel pass holders with disabilities and elderly and ill people with free travel passes in respect of accessing important day services that are vital for them and their treatment and care?  This charge has been applied despite the fact that these people depend on very modest social supports and incomes.  This charge is being applied throughout the country.  Will the Taoiseach commit to reversing this discriminatory and unfair charge?  When will he do so and will the Government reimburse the disabled, elderly and ill people who are entitled to and hold free travel passes who are being charged this unfair amount?</p></speech>

To date, nothing has happened even though there was a recommendation by the Labour Court in 2008 to the effect that community employment scheme supervisors should have an occupational pension scheme.  This Government has completely ignored their request and the recommendation by the Labour Court.  I am asking that either the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform meet with the supervisors to try to thrash this out once and for all.  I am constantly being contacted by community employment scheme supervisors in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  These people play a very important role in getting young people in particular back into the labour force.

One can only suspect that he is reluctant to answer questions without a prepared script.  Since the decision by the Supreme Court over 18 months whereby asylum seekers are allowed to work, I have continuously raised with the Minister the need to extend eligibility to apply to a driving licence to asylum seekers.  He has promised that the matter is under consideration and that his Department is working with the Minister for Justice and Equality to deliver it.  In the 18 months since the Supreme Court decision, no progress has been made.  This is at a time when we should be welcoming these people into our country and ensuring that they are facilitated by every means to integrate with society.  What better way to do this than by affording people the right to drive and go to work?  Will the Taoiseach take a personal interest in this and talk to the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality in order to ensure that this legislation receives priority so that people who want to make a contribution to make to society and who are being prevented from doing so on foot of where they live will be able to apply for driving licences?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600022#U01600"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit the sale or supply of electronic cigarettes or herbal cigarettes to persons under 18 years of age and for that purpose to provide for offences, proceedings and authorised officers and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Public Health (Electronic Cigarettes and Herbal Cigarettes) Bill 2019.  As we work to move towards a tobaccoless society, we must also act to ensure our younger citizens are not attracted to smoking of any kind and are not introduced to it through other products.  As we know, nicotine is an addictive substance and many vaping or e-cigarette products contain nicotine.  Ensuring that our younger citizens are not attracted to such products or herbal cigarettes that do not ordinarily include nicotine must be of the utmost importance, particularly in the context of ensuring that such products do not act as a gateway to tobacco-based products.</p><p>This Bill would address several issues.  Section 1 provides the definitions for the Bill and follows those definitions used in Directive 2014/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on 3 April 2014.  Section 2 of this legislation would make it an offence to sell e-cigarettes, refill containers or herbal cigarettes or to supply or invite to purchase such a product to a person under 18 years of age.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill propose to provide penalties for an offence under this legislation in line with those provided for tobacco by sections 5 and 6 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 and are cognisant of the Fines Act 2010.  Section 5 of the Bill relates to &quot;the functions of authorised officers&quot;, that is, the HSE, extending the application of section 45 of the Public Health Act of 2002 to enable it to act in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.</p><p>The Bill would address an aspect of our laws that we have, to date, failed to adequately tackle.  The fact is that recitals of the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products have recommended that an age limit be imposed on the sale or supply of such products.  However, this is left as a matter for member states to address in domestic legislation.  While we have banned the sale of tobacco products to those under the age of 18, we have not yet taken such action regarding the supply or sale of related products.  This Bill will work to prohibit the sale of electronic cigarettes, refill containers and herbal cigarettes to people under 18 years of age and fill a void that currently exists within our domestic law.</p><p>I am quite cognisant of the fact that the Minister for Health has obtained approval for a draft scheme of a Bill that covers many of the same aspects as my Bill.  However, in this regard, I ask the Government to consider the fact that my Bill is ready and that the likelihood of the Minister's Bill being subject to the EU's transparency directive is quite high.  The transparency directive, where a Bill is subject, requires member states to notify the Commission of technical regulations in draft and then wait for a standstill period of at least three months before adopting those regulations.</p> <p>The Bill I have brought forward, which proposes to prohibit the sale of e-cigarette and herbal cigarette products to those aged under 18, would not, I argue, be subject to the transparency directive.  However, from reading the heads of the Minister's Bill, I believe it may be subject to the directive.  In practice, that would mean that my Bill to ban the sale of these products to minors could be enacted, while the Minister's Bill, when brought forward, would have to wait some months.  That would not just encompass the drafting period but also the standstill period.  I must ask the Government to give serious consideration to enacting this Bill.  I ask it to do so with a view to implementing the outstanding aspects of the draft scheme published by the Minister last week by way of amending legislation in an effort to deter children from taking up the habit in the short term.  We are all working towards the same goal.  The sooner we ban the sale of such products to children and introduce the appropriate penalties for doing so, the sooner we can deter children from taking up smoking.  That is in all of our interests.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We subsequently spoke by phone on 7 August regarding political developments in the United Kingdom, including Scotland, and also Brexit developments.  Prior to that, I met the First Minister over lunch in Farmleigh on Monday, 27 May last.  We discussed mutual challenges and considered how best to maintain and further develop the strong bilateral relations between Ireland and Scotland.  We also discussed the latest political developments in the wake of the recent European Parliament and local elections, as well as Brexit developments.  We acknowledged the strength of bilateral relations between Ireland and Scotland and committed to working to maintain and deepen them.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Ms Fiona Hyslop, have just announced a joint review of bilateral relations for the next five years.  The joint review will cover government-to-government work and will also look beyond government to the areas of business and economy, community and diaspora, academic and research links, culture, and rural, coastal and island communities.  We want to learn from the best in each country and empower those who can bring our relationship to a new level.  I look forward to greeting First Minister Sturgeon again at the British-Irish Council meeting, which I will host in Dublin next week.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600023#V01300"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  First Minister Sturgeon has always been clear that, since Scotland voted 62% to remain within the European Union, she and her party are determined to do everything possible to maintain that position.  I refer in particular to ensuring that Scotland remains within the customs union and Single Market.  The First Minister has also spoken repeatedly about the serious implications for Scotland if Northern Ireland were to stay in the Single Market and Scotland did not.  She has also spoken about the close ties between our countries.</p>  <p>  It is also interesting that the Scottish National Party, SNP, gained three Members of the European Parliament, MEPs, with a Remain stance when so many Brexiteers were elected in England.  A general election is on the way in the UK and the Government cannot take sides, although there have been leaks that the Government is hoping that a Tory victory emerges.  We should keep in mind that many forces contesting the UK election are supportive of Remain.  Have there been bilateral meetings between officials from each Government?  Notwithstanding the review that has just been announced, will additional staff be deployed to the Consulate General of Ireland in Scotland?</p>  <p>  Regarding the Brexit situation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's agreement is a harsher one for the Republic of Ireland than was Prime Minister May's proposition.  That aspect has not been given the profile or discussion it merits and it is potentially very serious for us down the road in respect of Britain staying out of the customs union and Single Market.  That seems to be where Prime Minister Johnson wants to go.  The SNP, the Liberal Democrats, the British Labour Party and others, however, want to stay in the customs union, or as close as possible to it, and within the Single Market.  The impact of this UK election will be critical to Ireland, as will the volatility at the end of January and what may happen as a result of the election.</p>  <p>  We cannot comment on the various strategies but maintaining a seamless common travel area is still very important in the years ahead, as are reciprocal rights in health, education and social protection.  I welcome the review that has been announced.  At this stage, however, we probably need to increase the resources we devote to enhancing the relationship between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.  I also believe that the Taoiseach is supportive of Prime Minister Johnson's idea of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Has the Taoiseach spoken to the First Minister and-or Prime Minister Johnson about this proposal?  Is this a serious suggestion or was it just one of these top of the hat comments that the Taoiseach is capable of articulating now and again? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600023#V01400"><p>The Taoiseach stated earlier that he was wary of commentary because an election is under way in the United Kingdom.  We need some reflection here, however.  During the election campaign already under way, the First Minister of Scotland has indicated that it will remain an important priority for her to have a second independence referendum for Scotland.  There is real potential that might form part of the next programme for government in the United Kingdom, if the SNP is supporting the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats, or some combination of such parties, in a future British Government.</p>  <p>  We have to think about our future as well.  I listened very carefully to the Taoiseach's answer to a previous question regarding the future structure of the island of Ireland.  More than two years ago, I raised the idea that in calm times - and not now in the midst of an election in the next four weeks - we need to start scoping out the prospect of some mechanism for a revisitation of the New Ireland Forum or a Citizens' Assembly.  The Taoiseach ruled that out as if it was one issue in a queue of issues.  I do not think that this is simply one issue in a queue of ten issues.  The future of the island of Ireland, how we envisage that and how we make it an acceptable home for all of the people on the island of Ireland is something that we need to scope out now.  We must not leave it until we are faced with a Border poll for which there has not been proper preparation.  If any lessons are to be learned from Brexit, it is that if we are to make any definitive constitutional decisions, an enormous amount of advance preparation needs to be done.  The Taoiseach speculated previously that there was some merit in having a Citizens' Assembly on this matter.  We should at least sit down, as leaders of the political parties in this D&aacute;il, to think and discuss out loud among ourselves how these issues might be addressed in the coming months and years.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600023#V01500"><p>In a similar vein, the Taoiseach may be aware that there was a massive rally in Glasgow last Saturday.  Tens of thousands of people took to the streets demanding Scottish independence and supporting a call for a second referendum.  Contrary to some of the political commentary we hear when Deputies on this side of the Chamber ask for similar debates on Irish unity, the sky has not fallen in over in Scotland.  Now is time to start a conversation here.  The upcoming general election in the UK is being used by supporters of Scottish independence as a platform to campaign for independence.  That is not being done in just an abstract way.  Independence is being viewed in the context of new opportunities that Scotland may enjoy in the new political landscape following Brexit.  We are not yet 100% sure what shape that will take.  We do not know what is going to happen in the next couple of months concerning the delay.  I echo Deputy Howlin's call.  We need to start having this conversation.  That conversation is already happening and it is longer an issue of green and orange.</p> <p>This is about respecting all cultures and traditions within the island, doing what is best for us as an island, and not doing what is best for one culture or tradition over another.  We are all in this together and we all need to move forward.  We cannot be afraid to have that debate.  The sooner we have those types of debates and the sooner we are more open and transparent about where this country is going, the better.  As an Irish republican, I want to see a united Ireland.  There are other people on this island who do not wish to see that but that does not mean that we should shy away from having those conversations.  It is critical we have those conversations.  I urge the Taoiseach to start having those conversations with us because, as with many political issues in recent years, the public is way ahead of where this institution is in relation to those debates, and rather than us giving leadership, we will end up being behind the curve regarding the people's wishes.  I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on that.</p></speech>

I reassure them that the Government will not take sides in the UK general election.  While individual parties might support other individual parties, as a Government, we certainly will not have any role or involvement in the UK election.</p>  <p>  If there is a conservative win, I would expect the withdrawal agreement to be ratified quickly, allowing us to move swiftly on to talks about the future relationship.  Everything is still to play for in terms of the future relationship, particularly because of the joint political declaration talks about tariff-free, quota-free trade between the UK and the rest of the EU, including Ireland, with a level playing field, and that is precisely what I want us to achieve.  If there is a different government, a remain-leaning government comprising Labour, the Liberal Democrats and SNP, which wants to reopen the issue of a customs union, we would be happy to talk to them about that and, indeed, would welcome it.  I only hope that whatever happens, it is a clear result because what we had for the past couple of years was a finely balanced hung parliament that ultimately could not approve anything.</p></speech>

We have just reopened the Cardiff consulate and I am glad that we were able to do that.  We are also examining the possibility of opening a new consulate in the north of England, perhaps in Liverpool or Manchester, because we are aware that we need to think ahead to what the future relationship will look like after the UK leaves the EU and how we can continue to maintain strong relations with our nearest neighbour.  Part of that might involve expanding our presence in the north of England as well as deepening our presence in the existing consulates, and seeing if we can use the mechanisms within the Good Friday Agreement, such as the British-Irish Council and the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, as vehicles through which we can have deeper bilateral contacts with the UK Government and with the devolved administrations on the islands.</p>  <p>  Regarding the idea of a bridge between Ireland and Scotland, it is something I spoke about with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson.  He specifically raised it with me when we met on the Wirral.  I have not spoken about it with the First Minister of Scotland, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, but I may have the chance to mention it to her next week.  Frankly, I do not know if it is feasible.  I am aware of the issues that pertain, in particular, to Beaufort's Dyke, but it should not be dismissed or ruled out of hand.  Some people dismissed the idea of building a tunnel under the channel between France and England as science fiction.  In fact, it was science fiction for a period of time but it is, of course, now a reality.  I am aware of 100 km long bridges being built in China, the bridge between Denmark and Sweden, and the bridges in Louisiana, which Members will have seen.  Certainly, the distance is doable in engineering terms.  Whether the depth is, I do not know.</p></speech>

There are lots of suggestions that have merit for a future citizens' assembly and they should not be dismissed.</p>  <p>  Regarding this particular proposal, I would only say that the timing is important.  There are elections under way in the United Kingdom and north of the Border and we need to be sensitive about that.  Brexit is also unresolved.  I am keen that we do not constitutionalise the issue of Brexit.  There are many unionists north of the Border who feel that the withdrawal agreement undermines the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK.  I reassure them that that is not the case and that Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of the UK unless and until such time as the majority of people there decide otherwise in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, and I would not like to do anything that might cause people not to trust us on that.  We need to be careful in our guardianship of the agreement.  As somebody I admire immensely who Members will know, Ms Pat Hume, the wife of Mr. John Hume, always says, the Good Friday Agreement is the long-term solution.  It is not an interim solution.  We need to have regard to the fact that if people start to talk and consider and entertain the idea that the agreement might be replaced by something else, those who do not like it at all may misuse that opportunity to undermine the agreement.</p></speech>

The video the Taoiseach issued implied that Fianna F&aacute;il policies are now few and far between.  It reminded me of the type of American-style attack advertisements that are now too frequent.  It raises a serious point - the influence of social media and how it is used by politicians in the State, and particularly the rising influence of the far right and external forces in elections.  We need strong and enforceable legislation on ongoing political advertising of any sort to ensure our democracy is neither for sale or open to external interference.  We have long talked about the requirement to put a statutory electoral commission in place.  When will we have that?  Many of us thought that we would be in a general election here by now.</p> <p>It is certainly likely that there will be a general election within the next six months.  Everybody in this House would want a level playing field for that election.  I have two direct questions for the Taoiseach.  When does he envisage that the electoral commission will be established on a statutory basis in order to allow it to be the determiner of fair play in future elections?  How will he ensure that external influences will not impact on our electoral system in the forthcoming election?</p></speech>

The failure to progress the electoral commission, which was agreed as part of our D&aacute;il reform programme at the commencement of this Oireachtas, and had been agreed in a previous Government programme dating back to 2012 - and even before that - is extraordinary because it is key to ensuring that we safeguard our democracy, political and election campaigns and referenda.  We need a comprehensive statutory based electoral commission to make sure our elections are run properly, effectively and professionally.  That goes from registers to the social media impact.</p><p>It is important that the role of the Civil Service is never politicised.  That has been one of the great strengths of this country since the foundation of the State.  The introduction of the strategic communications unit tried to change that and, thankfully, through pressure from the Oireachtas, the position was reversed.</p><p>Has the financial allocation to the GIS changed during the past three years?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the work of the GIS is impartial?  Can he outline the reporting relationships within the GIS?  Is there a close working relationship between his political staff and staff of the service?  Have any external public relations firms advised the GIS on any aspect of its work?  Is it involved in promoting Government campaigns such as the Be Winter Ready campaign?  Do the same staff manage the <i>MerrionStreet.ie</i>website?  The Taoiseach might answer those specific questions as it is important we be vigilant in this regard.</p><p>I certainly support Deputy Howlin in the context of what he said about the impact of social media, political advertising on social media platforms and the external forces impacting on elections.  It is extraordinary that a report on Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum is being withheld.  That shows what is going on out there.  I am not sure if there is any clear articulation, clarification or a substantive report into what is happening in Ireland in terms of utilisation of social media by external bodies that may want to influence the direction of policy within the country.</p></speech>

He emphasised that this requirement stems from a need to ensure transparency and clarity for all citizens around what the Government is doing.  He also stated that the central objective of these channels of communication is to report the work of Government objectively.  What mechanisms are in place to ensure that transparency and objectivity is achieved?  In practical terms, how does the GIS measure those objectives?  What reporting mechanisms are in place for senior civil servants?  Does it include a periodic review process?  An issue that is becoming more prevalent is that of fact checkers, who have become very popular in the communications sphere.  Is this a process the GIS includes in its work?  If not, is it something the Taoiseach would consider would be included?  Has the Government ever employed an independent organisation to review the work and the organisational goals of the GIS?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has a lot of expertise and an interest in social media.  He also has the GIS in his Department, which is uniquely well placed to have an oversight of what is happening in terms of people being threatened.  We had the appalling attack recently on Deputy Martin Kenny, whose car was set alight in a very dangerous way outside his house, but I understand he got a tremendous amount of abuse on social media also.</p>  <p>  We want everybody to be able to participate in elections.  The trolls will not put me off running for election.  I am sure they will not put off Deputy Lisa Chambers.  However, we have just witnessed unprecedented numbers of women in a very robust UK Parliament opting not to run for election again.  I acknowledge that it is not just women who are affected.  Could the Taoiseach have conversations with parties or other Members to see if we can limit this particular evil?</p></speech>

We expect to have the heads of a Bill next year.  We are working on other legislation that will come in before that.  That was approved in principle by Government just this week.  That legislation will require transparency when it comes to political advertising online.  As we all know now, if somebody puts up a poster on a public lamp post to advertise themselves or a public meeting, it is necessary to state on that who printed it and who is responsible for it.  That is not the case online at the moment so we want to pass legislation that requires any online political advertising to be identifiable as to who commissioned it and where it came from.  That will be an important step forward and one that will be widely welcomed in the House.</p><p>I am satisfied that the GIS is impartial.  In my experience, civil servants are very careful about that and not crossing the line between working for the Department and the Government into the political sphere where they are working for a politician or a party.  I am very respectful of that division.  It is the case that all my staff have close working relationships with the civil servants in the Department.  That is as it should be.</p><p>In terms of the Be Winter Ready campaign, I honestly do not know if the GIS is involved in that.  I believe it is run by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, but I may be incorrect.  I tend not to get directly involved in any of these communication issues for reasons I think people will understand.</p><p>I reiterate that neither the GIS nor the Department of the Taoiseach have any role in respect of my social media accounts.  <i>MerrionStreet.ie</i>is a Government account but the ones under my name are mine.  Civil servants and the GIS do not have any role in that at all.</p><p>I share Deputy Burton's concerns about the number of women and men, but particularly women, who are leaving politics in the UK because they believe the climate has become toxic.  This is not just a social media issue, it is much more than that.  Much of it is related to Brexit but perhaps not just that.  I do not believe we have had that experience yet in this country but it is increasingly difficult to get people to run for election-----</p></speech>

Within my Department, staff across several divisions contribute to the work on Brexit preparedness.</p>  <p>  Brexit is an important part of the work of the international, EU and Northern Ireland division in my Department, which has 27 members of staff.  The division is headed by a second Secretary General, who also acts as the Irish Sherpa for EU business, including Brexit issues.  The division assists me in my role as a member of the European Council and in respect of Government consideration of Brexit issues, including negotiations, and also on Northern Ireland affairs and British-Irish relations.</p>  <p>  The economic division of my Department also contributes to the overall work on Brexit, to ensure the economy is well placed to avail of future opportunities and meet threats, including Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department also has a dedicated Brexit preparedness and contingency planning unit which comprises nine staff headed by a principal officer.  This unit works closely with officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to co-ordinate the whole-of-Government effort on planning, programme management and communications on Brexit preparedness.  The unit assists a Secretaries General group, which oversees ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning, and an assistant secretaries group on no-deal Brexit planning.</p>  <p>  The recent agreement between the EU and UK negotiating teams on a revised withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationship is very welcome.  This averted the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October by extending the deadline to 31 January.  However, if the agreement is ratified before then the UK can exit earlier.  The package is now subject to ratification by the British Parliament and the European Parliament, so there is still some way to go until we have absolute certainty that there will be an orderly UK withdrawal.  We are firmly of the view that this opportunity should be grasped and a deal concluded that will ensure an orderly withdrawal can take place.</p>  <p>  While the threat of no-deal Brexit has receded, it has not gone away completely.  The Government must maintain a state of readiness in its preparations should the threat re-emerge in the period ahead.  Even with the best possible agreement, it is still the case that the UK is leaving the EU and this will bring change.  It is important that Ireland is ready for that change, for our citizens and our businesses.  We will continue our preparations for all scenarios.</p></reply>

They were 31 March and 31 October.  If the Taoiseach were to be honest with the House, he would tell us that we were not prepared on either occasion.  A month before the 31 October deadline, we learned that we had to rely on temporary facilities in Rosslare Europort, for example, because permanent facilities will not be available there until 2021 at the earliest.  Likewise, we saw the dry run of Operation Purge in Dublin Port.  Should there be a queue of traffic going into the port, it is intended that the traffic will be brought into the port around a roundabout and sent back up to the motorway to park at service stations.  That is not rational or proper planning.</p>  <p>  I wish to make two points.  First, I hope we are still preparing to ensure that there are proper facilities in place in the event of a hard Brexit, which is not off the agenda.  The Taoiseach said as much in his reply.  As regards Rosslare Europort, can he give details of the proposed visit of an Irish delegation to meet French Government officials and officials from Le Havre on connecting the two ports?  That would be very welcome.  We should have vessels on standby to ensure we have such connectivity in the event of any disruption of the landbridge.</p>  <p>  Second, we are not out of the woods in respect of the potential horrendous damage Brexit could do.  It is not impossible that there will be a Nigel Farage-Boris Johnson government in place by Christmas.  If that were the case, there is no guarantee that the negotiated settlement is the one that will be put to the British Parliament.  It may well be the Nigel Farage view of a WTO agreement, in other words, no agreement or negotiation on a long-term, tariff-free trade arrangement with the European Union.  I am interested to hear the Taoiseach's view on that.  As I pointed out on the previous occasion we engaged on this, while the deal that was negotiated with Boris Johnson safeguards the essential Border issues, it is a much more detrimental deal for Ireland than the one that was done with Mrs. Theresa May in terms of long-term trade.  It moves Britain away from the alignment that Mrs. May wanted.  The difficult issues that will face us in the negotiations are either a Johnson government coming to power and reneging on the deal by the end of January or, even if the deal was ratified by the end of December, getting a trade deal that moves Britain further away from the alignment that allows seamless trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

That said, there is serious fear in Dublin about the gridlock that will occur on the M50 and in the Port Tunnel.  Currently, 10,000 lorries and 15,000 cars use the tunnel each day.  A number of suggestions have been made, such as parking at the big Dublin Airport car parks and parking on the hard shoulder on both sides of the tunnel.  Let us consider the experience on the M50 at peak hours in the mornings and evenings.  It is so congested that most people try to avoid it like the plague.  It is like a slow-moving car park.  There are endless small collisions and bumps between cars simply because people are stop-start driving.  In bad wet weather such as we have had recently, it is a nightmare.</p>  <p>  We discussed a potential resolution for this previously.  I acknowledge that much work has been done in Dublin Port, but why are Rosslare, Waterford and Cork not being prepared to take all the south of Ireland traffic?  If that could be done, it would remove significant pressure from Dublin and free up space at Dublin Port in respect of Northern Ireland hauliers who might want to use the port in the context of it being European in the future.  I realise that this is expensive.  It is absolutely crazy.  We must also have direct shipping to France and Spain.  That can be done from Cork and Rosslare.  The Taoiseach said previously that he does not believe the demand exists for it, but has he had an opportunity to review what the reality will be in the event of the UK going out of alignment in a serious way and the potential problems in ports such as Calais with traffic crossing over and back between the UK and the Continent?</p></speech>

The acuity is still present.  We know from a series of reports that businesses are still not as prepared as they should be, even though the first deadline was last March.  There are ongoing issues in that regard.  Now we are facing the third deadline on 31 January.  It is interesting that consumer confidence is still impacted by this uncertainty.  As I said earlier, even if the withdrawal Bill is passed, it will have a negative impact on the Irish economy because Boris Johnson wants to take Britain out of the customs union and the Single Market.

Notwithstanding what Mr. Johnson is saying about the political declaration, he wants to have his cake and eat it yet again if he gets elected.</p> <p> Despite all of the Brexit awareness campaigns and so on, approximately 58,000 businesses still do not have an EORI number.  That is very worrying indeed.  The latest AIB Brexit sentiment index found that, despite deep concerns about Brexit, 41% of SMEs in the Republic and 53% of SMEs in Northern Ireland still have not done any planning for it.  Some 30% of exporting and importing companies are not taking mitigating actions to address possible Brexit challenges, according to information we have received by way of reply to parliamentary questions.  It is important that we make the point that, irrespective of the type of agreement that emerges, Britain leaving the European Union will result in damage to Ireland.  It is worrying that many people are not prepared and do not seem to be apprised of the damaging impact that Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have on exports and, potentially, on services.</p> <p> It is extraordinary that the services sector has not been examined at all, particularly in respect of regulatory frameworks, regulatory alignments and the clear impulse of the Tory Party to have regulations that are different from those of Europe in certain sectors and which would not be as onerous.</p> <p> Our beef exports to the UK alone are worth &euro;1.2 billion.  That is huge.  Some 49% of our total beef exports by value go to the UK.  We know that the beef farmers were in extreme difficulty before any of this.  The uncertainty of Brexit is not good for the future of the beef industry.  Will the Taoiseach outline any short-term plans the Government has to ease the plight of beef farmers?  Will he comment on the overall points we have made with regard to preparations?</p></speech>

Regardless of what happens in respect of Brexit, whether there is a deal or not, we all agree that it will have an impact on our economy, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has said.  The severity of that impact will obviously depend on the type of deal, should a deal actually be agreed.  Regardless of whether there is a deal, the impact on our economy needs to be addressed.  I believe the Taoiseach said that there are 24 staff working on Brexit preparedness.  I may have misheard that but I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong.</p>  <p>  In their pre-budget submissions, IBEC and ICTU highlighted the economic issues, how they will have to be dealt with post Brexit and how we will have to change how we do business.  How far advanced are the practical plans in respect of tariffs, customs union issues and so on and also in respect of supports to be given to businesses?  As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, many businesses are not prepared for this.  I do not know the reason.  Perhaps people are too fixated on what is happening in the House of Commons or perhaps they are under the impression that, if we get a deal, everything will be okay and we will not have to worry.  The reality, however, is that even the best Brexit deal we can secure will negatively impact on our economy.  We need to be prepared for that.</p></speech>

We will continue our preparations for a no-deal outcome in case we end up facing into that scenario again on 31 January.  I have said it before but I want to say it again - being prepared for a no-deal outcome does not mean that there will be no disruption.  It does not mean that it will be a case of business as usual.  No matter how prepared we are, there will be disruption to our ports and transport infrastructure and to other places in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Rosslare-Le Havre route, I do not have any particular knowledge of that contact but I am glad to hear it happened.  The more links we can have between Irish ports and those in mainland Europe, the better.  With regard to Rosslare and shipping lines in general, the assessment of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is that there is sufficient unused capacity on existing shipping lines between Ireland and mainland Europe.  That was the Department's assessment.  The reason it was decided to opt for temporary facilities in Rosslare was that it would be quicker and less costly.  We still hope that we will not need permanent facilities or hard infrastructure in Rosslare because it is our ambition to negotiate a quota-free and tariff-free future relationship between the EU, including Ireland, and the UK.  Dublin is quite different because the port already receives ships from outside the EU.  A different case was made in that respect.</p>  <p>  Deputy Burton made a very good point about increasing capacity at other ports so that they could relieve the pressure on Dublin should it come under a lot of pressure as a consequence of Brexit, or even to provide a competitor to Dublin.  I believe in competition.  I like competition between State-owned enterprises.  I would like to see those ports develop in any event.  There are, in fact, very significant development plans for the Port of Cork.  I am not sure if they are under way yet as there is a legal dispute in that regard, but a very significant upgrade of the port is planned.  This is included in Project Ireland 2040.  An improvement in the road connection between Ringaskiddy and the city and motorway network is also crucial.  The same applies in respect of Shannon Foynes Port.  Only a week or two ago, we approved the progression of the Adare bypass and the Shannon Foynes road connection to the planning stage.  There are significant developments ongoing in respect of Shannon Foynes.  We are going to see better infrastructure in the ports at Foynes, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare in addition to better road connections which will allow them to compete with Dublin for business.  That will be a very good thing whether Brexit occurs or not.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin is correct in his assessment.  We are not yet out of the woods with regard to a no-deal Brexit.  If the UK election goes one way, the withdrawal agreement will be ratified and we will avoid a no-deal Brexit on 31 January.  There is a risk that it could go another way, as Deputy Howlin mentioned.  In that case, we could find that the withdrawal agreement cannot be ratified.  We cannot rule out the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on 31 January.  Even if the agreement is ratified, another potential cliff edge arises at the end of 2020, although the transition phase can be extended.  As I said earlier, however, it is all to play for.  </p>  <p>  There is no such thing as a good Brexit.  There are upsides and downsides but the downsides very much outweigh the upsides.  That is why Brexit is a bad thing.  In all scenarios there will be reduced growth and employment growth but this does not mean recession and it does not necessarily mean higher unemployment.  It is all to play for and if I have the privilege of leading the country in negotiations on the future trading relationship, my aim will be to achieve tariff-free and quota-free trade with the UK with a level playing field and the minimum number of checks so that the opportunities lost to the Irish economy can be minimised.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och d&oacute;ibh go l&eacute;ir.  It is an important issue and I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy English, is in the Chamber.  He knows County Meath well.</p>  <p>  I am very worried about the provision of social housing in County Meath.  I acknowledge there are projects ongoing, but they are very small in number.  My main concern, however, is that they are getting smaller in number over time.  When we look towards 2021 or 2022 we are running out of land in the county for direct building by Meath County Council.  We are also running out of projects that are currently in planning.  As of this month, Meath County Council has 118 houses at construction stage, 47 at tender stage, 168 at design stage and 19 coming through Part 8 developments.  While every one of those houses is important, these numbers are too low.</p>  <p>  There are also similar projects being done by approved housing bodies, although these are different in that they are not done directly through the county council.  Altogether, these projects account for 604 units, some of which have already been delivered because the figure covers the period from 2017 to 2021.  These are located in various places and large numbers of them have been bought from private developers, which can cause its own difficulties.</p>  <p>  I do not see any landbank owned by Meath County Council on the horizon.  As far as I know, the council does not have a policy or budget for buying land.  More important in the context of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government does not have a policy or budget to acquire a landbank in County Meath.  Where will houses be built in the county?  Over the decades, our predecessors, especially those from my party, were able to build large housing projects on large tracts of land.  It seems that the possibility of doing that is running out.  Many of the direct build housing projects that are up and running, either under construction, going through Part 8, out for tender or in the design stage, are filling in pockets of land that Meath County Council had in its ownership over the years.  I do not see beyond that where Meath County Council will be able to build and I do not see the plans for that.  This will require a major Government intervention.</p>  <p>  It is crazy that by the end of September, 101 couples without children and 23 households with children had been added to the homeless list in County Meath this year.  While some of the 53 children in question were placed by homeless services in rented accommodation, that is still a frightening statistic.  Every day, the Minister of State and I get emails from families who are about to suffer homelessness.  A number of reasons have been given by the county council but the main problems are the issuing of notices to quit and insecure rental.  Mortgages are not as much of a problem as rents.  So far this year, 762 new applications for social housing support have been granted in Meath.  We need much more of a vision for large-scale development in which the State can get involved.  This would also have a very positive impact on the housing market.  Rather than simply filling in small pockets of land in the county, where is the vision?  Where are we going to build houses in future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600028#GG00600"><p>I thank Deputy Byrne for bringing forward this topic for discussion and providing us with an opportunity to consider what we have achieved in recent years through Meath County Council.  I will also outline our plans for the next few years, including funding allocations.</p>  <p>  Deputy Byrne will be aware that housing is one of the Government's top priorities.  Investment in Rebuilding Ireland has been significantly increased every year.  Apart from having sites and planning permissions, the Government must have the ambition to solve and prioritise this issue, which is the case.  This year, we have funding of &euro;2.4 billion for housing and the figure will increase to &euro;2.6 billion next year.  Capital spending increased by 25% this year.  Money is being set aside to try to make this happen.  The Deputy is right that it is important to have a pipeline of projects in place in every county, especially priority counties such as Meath, to ensure this money can be spent on projects to deliver housing.  Part of my job, through the housing delivery office of my Department, is to look at the pipeline of projects that are coming through across the areas of build, acquisition, lease, housing assistance payment, HAP, and so on.  We this on a weekly and monthly basis with every local authority.  We have a very close working relationship with Meath County Council.  As a local Deputy, I naturally engage a lot with the council on its projects.  Meath County Council has been doing quite well in recent years in responding to the national drive from the Government to improve the situation around housing and put plans in place for the future.</p>  <p>  Nationally, 27,000 households will be helped with their housing needs in 2019 and more than 10,000 new social houses will be delivered.  These include more than 6,000 direct build units and leased or acquired housing.  These are 10,000 taxpayer funded houses that were not available last year.</p> <p>Meath County Council's share of that is approximately 1,100 and rightly so.</p> <p> With regard to the social housing programme in Meath, the local authority itself is responsible in the first instance for housing delivery on the ground.  I cannot tell the local authority what sites to use and the Department does not micromanage every detail.  We work with the authority on the proposals it brings forward and make an envelope of money available for projects.  We have made that very clear.  We have worked with the local authority to set targets for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and Meath has reached those targets at all stages and gone beyond them.  We have made it very clear that the funding is available from the Department to go beyond those targets to put a greater pipeline of projects in place.  In 2018, Meath County Council delivered through all of the various mechanisms more than 1,200 new solutions, of which 436 were new social houses provided through build, acquisition and lease.  That was 100 more than the target.  We funded that happily.  It is my job as Minister of State from the local area to ensure the funding is there.  Provision through HAP, RAS and so on came to 767 homes.  In total, Meath delivered 1,204 houses in 2018 and will be very close to that number in 2019 given the pipeline that is there.  Since Rebuilding Ireland commenced in 2016, over 3,400 units in total have been brought forward by Meath County Council across all the schemes.</p> <p> The ambition is there on the part of the local authority and on the part of the Department.  The targets are being reached and I understand we have to put in place the pipeline projects for 2020 and 2021.  They are there for 2019 and 2020 to match the targets but I am looking beyond that to 2021 and 2022.  We support the local authority to purchase land banks and develop more sites but we have moved on from the days of bringing forward large-scale sites to put hundreds of social houses in a single area while all the private houses are built somewhere else.  We try to develop sites with social and affordable housing and private housing together.  The projects in the pipeline that are larger include the site in Ashbourne which was previously owned by the Department of Education and Skills and there are sites in Ratoath too.  Bettystown is coming forward this year and next year and housing is being brought forward this year, hopefully, in Cortown and Oldcastle.  There are also sites in Nobber, Carlanstown, Donore, Dunshaughlin and Kells.  Many sites are being developed which will give us the supply we need for 2019.  We have been very clear with the local authority about putting in place more projects, including on its own lands.  It has a large land bank in Navan at the Farganstown site and is bringing forward proposals there.  The money was sanctioned last week and a project has gone to tender for a new road to open up those lands.  That land bank will be brought into use.  We encourage the local authority to put together more land banks and will work with it on that.</p> <p> We recognise the need for the local authority to put in place a pipeline of projects.  Meath County Council has, as a rule, responded to what is required of it over the last couple of years.  Naturally, the ambition is to go even further.  There is a great deal of private sector development in Meath also.  It is probably among the top three or four counties for private housing development and that will bring forward other options under Part V, including turn-key options.  We want to encourage and continue with that too because we recognise that there is a great deal of demand in Meath to which we want to respond.  I am confident the local authority is in a position to do so.  It needs to do so and we will certainly work with it on a weekly basis to bring more projects forward.  However, the Department cannot tell the local authority which sites in which areas it should use.  We can work with the local authority on any project it brings forward.  I will try to work with the authority to ensure we give it quick answers and respond as quickly as we can to any proposals it brings forward.  We will continue to do that.</p></speech>

I am not going to be critical of the local authority which is working with limited resources.  When the Minister of State refers to 1,200 being the total housing delivery for 2018, 767 of those units, or the vast majority, relate to HAP and RAS.  That is not sustainable social housing.  It is also a reason people are taken off the housing list.  Their housing needs are deemed to be met when they go on HAP.  While HAP, which is the old rent allowance in a new guise, is important, it is not the answer and it does not provide the stability people need.  That is the problem.  People need stability and are entitled to it.</p>  <p>  I can see the arguments behind why the Minister of State says we are not going back to building hundreds of social housing units in the one place.  They are obvious.  However, it is not an excuse for having ten here, 20 there or even the two largest projects planned for Meath of 55 units in Ashbourne and 42 in Navan.  Farganstown is listed on the current design plans.  While the social housing in various rural areas is welcome and there is demand for it and while it has to go through proper planning and so on, it is a drop in the ocean compared to what is required.  It is important that whatever social housing is provided is on bus routes, in established communities and suitable for people to live in.  We do not want people moving to areas they do not know with no public transport, which is something I have seen happen over the years.</p>  <p>  The ambition has to be much greater.  While we can see houses going up and houses being bought, I do not see that greater vision into the future.  I see a great deal of plugging of holes in terms of filling in sites the local authority already has ownership of and I see that running out.  I see a greater reliance on HAP than is there even already and a greater reliance on the purchase of houses in the private market which has the other effect on the housing market of increasing the price for everyone else.  If the local authority was building its own houses, it would actually reduce the price for everyone else as there would be more houses there.  We have it the wrong way around and are entitled to see a better vision for social housing.</p></speech>

No party in opposition has greater ambition in relation to social housing than we do in government.  We have set out a ten-year plan which brings Rebuilding Ireland forward with a commitment to deliver up to 1,200 social houses a year.  I do not see anyone else here with that ambition.  The ambition is there at national level and it is backed up by the money allocated to make it happen.  The Deputy is right that we need every local authority to match that ambition by bringing forward plans and a pipeline of projects.  As a Minister of State in the Department, I sit down with local authorities and officials on a weekly and monthly basis to see where they are going with this and what are their ambitions.  In some cases, it is 50 units, 60 units, 70 units or 90 units and it can go over 100 units.  However, bringing forward a massive site just for social housing will not happen.  The site in Navan is 28 acres and its initial phase involves fewer than 100 social houses.  However, a great many more can go on that at the right and appropriate time as determined by Meath County Council.</p>  <p>  As I said to Deputy Byrne's colleagues, we will match the ambition of Meath County Council.  The funding will be put in place to fund the housing projects it brings forward.  Whether it is ten large sites or 40 small sites is a decision for Meath County Council to bring forward through Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael county councillors working together.  Meath has responded to the initial targets set and is on track to meet them by delivering over 1,056 permanent new build homes itself.  In the short term, it uses the HAP scheme to meet people's needs today and tomorrow and it does so very well.  Deputy Byrne mentioned homeless families.  The majority of people who become homeless in Meath do so for a very temporary period.  The local authority responds quickly using all of our schemes to find those people houses and rightly so.  That is what we expect it to do.</p>  <p>  I understand what the Deputy is saying.  He wants to see what is happening in 2020 and 2021 and I share his wish.  We want to work with the local authority to fund plans for the future.  We are up for it in our Department and the money is ring-fenced to match that ambition.  Meath County Council has brought its housing waiting list down by 20% every year for the last two or three years and is well capable of doing this.  We need to continue that positive trend, build on it and bring forward many more projects while also dealing with vacant units.  An example in Kells is the &euro;10 million which has been set aside for a street of vacant houses.  Meath County Council is beginning to take on a great many initiatives and it can do more with our funding.</p></speech>

It provides 24-7 care support at a fully accessible holiday and respite centre.  It also provides nursing support.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has said one of the reasons it is pulling out of the centre is that there has been a reduction in bed night usage at the facility.  The six-year average bed-night usage at Cuisle is 4,800 per annum.  By the end of 2019, 4,380 bed nights will have been used.  The reason for the drop-off has been the lack of recruitment of staff to operate a holiday facility over weekends.</p><p>We are now being told Cuisle is not suitable because it is an institution.  However, the Irish Wheelchair Association wrote to members of Roscommon County Council in 2018 to say that its facilities resembled those of a hotel and included 34 <i>en suite</i>twin and double bedrooms, the Castle restaurant, Harry's Bar, a leisure suite and gyms.  That does not look to me like it is an institution.  Further, BDO consultants prepared a report at the time setting out a business plan for the tourism development of that facility, yet the Irish Wheelchair Association now says it is not viable.</p></speech>

The Minister of State visited the area approximately two and a half years ago and he was quite impressed with the centre.  He has been a champion for people with disabilities.  The budget for 2019 was almost &euro;40 million, which is a record amount.  Money is required and refurbishments need to be done.  That will cost &euro;1.2 million or &euro;1.3 million.  Surely this money can be found out of that &euro;40 million budget?</p>  <p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association needs to pull its horns in here.  It must respect the public representatives who were elected to represent the people and meet them when they are asked to do so.  I urge the Minister of State, who is good at his job, to clarify the information that has been provided to him by Members of the Oireachtas and to ensure that action is taken.  This is a disgraceful act.  It is not acceptable that any group should make a decision of this type without consultation.</p></speech>

Some 48 jobs in a rural area are at stake, as well as the fine facilities at the Cuisle centre.  There has been talk of the new hotel model.  Nobody is opposed to the use of different models but when one listens to them they speak of a ten year projected model.  Do they refer to a new HSE model?  Works are required but, to be fair, the Divine World Missionaries have said that there would not be a problem with a lease or trying to help financially.  We need to pause.  Solutions must be found and I ask the Minister of State to intervene in order to ensure that those jobs are saved.  This facility is the jewel in the crown in our area.  It is one of the finest facilities in the west.  We talk about the Hidden Heartlands and there is great potential in this with people working together.  Will the Minister of State talk to the head of the Irish Wheelchair Association in order to ensure that this is paused so that plans can be put in place for the benefit of everyone, especially the wheelchair users who avail of the facility.</p></speech>

This year, &euro;1.9 billion has been allocated to the HSE's disability services programme.  This is funding the provision of a wide and complex range of services and supports to people with disabilities, including the provision of home support packages and respite services, within available resources.  Respite can occur in a variety of settings for any length of time, depending on the needs of the individual, the family and available resources.  In recent years, there have been positive changes in accessibility standards in Ireland that now present a greater range of choice and options for people with disabilities seeking a holiday or respite.  Consequently, there has been a shift in best practice approaches.  This is reflected in current HSE policy - Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: A Strategy for Community Inclusion - and Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  In line with this, Irish Wheelchair Association has decided to transition its holiday service in the west to provide accessible hotel holidays into the future, and to move away from its holiday facility at Cuisle, County Roscommon.  Cuisle requires major capital development in respect of fire upgrade works estimated to be in the order of &euro;1.5million. The Irish Wheelchair Association has indicated that this level of capital funding is not available within its current resources.  Notwithstanding the requirement to ensure regulatory standards are maintained, the HSE has confirmed to Irish Wheelchair Association that this level of capital investment is not considered viable in the context of other potential alternative service options and models from which to deliver respite services.</p>  <p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association is planning to provide a wider range of choice to people with disabilities seeking to take a supported respite holiday in the west by partnering with accessible hotels.  This new and innovative service will commence in March 2020 in conjunction with the HSE.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has been operating comparable hotel holiday breaks in Kilkenny since 2018 and has received positive feedback across the board from guests.  Some 99% of guests said that they would return.  This service was also shortlisted for an Irish Healthcare Centre award in 2019.  The Irish Wheelchair Association hopes that in the coming years, its accessible hotel holiday service will expand to key destinations across the country.</p>  <p>  The move to the new holiday service will mean that the Cuisle buildings will not open in 2020.  The Irish Wheelchair Association acknowledges the contribution of staff at Cuisle for their contribution to the respite service in the west.  Where possible, the Irish Wheelchair Association will offer redeployment opportunities to staff and is engaging with local staff members and their representatives to ensure minimum impact.</p></speech>

If we were we talking about the Minister of State's constituency, the equivalent would be 1,200 job losses.  The staff have been given 20 working days notice.  That does not show that the Irish Wheelchair Association is acknowledging the contribution of the staff.  The staff have also been told by management that there are no, or very minimal opportunities, for redeployment.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State has just told the House that the Irish Wheelchair Association is suspending its respite services for five months until the new service comes into play next March.  That is totally unacceptable to the service users.  Finally, under no circumstances will we in the community will not accept the removal of equipment which was fundraised for by the local community and was funded through the Exchequer being removed from the Cuisle facility because we believe the facility has a viable future as a going concern.  We plead with the Minister of State to ensure that there is an extension of 12 months to allow us to put in place a viable alternative.</p></speech>

Let us give it a year to see if we can examine and resolve this problem.  I am using strong words but how dare the Irish Wheelchair Association carry on like this and behave in this way towards elected representatives?  Its treatment of workers has been disgraceful.  Some 45 or 46 jobs are at stake.  The treatment of the workers is outrageous.  What is wrong with this facility?  When he visited the area, the Minister of State stated that the facility is outstanding.  The decision must be reversed, at least in the short term.  Many people use this facility.  Not long ago, I received a call from Deirdre, an Irish Wheelchair Association member from Dublin, who had read about this online as did many of her friends.  This is disgraceful carry on from a body which has just received &euro;40 million, with the help of the Minister of State, over the past year.  I again ask the Minister of State to please reverse this decision, in the short term at least.</p></speech>

The Irish Wheelchair Association has already outlined that the facilities required are not there in many counties.  In general, one gives three or six months notice to staff when it is planned to close a premises.  These staff were given 28 or 29 days.  On the matter of redundancy or redeployment, the staff have been told bluntly that the chance of redeployment is minimal to none.  If the Irish Wheelchair Association ultimately wants to decide that it will not run this any more that is fine.  However, it should give us space to work on it.  To be fair, the owners of the buildings, the Divine World Missionaries, are willing to help out.  A setting of drawings is required.  It is possible to throw figures at anything and say something will cost &euro;1.5 million or pluck them out of the sky, but let us see.  The community, along with the Divine World Missionaries, Government help and the Irish Wheelchair Association must be given the space required to help immediately.</p></speech>

I will convey their views and concerns to the HSE.</p> <p> The Deputies mentioned the Irish Wheelchair Association partnering with hotels.  This is to provide people with disabilities with modern and fully-inclusive independent hotel breaks at a range of locations, with easy access to local towns and a wider choice of amenities.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has the ethos of delivering services that respond to the wishes of its members.  The new service will be located in accessible hotels in the Galway area and the midlands.  The Irish Wheelchair Association is in the final stages of the procurement process and will soon be able to announce the exact locations involved.</p> <p> I am aware of the matters raised by the Deputies and I agree that there will be an impact on people with high-dependency issues.  These will require clarification and I have instructed HSE officials in the past few minutes to ensure that this will happen in consultation with the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I will revert to the relevant Deputies with this clarification over the coming days.  It is essential that common sense prevails.  In that context, the Deputies have put forward sensible solutions.  I give a commitment that these solutions will be put on the table in trying to resolve the matter.</p></speech>

This is the biggest and, arguably, the best dementia care facility in the country but it may have to close because of a deficit in funding.  This is shocking news for people.  Everybody in my area knows somebody with a family member in the facility.  A member of my extended family suffered from dementia and she spent her final years there.  The staff were wonderful and the care was really amazing.</p><p>One of the features of St. Joseph's is that it caters for high-dependency dementia sufferers.  It was indicated to me by families of people using the service earlier in the summer that there was a problem.  I tabled a parliamentary question at the time expressing concern about the funding deficit and the implications it could have for St. Joseph's but I was informed, in a fairly cold response, that the HSE was discharging its funding responsibilities under the fair deal scheme, which is more properly known as the nursing home support scheme.  The problem is that this does not provide sufficient funds for high-dependency sufferers.  The extra cost of providing care for high-dependency sufferers of dementia has been covered by St. Joseph's, leading to a deficit of &euro;7 million building up to 2012.  St. Joseph's has managed to cover the latter up to now.  It is facing an ongoing deficit for this year of &euro;1.2 million and it simply cannot cover it any more.  This deficit exists because the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, the HSE and, ultimately, the Government will not provide the additional necessary funds for high-dependency dementia sufferers.</p><p>Ms Emma Belmaine, the chief executive of the facility, put it very well when she explained the cruel injustice of this for families and dementia sufferers.  It is difficult enough for family members to deal with high-dependency dementia sufferers without them being treated in this way.  She states:</p> <blockquote> 	Decision makers and funders need to understand that people living with a diagnosis of dementia cannot be discriminated against and are entitled to the same spectrum of care as those with a different terminal illness.  Funding for dementia care also needs to be increased significantly and allocated fairly, not based on numbers in beds but on the needs of people.  It should not matter whether the person is receiving that specialist dementia care in a HSE facility, a private nursing home or an independent not-for-profit facility such as St. Joseph's. </blockquote>  <p>I ask the Government, as a matter of urgency, to cover the deficit and ensure the biggest and best care facility for dementia sufferers in this country does not close, causing great hardship for dementia sufferers and their families.</p></speech>

It provides both residential care and day care for service users, all of whom have a diagnosis of dementia.  Many of the 60 residential places are funded through the nursing homes support scheme.  Separately, the HSE contracts for approximately 25 day care places per day at St. Joseph's.</p>  <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, commonly referred to as the fair deal scheme, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The nursing homes support scheme is expected to support 23,042 people at any one time in 2019.  The scheme's budget for 2019 saw an increase of &euro;24.3 million over 2018, making a total budget of &euro;985.8 million for 2019.  In 2020, the scheme will see a further investment in its budget of &euro;45 million, bringing the total annual budget for the scheme to &euro;1.03 billion.</p>  <p>  This substantial investment will provide ongoing long-term residential care over the course of 2020, ensuring that the scheme can continue to deliver affordable and accessible nursing home care for our citizens with long-term care needs.  The NTPF has been designated by the Minister for Health pursuant to section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement on the maximum price that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to nursing homes support scheme residents.</p>  <p>  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function and negotiates with nursing homes on an individual basis.  The Minister for Health does not have any role in this regard.  The NTPF has clear and established processes for agreeing prices and has successfully negotiated terms with over 430 private and voluntary nursing homes participating in the scheme.  The NTPF's processes are available to all nursing homes and since the end of 2017 there has been a net increase in the number of nursing homes operating in Ireland, with an increase of almost 1,300, or 5.7%, in the number of beds in the nursing homes with which the NTPF has agreed terms.  In its statutory role to negotiate maximum prices charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to nursing homes support scheme residents, the NTPF established processes are the appropriate mechanism for engagement.  The established processes include provision for an NTPF review mechanism where agreement is not initially reached on the price.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been involved in extensive engagement with the St. John of God Hospitaller Services Group about the day care service at St. Joseph's and this engagement is ongoing.  I acknowledge the role of private and voluntary providers in residential care provision.  I encourage the St. John of God group to continue the engagement with the HSE on day care services.  I also encourage the continued engagement with the NTPF processes with regard to the prices for the residential care services.</p></speech>

That would cause extreme hardship for dementia sufferers, their families and the wonderful staff and 100 volunteers who assist in this dementia care centre.  For example, Frank wrote to me.  He said his father died aged 48 years.  Then his mother died two years ago in 2017.  She was 92.  He has been taking care of his stepfather, aged 87, who has had dementia since his mother's death.  He works full-time and depends heavily on the service and help of the wonderful people in the day care facility at Saint Joseph's.  He said without the service he does not know what he will do.  He said the letter he received regarding the consequences should the facility close frightened him.  I have received a range of other similar correspondence.  Frank and the others who have written to me want to know that the Government is not going to let this facility close for the want of &euro;1.2 million.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State to acknowledge the point I made earlier?  It was the same point Ms Emma Balmaine made, which is that the funding provided under the NTPF does not recognise the difference between low-dependency and high-dependency dementia sufferers.  Every other part of our health service recognises that.  No one suggests that regardless of how bad a person's cancer is or what level it is at, that person should get the same treatment regardless.  The treatment is tailored to the need but when it comes to dementia sufferers the Government has decided a given amount is as much money as a dementia sufferer is getting and no more, regardless of his or her need.  That is cruel and inhumane.  By the way, the day care rate given by the HSE to Saint Joseph's Shankill has not increased by a cent since 2008 even though all the costs have gone up dramatically since then.  I appeal to the Minister of State to get the Government to intervene to ensure this facility does not close because many people, staff and families will suffer if it does.</p></speech>

I wrote to the Minister in June about this.  This is the most important and largest dementia care centre of its kind anywhere in the country.  Those involved are leading the way.  They have revolutionised dementia care in this country.  They have been raising the issue for a long time.  The centre is a high-care facility and it is getting approximately three quarters of the funding it needs.  What is being sought is not much extra.</p>  <p>  The letter the chief executive sent out explained that the centre will have to close the doors in approximately seven weeks.  Approximately half the staff and patients there come from my constituency of Wicklow.  The anguish and fear felt in Wicklow today over this is unprecedented.</p>  <p>  Will the Government, as a matter of urgency, agree to short-term funding?  We are talking about a small amount.  It could ensure funding was in place for a six-month reprieve.  That could give time for a proper renegotiation.  We have to back these dementia facilities.</p></speech>

I fully acknowledge the important role played by the voluntary and private providers in the provision of services such as residential care and day care for older people, including those with dementia.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that appropriate mechanisms exist for service providers such as Saint Joseph's Shankill to engage with the relevant agencies.  The Deputies can tell those people who have major concerns or who are worried that, in respect of day care services, there has been intensive engagement between the HSE and Saint Joseph's Shankill this year.  The HSE has committed to continuing this engagement with a view to further assisting the facility where possible.</p>  <p>  The majority of residents are supported through the nursing home support scheme, under which residents contribute to the cost of the care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the costs.  The NTPF has statutory responsibility for negotiating with individual private and voluntary nursing homes to reach agreement in respect of the maximum price that will be charged for the provision of residential care services to nursing home support scheme residents.  The fund has well established processes with which all providers must engage.  In the event that agreement cannot be reached through the engagement process with the fund, there is a process whereby the nursing home may seek a review by the NTPF chief executive officer.  I understand that the initial engagement and negotiation process is active.  Given the NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its functions, it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further other than to reiterate my encouragement to Saint Joseph's Shankill to engage fully with the established processes.</p></speech>

We had a long discussion yesterday and, as you know, proceedings are ongoing about that.  There will be more discussion about the issue of money messages.  However, I want to get some clarity on precisely what happened to the arrangements for today.  The communications that we got leave very big questions in my mind as to exactly how the arrangements for today unfolded or were revised.  In the first instance, notwithstanding the issue of the motion and your ruling on the motion, a Cheann Comhairle, there was a slot for Solidarity-People Before Profit due to start now.  That was still in the arrangements for today this morning when the business schedule was sent out.  At some point later in the day, that slot disappeared.  How did the decision happen?

I am pleased that the key features of the Bill have been welcomed and supported by all sides during the debate.  The provision for a five-year minimum term for gift vouchers and other protections contained in the Bill will be of real benefit to the very many consumers who give and receive gift vouchers.  The amendments made to the Bill have improved it considerably and they are important provisions that I believe significantly strengthen the protections provided for in the Bill.  I look forward to returning the Bill to the Seanad, to its enactment shortly thereafter and to having it in force in time for the peak Christmas buying period for gift vouchers.</p></speech>

At present, regulations in European Economic Area or EEA states are automatically notified when a sanction has been imposed on a registrant.  In drafting the Bill, it was considered prudent to provide for this for third countries also, particularly in the context of Brexit.  The Bill, therefore, provides that a regulator shall notify sanctions to its equivalent body in another jurisdiction if the regulator has reason to believe the registrant is also registered there.  All five Acts provide a mechanism for the regulator to apply to the High Court for the immediate suspension of a registrant where this is considered necessary to protect the public.  This suspension comes into effect while steps are being taken under the fitness to practise process.  As indicated on Committee Stage, it is necessary to provide separately for exchange of data between regulators outside the EEA space in these circumstances.  Accordingly, a separate provision in each of the Acts is required to provide for this.</p><p>The amendments I am now proposing will provide that the regulators will be able to advise their equivalent body in another jurisdiction of an order of the court under the immediate suspension provision where the regulator has reason to believe the practitioner is registered in that jurisdiction, or has made an application to be registered, and that the regulator in that jurisdiction is not aware of the court order.  There is already provision to notify in certain circumstances and we are adding to that a provision to notify under the immediate suspension provisions.  This was largely welcomed on Committee stage.</p></speech>

We need to open up a dialogue about what exactly is being proposed.  The sanctions of admonishment and censure in the respective Acts are considered relatively minor and would not automatically be published where the appropriate regulatory body considered it was not in the public interest.  I do not understand what the problem is with the original legislation or why there is a need to make changes at this stage.  There is considerable confusion and concern among workers across the health service who are affected by these changes, such as nurses, physiotherapists, social workers, optometrists, doctors and dentists.  Why is the Minister seeking to change the primary legislation in this way?  The regulatory body may take the view that it is not in the public interest but this almost places an onus on the relevant body to publish.</p><p>I will give the Minister a small example of what I mean.  Years ago, I represented a nurse who was accused of something that was minor but serious.  When she committed the misdemeanour she was in the grip of an issue with addiction but she got her life back on track and, by the time she came before the fitness to practise committee, she had already come through it and was ready to go back to work.  The committee took a very benign view but she was terrified that any reference to what she had done would be published, on the basis that she did not present a threat to anybody.  She had had an incident but she had dealt with it and had come through it on the other side.  Has the Minister had discussions with the representatives of the people who are going to be at the business end of this provision?  Can he outline the rationale behind the provision?  It seems to me to place an onus to publish.  While we should always have a consideration of the public interest, we should also have consideration for the person who will have to deal with the consequences of this. </p></speech>

Provision has also been made to allow the regulator to notify the HSE and the employer where a sanction is applied by a regulator outside the State and the regulator is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.  This provides a very important protection to the public in light of the increased mobility of health professionals globally.  Deputy O'Reilly's amendment would restrict the Dental Council's powers to notify the HSE only when a sanction is imposed in this country and not outside.</p></speech>

From a technical point of view, this would be an accidental consequence of the amendment.  It would also remove the express power to notify an employer when such a sanction is imposed and this approach would run contrary to the purpose of the Bill.  None of the other amendments for consideration is attempting to remove these powers of notification in relation to the other regulated health professions so this amendment would treat dentists differently from all other health practitioners, though I accept that this is also not the rationale behind the amendment.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.  On the broader point, however, the capacity to notify the HSE when a registrant has a sanction imposed on him or her outside the State is an important provision and, in the interest of equity, should apply to all health professions.  I am not convinced of the case for not having such a provision but perhaps the Deputy and I could discuss it when the Bill goes to the Seanad, as well as the technical issues I have with the amendment.</p>  <p>  Other provisions in the Bill require practitioners to make a declaration upon application for registration and every year after sanctions or convictions are applied outside the State.  The Bill also provides the power for all five regulators to notify employers and the HSE of sanctions imposed in any country outside the State but this amendment would remove this power in the case of dentists.  Public interest is always the test the regulators apply and both the Deputy and I agree with them on this.  I am satisfied that the regulators understand the meaning of "public interest" but I am happy to tease the issue through further if the Deputy wishes to consider further amendments in the Seanad.</p></speech>

Sometimes, however, it is not in the public interest.</p>  <p>Let us put aside the technicality of the amendment.  I accept this is isolated to one group.  Does the Minister accept there are scenarios where the sanction could be quite light?  The offence, for want of a better word, might be relatively minor.  There are scenarios where the public interest is not served by publication or notification of one's employer.  I am thinking in particular of the woman mentioned earlier, who I will not name.  She was terrified that, should she choose to re-enter the workforce, her employer would be advised of her offence.  I acknowledge that an offence was committed, but she had more than come through it.  Does the Minister accept that there are scenarios where, for whatever reason, it is not always in the public interest to publish this information?  There are situations where the damage caused to the person in question would outweigh any benefit to the public interest.</p> <p> I accept that there is a technical issue with the amendment.  That is fine.  Between now and when this Bill comes before the Seanad, I ask the Minister to engage with those representing these people because there are scenarios where the public interest would not be served.  I accept that the public interest is absolutely paramount.  However, I have experience of situations where it would definitely not have been in the public interest to publish that information in any way, shape or form.  It would bring people back to a time in their life when they had a particular issue, through which they have now come.  It would be unfair to keep bringing them back to that place.</p></speech>

I am happy to engage further on this issue between now and the Seanad's consideration of this Bill.</p>  <p>  I will make two points on this amendment.  I accept that there are situations where it may not be in the public interest to publish certain information, but I also trust our regulators to make that determination.  The independence and robustness of our regulatory bodies is right and proper.  We are empowering our regulators and trusting them in this regard.  That is an important point.</p>  <p>  On my second point, I do not wish to be pedantic but there is a difference between publication and notification. </p></speech>

A person's employer has a right to be notified, but people also deserve second chances.  It is about striking that balance.  By and large, our regulators understand how to do that and get it right.  I am happy to engage further between now and the Bill's passage through the Seanad.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, introduced a series of amendments on Committee Stage that would give regulators the option to send notifications about registration by email or other electronic means.  At that time, the Minister of State signalled that there may be a need to introduce further amendments on Report Stage to provide for notification by electronic means for events other than registration.  We are now bringing forward those technical amendments.</p></speech>

The Minister of State brought forward an amendment on that Stage to further amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act.  The amendment specifically sought to remove the requirement for the council to refer all sanction recommendations from the fitness to practise committee to its registration board.  At that stage, the Minister of State indicated that a further technical amendment would be required on Report Stage to delete the recommendation-making function of the registration boards contained in section 27 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, as this had been inadvertently omitted from the Bill.  This amendment deletes the relevant section of the Act.  It is a purely technical amendment to fix an error.</p></speech>

A finding of poor professional performance was made against Professor Corbally by the Medical Council, and he challenged that finding all the way to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court judgment was a landmark one.  The five-judge court unanimously dismissed the Medical Council's appeal against the High Court's quashing of a council decision that Professor Corbally should receive an admonishment over a once-off error.  The court said that a threshold of seriousness must be met for a medical professional to undergo a public inquiry.  It further stated that it was neither fair nor just that someone like Professor Corbally was subjected to an inquiry with extensive publicity, some of which lacked fairness and moderation.  Despite the landmark judgment, the case has not been legislated for.  With that in mind, I have submitted this amendment to try to legislate across all the primary Acts to incorporate the Corbally judgment in the definition of poor professional misconduct.  I would prefer if such legislative change came from the Minister, but that has not happened.  We discussed this on Committee Stage.  In the absence of a satisfactory response from him, I will press the amendment and the others that incorporate the Corbally judgment in the definition of &quot;poor professional performance&quot;. </p></speech>

A lengthy discussion was held on Committee Stage about finding a reasonable way for people to avoid going to the High Court as their first port of call for an appeal.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, it is sometimes necessary for them to do so, and the Supreme Court can also be brought in.  At that time, the Minister stated that he would take a serious look at the issue.  However, I was disappointed to see that none of his amendments deal with it.  It is mentioned on pages 16 and 17 of the Bill, where it is stated that the first port of call is the High Court.  Do any of the Minister's amendments deal with this or is any work being done to find a non-judicial route for a person's first appeal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600034#NN01400"><p>I will comment on Deputy O'Reilly's amendments together.  I note her wish to appropriately reflect the Corbally judgment in the regulatory Acts, specifically by the addition of the words &quot;serious error&quot; to the definition of &quot;poor professional performance&quot;.  This was the subject of a good and intense debate on Committee Stage.  The issue has been considered by my officials since then, and, indeed, had been considered before Committee Stage as well.  As advised on Committee Stage, the health regulators are absolutely clear in their application of legislation that a threshold of seriousness applies to poor professional judgment.  The Supreme Court's judgment in the Corbally case left no doubt in this regard.  The judge at the time ruled that:</p> <blockquote> 	The term &ldquo;poor professional performance&rdquo; has a threshold of seriousness built into it: therefore only conduct or activity, by act or omission, which reaches that level, can be said to meet the test. </blockquote>  <p>Against this clear Supreme Court ruling, these amendments propose to insert a variation of additional phrasing into the definitions in the four Acts.  I am advised that such an introduction risks potential unintended consequences and would not bring additional clarity.  Do these amendments intend the word &quot;serious&quot; to apply only to error or also to failure, and is that intention sufficiently clear in the proposed definition?  As we know, professional regulation is a highly litigated area and the amendment of definitions, in particular, is something we must approach with great caution.  It is also worth noting that the regulatory Acts provide for a registrant to provide particular undertakings to the regulator in appropriate circumstances.  These may be employed, for example, where the necessary threshold of seriousness has not been met.  A revision of the definition could, therefore, impact on these or other aspects of the legislation, which are, therefore, difficult to predict in advance.  For these reasons, I remain of the view that it is neither necessary nor desirable to amend the definition and accordingly, I am not in a position to support these amendments.  The Supreme Court ruling has provided great certainty, and my fear is that amendments to the definition would accidentally inject a degree of uncertainty into this area.</p></speech>

The concerns I raised have not been addressed by his response.  It is imperative that we legislate for this.  The intention when the judgment was issued was fairly clear.  It was a landmark judgment and the dismissal of the Medical Council's appeal was unanimous.  From my perspective and based on the interactions I have had, the intention is to legislate for the Corbally judgment.  In the absence of that, I have no option but to press this amendment.</p></speech>

I do not in any way dispute what Deputy O'Reilly is trying to do.  The strong advice available to me is that the definition of "poor professional performance" is provided for in four of the five health professional regulatory Acts already in place.  It is not covered in the legislation relating to dentists.  That has now been defined by the Supreme Court.  There is no greater clarity in terms of understanding that we could arrive at than the Supreme Court.  For us to begin to alter the wording would inject a degree of uncertainty.  I know that is not the Deputy's intention, but it could be an unintended consequence.  I would genuinely advise against these amendments.  I would be happy to engage further with Opposition spokespersons in advance of the Seanad debate, but I am concerned about this.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Donnelly's query, my officials responded to him, through the committee, in terms of outlining the rationale for confirmation by the High Court versus a lower court.  Perhaps I will discuss this with him and we can decide if he wants to pursue it further. </p></speech>

It has to do with publication.  The Minister and I have had a discussion and we agree that we must put the public interest first.  I am seeking only to afford a modicum of protection to an individual against whom a finding, even a minor one, is made.  In such a circumstance, the publication of a censure or admonishment for a minor infringement could have major implications for a person's professional career and personal life.  I think the Minister understands where I am coming from with this amendment.  My hope is that he and-or his officials will take the time to engage with the representative bodies before the Bill moves to the Seanad.  These bodies have much more knowledge than we do concerning the potential unintended consequences of publication.  I say that with the caveat that the public interest has to come first.</p></speech>

I will reflect further on this issue before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  I make the following point to be of assistance should the Deputy decide to have an amendment tabled in the Seanad.  The amendment, as drafted, would cover three of the five regulatory bodies and would not cover dentists and pharmacists.  I only point that out by way of being helpful.  My position remains very similar to that which I expressed in the previous debate we had on notifications.</p></speech>

The Committee Stage discussion was very helpful because several Members, principally Deputies O'Reilly and Donnelly, sought greater clarity on eligibility for registration on the specialist division of the Medical Council's register of a small cohort of medical practitioners who were correctly appointed to consultant posts prior to 2008.  As we discussed at the committee, a small number of people would have qualified but, for whatever reasons, whether family life or something else, did not avail of the grandfathering clause at that time.  I do think any Deputy had a difficulty with this cohort being dealt with.  Deputy O'Reilly wanted to check that the provision was specific.  I am revising the text, therefore, to bring additional clarity to the scope of the provision, specially regarding the cohort of medical practitioners that it is intended to capture.  The amendment specifies that a consultant must have been correctly appointed to his or her post under the terms in operation in 2008 and must satisfy competency requirements for registration.  I thank Deputies for their helpful comments on Committee Stage.  I trust and hope that the revised wording addresses their concern and I respectfully ask the House to accept my amendment.</p></speech>

For the avoidance of any doubt and to be a bit belt and braces about the whole affair, this is not intended as a vehicle by which people who have a lawful entitlement, which I would not interfere with, to a contract of indefinite duration are now practising as consultants.  It is explicit and recorded in the House that this is intended to deal only with those people who would, by virtue of their qualifications and experience, in 2008 have been entitled in this regard and not an entitlement by virtue of a contract of indefinite duration.  It refers to people who would have had that entitlement at the time but who did not avail of it, for whatever reason.  I have spoken to people who, for family reasons, could not avail of the contract and that is fair enough.  The intention is to include these people.  We need to be very clear that this provision is not intended to add to the register those people only practising as consultants because they have a contract of indefinite duration.  That is a whole other conversation that we will have on another day.</p></speech>

The amendment introduced on Committee Stage was to facilitate the transfer of a small number of consultants, estimated to be about 30 or 40, from the Medical Council's general division to its specialist division.  These are consultants who were correctly appointed to their posts prior to the introduction by the HSE in 2008 of a requirement that consultants be registered in the specialist divisions.  The consultants in question did not take advantage, for a number of reasons, of the five-year period during which they could have applied for transfer under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  On Committee Stage, Members were agreeable to this change but they were concerned that the language used in the amendment was overly broad and could be problematic in terms of access by consultants outside of the intended cohort.  The revised text is now being introduced to address those concerns.</p></speech>

It is proposed that the Bill be so amended.  To be honest, I thought this was an oversight.  Where a member of a regulated health profession is being adjudicated upon, it should be made explicitly clear that a member of the same profession should sit on the preliminary proceedings of fitness to practice committees. </p> <p>I have discussed this matter with individuals who take these cases and it is their belief that this provision is absolutely essential.  I also raised the issue on Committee Stage and it has not been addressed.  I will press the amendment to a vote because it is my understanding that the people involved feel extremely strongly about the issue.  They initially believed this was an oversight and I thought an amendment would have been made in the intervening period.  Since that has not happened, I will press this amendment.</p></speech>

I believe we have addressed the issue the Deputy wishes to address.  There are two parts to this, namely, the composition of the committees and ensuring a shorter timeframe for complaints, which is in everybody's interest.  While Deputy O'Reilly's amendment addresses the concern about the composition of preliminary proceedings committees and a fitness to practise committee of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, it had been suggested that the Bill, as drafted, could potentially have unintended consequences in the make-up of committees.  That concern was brought to the attention of my Department earlier this year and an amendment in my name, which addressed this issue and one other issue, was introduced and agreed on Committee Stage.  The composition of committees is dealt with in a number of sections in the Nurses and Midwives Act and I am advised that, when read together with my amendment on Committee Stage, they fully achieve the outcome sought by Deputy O'Reilly.</p>  <p>  The amendment I introduced on Committee Stage also addressed the second problem, which the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland had identified.  The Bill, as initiated, was applying a new streamlined committee structure to complaints received after the section of the Bill comes into effect.  This would not have assisted with processing the complaints already received by the board and it could have taken up to two years before the new structure came into effect.  For want of a better phase, we did not want a backlog of complaints building up.  Accordingly, the Committee Stage amendment that I introduced applies the new structures to complaints already received but which have not yet progressed to inquiry stage.  This approach will ensure that complaints are concluded in a shorter timeframe, which is obviously of benefit to the complainant, registrant, witness and regulator.</p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that it is Deputy O'Reilly's sincere intent to address the original issue.  However, the amendment, if accepted, would undo the provision which addresses complaints already received when the section takes effect.  Accordingly, I cannot support it.  I believe I have addressed the concern regarding the composition of the committees with the Committee Stage amendment I brought forward when it is read alongside the Nurses and Midwives Act.</p></speech>

My intention is to ensure that happens.  I do not want to undo anything, add to a backlog or do anything like that.  Clearly, that is not the intention here.  The intention is to ensure that the regulated health profession in question is represented on the committee.  If the Minister can give me that assurance, I will find myself amenable to persuasion.</p></speech>

It is burdensome in a financial, administrative and personal respect and it will have the unintended consequence of unnecessarily exposing registrants who are suffering from illness to the glare of publicity associated with proceedings in open court.  I referred already to a case in which I was personally involved.  This section proposes an amendment to section 72 of the Act, which will require now that sanctions of advisement, admonishment or censure are confirmed by a court.  Currently, those sanctions do not require confirmation by a court.  It is not confirmation by a court that I have difficulty with but the fact that the case is made public.  I am happy to listen to what the Minister has to say about how that scenario will be avoided.  None of us wants to place regulated health professionals in a scenario whereby they find themselves in open court in respect of something that does not require the glare of publicity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600038#RR01300"><p>The Bill provides that for all of the regulated professions, the minor sanctions of advisement, admonishment or censure will now require confirmation by the court before they come into effect.  This provision is considered appropriate in light of evolving case law which is increasingly concluding that it is the adverse finding arising from a fitness to practise proceeding rather than the specific sanction which often has the most significance for registrants.  It is appropriate, therefore, that such a finding goes before a court before a sanction is applied on a registrant.  The Bill, as drafted, will provide for all sanctions to be subject to confirmation by the court.  This will result in greater equity of treatment for registrants who are the subject of an inquiry.</p>  <p>  I recognise the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Reilly on this issue, particularly in relation to how a registrant may feel he or she will be negatively impacted in the process.  However, I must balance that, to use a phrase we keep discussing and with which the Deputy and I both agree, with the public interest in maintaining a transparent, fair and robust system of professional regulation.  Under the current legislation, for example, a censure with a fine requires confirmation by the court before it comes into effect, while a censure alone does not.  Clearly, the current position is not equitable.  Confirmation of all sanctions will ensure that all registrants are subject to the same treatments and protections of the court.</p>  <p>  I also remind the Deputy that, in accordance with the definitions discussed earlier, a threshold of seriousness applies to the events giving rise to a fitness to practise complaint and these are cases that have been deemed to meet a threshold of seriousness.  In appropriate cases, a regulator may invite a registrant to give an undertaking or consent to a particular course of action and, if given these, conclude the matters and not require the confirmation by the court.</p>  <p>  The issue of costs was raised on Committee Stage.  It is important to state that in future, as is the case now, it will be the courts which will determine who bears the costs.  The determination by the court in these matters cannot be presumed in favour of either party in advance.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Reilly's amendment would relate only to nurses and midwives.  I am sure that is unintentional but I need to point that out.  For the reasons of equity I have outlined, I do not believe the Deputy wishes to treat one group of registrants more favourably than another.  For these reasons, including the technical matter I outlined, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

As Members are aware, the position in respect of Bord na M&oacute;na has been threatened by a number of decisions.  This is a very worrying time for workers, their families and the entire midlands region.  We have had substantial use of peat in power generation in three plants, one operated by Bord na M&oacute;na and two by the ESB.  The Edenderry plant has permission for co-firing and that continues to 2023.  However, regarding the planning application made by the ESB in respect of the other two plants, in the case of West Offaly Power, a decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that it would not grant the permission sought for co-firing.  There was considerable discussion about the opportunity for a judicial review of that decision.  Having considered the basis on which a judicial review can be taken, which is essentially a failure of due process within the planning process, the ESB decided that there were no grounds on which to take such a review.  An application has been made to Longford County Council in respect of the Lough Ree plant but a decision has not yet been made on it.</p>  <p>  Against the background of this considerable setback to the original plan, which was to have a gradual exit from peat but with more years during which it would continue to be used to for electricity generation, the Government has decided that we need to be prudently preparing for alternative opportunities for these workers.  I have met the workers concerned, the worker directors, the community and public representatives in the area.  There is a strong desire on the part of the workers, their families and the region in general that alternative opportunities would be available to copper-fasten the future of people who anticipated that they would have opportunities to continue to work up to 2027-2028.  As a result of that, we have been working diligently to develop those alternatives.</p>  <p>  As Members know, in the recent budget we made a significant announcement in that context.  That provides for the establishment of a &euro;20 million fund to have aggregated retrofitting in the midlands, which will provide new work opportunities.  We also made a decision that we would establish a just transition fund of &euro;6 million, which would be available to support change for both the workers and the region.  We also made a decision that, apart from Bord na M&oacute;na's work to rehabilitate bogs, which will provide work opportunities, we will also accelerate the work done by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in facilitating the rehabilitation of bogs.  We anticipate that the employment opportunities generated by these alternative activities could run to 400 or 500.  In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na has recognised that it has an obligation to restore its bogs.  We have been working with the European Union to consider how further support can be obtained in order to develop a high standard of rehabilitation that would provide additional work opportunities over a sustained period.  We continue to discuss the opportunities for that with the European Union.</p>  <p>  I have also been involved in discussions with outgoing Commissioner Ca&ntilde;ete.  We have secured agreement that peat would be included in the coal regions in transition platform.  It has been agreed to include peat in that, which will allow us to have the support of a dedicated country team comprised of Commission experts who will be visiting Ireland next month to work with all those involved - workers in the region, the transition team and Bord na M&oacute;na - to develop alternative opportunities.</p>  <p>  At the core of this is Bord na M&oacute;na's own ambition to move strongly, as it would describe it, from brown to green.  It made a significant announcement recently re-endorsing that ambition to move by 80% from brown to green by 2025.  It has had significant successes in developing alternative opportunities in recycling, alternative and renewable fuels and alternative activities for its 80,000 ha landbank.  It continues to develop those opportunities.  They will be important activities.  Bord na M&oacute;na is unique in the context of the midlands in that it is a commercial State body dedicated to providing employment opportunities in the midlands.  It has recognised that we are moving out of solid fuel generation.  We are moving out of coal and peat.  It must transform that business and provide opportunities for workers and for the regions.</p>  <p>  I assure the House that the Government is wholly committed to delivering a just transition for the workers, their families, the region and the enterprises in those areas.  We will be seeking to work with all the key players to make that a reality.  I have already dedicated my senior officials to develop this retrofitting model, along with other Departments.  I have committed to appoint a just transition commissioner who will assist us in developing the framework to achieve that just transition.</p></speech>

As children, all of us were very aware of that growing up.  One third of our land mass is comprised of peat so it is no surprise that, for generations, peat harvesting was crucial to the area.  We were fortunate enough not to experience emigration at a time when others regions did.</p>  <p>  The transition from peat harvesting in the midlands will be enormously challenging.  It has been flagged for a number of years but, unfortunately, the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of West Offaly Power has accelerated it.  That is causing a great deal of concern for the workers, their families, the communities and those of us who care about this issue in terms of public representation both at local and national level.  I am aware also that the Government - I thank the Minister in this regard - has been very concerned about this matter.  The Minister has made every effort, as has the Taoiseach, in establishing an interdepartmental committee in the Department of the Taoiseach.  That shows how seriously the Government is taking this issue.  I welcome that.  I want to acknowledge the Minister's visits to Offaly.  This issue is of huge concern and his visits were very welcome.</p>  <p>  I refer to the implications for Offaly County Council and the hole in funding this will create for it.</p> <p>It has been very proactive in the just transition team forum which it put together, the midlands transition team.  It is welcome to hear of the positive efforts being made.  However, we must never forget that the impact on the workers and their families is at the heart of all this.  We must ensure there will be no lack of clarity for them in terms of what they are entitled to access, training and upskilling and the impact on their pensions.  We must be clear that they will get everything they are entitled to get.</p> <p> I also welcome the announcements in the budget about the various funds.  One in particular, relating to bog rehabilitation, was strongly welcomed.  A number of the workers had identified this as an area in which they could be well employed for a number of years.  I hope Bord na M&oacute;na will be able to apply to the climate action fund to ensure the workers have access to further employment to bring them to retirement age, which is what many of them want.  Unfortunately, I have run out of time.  It is most important that the workers, communities and our county are at the heart of this just transition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600040#TT00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Eugene Murphy, if he arrives.  I thank the Minister for allocating time for this debate.  What is surprising in the context of his opening statement is that he has yet to set out when a commissioner will be appointed for the just transition task force and how independent the commissioner will be.  Apart from restating much of what we have heard previously, we have no detail on foot of the Minister's contribution.</p>  <p>  We all acknowledge the issues surrounding the transition in the midlands.  The title afforded to this debate is incorrect.  It refers to a potential early exit, but the problem is a disastrous and unequal exit due to many poor Government decisions for the best part of a decade.  There has been much inaction in this area for many years.  The switch is being flicked and many workers, communities and livelihoods are being left behind.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague, Deputy Cowen, in trying to ensure that a just transition task force was part of the budgetary negotiations.  There will be a hypothecated funding allocation for the regions most affected by the transition that we must progress across the Government.  The Government's decision to appoint a just transition commissioner might be the right approach and is in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee, but there has been little detail from the Minister about when that will happen.  It is far too late, however.  The commissioner must be appointed before Christmas so that there can be negotiations with workers.</p>  <p>  People who are watching this debate will know that workers are at the core of this.  They are transitioning from their existing jobs and livelihoods into future prospects of employment, which were announced in the budget.  It is one thing to make announcements, but it is another thing to deliver for workers who cannot be left behind.  Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB must commence immediately with a respectful deal in early 2020.  The commissioner must be independent and must allocate just transition funding on a fair basis to the communities involved.  These funds must be made available not only to the midlands but to all affected areas and sectors, for example, the coal plant at Moneypoint is a particular concern for the just transition task force.</p>  <p>  I have a question for the Minister about the hypothecated fund that is a key part of the climate action plan.  What will be its legal structure to ensure not only that just transition occurs across communities but also that there is no diversion of funds to other areas if gaps have to be plugged in those areas?  What will be the legal structure relating to it in order that we can progress it into the future?  No legislation has been published yet.  Is it a hypothecation within Government figures or will it have a legal standing?  It is important for the communities and workers that are adversely affected to see that a just transition task force has a commissioner appointed and that there is a crystallised funding model whereby any moneys raised through carbon tax are allocated and future-proofed.  That has not been announced so far by the Government.  I am anxious to see progress on the legal basis for that.</p>  <p>  The restoration of bogs is a particularly important climate measure.  Has the Minister examined the potential employment opportunities in this area, which we heard about at the climate action committee?  We also had a great deal of discussion about retrofitting and the employment opportunities in that area.  There are potentially thousands of jobs, a matter for the just transition task force.  In addition, the task force must examine the issue of the restoration of bogs.  We should see formal details from the Minister in that regard.</p>  <p>  There is an absolute fear among people and communities about their livelihoods.  Over a number of years there have been delays and a lack of action, and now we are playing catch up.  However, that catch up should not be to the detriment of the communities and livelihoods of people whose jobs are being shut down.  They have few prospects and little hope until we see more detail.  I am surprised that the Minister provided more nebulous information but little detail regarding how he is going to conclude this transition and how he proposes to progress it for the people whose livelihoods are at risk.  We know from the climate action committee the number of deaths that occur as a result of fuel poverty.  One acceleration for jobs growth will be in the aggregation of retrofitting across the country.  There is a potential fund of &euro;30 million for that, but we must see those jobs crystallised into the future.</p>  <p>  As regards the just transition fund, can the Minister provide additional information on how the midlands can transition from brown to green?  Again, there was little information from him on a roadmap for people's livelihoods and jobs.  What is the scale of negotiations that are ongoing?  There is enormous concern about a mismatch between management level and the feed down to workers on the ground in the midlands.  The regions across the board want buy-in on this issue if there is protection of jobs and livelihoods.  We have EU and UN obligations, but we cannot leave people behind.  That is a core message.</p>  <p>  Deputy Eugene Murphy has been delayed.  Will he be able to contribute later for a couple of minutes?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600040#TT00400"><p>Being from the midlands, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this.  We all accept that the move away from brown energy to green energy is happening, but it must happen in a way in which workers and communities are not left behind but are respected and have a future.  There must be a just transition.  When the committee was putting together the report for the Government, this is one of the areas on which my party and others were united in terms of ensuring it was in the Government's proposals and moved forward.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that has not been happening up to now and it is having a seriously negative effect on families, workers and communities across the midlands.  In County Laois, there was no just transition for the workers of C&uacute;il na M&oacute;na.  That has been moving away from peat over the last 20 years and has been scaled down, but there has been nothing for the workers over that time.  The redundancies announced this year were a shock to workers and families.  There were 200 earlier this year in the Offaly area, followed by 150 laid off temporarily in Longford last July.  What has been frustrating for many people in the midlands is that the move away from peat has been in progress for 20 years, yet workers and their communities have been left behind.  In towns such as Mountrath, which depended on Bord na M&oacute;na, there has been no replacement employment for the hundreds who lost their jobs.</p>  <p>  We must change how we do this.  In the future there must be proper planning and appropriate transition for workers and communities in counties such as Laois and Offaly.  For a start, the power stations at Shannonbridge, in west Offaly, and Lough Ree are set to see the public service obligation, PSO, expire on 31 December next.  The licences are also due to end in December.  I contacted the Department about this, but I am still awaiting a reply.  Perhaps the Minister could let the House know whether these matters have been resolved or what the plan is for these two stations.  Obviously, people are very concerned about this.</p> <p>According to the paper published this year by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, the ESB unsuccessfully sought funding to dismantle both Lough Ree and Shannonbridge in the event that these plants lose funding from the PSO levy.  If that happens and both plants are shut down, what plans does the Government have in place for the workers?  What transition arrangements and alternative employment will be available?  </p> <p> Our party has brought forward a well-researched document titled, Powering Ireland 2030.  It calls for 80% of energy in the all-Ireland market to be generated from renewable sources.  It is an ambitious target but, looking to what has been achieved in other countries, we believe it is achievable.  </p> <p> A key component of such a transition is the development by the State of renewable biomass and biogas sectors.  The midlands can be the heart of such development.  That is the message I want to convey to the Minister this evening.  This presents an opportunity for the midlands because the region has the land, power stations and people with certain skills that can be developed.  At the moment Bord na M&oacute;na's bioenergy division sources biomass to be used in the Edenderry power station.  I am told that one shipload came from Australia.  I do not know whether that is correct.  A union representative told me that but the Minister might confirm it.  We know, however, that shiploads have come from South America.  That is absolute insanity from the point of view of the environment, the economy, and building sustainable communities.  </p> <p> We already have raw material, although it is not being utilised.  I highlight the fact that there is a surplus of straw in the country in addition to hedge cuttings and forestry thinning waste.  Some forestry waste is being utilised but we need to start using all of those sources of biomass.  They will not be enough in themselves, which I understand.  It is for that reason that Sinn F&eacute;in has been arguing for the past eight years that we need to develop biomass crops and to grow them widely.  Trials with willow trees have been carried out, which were not that successful, but there are other crops and other examples.  We have all been looking at information in that regard over recent years because we know how important it is.  We have a large farming sector in this State.  We also have issues with waste and emissions.  Farming incomes are also low, which is a major issue, particularly in some of the communities where Bord na M&oacute;na activities are being scaled down.  Many of the people working in Bord na M&oacute;na are also part-time farmers.  The State should not be importing biomass of any kind of a long-term basis.  We need to develop our own supply chains in Ireland.  </p> <p> The Government's plan for the plant at Moneypoint under Project Ireland 2040 is to convert it to burn natural gas by 2025 at a cost of &euro;1 billion.  We face a challenge in that respect.  The plant was closed for a period.  The future of Moneypoint is an issue in the context both of servicing our electricity needs and of the communities and workers involved.  We welcome the commitment to phase out coal combustion but consideration has to be given to converting those plants to alternative fuels and to developing biogas and biomass.  </p> <p> Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB are renowned for their apprenticeship schemes.  They have an excellent history of, and great credibility and experience in, producing good apprentices and tradespeople.  They have good track records in that regard.  There is no reason they should fail to play a role in the new green and sustainable energy sector.  What plans are in place to upskill those workers currently employed in the peat industry and in the other industries that are to be scaled back?  What plans are in place to train them in the high-efficiency construction skills needed to retrofit homes and to enable them to work in different parts of the country?</p> <p> With regard to the horticultural sector, the horticultural peat plants at Coolnamona and Kilberry are hanging by a thread.  Peat is stockpiled on the bog.  I was looking at it again over the weekend.  The decision by the British retailer, B&amp;Q, to refuse compost composed partially or totally of peat is a reality.  That is what the customer is telling us.  Workers in Laois and south Kildare cannot be thrown on the scrapheap.  We need to make more use of the facilities at Coolnamona and Kilberry and to provide a sustainable transition for them with regard to horticultural products.  There is an opportunity to start using municipal waste to generate compost free from horticultural peat.  That needs to be developed.  Some of this is being done at Kilberry.  I know that and I understand that but it needs to be scaled up.  We produce a lot of waste as a country.  This is an opportunity to use that waste to move towards more sustainable horticultural products.  </p> <p> We cannot allow the midlands to become a rust belt.  We have to ensure that it becomes a dynamic economic area.  It has been one in the past.  Bord na M&oacute;na regenerated Offaly, as did the ESB and other industries.  That can be done again as part of the move from brown to green.  We are late starters, however, and we are where we are.  We need to ramp this up now.  We need investment in alternative employment and in training and upskilling.  That is why I have proposed that we use the training centre at Mount Lucas.  It needs to be expanded.  The Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board is doing very good work there but it needs to become a centre for apprenticeship training.  I am making the firm proposal that the centre at Mount Lucas, between Edenderry and Daingean, be used for that purpose.  I know people who have attended courses there but it needs to become a centre for training and apprenticeships in the new skills required for installing green energy measures, building energy-efficient homes, commercial buildings, offices and community facilities, and retrofitting.  </p> <p> Many communities throughout the State are watching to see what will happen in the midlands with regard to the peat industry because it is the litmus test for how the transition to a more sustainable future will be handled.  Successive Governments have handled Bord na M&oacute;na poorly.  I do not refer only to this Government but to the Governments in the 1980s and 1990s that moved away from horticultural peat and sod fuel, for example.  These past actions have served to make communities anxious and concerned.  People in rural areas resent the fact that they will carry an unfair share of the financial burden arising from proposed climate actions.  </p> <p> A much better approach to a just transition is needed to gain the trust and support of the ordinary people and communities who will enter into the just transition phase.  Moneypoint is a case in point, as are the midlands.  We need to do our best in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-06a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600041#UU00300"><p>Yes.  Just transition is about allaying fears by involving those most directly affected.  In Ireland, the areas of energy, transport and agriculture all need to undergo rapid transformative change.  Hauliers, peat production workers, builders, mechanics and farmers will all be impacted.  The sooner we start to plan for their well-being during this transition, the less social and economic disruption we will face.  The point of planning for a just transition is that it is not just about climate change, but about people having decent and sustainable livelihoods.</p>  <p>  A good example of this from elsewhere in the globe was articulated by our former President, Mary Robinson, in a keynote speech in Dublin last November when she referenced Port Augusta in South Australia where a coal-fired power station was to be closed down.  In the five years leading up to the plant's closure, workers, unions, citizens and local businesses came together to research how to achieve a just transition.  They developed a thermal solar plant that will create 1,800 jobs and save 5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.  This is a story of how preparation and partnership can work to deliver positive outcomes for all.</p>  <p>  This leads us to the Minister's announcements in respect of the midlands following the most recent budget.  No matter what part of the country we come from, we all agree that the midlands region is the effective epicentre for the just transition.  It is the test bed.  I share the views of Deputy Chambers regarding the vagueness in respect of planning.</p></speech>
