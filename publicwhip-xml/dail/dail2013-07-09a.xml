    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900003#A00400"><p>The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals to bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  JobBridge has made very significant progress since it came into operation in July 2011.  As of 27 June 2013, 18,587 internship placements had commenced, with 5,934 participants in active internships and 1,936 internship posts advertised and available on the JobBridge website.  The independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants which I published recently has found that 61% of interns who finish placements secure employment within five months.  These progression outcomes are exceptionally positive and compare very favourably with European averages for internships.</p><p>  We believe these outcomes are due, at least in part, to the voluntary nature of the relationship between the host organisation and the intern and to the careful design and active management of JobBridge by the Department.  One of the strong features of internships is that part of the intern experience is in interns applying for and succeeding in getting an internship place.  The internship is designed to stay as close to the acquisition of a permanent job as possible.  For example, as part of this design, we ask host organisations to provide meaningful work for interns, to commit to a standard agreement detailing expected learning outcomes for the intern, to provide mentoring for each intern and assign a mentor to the intern for this purpose, to submit monthly reports to the Department and, at the end of the internship, to complete an end of evaluation questionnaire and provide each intern with a reference.</p><p>In asking host organisations to observe best practice guidelines, we are requesting them to invest considerable time and effort in the intern.  This investment pays dividends by increasing the value of the internship and is a major factor in the high rate of progression of interns into employment.</p><p> We have carried out 2,200 on-site monitoring visits, arising from which 23 organisations have been excluded from JobBridge.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></p><p> Given the importance attached to the quality of the internship experience, the Department actively monitors internships to check whether host organisations are conforming with its specification of best practice.  In cases in which it is deemed that an organisation is not offering an internship of sufficient quality the Department reserves the right to exclude that organisation from further access to JobBridge and, in some cases, to terminate existing internships.  However, it is important to highlight that the overwhelming majority of organisations are operating in conformance with the scheme design.  In fact, more than 7,500 host organisations have participated in the scheme and, as outlined above, just 23 organisations have been excluded from further access to the scheme.</p></reply>

That is what they are supposed to do.  However, my question was tabled to find about the minority who have sought to abuse a Government scheme funded by taxpayers' money and designed to give young people a start in life.  That sort of conduct is despicable.  The Minister has not answered my questions regarding what these organisations did to precipitate their removal from the scheme and whether she plans to name them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900004#B00300"><p>We have carried out 2,200 on-site monitoring visits out of 7,500 host organisations that have participated in the programme.  That is a high number of visits compared to the total number of organisations.  Reasons for excluding organisations include a failure to complete or adhere to the standard agreement, which requires that a high-quality experience and a reference be provided to the intern and includes reporting, evaluation and monitoring provisions; a failure to provide evidence of the provision of mentoring and development to the intern; a failure to complete monthly updates; the use of interns to undertake duties of displaced staff; and a failure to provide a reference to the intern.  The host organisations are getting the value of the qualifications, experience, creativity and energy of the interns and, in return, they are asked to offer a high-quality experience and fulfil certain conditions.  If they do not, we will withdraw their sanction.  However, 23 out of 7,500 organisations represents a low rate of failure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900004#B00400"><p>I accept that, but it does not justify abuse of the scheme.  When a host puts itself into the market to accept interns, it must sign up to a certain agreement.  The 23 organisations that have been identified thus far clearly did not adhere to the terms of that agreement.  Does the Minister propose to name those organisations?  I tabled a question to that effect previously and was told that she was not prepared to name them because, for some obscure reason, it might affect employment levels and the economy.  She will be aware that if an organisation or individual is in default with the Revenue Commissioners, it suffers two punishments.  First, it is subject to savage penalties and interest, and second, it is named and shamed.  The latter is regarded as part of the punitive process.  The organisations we are discussing suffered no punitive process other than being deprived of the opportunity to continue abusing the JobBridge scheme.  They have not been named and shamed, which is the only possible punishment I regard as appropriate.  Why is that the case?  A number of those who have been subject to Revenue Commissioners audits and penalties are also employers.  That did not stop them from being named.</p><p>If the Minister does not have this information, perhaps she will undertake to give it to me, but has any of those organisations been involved in the transgression of either labour or industrial relations law in any other context?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900005#C00200"><p>The comparison with Revenue is not appropriate.  People are bound by law to pay their taxes.  The internship JobBridge scheme is a voluntary arrangement on the part of both the intern and the host organisation.  As we have gone along, we have refined and improved the scheme.  We have broadened it and introduced further specifications over time.  In the beginning, offers were posted which were not internships and this was a frequent complaint initially.  This was because we were launching a brand new scheme, unseen previously in Ireland.  We have been learning constantly since.</p><p>  The intern is important and it is important he or she has a good experience.  Interns communicate with us monthly and we are focused on them and their experience, along with the benefit to the host organisation, because we want them to be able to move on to further employment, either with the host or someone else.  They communicate with us monthly and also have access to Department staff who will visit the host organisation and conduct a monitoring visit.  Where there is a complaint, we investigate it speedily and examine the cause of the complaint.  As a consequence, the volume of complaints is very small.  </p><p>  In addition, there is a very active community in the various social media who voluntarily monitor closely every aspect of JobBridge and advise the Department.  We take all of the observations made to us and reflect them in the subsequent development of the scheme.  An offence or failure on the part of companies taking on interns cannot be compared to a Revenue offence, as by law, one must pay one's taxes.  What companies must do with this scheme is to give interns a quality experience and a proper internship.  A Revenue offence belongs to a different category.  Most of the firms offering internships are voluntary members of the scheme.  Where an intern has a problem, we will withdraw that intern if the host organisation is at fault and will find another placement for him or her.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900005#C00500"><p>I was delighted to launch JobsPlus yesterday in Waterford with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  The new scheme, JobsPlus, is a simplified scheme.  It is as easy as I could make it for employers and applications are made online.  The scheme replaces the employer job PRSI exemption scheme, which started in June 2010, and the Revenue job assist scheme which began in 1998.  Employers had said to me that while these schemes were very good, they were very clunky and the numbers of people applying for them were very small.  I went around the country and talked to employers and the result is that this new scheme is as simple as I can make it.</p><p>  There is an immediate and financial incentive to employers.  The incentive is payable on a monthly cash back basis over a two-year period while the employee is retained in full-time employment of over 30 hours per week.  In respect of recruits who are more than 12 months unemployed, but less than 24 months, the incentive is &euro;7,500.  This amounts to over &euro;300 per month.  For somebody who has been unemployed for two years or more, the incentive is &euro;10,000 over two years.  This is worth approximately &euro;400 per month.  This is a cash back or wage subsidy scheme paid directly to the employer in respect of a qualifying employee taken on.</p><p>  I travelled around the country and listened to employers in this regard.  Approximately 2,500 employers attended the nine or ten road shows I conducted around the country.</p><p>Most people said they had never heard of the schemes or that they were very awkward to implement.  This one is simple and, hopefully, it will be a help to the long-term unemployed, who now constitute a significant number of those unemployed in this country, and will also be a cash-back wage subsidy to employers who take on people.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>While conducting employer road shows throughout the country last year, I listened to the views of employers who perceived the old schemes as being complicated and burdensome.  The low take-up of the old schemes endorses these views, and that is why I have introduced a simple, easily understood and attractive scheme to encourage employers to recruit from the longer-term unemployed.</p><p> The State offers supports to private business through a number of Departments and agencies, the objective being to attract and retain investment and nurture indigenous industries to create employment and contribute to the Irish economy.  JobsPlus aims to alert employers to the talented pool of workers on the live register and encourage them to offer this group an employment opportunity.  The structure of JobsPlus, which biases the incentive in favour of employers who recruit long-term unemployed people, lessens the likelihood of economic deadweight associated with interventions of this nature.  While unemployment has stabilised recently, persons on the live register for a year or more now account for about 45.5% of all persons on the live register and this rate has been increasing slowly in recent months.</p><p> Every new full-time job supported under JobsPlus not only reduces social welfare payments made by the State but, critically, reduces the payments made to longer-term unemployed people, who evidence suggests are more likely to become long-term dependants of welfare.  In addition, these new full-time workers will now contribute to the Exchequer by paying tax and PRSI.</p><p> The introduction of JobsPlus is closely aligned with Government policy on job creation, which is central to overall Government policy, particularly in times of high unemployment.  The Government's activation strategy as presented in Pathways to Work outlines the overarching objective of the strategy, which is to maximise the number of new jobs to be filled by the unemployed.  This investment in jobs creates an additional stimulus, having a multiplier effect on the domestic economy and domestic demand which, as the Deputy knows, is crucial to our recovery.</p></reply>

The question is not meant as a criticism but simply as an expression of concern.  We must ensure that, as in other schemes, we do not end up with job displacement and abuse by employers.  The question focuses on what type of monitoring will be put in place to ensure there is no displacement and that it is not an incentive to employers to lay off a person and take on somebody who is long-term unemployed, which would defeat the purpose.  What steps will be taken to ensure businesses do not become dependent on this scheme?  Obviously, they will employ somebody for the two years and will receive a benefit, but they may then employ somebody else.  While this is obviously an emergency measure to reduce the number of long-term unemployed, which is welcome, there are concerns.  I ask what steps will be taken to deal with these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900006#D00300"><p>I welcome Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's support for JobsPlus as well as Deputy O'Dea's support for JobBridge.  With these schemes we are following Lord Keynes' advice that, at a time of depression and recession, the critical thing is to get more money circulating in the economy, and one of the best ways of doing that is to get as many of our people as possible back to work.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh knows as well as I do the number of people who used to be up at 6 a.m. on a lovely day like today, out working on construction sites and finishing only when the light went down.  In the period after the Anglo Irish Bank bailout and the bank guarantee, this country lost 250,000 jobs.  We fell off a cliff as regards employment.  Quite a number of those people are still out of employment because they were in construction.  They need to transfer, so this is an opportunity for them.</p><p>  One of my concerns is that when an employer looks at somebody's CV, if the person has been out of work for one, two or three years, the employer will wonder about the gap.  We try to fill that gap through education, training, community employment, job placement and JobBridge.  As service under any of those schemes is included in the calculation of one or two years out of employment, employers will be getting people who will potentially have a lot of experience in different areas.</p><p>  We will monitor the scheme by having employers apply online.  Obviously, if an employer has just had redundancies and reductions in its labour force, this is the kind of development that would perhaps indicate an attempt at displacement, and we would seek to exclude such employers.</p></speech>

I am interested in the uptake because I believe some businesses are in a position to employ additional people.  It will be interesting to see how the Minister's budget will cope if there is an intake, because I presume money has to be set aside to pay the approximately &euro;300 or &euro;400 a month the businesses will receive.  I have a concern in that, while we understand the benefits to the local economy and to the people who will take up positions, we do not want to end up with a tier of businesses that are dependent on a subsidy from the State to employ people on a continuous basis.  At some stage, somebody will have to make an assessment that such businesses need to break that dependency.  While they are not dependent as yet, it is something to watch for in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900006#D00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  As I said, this is a type of wage subsidy.  Many economists who believe in expansion and a Keynesian stimulus would agree with this, and both major parties in Germany agree with the use of wage subsidies.  Whether positions are taken up depends to some degree on the calibre of the people who apply, because an employer is not going to make a hiring decision based only on the wage subsidy element.</p><p>Nevertheless, the scheme does offer a good cash-back incentive for employers.  If they take on a person who has been on the register for one year or more, that subsidy will be &euro;312 per month.  Where the individual has been out of work for two years or more, the subsidy payable is more than &euro;400 per month.  Employers, for their part, must offer the employee at least 30 hours work per week and must abide by the minimum wage requirement and other aspects of labour relations law.</p><p> The two existing schemes were very well intentioned but did not have a very good take-up.  If we succeed in getting, say, 2,500 people off the live register and into employment under the scheme, the cost will be more than &euro;20 million.  At the same time, however, we will save on social welfare payments, which are a minimum of &euro;188 per week per individual.  If we do the maths we see that everybody can be a winner, including the individual who has not been in work, the employer who receives a wage subsidy, and the Department of Social Protection.  I will be much better thought of by the Minister for Finance as a consequence.</p></speech>

This represented an increase of 12% compared with the figure for June 2012, when there was 595 participants in drug rehabilitation projects in those divisions.  Progress has been made in a number of areas in ensuring the sustainability and development of drug rehabilitation projects operated under the community employment scheme.  This is in accordance with a commitment I gave when I took over the management of the scheme.</p><p>  An improved vacancy notification system for drug rehabilitation places is now in place and has been advised to all scheme sponsors.  This aims to improve the spread of draw-down of places within Dublin and across the country and increase awareness of these opportunities.  Priority was given in the application of the additional 2,000 places provided by the Department in this year's budget.  If Deputies have ideas on innovative means of providing additional places, I and my officials would be pleased to hear them.</p><p>  A referral process has been introduced to ensure appropriate referrals to the rehabilitation places.  The Department's referral protocol has been agreed with the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, NDRIC, and links with the emerging care and case management framework designed to promote an inter-agency response to the needs of people working towards rehabilitation.   Earlier this year a stakeholders group for drug rehabilitation schemes was established by the community employment policy unit within the Department.  This group acts as a consultative mechanism to assist the Department in identifying improvements to the current community employment drugs programme and advising on how we can attain efficiencies and value for money in the delivery of the programme.</p><p>  As part of this development, a drugs awareness briefing workshop was held recently for officers within the Department who are working with the drug rehabilitation schemes.  The workshop was delivered by key stakeholders from the statutory and community sectors, including scheme participants.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The objective was to inform and advise officers on developments in regard to drugs rehabilitation scheme places and to enhance their skills in working with the operators of the schemes. </p><p>  My Department is a member of the Oversight Forum on Drugs, the Department of Health's drug advisory group and NDRIC, and supports drug task force activities.

The financial review undertaken by her Department last October recognised the important role of the drug rehabilitation programme and recommended that it be a dedicated strand of the community employment scheme.  It further advised that there should be a more coherent framework to ensure sustainability and development.  I understand progress is being made in that regard, but will the Minister indicate how much consultation there has been with local bodies?  I am very familiar with these schemes in the inner city, the people who participate in them and the vital role they play in individuals' recovery.</p><p>They offer substantial learning paths but they are in disarray because of the changes to F&Aacute;S, FETAC, VECs and the NQAI.  Previously accepted programmes are now not getting project accreditation and are unable to register.  Can the process be speeded up so that they can register and get the accreditation they had in the past?</p></speech>

We took over community employment in January one year ago.  Traditionally, drug rehabilitation places are difficult to fill, and it is often difficult to fill even 1,000 places.  If Deputy O'Sullivan or other spokespersons have ideas about Dublin or other towns and cities where there are problems, I am open to discussing it.</p><p>  We set up a stakeholder-and-forum approach and we are seeking to educate the officials dealing with case management of individuals.  If someone has had serious drug addiction and a problem from a young age, the path to rehabilitation can be slow and lengthy.  We have provided for that.  For many people, the high point will be returning to education - and not simply to work - so that they can develop themselves over an extended period of time.  Now that the schemes are in the Department, there is greater capacity for progression up to a five-year period so that people can free themselves, their families and their communities from being dominated and ravaged by drugs and can move into education and getting qualifications.</p></speech>

They are being slowed down in the registration and accreditation process.  Community employment schemes are countrywide but I must make a point in respect of Dublin Central, which has twice the national average of lone parents and pockets of which have unemployment rates of 60% and higher.  Community employment schemes are vital.  Double payments is another issue.  In grappling with the issues facing us, some further incentives are needed to get people onto the schemes.  As well as what the schemes are doing, we must also consider the services they are providing, particularly child care.  Community employment schemes can provide training in child care, as well as the service, but they also provide employment in preschools and cr&egrave;ches.  There will be a need for more people with FETAC qualifications.  There is a real gap that could be addressed.</p></speech>

If there are specific issues, I will examine them.  With regard to child care, we are working on the idea that all child care places availed of lead to a FETAC level 5 or 6 qualification.  Getting to level 5 is a serious qualification in terms of the attractiveness of an individual for the employment opportunities available.  Our hope is for a progressive structure with social contact and rehabilitation experience.  The HSE can provide therapeutic input, which is separate to what the Department of Social Protection does.  There is also a movement into education, personal development and, ultimately, qualifications in areas in which employment is a possibility.</p></speech>

It delivers on the programme for Government commitment to create a co-ordinated employment and entitlements service and involves a multiannual programme of complex legislative, organisational, process, people and work change which runs to the end of 2014.  There are five strands to Pathways to Work, including engagement with people who are unemployed, the provision of activation places and opportunities, incentivisation to take up opportunities, work with employers and reform of institutions.  I am satisfied that we are making good progress on all of these elements.  Last year, for example, 68,600 clients participated in a group engagement process, while more than 40,000 clients have benefited from such engagements already in 2013.  Similarly, the Department conducted 158,000 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers last year.  The target is to complete 185,000 initial interviews in 2013.  Under the Intreo model being rolled out across the country, the process of engagement starts immediately when a client registers for a jobseeker's payment and is informed by a personal profile captured in respect of each individual.  That happens for everybody who signs up.</p><p>  I note that we are entirely dependent on the OPW for the update, refurbishment and supply of offices, where required.  For example, the Waterford offices are expected to be completed by the end of the year, which is a positive development.  </p><p>  With regard to the provision of the one-stop-shop element of the service, the first 12 Intreo offices are now live.  We are converting a further 31 offices to full Intreo service providers by the end of the year.  Many of our offices are offering Intreo services while they wait for physical refurbishment to take place.  We intend to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>  This element of the new service is dependent on the acquisition of new properties and the structural modification of existing properties and, therefore, has the longest lead time to completion.  The implementation of more intensive and rigorous case management requires that additional resources be devoted to the activation process.  In this regard, the implementation of the new Intreo process and the integration of previously separate functions in F&Aacute;S, the community welfare service and the Department of Social Protection are creating efficiencies that will enable staff to be redeployed to case management activities.  It is expected that 300 staff will be redeployed to these activities by the end of the year, which will enable the Department to continue to resource its activation agenda.  In parallel and in order to augment and complement this effort, the Department is considering greater use of contracted resources.  Towards this end, it issued a prior information notice of a potential tender competition on 28 June 2013.  Feedback on this notice will inform the further evaluation of the contracting option.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the redeployment of staff, combined with potential use of contracted resources, will enable the Department to complete its roll-out of the Pathways to Work model on schedule.  The particular concern expressed by the troika related to the first strand of the programme - the pace at which we are changing how we engage with people who are unemployed and the extent to which we can resource this new engagement model.</p></reply>

It is in the interests of every person in the country, regardless of political affiliation, that it is a resounding success.  The Minister stated she was satisfied with progress.  The scheme has been the subject of a number of reports, almost all of which have been critical.  The most recent has been the report of the European Commission which includes remarks to the effect that progress has not been sufficiently fast in the light of the urgency and scale of the problem; that the pace of reform and the resources mobilised are insufficient, given the scale and urgency of the problem; that the capacity to meaningfully engage with jobseekers remains short; that rapid decisions and actions on the possible outsourcing of some activation services are needed but that progress has also been slow; that special attention needs to be dedicated to reskilling, upskilling and training, in particular for the long-term unemployed and the youth; and that faster action is needed to reform employment support schemes to increase their effectiveness.  Taken together with the other reports, this is a damning indictment of progress in what is, in essence, a good scheme.  Is the Minister aware of these criticisms and how does she propose to respond to them?</p></speech>

The Deputy has visited a social welfare office operating the new scheme.  The key to the new scheme is having sufficient space to carry out the group engagements, at which we outline to people initially the services, schemes and opportunities the Department is making available.  We also set out for people in these engagements their obligation to co-operate with the Department to get back to work.  One-on-one interviews are then required to take place.  We have conducted large numbers of such interviews and more than met the targets set.  We need from the OPW offices at which we can conduct this business.  The new offices offer levels of privacy and provide for discreet appointments.</p><p>I am in constant touch with the OPW to ensure that it remains extremely supportive and on the case in providing us with the offices.</p><p> The troika has gone out to a number of the offices and has been very impressed.  A critical issue for the troika is that if, for instance, there was more growth in the economy - I note that a number of the partners to the troika, such as the IMF, have admitted that they got some of the ambitions for Ireland wrong and underestimated the effect of deflation - that would have an impact on the numbers getting back to work.  The troika arrived in town today and that discussion is ongoing with it.</p></speech>

One objective is that 75,000 persons would be taken off the live register during the lifetime of the Government and that the average waiting time on the live register would be reduced from 21 to 12 months.  What progress has been made to date on these objectives and how optimistic is the Minister that they will be realised?</p><p>  From what we were told on the last occasion, I realise that the outsourcing of some of this work to private contractors was happening to some extent even before the Government announcement.  The Minister then stated that the Government was studying how to go about further outsourcing.  What is the position in that regard?</p><p>  Finally, one can take a person off the live register, not only to get a job but to be re-educated or re-skilled.  Much of this re-education and re-skilling would take place in the fourth-level education sector where funding has been cut back and pupil-teacher ratios have increased.  How does that gel with the Government's objectives in Pathways to Work?</p></speech>

In the long run, when one is in a recession like we are, one of the best options is to educate people as well as possible.  Finland and Sweden had bank crashes - it must be said, not as bad as ours but nonetheless - in the 1980s and 1990s and found investing in education most important, and my Department is doing that.</p><p>  The second aspect involves expanding all of the different opportunities we have mentioned.  We have also issued a prior information notice, PIN, which is, essentially, to invite expressions of interest from organisations around the country, whether in the community, voluntary, public or private sectors, which may be interested in helping in the job and, ultimately, tendering for some of the work to help to get people back to work.  As I told the Deputy previously, we also have been studying what has been happening in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, but particularly Sweden and Finland which had their own bank crashes and deep recessions, to learn from those who brought themselves back from a difficult position to a prosperous position currently.</p></speech>

I am very anxious to highlight the significance of the expenditure in local economies, in every town, city and village.  Although negotiations remain to be concluded, An Post's selection as preferred bidder for the new contract will continue to contribute to the vibrancy of both the rural and urban economies.  However, at this juncture, An Post does not provide a standard bank account.  The Department of Social Protection is a key player in the payment services sector, with over 87 million payments issued to customers in 2012.  It envisages an environment in which social welfare payments delivered to customers will ultimately provide an electronic option for everyone.  This goal is in line with wider Government policies. </p><p> It is noted in the strategy for financial inclusion report that the post office network has the potential to play a key role in the delivery of standard bank accounts.  As the roll-out of the standard bank account is being driven by the Department of Finance, it will be a matter for that Department and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to work with all potential providers, including An Post, in the coming months to optimise the nationwide availability of the standard bank account.</p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p> Supporting achievement of financial inclusion for customers is of fundamental importance to the Department.  In this respect, it is working with the financial inclusion working group established by the Department of Finance to support access to the new standard bank account.  The Department's payment strategy is contingent on the roll-out of the standard bank account.  The combination of the national payments plan, the standard bank account and the Department's payment strategy can, as three interdependent initiatives, realise tangible benefits in delivering a more efficient payments landscape and grow opportunities and benefits for consumers and business alike in the medium term.  My Department will continue to work with the Department of Finance and the financial inclusion working group to progress the roll-out of the standard bank account.</p></reply>

Most of them are probably social welfare recipients who are the customers of the Minister's Department.  While recognising the role of An Post in facilitating payments and its success in becoming the preferred bidder, I also know that the Department's preference is to move to electronic payments, with the aim of having only 3% payments made in cash by 2017.  This will have very serious implications for the recipients of social welfare payments and also for An Post and the viability of its network.  The basic payment account is very important for the recipients of social welfare payments who could continue to access their payments through the use of this account at the post office.  The Department should have a role in the roll-out of the basic payment account to ensure post offices can provide that service for the Department's clients and that the system works.  I ask the Minister to ensure the Department of Finance will make this happen.</p></speech>

However, An Post does not have the standard bank account facility which, perhaps, should have been developed a long time ago.  It now has the opportunity to possibly work in conjunction with whoever might be its preferred partners.</p><p>  I draw to the attention of the Deputy another element of An Post which is important to me.  My Department asks all new jobseekers to collect their payments in person.  This is of very significant assistance in deterring fraud.  People have to show up and cannot have someone else collect payments for them.  An Post potentially has an important role.  For example, the postmaster or postmistress knows everyone in the local area.  This knowledge provides a front-line of defence against fraud.  This is a service which all providers cannot offer.  The electronic fund transfers are significantly cheaper.  I recently visited Milltown Malbay where I spoke to a number of postmasters and postmistresses.  They told me that on Thursdays and Fridays, particularly in the winter months, there was very little activity, except for people coming to collect retirement pensions, for example, who then bought their groceries in the shops.</p></speech>

It is important from a social protection perspective to provide the basic payment account through the post office network.  The recent pilot study carried out by the Department of Finance produced very disappointing results because An Post was not actually included in the pilot programme.  There is great distrust of the banks.  This has been very well rehearsed in the House and we know the reason.  An Post would allow those with no bank accounts but who are clients of the Department of Social Protection to receive electronic payments.  This would reduce the costs of the Department and retain an element of security in terms of identifying fraud.</p></speech>

Perhaps they include people who, wisely, learned not to trust banks too much.  It is partly a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>  In Africa, for instance, almost all banking is done by telephone.  There has been an enormous change in how banking is carried out nowadays.  If the basic bank account, as committed to by the Minister for Finance, is developed in conjunction with a countrywide operator such as An Post, the system will reach into every parish in the country.  It affords an opportunity to be a social and economic vehicle in the way we just described.  I hope the Minister for Finance takes this into account in the context of the deliberations of his Department.  I do make my views known.</p></speech>

As part of a range of initiatives to prevent and detect fraud, the unit participates in multi-agency vehicle checks, MAVCs, on an ongoing basis.  Members are probably familiar with them.  These are primarily set up by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are planned in consultation with other participating agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and my Department.  MAVCs facilitate an approach whereby all agencies can comprehensively identify individuals engaged in vehicle tax evasion, road traffic irregularities or social welfare and tax fraud in particular locations.</p><p>  In line with powers that are specifically provided for in social welfare legislation, SIU officers participate in these checkpoints in the detection and prevention of social welfare fraud.  The general focus of inquiries is related to individuals driving commercial vehicles - haulage, transport and taxi - including those at taxi ranks at airports.  Where inquiries suggest that irregularities have occurred, they are pursued further.  A significant number of cases are subject to court procedures subsequently.</p><p>  Statistics on MAVCs undertaken by the SIU have only been collated with effect from 2010.  In the period 2010 to date, there was a total of 230 MAVCs.

In the southern and south-eastern regions, a total of 28 checkpoints were put in place with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue in 2010, and there were 29 in 2011 and 29 in 2012.  In the Dublin region, no checkpoints were put in place in 2010, and a total of 18 were put in place in 2011 and 14 in 2012.  Up to the end of May 2013, a total of 24 checkpoints were put in place across the Department's regional network.  I believe that these checks are a very useful element of the overall control activities undertaken by the SIU and they facilitate a joined-up and integrated approach to the investigation of a range of offences.</p></reply>

Many hours were spent on this issue, with 230 checkpoints over two and a half years.  I hope this will have the benefit of not only recouping money to the Department but also of discouraging others.  Will the Minister outline the number of people who have been charged as a consequence of these checkpoints?  Do Garda immigration officials also participate at these checkpoints?  It has been indicated in the past there was significant fraud in the immigration area.  Sometimes the truth is that this is not the case.</p></speech>

I refer to a number of examples.  Members will be familiar with inspections at taxi ranks which are popular with legitimate taxi drivers, both at the airport and other ranks.  At an MAVC the driver of a Volkswagen Caddy was interviewed by the SIU.  He described himself as a self-employed IT engineer working on contract to various companies with no employees.  On checking with Revenue, he had made no return since 2006.  Revenue carried out an audit, agreed a settlement of &euro;30,500 and the individual concerned made a payment in full within one month of being interviewed.  He was obviously fully occupied but not paying tax.  Elsewhere, a passenger in a van being driven by someone in the building trade admitted that he was working for the driver and gave a false name.  Further investigations revealed his true identity and the employer co-operated to give details of his earnings.  He was in receipt of social welfare payments and subsequently interviewed under caution.  His case has been recommended for prosecution.  People who have been out sick sign off soon after being stopped at a checkpoint.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute; take over if there is evidence of a criminal offence and prosecutions take time, but a number of people have appeared before the courts.  For example, a social welfare customer with a Dublin address  was interviewed.  He was driving a van with the name of a courier service on the side.  He said he was too busy at work and had not got a chance to sign off.  He then signed off, but unless documentation such as invoices is found in the van, it may be impossible to prosecute.  Perhaps his brother had just given him a job the previous day.</p><p>In that case, however, his jobseeker's allowance would have been terminated.  If the issue appears to be more serious, it will be the subject of investigation and the Garda and the tax authorities may be involved.</p></speech>

There are approximately 84,000 rent supplement recipients, of whom more than 53,000 have been in receipt of the supplement for more than 18 months.  The Government has provided more than &euro;403 million for the scheme in 2013.</p><p>  In 2012 the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rent assistance for persons with a long-term housing need, namely, for more than 18 months, from the Department to housing and local authorities under a new scheme, the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Officials in the Department are working closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to assist with the necessary work required to introduce the new scheme in terms of enabling the priority drafting of the required legislation, initiating the business planning process, including dealing with all of the IT changes required, examining the possibilities for providing for direct deduction from social welfare payments, including an amendement to the household budgeting facility, completing the economic assessment and initiating the piloting of the HAP scheme.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has recently commenced a business processing development exercise to determine the business processes and officials from the Department of Social Protection are fully engaged in this process.  The outcome of the initial exercise will provide an indication of the requirements and resources required for the implementation of the HAP scheme for both the Department and the housing authorities.</p></reply>

As was stated, this was supposed to be a short-term solution.  A person who is homeless and cannot afford to rent privately is entitled to support from the Government to rent appropriate accommodation.  However, even though this is supposed to be a short-term solution, currently there are 53,000 people who have been in receipt of rent supplement for more than 18 months.  Last year, as the Minister noted, there were 85,000 in receipt of rent supplement, at a cost to the Exchequer of more than &euro;400 million.  Regardless of whether we mean the old rent supplement scheme or the new, preferable, HAP scheme, what will happen to this large cohort?  Are we going to continue indefinitely in a situation where we depend on private landlords to provide the necessary accommodation, paying a king's ransom into their pockets each year?  Does the Government have a social housing policy to provide sufficient social housing for the people concerned to enable them to come off these schemes within a shorter timeframe than 18 months?</p></speech>

The scheme then migrated, particularly during the period of office of the Deputy's Government, to provide a general catch-all housing supplement which, as the Deputy noted, was far removed from what had been intended originally.  The Government is now returning it to what it was meant to be originally, namely, a short-term temporary payment.  On the other hand, that requires local authorities throughout the country to update and revise their differential rent schemes.</p><p>There are at least 66 separate computer systems in different local authorities dealing with housing.  If the Deputy thinks about the amount and variety of local authority accommodation available, the age of the people involved, the size and composition of the families, there are many variables and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would like the Department of Social Protection to deduct that rent at source.  We can only do that if the different local authorities can nominate to us the correct amount of the rent to be deducted.  As the Deputy knows, local authorities have built up significant arrears difficulties, many of which have nothing to do with people on rent supplement but they have been anxious to see the Department of Social Protection help people to pay their rent by direct deduction at source through the Department.  That, however, is a very onerous requirement whereby we will have to work out the IT involved.  There is huge work going on in that respect.</p></speech>

Will progress be made before the budget this year or when is it expected that the new system will be in place because it is a transfer of payment?  Will this payment also allow for those people who do not currently qualify for rent allowance?  Many people on low rent are now living at home, often in cramped conditions, with family, and have no option because there is a shortfall in social housing and a long waiting list, and because they cannot qualify for that allowance and rents in some areas of the city continue to increase.  Will it capture that cohort of people who do not qualify for rent allowance and who qualify to be on the housing list?  There is a difference between them.</p></speech>

What is important from the point of view of the Department of Social Protection is that one of the biggest poverty unemployment traps arises when somebody on rent supplement is offered employment and loses the whole of the rent supplement whereas if they are on the RAS or move to the HAP they will be provided with accommodation via the local authority and will be on a differential rent scheme.  If they are offered a job they will be able to calculate according to their family circumstance what the likely increase in the rent will be, just as if they were in a traditional local authority programme.  That is the enormous advantage of this kind of scheme to Irish society and to me as Minister for Social Protection because it removes one of the unemployment traps.</p><p>  The local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have committed us to beginning several pilots.  I hope to see that as soon as possible but certainly no later than the start of the new year.  I do not want to underestimate how challenging it is to bring in this new system.  People who have served on local authorities and been involved in the complexity of housing cases will understand that it involves a large IT commitment for the local authorities.  Returning to Deputy O'Dea's point, the provision of additional social housing is critically important to deal with the difficulties of the people he has instanced looking for housing.</p></speech>

I do understand the complexities of transferring from the rent supplement scheme to the HAP scheme but the elephant in the room is the lack of social housing.  Under whatever scheme the Minister assists people the lack of social housing is a constant.  There is a gross lack of social housing at the moment.</p><p>Does the Minister agree with Social Justice Ireland and others that the Government&rsquo;s provision for 5,000 extra social houses in last year&rsquo;s budget only scratched the surface?  In her previous incarnation as a spokesperson, I recall the Minister expressing the hope and aspiration that there would be a social dividend from the National Asset Management Agency.

Yes, there is a role for enhanced investment in social housing, particularly at a time when we need stimulus programmes.  We need to see some of those in the construction industry who have been long-term unemployed get back into employment.  Under the recent stimulus programme my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, provided &euro;50 million for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for insulation retrofitting of local authority houses.</p><p>  When I was on the other side of the House, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea&rsquo;s late predecessor and my constituency colleague, Brian Lenihan, accepted my social dividend amendment to the NAMA legislation.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning are actively pursuing this matter with NAMA.  One of the problems for NAMA is that many of the properties it has available are not necessarily in areas where people wish to live and some are in unfinished estates.  There are ongoing active discussions on some properties which would provide good accommodation, particularly in major urban centres.</p></speech>

Parental leave entitles parents who qualify to take a period of up to 18 weeks of unpaid leave from employment, generally in respect of children aged up to eight years.  While there is no provision for a social insurance based payment for periods of parental leave, employees may be entitled to credited contributions to maintain their social insurance record for the period.</p><p>  The introduction of paid parental leave, or paternity leave, would have significant cost implications for employers, the Exchequer and the social insurance fund.  In addition, introducing a paternity benefit payment would depend on establishing an underlying entitlement to statutory paternity leave in the first instance and would require legislation on the part of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The potential for introducing paternity leave was formally considered in the review of the Parental Leave Act, published in 2002, but the working group concerned did not reach a consensus.  Similarly, a working group set up under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, examined the provision of support in this area but did not identify an agreed way forward.</p><p>  The Department is also in regular contact with the Department of Justice and Equality regarding issues on maternity, adoptive and health and safety leave.  In these ongoing contacts general issues regarding the provision of supports for fathers are discussed.  In this context, the potential for development of the already substantial supports provided for parents are kept under review.</p></reply>

If it were available, it is estimated that half of all fathers would take some paternity leave.  I favour the idea in principle.  The cost of maternity leave is about &euro;300 million.  The difficulty with previous working groups was agreeing how such leave would be provided for and who would pay for it.  There would have to be an agreed system of payment if it were to be brought in.  However, one alternative for fathers in some occupations is to take the unpaid parental leave obligation.  I am aware that a number of employers currently have <i>de facto</i> arrangements and pay fathers up to three days' leave on the birth of a baby.  I know the Deputy's question refers to a wider provision, but that would have to be funded.  We could look at that issue again in the future.  With the current state of the economy, it might be difficult to fund it.  An argument was made before that employers should fund it, but they had an issue with that in the past.</p></speech>

If we were to change the system, there would be very significant issues of administration.  None the less, especially as the economy recovers over time, it might be something we would consider as a socially progressive measure that would give more recognition to the role of fathers.  My colleagues from Scandinavia find that the provision of paternity leave underscores for employers the fact that babies have two parents and that their obligations and commitments to bringing up their children ought to be recognised.</p></speech>

There are currently some 12,000 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, for which the Government has provided almost &euro;42 million in 2013.  To ensure that those who are in mortgage difficulty engage with their lenders under the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and avail of its forbearance arrangements, from June 2012 the mortgage interest supplement is not payable until applicants have agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months. This measure is in line with the recommendations of both the Department's Review of the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme, published in July 2010, and the report of the mortgage arrears and personal debt group chaired by Mr. Hugh Cooney and published in November 2010.</p><p>  The process acknowledges that it is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower to address financial difficulties as speedily and effectively as circumstances allow.  The underlying principle is to ensure the MARP functions alongside State supports.  The MARP provides protection for customers without the need for State intervention.  The Central Bank has introduced a revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears, or CCMA, which came into effect on 1 July 2013.  I am satisfied that the mortgage interest supplement continues to provide suitable support within the revised CCMA framework and I have no plans to amend the conditions of the scheme at this time.</p></reply>

As the Minister pointed out, only 12,000 homeowners are in receipt of it, yet we have almost 100,000 people in mortgage arrears, many of whom have lost their jobs.  The reality is that some of those people do not have the economic wherewithal to sustain an arrangement with their lenders for 12 months of interest-only payments.  They are too poor to do that, so if the Department does not give them mortgage interest supplement they are in danger of losing their homes and then coming back to the Department looking for rent supplement.  It does not make any sense to me.  A number of homeowners in my area are in that situation.  The process needs to be reformed straight away.</p></speech>

It is pretty obvious that anything the banks are doing in this area is not substantial enough.  The decision not to give people mortgage interest supplement when they need it will drive more of them into it.  They are not getting the money when they need it.  The supplement is being offered after 12 months, but many of these people will lose their homes in the next 12 months and it will not be any good to them.  There is no logic in not helping people who could work their way of their difficulties.  It was fine to give &euro;67 billion to the banks, but the Government will not help people retain their homes by giving them a bit of relief when they need it, and not later after they lose their homes.</p></speech>

The critical issue is that there must be a solution between the borrower and the lender - namely, the bank and the person who is in difficulty.  The Department of Social Protection spends &euro;42 million on mortgage interest supplement that is then passed on to the banks.  If a person receives a supplement indefinitely, as can be the case with rent supplement, he or she can end up in an unemployment trap in which it can be difficult to take up a job due to dependence on the mortgage interest supplement.  That is one of the downsides to how the scheme operates.</p><p>  We have worked very closely with the various agencies to ensure that the focus is on a sustainable resolution and not simply on something that actually locks a person into not being able to take up a job.  That was an unintended consequence of how the scheme worked.  If the banks engage with the individual, which they are required to do, then, if the individual has lost his or her job, he or she may be eligible for the supplement.  Twelve thousand people get the supplement at a cost of around &euro;42 million.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900018#Q00400"><p>The mortgage arrears crisis shows no sign of abating.  We heard at the weekend about significant disagreements between the Financial Regulator and the banks regarding the content of a sustainable resolution package for mortgage arrears and the pace of progress being made by the banks.  The economic impact of the mortgage arrears crisis is severe.  It is hammering consumer confidence and undermining the prospect of a recovery in the domestic economy.  More than 95,000 people are now in arrears of more than 90 days.  The Government's decision to amend the code of conduct places a substantial number - more than half - of these individuals in a serious situation in respect of the banks and the approaches they may make.  There are genuine fears about an impending wave of family home repossessions.  People are very worried.</p><p>  Banks were supposed to have already achieved a 20% target of providing sustainable solutions to people in mortgage arrears.  I ask the Taoiseach to update me on the extent to which that target, which was due to be reached in June, was met.  They are supposed to reach a target of 50% by the end of this year.  My party tabled a motion for constructive debate this evening.  We are calling on the Government to amend substantially the code of conduct to give greater protection to those who are in arrears by, for example, establishing a clear definition of what constitutes an unsustainable mortgage, ensuring a minimum protected level of income for people in arrears and reinstating the 12 month moratorium on commencing repossession proceedings.  We would ensure that banks record all calls made with those who are borrowing from them lest there be any accusation of aggressive or unacceptable behaviour.  We would oblige a bank seeking an order for repossession to first obtain written confirmation from the Central Bank that it has exhausted every other course of action available to it to keep the family in its home.</p><p>  Does the Taoiseach not accept that it is now time for the Government to intervene directly to offer protection to those in mortgage arrears?  Can he outline to us the nature of the disagreement between the Financial Regulator and the banks and outline what he believes a sustainable resolution would comprise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900018#Q00500"><p>A sustainable resolution is to arrive at a situation whereby a person currently in mortgage distress or arrears enters an agreement with the lender that the person in that situation can be sustainable, in other words, can meet the requirements over a period in a different set of circumstances.  Deputy Martin raised two issues, the arrears and the progress being made by the banks on the restructuring of mortgages.  He says it is time for the Government to get involved but we have been involved for quite some time.  If there had been involvement previously we certainly would not have the mess we are now dealing with.  All of the tools are now in place to allow for the accelerated working out of mortgage arrears.</p><p>  Banks and borrowers are now required to use these tools to reach a fair, sustainable and affordable solution to mortgage arrears.  The Deputy and I both know the pressure this causes for people everywhere around the country.  There is no doubt that over the last number of years there has been insufficient activity.  That is why the Central Bank announced its new targets.  These targets will be strictly monitored and enforced so that banks can reach sustainable solutions for families in mortgage arrears.  The Governor, Prof. Honohan, set out the conditions and he expects to see recommendations from banks against the performance on the targets that have been set.  If the Central Bank requires further powers, the Government will always be available to deal with that.</p><p>  As of the end of March, 79,689 mortgage accounts were categorised as restructured, of which 53% were not in arrears at the end of quarter one.  Of the percentage of the total stock in arrears, both early and 90 days plus, 37,454 or 26% were classified as restructured.  This does not mean that 47% have fallen back into arrears because restructured accounts in arrears include accounts that were in arrears prior to restructuring, where the balance in arrears had not been eliminated, as well as accounts that are in arrears under the current restructuring arrangement.</p><p>  The public targets have a number of elements.  Quarterly targets have been set in respect of the number of sustainable solutions proposed to customers.  The application of the targets commenced at the end of quarter two of 2013 and are being enhanced in subsequent quarters, with 2014 targets to be set in due course.  It is expected that 50% of mortgage holders will have their restructured proposals dealt with by the end of this year and the remainder in 2014.  Progressively more demanding quarterly targets will be set for the conclusion of the sustainable solutions.</p><p>  I want to be clear with the Deputy that no targets are being set for repossession of homes.  That has to be the last resort and the conditions state that clearly.  These targets are deliberately demanding and they are designed to ensure that the vast majority of families in this country will be offered solutions that do not involve house repossessions.  We all know how important that is.</p></speech>

Does he accept the proposals we are tabling tonight on strengthening the code of conduct in order to protect those in mortgage arrears?  I outlined a series of constructive steps we believe should be taken to give genuine protection to those who are in arrears.  The Government's only intervention to date has been designed with the Central Bank to facilitate more repossessions of family homes.  There is no other way of assessing the situation.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013 has been changed to facilitate repossessions without conditions.  The Government has diluted many of the protections contained in the previous code of conduct in regard to the level of contact banks are allowed with customers and other areas.  It has also reduced those entitled to mortgage subsidy.  The entire agenda has been to put families in arrears into further jeopardy in terms of their relationship with the banks.  There is a disconnect between official utterances and the reality on the ground as experienced by people in mortgage arrears.  This is particularly the case for those with equity in their houses, in regard to whom the banks appear to be adopting a more aggressive approach despite the fact that they have the capacity to take up split mortgages or other alternatives.  A statistic that speaks for itself is that only 140 split mortgages have been agreed in the last two years.  That sums up the inertia and lack of action that have allowed the problem to worsen.</p><p>  The Taoiseach did not answer my question on the targets.  What percentage of sustainable solutions was achieved by the end of June?  It was meant to be 20%.  What is the actual figure?</p></speech>

We learned last week from Alan Dukes, a former leader of Fine Gael, that he was aware of the existence and content of the Anglo tapes.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said they did not know about the existence of these tapes, but clearly, it is in the public interest that they should know.  Alan Dukes says he knew about them.  What did he do about the existence and content of these tapes which have angered and scandalised so many ordinary decent people?  Does the Taoiseach know whether he reported them to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank?  I cannot believe Fianna F&aacute;il did not know what was going on and that the Government did not know either.  Alan Dukes is a former leader of the Fine Gael Party.  He says he was aware of the tapes and their content, but we are led to believe he did not tell anyone.  Who was he supposed to tell?  Who are the other public interest directors who are still in place?  To whom are they supposed to report?</p></speech>

As a public interest director, I had words with the former leader of our party in respect of our party's view that Anglo Irish Bank should be wound down.  I listened to the interview given by Alan Dukes last week and he clearly indicated that he had given all of the documentation of which he had possession to the Garda, in respect of an inquiry following the serving of warrants by the Garda, for transmission to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the preparation of books of evidence.  He confirmed that this documentation had been handed on by Anglo Irish Bank.  He also confirmed, in respect of the decision to be made by the Government, that as a public interest director he was more than willing to come before any such inquiry or committee to answer any question put to him regarding his knowledge, information and responsibility as a public interest director of that former bank.</p></speech>

I asked him what was the function of public interest directors.  They may have been appointed by the previous Government, but they were retained in place by the Government.  What is their function?  It would only be news if Alan Dukes had said he would not go forward to any inquiry.  He has stated the obvious.  What is his function?  These directors are public interest directors.  To whom are they supposed to report in the public interest?  It is very clear that they are not acting in the public interest.  It is my strong suspicion that they are there to act in the political interest and keep the <i>status quo</i> intact.  That is clear if we look at the record.  I remember that the Taoiseach once said he would keep a report card on Ministers.  He has got rid of that idea for Ministers, but surely if he looked at the report card on these folk, he would see there was room to change the system.  We were told they had been appointed to act as watchdogs for ordinary decent citizens.  That was the spin behind it, but, clearly, they are lapdogs.  What is the Taoiseach going to do?  Some of these directors are still in place.  They are there on his watch and he cannot blame Fianna F&aacute;il for them.  They are described as public interest directors.  I asked what their function was, but the Taoiseach did not answer.  I would like him to answer that question now.  Will he tell us to whom the public directors in place in the other banks are supposed to report back?</p></speech>

Whatever information this particular public interest director has, he is quite willing to talk on it during any investigation or at any committee or inquiry we set up.  It is important to remind the Deputy that Mr. Dukes, as he would be well aware, cannot cross over into the independent work ongoing in the context of the preparation for criminal trials in respect of which charges have been preferred against a number of individuals.  An inquiry or investigation is one process, but the criminal process is independent of it and operates through the courts where justice is dispensed by a judge and jury.  Alan Dukes has already pointed out publicly that the information available on the tapes was transmitted to the Garda and that he will have no difficulty, as a public interest director, in attending Oireachtas committees, inquiries or investigations or whichever option the Government decides to follow in due course.</p></speech>

He has been taken home by his family to his home in Trim, County Meath and although weak, he is continuing his protest.  A number of Deputies from different parties, including Deputies Barry Cowen, Willie O'Dea, Clare Daly and others, have spoken to this man and tried to persuade him to end his protest.  I have a doctor's note which was sent to me at 2.09 p.m. today.  It states this man's blood pressure is extremely low at 78/67 and that he has lost 29 lbs in weight.</p><p>This was not to be my Leaders' Question today but I was approached by his partner, his mother, his father and his friends, who asked me to ask the Taoiseach to intervene.  There are two questions.  Tony Rochford is the man in question and he is self-employed.  As we are aware, if a person is self-employed and unable to work, it is almost impossible to receive State support.  In other words, most people who are self-employed and lose their jobs cannot receive unemployment benefit.  This is an ongoing issue that was to be dealt with over recent years but it has not been dealt with.  Under present economic circumstances, this has driven many people, through no fault of their own, into dire financial hardship, where they are relying on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other agencies for support.  Will the Taoiseach address this problem?</p></speech>

Clearly, this is a matter we can have examined.  I do not know whether Deputy Cowen or Deputy Daly have an up-to-date set of facts about Mr. Rochford's financial circumstances but, from what Deputy Halligan has said, first, he is entitled as a citizen to a deferral of his property tax, depending on his circumstances, and he would be entitled to have that examined.  Second, as I can certify to the Deputy, there are very substantial numbers who receive jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance who were self-employed and might have lost their job, got work again and lost it again, as, unfortunately, happened to so many thousands during the course of the economic crisis.  I would hate to think that a citizen of our country would be outside the gates of the Houses of Parliament in a situation where he is on hunger strike and where we cannot deal with the circumstances.  We need to know what those circumstances are and I would be very happy to have them examined.</p></speech>

This is inevitable under the present economic circumstances, with the hardship that hundreds of thousands of people are feeling.  My worry is, as it has always been, and I have spoken about this in regard to many issues at public meetings, that somebody might go to the end because they are at the end of their tether with regard to how they are being treated and dealt with - people on unemployment benefit, people on disability and people without mobility.  This is my worry.  Many of us in this Chamber would not wish that to be the case and, as I said, a number of Deputies met this man and urged him not to do this, and it is not what I would want him to do.  However, the harsh reality of everyday life in Ireland today is that people have come to the bridge and they are at the end of their tether.  I believe it is inevitable that, if this ongoing economic crisis continues, where we continue to allow almost 700,000 people to live in poverty and abandon half the population-----</p></speech>

At least 100,000 people have had direct contact with the Department of Social Protection in one form or another and many of those were involved in the construction sector.  One of the changes that was made concerned the age-old problem we always had in this country, where a construction worker lost a job and it used to take six to eight weeks to get back on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  That has all been changed and if a former construction worker now gets a job for, say, three weeks, five weeks or ten weeks, the payment is just suspended and renewed when the work ceases.</p><p>  It is also a fact that the level of social welfare payment and remuneration in this country actually reduces the risk of poverty by up to 60%, which is by far the highest of any of the European Union countries.  Having spoken to some of the people of Spain, Portugal and Greece recently, I know there is no social welfare at all there after a two-year period.  Whatever state we have been in here in Ireland, at least the level of assistance reduces the risk of poverty by up to 60%.</p></speech>

William Leahy, president of Boston College, to receive an honorary degree in law and deliver the commencement address at the 2013 graduation ceremony.  This was a very prestigious honour, particularly as Boston College is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year.  Much of its history and development as an institution of higher education have been shaped by ties to Ireland.  I was pleased to accept the honorary degree and deliver the commencement address on behalf of all the people of Ireland on Monday, 20 May.  I also addressed the annual commencement eve dinner at the college on Sunday, 19 May, with a number of other guests who were also receiving honorary degrees.</p><p>  In addition, I was invited as guest of honour to a dinner on Saturday, 18 May at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library to mark the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's visit to Ireland in 1963.  The JFK Presidential Library and Museum is the national official memorial to the late President.  The dinner was hosted by the library foundation and also attended by Senator and Mrs. Paul Kirk.  </p><p>  During my visit to Boston I also visited the memorial site of the Boston marathon bombings at Copley Square, with Commissioner of Police Edward Davis, where I placed a floral tribute as a gesture of respect to the dead and injured.  I took the opportunity during my various speaking engagements in Boston to praise the courage, dignity and strength shown by Bostonians following the bombings.</p><p>  On the Monday morning I addressed a business breakfast organised by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and attended by senior executives from a range of companies with business interests in Ireland and the United States.  I highlighted the strengths of Ireland as a location in which to do business and for companies looking to internationalise or expand their existing geographical footprint.  My tight schedule did not allow for bilateral meetings with any of the companies present at the business breakfast.</p><p>  This was a relatively short visit and there were no bilateral political meetings scheduled in my programme.  I did not have any meeting regarding Ireland's corporation tax rate, nor did my programme include specific meetings with representatives of the undocumented Irish groups.  However, as I previously reported to the House, I had a number of meetings on the issue of immigration reform during my March visit to Washington.  There has since been significant progress on this issue generally in the United States.  I very much welcome the recent vote by the US Senate to approve a Bill that provides for comprehensive reform of that country's immigration system.  This is a very positive development that takes us another step closer to addressing the problems faced by undocumented Irish emigrants.  I strongly welcome the provisions in the Bill to address the concerns of our undocumented and the specific E3 provisions for Ireland that provide a legal pathway for the future.  I am also pleased that the Bill includes provisions to allow for a continuation of the summer J1 visa programme that has meant so much to successive generations of young Irish people.  The focus will now move to the House of Representatives and the Government will continue to follow the issue closely and remain engaged with key stakeholders.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, travels to Washington this week for further discussions on the issue.</p><p>  I did not have any detailed discussion regarding the Boston College history papers during the visit.  As the House is aware, this matter may be the subject of further legal proceedings and, as such, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900021#T01300"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  He indicated that he had very little time for bilateral meetings during his recent visit to Boston.  I am somewhat concerned that he did not meet representatives of the undocumented Irish, as requested by them.  It is important that he and Ministers should make time for meetings with these groups when visiting the United States in order to get a sense of the impact on people's lives of the lack of movement or momentum on immigration reform during the years.  The people concerned and their families are living in traumatic circumstances and would certainly have appreciated a meeting with the Taoiseach.  I hope he will accommodate them during future visits.  It is important, too, that the T&aacute;naiste would allow the all-party delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade to accompany him to any meeting he has this week with Members of Congress.</p><p>  The Belfast oral history project papers relate to a very sensitive and important issue.  For the researchers and designers of the project - Anthony McIntyre, a former member of the IRA, and the journalist Ed Moloney - it was an endeavour to get to the truth of the various operations and the murder and mayhem which took place over a long period.  Arising from that Belfast project is a very fine publication by Mr. Moloney, <i>Voices From the Grave</i>, a book which every Member of this House should read.  It sets out in great detail the appalling atrocities committed by the IRA and loyalist gangs and exposes many truths about the situation in Northern Ireland during that period.</p><p>  There have been moves by the PSNI and the British authorities to seek the recovery of some of these recordings to help them in pursuing their investigation into the abduction and murder of Jean McConville.  It is a great pity that we are nowhere near a resolution of that crime such a long time after the event.  Mrs. McConville was a widow struggling to bring up ten children when she was abducted and murdered, a crime to which the IRA admitted in a statement.  As Mr. Moloney's book outlines, Brendan Hughes who was a key member of the Belfast brigade of the IRA at the time pulls no punches in his claims of who ordered that killing.  There have been various calls for people to assist in the discovery of the truth in this matter.  Mr. Hughes has gone to his reward, but he made clear his views on the claims by the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in of having had no involvement in the IRA and so on.  Mr. Moloney's book is quite explicit in terms of the quotations by Mr. Hughes taken from the tapes.  Some of the recordings have been secured by the PSNI, but others have not.</p><p>  It is a difficult and sensitive situation in that the individuals who recorded the interviews with former combatants were allowed to do so on the understanding the recordings would be protected until after the deaths of the individuals concerned.  However, the fate of the disappeared is one of the unresolved issues of the peace process, particularly the murder of Jean McConville.  Those who have any information on these matters should make a statement to the police.  Moreover, I would invite the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in to make a statement to the House on this matter, given the gravity of what occurred and the gravity and scale of the allegations set out in a publication which has been in circulation for some time.  If the same allegations were made against any other Member of this House, there would be clarion calls for him or her to confirm to the House and the public the veracity or otherwise of those rather blunt allegations.</p><p>  It is a very sordid tale and I am surprised that the Taoiseach did not have any discussion on the matter during his trip to the United States.  I have met one of the authors of the project and, without casting aspersions on anybody in this House, it is fair to say he has genuine fears for his life as a consequence of the release of the tapes.  At the same time, it is my view that nobody should stand in the way of the PSNI in endeavouring to pursue its investigation into these matters to the fullest extent possible.  The former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Mrs. Nuala O'Loan, made it very clear, having carried out her own investigation into the matter, that there was no evidence to sustain the allegation that Jean McConville had been an informant.</p><p>Deputy Adams owes it to the House to make a comment on it.</p></speech>

It was a very short visit and the tightness of the schedule meant we could not have formal bilateral meetings.  Like every Member, I share the view of the necessity of doing something about the undocumented Irish.  I am in regular contact with a number of people in the United States about the progress of the Bill and through the Senate.  The problem will be in the House of Representatives.  We continuously get a stream of queries and requests for information about what is happening.  It may be that it will have to go to a conference committee of the Senate and the House, depending on the issues raised by representatives in Congress.  The point made by the Deputy is clear and there is no disagreement in the House.</p><p>  In formal visits to the United States, we try to fit in meetings with the representatives of the undocumented.  The T&aacute;naiste is going out this week to have meetings with Congress people on the Hill in respect of the Bill that will come before them.  With regard to taking the advice of the representatives on the best thing to do, we will be happy to be associated with that work.  Through the embassy and the range of public representatives from all parties, we are anxious to do that.</p><p>  I read <i>Voices from the Grave</i>.  I have had words with Deputy Adams before about the late Jean McConville.  After Question Time and the Order of Business, I will meet with representatives of the disappeared.  We both know the feeling of an end not having been brought about when someone has died or disappeared.  It is very important for the families, irrespective of where they come from, that a sense of closure be obtained.  I have learned this, particularly from the families of people who were lost at sea.  There is a feeling that something is missing, literally, when the remains are never recovered.</p><p>  The section in the book concerning Jean McConville is stark and strong.  I do not know the answer.  When Deputy Gerry Adams comments, he may well make the statement that he has made to me before.  This is about information contained in a number of tapes that have been sent on to the PSNI.  I do not know what they contain but they arise from the oral history project at Boston College.  When we talk about bringing closure and healing to the communities in Northern Ireland, this element of the disappeared is a central feature.  I read the evidence from Nuala O'Loan on the fact that there was nothing to prove the late Jean McConville was an informant.  I also read the Hughes allegations about the decision to have her killed and about what was to be done with the body.  I do not know the truth of it; nor does Deputy Martin.  Mr. Hughes makes comments about Deputy Gerry Adams, whom I cannot speak for in that regard.</p><p>  I did not have any opportunity on that short occasion to have detailed discussions about the oral history project with the people in Boston College.  It was the subject of court cases and I understand some of the tapes have been handed over to the PSNI.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900022#U00700"><p>The Taoiseach has put great store on the question of Ireland's international reputation.  Time and again he has cited the importance of maintaining and rehabilitating Ireland's reputation on the international stage as a key reason for continuing the bailout of banks and protecting the financial system, as he calls it - it is because our international reputation is so important.  In his recent visit to the United States, did the Taoiseach feel that the visit coincided with stunning revelations emanating from a US congressional committee that American companies were using Ireland as a tax shelter to avoid paying tax, were paying little or no corporation tax and were using the State as a means to avoid paying tax, and that this did immense damage to our international reputation and our reputation in United States, in which the Taoiseach puts so much store?  Does the Taoiseach think, in light of these and similar allegations made in the British Parliament, that Ireland is a tax haven and is facilitating aggressive tax avoidance by US multinationals, and that if we are to protect our international reputation we must be seen to take vigorous, aggressive and serious action to get to the bottom of this?  Does the Taoiseach not think that the shooting down of a proposal made by me, Deputy Pearse Doherty and Deputy Joe Higgins at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that the representatives of Google, Facebook and Apple should come before the committee to answer questions on their tax avoidance schemes and how they use this country to that effect is damaging to the international reputation the Taoiseach thinks is so important?  How can he square his defence of Ireland's international reputation with the fact that he, his party and his Government are involved in a conspiracy of silence about Ireland's corporate tax regime and the use of this country by US multinationals as a tax haven and shelter?  How can he square these two things, and will he do anything about it if our reputation, which he considers so important, is not to be left in tatters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900022#U00800"><p>I do not accept the assertion that Ireland is a tax haven and I do not accept that there has been a conspiracy of silence.  I spoke to Senator McCain about both issues at the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Washington.  This matter was never mentioned and, in respect of the business people I met in Boston, it is fully understood that this country is not a tax haven.  Ireland's reputation internationally is something we value greatly.  It has been restored, as has the sense of consistency and stability in regard to the corporation tax rate and, in respect of American investment here, our understanding of the talent pool we have in the country and our ability to cater for the changes that occur with the development of biotechnology, genetics, the Internet, nanotechnology and other areas, not to mention the financial services, where people look for creative, imaginative and challenged young people.  They are very happy about that in terms of our reputation.</p><p>  This happened during the course of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which had three pillars: stability, growth and jobs.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had the privilege of chairing one of the meetings of finance Ministers.  That is why tax fraud and evasion and aggressive tax planning were central features of the Presidency pillars.</p><p>Great progress was made on those.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Commissioner Semeta issued a joint letter to ECOFIN Ministers in April urging action on fraud and aggressive tax planning.  They identified a number of areas.  In May, the ECOFIN agreement on aggressive tax planning and good governance was concluded and acknowledged by member states.  Importantly, the Council conclusions recognised that there are international tax issues which cannot be solved through unilateral action by individual countries.  It will require collaborative and collective responsibility.</p></speech>

Many companies use multi-jurisdictional tax approaches.  The end result may be that through the use of those other tax environments, the rate of tax is reduced from our 12.5% corporate tax rate.  It is recognised that this cannot be dealt with individually and the approach must be collective.  That is why the European Council, which I attended, was very happy to adopt the principle of achieving a new international code of tax practice.  Countries which have traditionally been less forthcoming about their tax systems are now agreed.  The anti-fraud package encompasses a quick-reaction mechanism to combat sudden and massive VAT fraud.  The expansion of the reverse-charge mechanism was a priority for our Presidency.  Political agreement was achieved on the package being delivered at the June ECOFIN meeting and the savings directive was put through.  Ireland was the fourth country to sign up with the United States on the FATCA agreement on the sharing of information on tax.  We have been very forthcoming on that.  We have also been forthcoming on our involvement as a focus group for the OECD, which is now setting out the standards and work to be done to implement a new international tax system.  Ireland was responsible during the Presidency for achieving agreement on a mandate for amendments to the savings tax agreement with Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Andorra, San Marino and Monaco to ensure there is an equivalence of measures across the European Union.</p><p>  I do not accept Deputy Boyd Barrett's assertion that Ireland is a tax haven.  I do not accept his assertion that there is a conspiracy of silence here.  I accept that the reputation of the country is of critical importance.  That reputation has been restored.  It is accepted in business circles that Ireland's corporate tax rate is transparent, applies across the spectrum and has been deemed to represent an effective rate of 11.9% by the World Bank.  The Deputy has made his case before.  I do not accept it, consistent though he is in his argument.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900023#V00400"><p>I join the Taoiseach in his welcome for the recent decision by the US Senate to approve a comprehensive immigration reform Bill which has the potential to lift the fear of discovery and expulsion with which many undocumented Irish citizens working in the USA are burdened.  I acknowledge that it must get through Congress etc.  I recognise in particular the efforts of all who have lobbied on the issue.  I think well of the work of Ciaran Staunton and others.  He was on a conference call to the all-party group in the Oireachtas to brief people on what is required.  Interestingly, an all-island approach is being taken between the Assembly and the Oireachtas.  Some concerns have been expressed, including concerns about the future of the J1 visa programme which allows thousands of students to work in the USA.  I understand a fee of $1,000 will have to paid by a student's employer or other sponsor in the USA.  Many students do not have an employer in place before they go and some employers may not be willing to pay even this reduced fee.  I ask the Taoiseach to obtain clarification on that issue.  I note the T&aacute;naiste's visit.  Clearly, all of us must use our contacts on Capitol Hill to lobby for the Bill.  The T&aacute;naiste should meet with activists and those who are working with the undocumented Irish.  It would be useful to bring an all-party grouping from the Oireachtas and, or, Stormont.  Each party has its own contacts and personal relationships, all of which could prove influential in facilitating the passage of the legislation.  I ask the Taoiseach to ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider that.</p><p>  I am uncertain as to whether I should ignore the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il in his charges.  Sometimes, it is impossible to know what the right thing to do is when someone comes in with a book, parades it in the Chamber, makes accusations and engages in weasel words.  Should I sit on my dignity and let this pass or get up and speak to the issue?  I was very taken last week talking about other tapes - the Anglo Irish Bank tapes - to note mentally that the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il spoke to the Taoiseach and said &quot;You choose to exploit the past, not to learn from it&quot;.  I said &quot;Miche&aacute;l, I hope you remember that&quot;.  The Boston tapes is a matter that is in the hands of the PSNI and it will do with that what it wants.  I have been very restrained in my comments about all of that and will continue to be.  I have consistently rejected claims, however, by those who accuse me of having any knowledge of or part in the disappearance and killing of Jean McConville.</p><p>  The issue of those who were detained, abducted, shot and buried by the IRA is a terrible legacy of the conflict.  We know it is not unique to this phase of the conflict.  It has happened at other times.  There are still issues going back to the Civil War and the Tan war, which have to be resolved.  At least, this generation of republicans, among whom I count myself, is trying to undo the wrong that was done.  Clearly, those who were killed cannot be brought back to life, but I do think that a grievous wrong was done.  For its part, the IRA, which is now on ceasefire, has left the stage and is not around, apologised for what it did.  I have been very much part of the effort to retrieve these remains since I was approached by some of the families.  Some of the families are republican families.  Some of them are friends of mine.  Some of them are neighbours of mine.  Fr. Alec Reid, others and I have worked very hard, which the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il must know.  The commission was established under a Government of which he was a part.  The different suggestions that were put and the co-operation the IRA, including what were referred to as &quot;primary sources&quot;, gave to the commission are matters of public record.  The man who is in charge of the special forensic investigating team, which was put in place on suggestion from us, has acknowledged all of this.  He said in 2009 that those who were working with him were working in a spirit of co-operation and reconciliation to help in every way they could.  He said he was absolutely convinced that they were doing everything they could to assist.</p><p>  Now, we come to how this is used to score political points.  I am also meeting the families this evening.  I made the point earlier that some of them are friends of mine and many are my neighbours.  Those who make the accusation against me, apart from those in the D&aacute;il, are implacable opponents of the peace process.</p><p>They say there should not be a peace process and the war should have continued, and they attack me as a means of undermining that.  Some of them are past, some of them are still active and some of them are still out there.  At least, they have their convictions.  They are not doing it for electoral gain.  They are not doing it for political point scoring.  They are not doing it as a Fianna F&aacute;il leader trying to reclaim the republican mantle which was so despoiled by successive Fianna F&aacute;il leaderships which let the people down in a most deplorable and anti-republican way.</p><p> It is also my view that those who brought together this Belfast project have a similar view.  These two individuals who misled are not supporters of the peace process.  They have since acknowledged that they could not and should not have given the commitments which they gave that these would not be revealed until these individuals were dead.</p><p> I am trying not to fall into the trap here of trading points on other people's wounds with the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I have a deep investment in what is happening in the North.  I will continue to have a deep investment.  I do not shy away, I do not hide, I do not disassociate myself but I like to think that I am also defined, as are those who work with me, by what we have still to do.</p><p> I would appeal, once again, because I believe - I cited the person in charge of the forensic team's statement that republicans are co-operating actively - the remains of nine of these persons have been recovered and are in graves that their families can visit.  Seven have still to be found.  Not all of those seven were killed by the IRA, but seven have still to be found and we all need to do our best to play a positive role in this.  I appeal, once again, to anyone with any information whatsoever, no matter how small, tiny or insignificant he or she thinks it might be, to bring that forward to the commission, to the families, to the Garda or to the PSNI, or to me or anyone else he or she thinks can usefully bring this forward to help these families.</p></speech>

Clearly, other nationalities have an interest as well and one does not want to be seen to have the entire Bill focused on one country.  Obviously, we have our interests here in that regard.  We did this previously and there is no difficulty, at the appropriate time and at the appropriate level, in having representatives of the D&aacute;il travel to engage with the representatives, both Democrat and Republican, in Washington about our interest in seeing that the Bill would go through and, if it is not to go through, that, out of the amalgamation of the Senate and the House of Representatives, we keep a close eye on this.</p><p>  Of all of those who were shot, murdered or killed during the troubled period in Northern Ireland, the name of the late Mrs. Jean McConville stands out because of the notoriety of the case and because of her family circumstances.  I accept Deputy Adams's view that if there are persons out there with information of assistance in finding the remains of persons who were shot and taken away - and God knows what happened to them or was done to them that their bodies have not been recovered and been allowed to be repatriated to family graves - and there are such persons, they should come and give that to members of the authority or whoever.</p><p>  As I stated, quite a long time ago I also read that book, but I saw a short piece of a television programme that Deputy Adams did on this some time ago where he was asked a direct question as to whether there was an involvement from him in this case or not, and he answered that question.  Leaving the Boston tapes aside, this is a fairly serious book.  I do not know the individuals, Mr. Brendan Hughes or Mr. Ed Moloney, who wrote it, but people would like to hear Deputy Adams confirm in the D&aacute;il that what is written in that book is simply not true.</p></speech>

The people want to hear a voice of reconciliation looking forward to a future here where that closure can be brought in so far as that can happen.  It is difficult after 30 years to go and pinpoint exact spots and that is why the commission, in conducting its investigations, has had to have carried out excavations in a range of areas as to where bodies are supposed to be dumped or laid to rest.  The people would like Deputy Adams to say here that what Mr. Hughes and Mr. Moloney state in that book is simply not true and that from the Deputy's personal responsibility in a different time and place, we can be clear on that.  I accept Deputy Adams's word on his interest in seeing closure brought to the matter of these bodies that have not been recovered.  In the case of the late Mrs. McConville, he has an opportunity in the D&aacute;il, our Parliament, to address an issue that has affected many people because of the extent of the coverage of this over the years.  For one reason or another, those people have always associated Deputy Adams with elements of that and he has a chance here to put it on the record.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on receipt of an honorary doctorate.  It is important that we continue to foster relations between Irish America, both at political level and at a more informal level.</p><p>  There were two matters I wanted to point out.  First, I welcome the meeting the Taoiseach held with the US multinationals organised by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Of course, he had Offaly in mind when he was over there.  We would welcome them with open arms, particularly increased trips of groups from IDA Ireland.</p><p>  I suppose I specifically wanted to focus on the efforts that were being made by everybody on the legalisation and citizenship of the undocumented Irish.  We have 50,000 over there.  It is fantastic that the Bill was passed recently in the Senate but every effort should be made diplomatically to ensure that it gets through the House of Representatives.  It is critical.  This is the closest it has been in decades, for the 11 million undocumented in the United States but, specifically, for our undocumented.  Recently, I had contact from a parent whose daughter is over there for a number of years.  She is doing really well but, unfortunately, cannot come home for those important family events that we all treasure and make life so worthwhile.  What strategy does the Government employ as a rule in terms of linking in with the various lobby groups over there?  I refer to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste is visiting the US and I welcome that the Taoiseach has had meetings on this matter.  Has the Government a specific strategy to deal with this?  I am particularly concerned about the citizenship element.  We want to ensure that they are given legal status and also citizenship.  We do not want our people to be second-class citizens over there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900025#X00200"><p>This is a two-way process, in particular, with regard to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  We are very anxious to maintain the attraction for investment in Ireland from the United States and from other countries.  That is why it is important to engage with those groups and corporations to show what is on offer here, the tax rate, the available talent pool, our track record, technology and the capacity to measure up in whatever way that might be.  On the other hand, I refer to the growth in Irish-owned companies in the United States which currently employ nearly 100,000 people across 50 states and which speaks for itself.  The old tradition of, "Please give us", is gone.  There is a very strong contribution being made by Ireland to the US.</p><p>  In reply to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, the outcome of the EU-US trade and investment talks will be potentially very significant.  I hope this question of the allegations about involvement in retrieving information in European Union institutions is dealt with and the facts made public so that these talks can proceed.  They could be concluded within two years.  At the G8 summit in Fermanagh President Obama offered that the talks would commence in July in Washington.  He set a time limit of two to two and a half years in order to make real progress.  This agreement would be in the interests of Irish companies which wish to do business in the US and through a separate agreement with Canada.  The agreement would also mean that business could come the other way.</p><p>  The strategy for dealing with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR, and other groups with regard to immigration issues applies from the very highest level.  I raised the matter with President Obama last year and again this year, as we always do.  However, we are not in a position to dictate what the US Senate or Congress will do.  We have stated clearly that we have an interest and we want to work with them.  As the process proceeds we wish to explain the circumstances that apply in respect of our citizens.</p><p>  While the American President is the most powerful politician on the planet, it is an executive position which must strike a balance between the Senate and the Congress.  This was given an impetus by President Obama prior to the recent elections with regard to the Latino vote.  Segments of the population which have been in the United States since they were children and before certain dates, were given options.  We engage on all sides with the ILIR, with Congressmen and with Senators.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Leahy and Senator Schumer who were two of the eight Senators who were the original sponsors of the Senate Bill which has now gone through.  The problem is that there are very different views in the House of Representatives and this is where the next battle must be fought.  We are not in any position to tell them what they must do.  We can tell them what we would like them to do and we can ask them to understand our interest.  This is why Members on all sides have engaged with their respective contacts.  The T&aacute;naiste is visiting the United States this week.  The Irish ambassador and the Irish Embassy in Washington are in constant contact with the various segments and sectors in the Congress.  The ILIR - Mr. Staunton and others whom we have met on many occasions - will also keep a very close watching eye.</p><p>  We would like to think that this matter can be brought to a successful conclusion but it affects many more than just Irish people.  At the same time as the Bill was going through, the Senate also approved the expenditure of billions of dollars to build a fence between the US and Mexico.  This illustrates the depth of conviction about homeland security and illegal immigration as a result of the 9-11 tragedy.</p><p>  Our strategy is one of constant engagement and interaction from the level of the President down.  We would hope that after a very long campaign over many years the Congress and the representatives of the people will understand the contribution which other nationalities can make to the United States and which they have made - none more so than the Irish - over the past 250 years.  We would like to think that this can be brought to a conclusion and that it will provide an opportunity for those who are in the US as undocumented immigrants but who have social security numbers and are contributing to the economy of the United States.  Many are married with families and it is hoped this will provide them with a legitimate path to citizenship if that is what they wish.  It is a complex issue and the Government is very interested in seeing it make progress.  Arising from the suggestion by Deputy Adams, when the time comes we will give consideration to an appropriate level of all-party engagement.</p></speech>

The Schumer Bill has made progress because of the electoral and political changes in the United States which is to be welcomed.  However, significant work still needs to happen with regard to the Republican Party because that is where the action is.  Fianna F&aacute;il facilitated all-party delegations in the past.  I ask the Taoiseach if he could ensure there is contact between the Government and the actual undocumented people because this would be of assistance to those who are pursuing their interests.  The challenge seems to be to secure a majority of the majority within the House of Representatives, the lower house.  It is vital that the Government lobbying should target those who have reservations and are opposed to the Bill.  In my view this is a very significant opportunity, in the aftermath of the presidential election, to achieve some progress.  The reason there has not been progress to date is because of the political configuration within the United States.  There has never been an opportunity to gain considerable consensus across both Houses of Congress and across both parties.</p><p>  I refer to the Boston College Belfast oral history project.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider meeting with the authors of that project, Anthony McIntyre and Ed Moloney.  I reject what Deputy Adams said.  The Taoiseach can see for himself that their objective in recording these interviews was not to undermine the peace process in any way.  I am not endeavouring to exploit the past; I am dealing with the present.  The investigation into Jean McConville's death is happening now; it is a live investigation, not an historical investigation.  Hence the PSNI's desire to secure these tapes which has caused difficulties for those involved in recording them in the first instance.  When I showed this book to the House, the words I used when I said that this book is a &quot;must read&quot;, were exactly the words that Deputy Adams used some months ago here when he also paraded a book in the House and said it was a &quot;must read&quot; for every Deputy in the House.  The book dealt with British undercover activities in Northern Ireland.  He said it outlined in great detail the approaches of the British Government authorities and army and so on, to undercover activity.  He felt it was quite appropriate to bring to our attention the importance-----</p></speech>

I would say that this is also a "must read".  It is wrong to try to undermine the people who were responsible for writing this.  They are not anti-peace process.  In fact, Anthony McIntyre will say that if the IRA and all those who supported their war were honest, they would have said they should have packed up in 1974.  From his perspective, everything since 1974 was a futile killing of life on all sides, that it was not worth the loss of one single life.</p></speech>

I find myself in a very awkward position.  In reply to Question No. 3, the Taoiseach said:<blockquote>I did not have any detailed discussion regarding the Boston College history papers during the visit.  As the House is aware, this matter may be the subject of further legal proceedings and, as such, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment.</blockquote>Therefore, as Chairman of this House, I find it very awkward not to be seen to be stopping people from raising legitimate points but if somebody says that to me in his capacity as Taoiseach, I have to take note of it, and I ask people to respect that please.  If there are other questions to be tabled in that regard, please do so and if they are ruled out or in we will deal with them.</p></speech>

Yesterday, I noted on the Internet that a company called Dema Partners, an international tax solution consultant, offers corporations 80 &ldquo;tax havens&rdquo; around the world where they can avoid tax.  Ireland is included as one.  The US Senate committee, including both Republicans and Democrats, states Ireland is a tax haven, and experts such as Mr. Richard Murphy in the United Kingdom say Ireland is a tax haven.  Members of the British Parliament state Ireland is a tax haven but the Taoiseach says it is not and that everything is fine.  How does the Taoiseach explain this?  If it walks and talks like a duck, it probably is a duck.  Despite this, the Taoiseach's account conflicts with everybody else's account of what is occurring in terms of corporate tax avoidance by multinationals in Ireland.  If the Taoiseach is so concerned about Ireland's international reputation, particularly in the United States, why can we, in our Parliament, not do the same as was done in the US Senate and the British Parliament, that is, bring the representatives of Google, Facebook, Apple and other corporations at the centre of the allegations before our committees to answer questions instead of shooting down proposals to do so, as happened last week at a meeting of the finance committee?</p></speech>

I remind the Deputy of what the chief executive of the major company mentioned in this context said publicly, namely, that no special arrangement or deal was done by this country with his company.  We are not entitled to do such a deal anyway because the corporate tax legislation here is statute based and very clear.  It cannot allow for special deals to be done with any individual company.  The Senate committee may well have its own agenda.  Obviously, it has capacity to deal with elements of US tax legislation, if it wishes.  I repeat that this country has no difficulty whatsoever in standing up for what we do here and the fact that we can only tax on profits generated here.  The World Bank clearly points out that Ireland's effective tax rate is 11.9%.  Second, Ireland is the fourth country to sign with the United States with the effect of saying we open our books in terms of the sharing of information about tax issues.  Third, during our Presidency, we reached an agreement at the European Council that the principle of the development of a new international tax code has to be dealt with because no individual country can deal with it on its own.  As somebody pointed out to me, an item manufactured in Ireland and sold in another country generates an element of tax here, in the country in which it is sold and where the intellectual property might well be vested.</p><p>  Corporations that use many jurisdictions operate according to the various tax environments in those jurisdictions.  As the Deputy knows, we do not do what are called the brass-plate operations, in respect of which the company that was mentioned has over 4,000 highly paid technicians and software engineers in the country.  Therefore, there is a real investment, which proves Ireland is not a tax haven.  None of the four criteria set out by the OECD that determines countries as tax havens is met in any way by Ireland.  Everything points in the other direction.  Ireland, as one country, is more than willing to play its part with its European colleagues in developing an international code that stands up.  As I stated, some of the countries that were very conservative in the dispensing of their information on this have now come forward and said we must develop measures in a collaborative and co-operative way.</p><p>  With regard to the question on activities in other countries that are at war, these matters are raised through our European contacts, at European Council level and with the high representative.  On the last occasion I raised this, it was to tender the condolences of the Irish people to the Italian Prime Minister, whose forces lost a member in Afghanistan when, unfortunately, a bomb was thrown by a young child into a facility there.</p></speech>

I responded by saying: "I have consistently rejected claims that I had any knowledge of or any part in the abduction or killing of Jean McConville."  I do so again today.  Will that be the end of the matter?  Of course not because this party, under its current leader, is fighting a battle for its survival and that is its only concern in raising this issue.  I repeat what Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin said last week to the Taoiseach: "You have chosen to exploit the past, not to learn from it."  He should practice what he preaches.  The abduction, killing and burial of the people concerned was a grave injustice, but efforts are ongoing and when the seat on which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has his bum is cold, they will still be ongoing until all the remains have been returned.  Jean McConville was one of those whose remains were retrieved through the diligent work of the people on the commission and others, but the remains of seven people have yet to be found.  We have to continue with our efforts, no matter what is said or how this is used or exploited for party political gain.  I do not know what the voters think of it all, but it is more important than what passes for politics sometimes in this House.</p></speech>

The Government yesterday committed to introducing legislation to provide for mandatory personal locator beacons on small fishing boats.  I very much welcome that initiative.  There have been too many tragedies, with 55 fishermen dying in the past five years.  The Taoiseach is very much aware that fishermen are finding it harder and harder to make it a living and, therefore, the best protections are needed.  Will he update the House on the progress of this legislation?  Will he also ensure the personal locator beacons for small vessels will be fully funded by the Department?</p></speech>

The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Transport, Tourism and Sport attended the launch.  There have been sophisticated digital communications developments in this field.  If fishermen carry the device on their life jackets and, unfortunately or tragically, end up in the water, the beacon will go off.  The same applies to the locator for the vessel.  These developments have progressed greatly in the past few years.  Both Ministers outlined work, training and funding programmes, with 60% for smaller boats and 40% for larger boats.  Clearly, the requirement for fishermen to engage in training on a five yearly basis speaks for itself.  We all recall the most recent tragedy involving the Bolger family off the Waterford coast.  It is hoped yesterday's launch on a beautiful day in Union Hall, poignant though it was, which was different from the occasion on which the tragedy occurred, will lead to lives being saved.  As these developments improve, they are becoming seriously sophisticated in terms of GPS location.

We strongly support this facility; we have had a lot of engagement on it and would like to see it happen.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900029#BB00300"><p>I appreciate this Topical Issue being selected for debate.</p><p>  I am very concerned at the apparent policy of centralisation of court services being pursued by the Courts Service and its buildings sub-committee.  The most recent decision by the board on 1 July will see two further courthouses being closed in County Mayo, in Swinford and Ballyhaunis, bringing to ten the number of courthouses closed in the county since 2000.  The administration of these courts and the court sittings are being transferred centrally to the courthouse in Castlebar for the stated reason that there are better facilities in Castlebar courthouse and there is a holding cell there.  If these are the criteria - I understand there are several other items which I will address - all District Courts and all courthouses in County Mayo will shut down and all of the work will be transferred to Castlebar where the investment has been made in the courthouse.</p><p>  What is the State saving?  In Ballyhaunis and Swinford there are 24 hour Garda stations, but now garda&iacute; will be required to travel a distance to Castlebar and spend their time, a day perhaps, sitting around the District Court and will then have to travel some distance back to their towns.  They will not be able to attend to their policing duties as easily or readily as if they were attending the District Court in their own towns as they have been doing to date.  What is being saved in the way of resources and policing hours when one considers that garda&iacute; will have to travel?  That is not to mention, first and foremost, the question of accessibility to District Courts and courthouses in the county.  As in many other counties and District Court areas that serve large dispersed rural populations, public transport is a major problem in County Mayo.  It is all very well to have a court case running, but if one does not have a car and cannot get into court, or meet one's legal representative beforehand, one is in difficulties.  This is a very real and serious issue which is often not appreciated in bigger urban centres where public transport is more readily accessible.</p><p>  What consultation is ongoing?  I have no doubt that some consultation has taken place and the reasons have been given for preferring Castlebar.  Why are the administration of Swinford District Court and the court sittings being moved to Castlebar?  This work is being done in Ballina District Court office.  This office holds all of the liquor licensing files and all other files pertaining to the operation of Swinford District Court.  I have spoken to stakeholders there, including local garda&iacute;, solicitors practising in the District Court and other interested parties, including representatives of the Mayo Solicitors Bar Association.  The general feeling is that there is already a very good working relationship between the District Court staff in Ballina and the Swinford area and as they are already doing this work, why centralise it in Castlebar, unless to undermine the Ballina District Court office and in pursuit of a centralisation policy?</p><p>  I know that the Courts Service will claim that it looks into issues of public transport, but I cannot believe that is a very real and urgent consideration for it, given the number of rural courthouses it closes down.  In this case I am aware that there are considerably more Bus &Eacute;ireann services - the public transport services available - between Ballina and Swinford because they are on the same N26 national primary Ballina-Dublin route than there are between Swinford and Castlebar.  Equally, the new administrative and local authority area sees Swinford being included with Ballina, while much of the Garda district area in Swinford is also being subsumed into the Ballina district.  This does not make sense on any score.  </p><p>  In respect of the holding cell, mentioned in connection with Castlebar, there is a state-of-the-art Garda station just around the corner, where all prisoners and people required to be detained in custody can be satisfactorily held.  One of the fundamental tenets of the District Court and the way it operates is that it should be accessible to the people of an an area and administered locally.</p></speech>

As she may be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, the management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and I have no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions which, of course, include the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Courts Service has been reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring front-line court services can be maintained.  I am informed that all venues were included in this aspect of the review.  In the context of the review, a number of venues were identified to be considered for closure, subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.</p><p>The service established a general framework within which such venues were assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells, etc.  The likely impact on other justice agencies, such as an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service, is also taken into account.  Consultation processes are carried out in each case and among those consulted are the Judiciary, the local Bar Association, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service, the Probation Service and the relevant town council.</p><p> In line with the process, the building committee of the Courts Service board considered outcomes and recommended a number of closures to the board.  As part of the consultation process, all those who had been consulted previously were informed of the recommendation of the building committee and were invited to make further submissions which would be placed before the full board for consideration.  I am informed these submissions, together with all previous submissions, have been taken into account in the decision-making process.</p><p> As the Deputy is aware, the board recently approved the closure of a number of courthouse venues.  At its meeting on 1 July 2013, the board approved the closure of venues at Birr, Edenderry, Clones, Swinford, Ballyhaunis, Kinsale, Baltinglass and Kells.  I am informed a decision regarding the future of Skibbereen was deferred until the autumn.</p><p> The business normally transacted at those venues will be transferred to alternative venues in adjoining District Court areas.  It is anticipated all of the venues will formally close on or before 1 January 2014.  As already stated, the board is independent under statute in regard to these matters and it is not open to me as Minister to influence the outcome of the deliberations of the independent board.</p><p> It was a decision made by the board that the Swinford court work be transferred to Castlebar.  The Courts Service fully examined the alternatives available to it and this decision was made having examined those alternatives.</p><p> The Courts Service, like all other areas in my Department, has been affected by the cutback in funding available.  Each service provider, including the Courts Service, is under an obligation to see what action it can take to ensure expenditures are reduced and appropriate savings are made.  The Courts Service had a reduction of &euro;800,000 in its 2013 allocation.  I am anticipating that there will be a further reduction in the funding available for 2014.</p><p> In that context, it is important for the Courts Service to review existing court centres, the manner in which justice is administered and how savings can be effected while providing the most modern court facilities for the benefit of the public within the limited funding available.  I am sorry I cannot be of greater assistance to the Deputy in this matter.  Ultimately, these are decisions to be made by the Courts Service.</p></speech>

I accept savings have to be made.  However, consultation with local stakeholders is not meaningful because the grounds for the decision do not resonate with any stakeholders involved.  I have sought clarification from the Minister on what seems to be a centralisation policy solely based on cost-cutting measures.  If this is the case, the cost for rural areas is that services will be closed down.  There should be more consideration than that and recognition of realities such as the availability of public transport.  There is not the same level of public transport available to Castlebar that there is to Ballina.</p><p>  I have been in contact with the Courts Service and it automatically assumed the court work from Swinford would go to Castlebar with no consideration given for Ballina.  I appreciate the service may look at this in light of the case I have made to it.  However, it shows that the concerns of local stakeholders affected by these decisions were not taken seriously.  A buildings committee sitting in Dublin has no concept of what it is to be operating in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

It is chaired by the Chief Justice and the presidents of the various courts have input into it.  The Courts Service is for the whole of the country; it is not a Dublin-based committee.  There was extensive consultation with stakeholders including an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is about ensuring that in the current economic climate we maintain a sound Courts Service and that people have access to it but it is done in a manner which is careful with resources.  This is an obligation that, unfortunately, our predecessors were not always very conscious of in the arrangements they made on a broad range of areas.</p><p>  The Government is conscious of the value of providing for an excellent courts system and has continued to provide substantial resources for the service.  Last year, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;5 million was given to it, on top of the original net budget of &euro;54.1 million.</p><p>  No area can be exempt from the financial constraints of the past few years.  While funding has been cut in common with every area within the justice sector, it has been possible to press ahead with some aspects of the capital programme by way of public private partnerships.  The Government&rsquo;s infrastructures stimulus package announced last year includes the development of seven new county-town courthouse projects in Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Limerick, Drogheda, Letterkenny and Mullingar.  There is no question of centralising our courts in Dublin.</p><p>  The board, however, has had to take unpalatable decisions to close several smaller non-viable venues elsewhere.  The continuing investment in the county-town venues will facilitate the introduction of more efficient work processes, prisoner transports, allowing the other criminal justice agencies to continue to provide front-line services with reduced staffing levels that are essential nowadays.</p><p>  I am conscious of the Deputy&rsquo;s concern to ensure a full and proper Courts Service is available to the people of Mayo.  I am committed to that too and I thank her for raising this issue.  Ultimately, the final decision-makers with regard to court venues are the Courts Service.  Having engaged in a consultative process, it is for it to determine what changes should be implemented with regard to court venues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900030#CC00400"><p>The number of people jailed for the non-payment of fines has increased by 82% which the Minister will agree is nothing short of substantial and alarming.  We as legislators must delve into this.  I strongly suspect this increase is related to the economic climate.  Considering the small financial quantities of some fines, why would someone bother going to jail if they had the wherewithal to pay them?</p><p>There may be another view on that issue, but it probably relates to working class people who find themselves in a bad place and if they do not have the money, they find themselves in a place where they should not be.  That is something legislators should address.</p><p> We should also be concerned that 60% of all District Court cases involve road traffic offences.  It is interesting that the Courts Service has called for fines for these offences to be included in road taxes.  I do not know what the Minister's view on this is, but it should be explored.  District Courts administer justice, yet 60% of the work relates to road traffic offences.  Surely there must be another way to deal with this issue rather than jamming up court proceedings.</p><p> The issue of sentencing aggravates all citizens of the State, particularly when cases arise where the ordinary man or woman on the street recognises that there is an injustice and nowhere does it agitate people more than in the case of sentencing for sexual crimes, which are violent crimes against women.  There is a difficulty with section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 which allows for compensation to be paid.  Without citing recent cases with which we are familiar, this raises the question that if somebody has money and engages in this kind of dreadful act, he can buy himself out of the crime.  Most citizens of the State would not agree to this, but we inherited a justice system which is not our own and we have to deal with it as it is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900031#DD00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising these important issues.  As he will appreciate, judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in others concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all of the circumstances of a case, imposes an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender, in that process identifying where in the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factor which may be present.</p><p>  From time to time, issues arise with consistency in sentencing and the sentences imposed in high profile or particularly sensitive cases.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I cannot enter public discourse on individual cases.  It is ultimately for the judge to impose sentence taking into account all relevant factors.  However, I draw attention to an important safeguard, the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.</p><p>  The Law Reform Commission has recently published a report on mandatory sentencing.  Separately, I have established a strategic review group to consider penal policy, including sentencing policing.  I expect the group to report later this year and intend to publish its report.  The group will take account of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report in its deliberations and both reports will be considered in due course.</p><p>  I turn to the separate but related issue raised by the Deputy, that of fines.  Fines are the most commonly imposed sentence in the courts and I am pleased to say that subject to the approval of the Government, the fines (payment and recovery) Bill will be published next week.  The overall objective of the Bill is one that I am sure is shared by the Deputy and most in this House.  That objective is to reduce and, to the greatest extent possible, eliminate the need for judges to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of fines.  Last year around 8,300 people were sent to prison for the non-payment of fines.  They comprised the vast majority of those sentenced to short sentences by the courts and committed to prisons in 2012.  The resources expended by all involved in the justice system is staggering, from the Judiciary to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Courts Service to the prisons, at a time when resources are at a premium.  Prison is not the answer to the non-payment of a fine, except in exceptional cases.</p><p>  None of this is to say I am sanguine about the non-payment of fines.  For the justice system to work, it must have the capacity to detect crime, prosecute offenders and, where they are convicted by the courts, ensure compliance with whatever sanction the courts impose.  Where fines are concerned, this means collecting the fine.  It is regrettably the case that a significant minority of around 30% of fines are not paid.  The fines (payment and recovery) Bill seeks to address this issue in a number of ways that avoid the need to send defaulters to prison.  It provides that everyone can pay a fine by instalments over 12 months and, where a person is in default, an attachment order may be made requiring his or her employer to collect the fine and pay it over to the courts.  The Bill also provides that community service orders may be imposed in all cases of non-payment.</p><p>  I am confident that the proposals contained in the coming Bill will achieve a significant reduction in the committal to prison for the non-payment of fines, while protecting the principle that sentences imposed by the courts must be served.  Where this involves a fine, the fines payment and recovery system will strive to collect the fine either from the person's income or assets and, failing this, will impose community service on the person.</p><p>  I note that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court recently suggested that where road traffic tickets were issued and not paid, that a system might be put in place to provide for the recovery of outstanding payments through road tax.  This is an issue I intend to raise with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, within whose remit the Road Traffic Acts fall, with a view to seeing if a system in this area be considered and put in place.  I am conscious that circumstances may arise where fixed ticket charges are issued by mistake, issued to the wrong person or someone who does not own the vehicle, or there may be extenuating circumstances.  It is a more complex issue than may otherwise have been assumed, as there are many instances where proceedings may not be appropriate in respect of road traffic matters and if all tickets issued automatically attached to someone's annual road tax, justice could be done.  It is a very interesting proposal to which I am giving some consideration, following discussions with the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar.</p></speech>

That is to be welcomed because the legal process needs to be changed in the modern world.  We need to tackle the perception which I consider to be true that the law is in place for the better-off, not the ordinary person.  I am particularly interested in the system that operates in England and Wales, in which the Sentencing Council is made up of eight judges who represent all courts and six lay people with specialist knowledge.  They have the role of promoting consistency in sentencing and informing the public about the factors that are taken into account by judges in formulating sentences.</p><p>I agree with the Minister that judges have to retain discretion.  I do not think the law would work without a separation between legislators and judges.</p><p> The sentencing council for England and Wales has drawn up guidelines for sentencing which outline all the factors to be taken into account when judges pass a sentence.  That is a radical initiative.  The guidelines are contained on a single page which judges fill out at the time of the court case and forward to the sentencing council for analysis and use in the promotion of consistency.  All of us want consistency in the application of the law.  I referred earlier to rape cases in which people believe they can buy their way out of sentences and the thorny issue of corporate misdemeanours and white collar crime, which we have failed to address in this country.</p></speech>

They are of interest to the public at large and have great importance to legislators on all sides of this House.  It is important they remain in the spotlight and that we continue to reflect on how our criminal justice system works.  I hope I have made the position clear in regard to sentencing and I look forward to receiving the report of the penal policy review group in due course.</p><p>  Within the overall parameters of judicial independence, we need to ensure sentencing is coherent and consistent.  Above all, confidence in the system requires that the public believe the sentence is commensurate with the crime.  In many cases a sense that it is not commensurate is based on an incomplete picture.  The factors taken into account by the judges are not always known to the public and, indeed, are not always reported.  A more transparent system that ensures people understand the process and the factors taken into account in sentencing would help and, as I noted earlier, I intend that the Law Reform Commission report will feed into the work of the penal policy review group.  I assure the Deputy I am open to any reform that improves the system.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of sentencing, the Judiciary has done some work in this area.  One of the items of legislation standing in line for completion is the judicial council Bill.  When the Bill finally comes before the House and is enacted, I hope the judicial council might have regard for the development by the Judiciary of sentencing guidelines to assist judges in sentencing and consistency of sentencing.  However, we must always remember when a judge exercises discretion in a particular case that background circumstances can substantially differentiate what may appear on the surface to be two similar cases.  This is not always understood.</p><p>  In regard to fines, we are genuinely on the cusp of an historic reform of the fines system that will make imprisonment for the non-payment of fines the exception rather than the rule.  These are important reforms to which the Government committed in the programme for Government and it is my hope that the fines payment and recovery Bill, which is fully drafted and which I hope will be before the Cabinet next week, will be published within the next ten days.  It is my objective, with the agreement of the House, that it will be enacted by Christmas and that the new regime will be in place in early 2014.  The days of automatically sending those who either cannot or will not pay a fine to prison will be at an end.  It is important that those who can afford to pay their fines but fail to do so understand there are consequences for such actions.  These consequences may include supervised community service if circumstances are such that an attachment of earnings order may not be appropriate.  This is a reform that I hope will be widely welcomed.  It will make a significant difference and I look forward to a debate on that Bill taking place in the House shortly after we return from the summer vacation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900032#EE00300"><p>The problems facing the pension system in this country are manyfold.  Unfortunately I will only have time in the two minutes available to me to focus on one of these problems.  I suspect the reason the Minister for Social Protection is not here is that less than one month ago we told her in unmistakable terms that the 30 June deadline for the trustees of defined benefit pension schemes to submit funding proposals would not be met by most of those trustees.  That has turned out to be the case.  They have not submitted their proposals by the 30 June deadline because they know they have no hope of meeting the onerous funding requirements set out for them.  The result is that many of them will wind up in a situation where the assets are distributed in a most unfair and patently unjust manner.  When these schemes wind up, those who have already retired will get the full benefits to which they are entitled regardless of how much it will cost - it is costing a lot more now than previously - and the balance will have to be distributed among the remaining scheme members.  A person who has retired, such as a chief executive with an index-linked pension of &euro;100,000 per annum, will have his or her pension fully protected, whereas somebody who has worked for 30 years and is a few weeks or months short of retirement may get nothing.</p><p>  This is not simply an academic exercise.  I am currently dealing with three deferred pensioners with the TSB in Limerick, all of whom are in their late 50s.  They should be entitled to pensions ranging between &euro;22,000 and &euro;25,000 per annum but, as a result of the wind-up of their scheme and the fact that those who are already retired have to be fully compensated, they have been told they will get amounts ranging between &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 per annum.  That is a blatant injustice.</p><p>  The Minister promised on a number of occasions to change the order of priority.  She has allowed the 30 June deadline to elapse in full knowledge that the schemes will wind up and their assets will be distributed in this unfair manner.  She made commitments in the programme for Government and the legislative programme, as well as to organisations such as ICTU and IBEC, but her indecision appears to be final.  What is the reason for this paralysis?  Is she going to do something, even at this late stage, to alleviate the problem these people face?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900032#EE00400"><p>The cat is clearly out of the bag and we are now dealing with an open crisis.  As Deputy O'Dea noted, however, it is not unexpected because we knew this day would come.  Some 400 of these schemes have already closed over the past five years and 300 out of the 900 existing schemes have failed to meet existing standards.  What this means in reality is that the reasonable expectation of tens of thousands of workers to a certain standard of living on retirement has been ripped from underneath them.  What is the Government going to do about this?  The delayed reaction in changing the order means that when these schemes wind up the pensioners will get everything and those still at work or making deferred contributions will get nothing.</p><p>  Furthermore, many pension schemes are using the current crisis to get out of existing commitments.  Examples of such schemes are the ESB and Aer Lingus.  The ESB's pre-tax profits increased fourfold last year to more than &euro;300 million.  Its chief executive earns in the region of &euro;400,000 and his predecessor earned approximately &euro;700,000.  Despite stating it cannot honour the commitments given in the ESB pension fund, it paid out a dividend.  Similarly, Aer Lingus is going through a huge crisis involving thousands of workers.</p><p>There was a 40% increase in operating profit this year, with record numbers of passengers being carried, yet Aer Lingus says it cannot contribute to the pension scheme.  This is not good enough.  Some of these schemes are in trouble because of inappropriate regulation - which successive governments have stood over - as well as asset stripping by some of the companies and flawed accounting practices.  What we want to know is what is the Government going to do to protect the livelihoods of these tens of thousands of pensioners.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900033#FF00200"><p>First, I wish to inform Deputy O'Dea that I understand the Minister for Social Protection had another commitment from well before this matter was submitted and that is the only reason she is not here and I am.  In so far as I do not answer some of the issues raised, I will ensure that she is aware of the issues the Deputy has raised.</p><p>  I thank both Deputies for raising what is an important issue for many people.  The persistent funding difficulties of defined benefit schemes, due to increasing life expectancy and the financial downturn, have been well recognised.  Employers, unions and trustees have been making strenuous efforts to protect the viability of their schemes and many measures have been introduced to support these efforts.  The funding standard for defined benefit schemes was suspended in 2008, following the downturn in the financial market, to give the trustees and sponsoring employers adequate time to assess their schemes and consider a response to improve the funding position.  The reintroduction of the funding standard was then delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to these challenges.</p><p>  Following the reintroduction of the funding standard in June 2012, pension schemes were required to submit funding proposals to the Pensions Board by 30 June 2013.  Where funding proposals have not been submitted, the Pensions Board is formally contacting schemes to ascertain their particular circumstances.  The Pensions Board will then decide what steps to take on a scheme-by-scheme basis and taking account of the individual scheme circumstances.  However, it must be emphasised that trustees must meet their legal obligations and ultimately the Pensions Board will use its regulatory powers where benefit underfunding is not properly addressed.</p><p>  In trying to strike a balance between the need to support schemes in their efforts to meet funding challenges while simultaneously implementing a regulatory framework to ensure pensions commitments made can be met, the following measures were introduced to ease pressures on defined benefit schemes while the funding standard was in abeyance: significant legislative changes were made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act in 2009 to allow for the restructuring of underfunded schemes by removing the priority given to post-retirement increases for pensioners to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme; the powers of the Pensions Board were strengthened to ensure that pension contributions are remitted by employers to scheme trustees; the pensions insolvency payments scheme was established to reduce the cost of purchasing pensions for trustees where the employer has become insolvent; and legislation was introduced in 2010 and 2011 to provide the option of a sovereign annuity for trustees.</p><p>  Changes to the defined benefit model and the funding standard, including the introduction of a risk reserve, were made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  The reintroduction of the funding standard followed.  More recently, the Minister for Social Protection announced a number of regulatory changes to assist defined benefit schemes as they prepared funding proposals.  Legislation has since been enacted in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board.  </p><p>  The funding standard provides a benchmark against which the &quot;health&quot; of a scheme can be tested.  The responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.  While the recent OECD review of the Irish pension system describes the funding standard as ''undemanding'', many schemes are coming from a deficit position and it is clear this is a difficult problem that requires careful management.  Ultimately, it must be remembered that the regulatory structure is there to ensure members' benefits are protected.  Therefore, it is expected that all defined benefit schemes will submit their proposals to the Pensions Board.  Compliance with the regulatory structure is essential for the future sustainability of these schemes and increased security of members' benefits.  It will also ensure that we ascertain the precise funding position of schemes.</p><p>  Following receipt of proposals, it will be possible to get a more accurate indication of the level of underfunding in defined benefit pension schemes.  This will also allow for the impact of the many measures already introduced by Government to be assessed, including the potential benefits to schemes of the use of sovereign annuities or bonds.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is keeping the situation under review and will report back to the Government in the coming months on these issues.  A wider package of legislative proposals and additional reforms will be considered at that stage.</p></speech>

I could quote it by heart.  It will give no comfort whatsoever to people who will be affected by this.  Everybody knows, including the Minister and her colleagues, that a number of defined benefit pension schemes will close down.  The longer the situation is left as it is, the more of them will close down, and the more of them that close down, the more current or active employees will be affected.  Their pensions will be determined in a way that is manifestly unfair.</p><p>  I put it to the Minister that the programme for Government states that the priority system will be changed.  It is also on the legislative programme for this session that the current rules for the distribution of assets and the wind-up of defined benefit pension schemes will be changed.  This has been promised by the Minister on no less than three occasions.  However, we are now told that the Minister is reviewing the situation and thinking about it.  We are told she is considering the options and looking at this and that.  In the meantime, with every week that passes another defined benefit pension scheme closes down and employees are left at a disadvantage.  Is the Government going to do anything to alleviate this injustice before it affects further thousands of employees who are just unlucky because they have not reached retirement age by the time their schemes are wound down?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900033#FF00400"><p>The Minister's response is totally unacceptable.  The statement that the crisis in defined benefit schemes is because of increased life expectancy and a downturn in the financial market is not true.  He has failed to address the points I raised regarding very profitable companies that are using the current situation as an excuse to avoid their responsibility.  Defined benefit schemes are not unaffordable nor unreasonable.  We are talking about relatively modest pension schemes under which people had a certain expectation as to what they would get on their retirement.  They contributed heavily out of their pockets and their employer sometimes contributed as well for them.  Therefore, they have paid for their pensions.  Unless the Government acts, these people will get nothing.  People currently in work, some of whom have worked for up to 40 years, are being told by Deputies and Ministers, who can get quite a gilt-edged pension after 20 years, that the Government is going to do nothing for them.  This is not good enough.  Already, we have seen this happen at TSB and the Abbey Theatre, and now AIB is indicating it will close its defined benefit pension scheme.  Some 300 other schemes are on the edge.  What is the Government going to do to deal with this situation?  It is unacceptable.  In reality, pensions are deferred wages that have been earned by workers.  They should not be gambled with and left open in this way.  The Government has a responsibility to address the problem sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

This is a very important issue.  It is correct that it affects a number of people and there are obvious difficulties in this area.  In total, 212 of the 933 defined benefit schemes currently subject to the funding standard were due to submit a funding proposal by 30 June and did not do so.  A number have been in contact with the Pensions Board with a view to submitting proposals very shortly.  Immediately after the 30 June deadline, the Pensions Board initiated contact with schemes that had not submitted plans to ascertain their particular circumstances.</p><p>  I want to emphasise the importance of trustees arranging for an actuary to carry out a valuation of individual schemes' liabilities and assets at regular intervals.  The effective date of actuarial valuations must be not later than three years after the previous effective date.  If the actuary certifies that the scheme has insufficient assets to satisfy the funding standard, the trustees must ensure that a funding proposal is forwarded to the Pensions Board with the actuarial funding certificate.  The funding proposal must be designed to ensure the scheme could reasonably be expected to satisfy the funding standard at the effective date of the next actuarial funding certificate.  The trustees should instruct the actuary to bring forward proposals for the range of measures that could reasonably be expected to meet such requirements.  These could include, first, an increase in the level of contributions to be paid by the employer and-or the scheme members, second, a reduction in the benefits which would be payable to each respective member, third, changes to the investment strategy in regard to the scheme's assets, or, fourth, a combination of any of the measures I have just set out.  Specific guidelines under the Pension Acts must be followed if a reduction in the accrued benefits of members is proposed.</p><p>  The Pensions Board has a specific statutory remit in this area.  When it has followed up on these matters, it will be reporting to the Minister, the Minister will be reporting to Cabinet and Cabinet will consider what steps Government should take.  However, to suggest the Government has done nothing so far is unfair to the Minister for Social Protection.  It is also untrue, and I detailed some of the action taken in my initial comments.  Let no one pretend this is an easy problem to resolve.  Let us have a bit of honesty in this House.  Deputy O'Dea and others in Fianna F&aacute;il should stop washing their hands of their responsibility as individuals for the problems this Government is now seeking to address.</p></speech>

It concerns a number of community hospitals across Donegal.  We have seen in recent months a huge turnout of ordinary people who are seriously concerned about the future of their community hospitals and the services they have provided and will provide into the future.  They have come out in support of Dungloe Community Hospital, Carndonagh Community Hospital and St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar as these vital community services are faced with further cutbacks.</p><p>  I am not sure if the Minister of State is aware of Dungloe Community Hospital but it is a fine facility with 35 beds.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, visited that hospital last year to open a new wing, which cost &euro;600,000, including the equipment that was needed for it.  While there, the Minister acknowledged the impeccable care, staff and services at the hospital.  Barely a year later, however, ten beds in that hospital are lying empty, two of which were provided by the community through fundraising efforts over a long period.  Those two beds were traditionally used for palliative care due to the fact they were in private single rooms.  The local HSE management explained to me in May of this year that the decision taken to temporarily close the beds was due to an increase in long-term sick leave, a number of staff retirements and planned maternity leave, with the moratorium on recruitment restricting its ability to replace these staff.  The HSE was very clear as to why these beds were lying empty and closed.</p><p>  Meanwhile, St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar, which is the largest community hospital in Donegal, is also faced with the loss of ten beds, which is in addition to the 13 beds this hospital has seen closed in recent years.  Since the recruitment moratorium was introduced, the level of nursing staff at St. Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar has reduced from 37 whole-time equivalents to 25, and in non-nursing grades there has been a reduction of six front-line workers.  A recently published HIQA report on St. Joseph's stated: &quot;At the time of inspection there were 10 staff off through illness, five nurses and five carers&quot;, in addition to one retirement.  The confidential HSE public service agreement, PSA, document, to which I have access, states that the St. Joseph's management team has indicated its staffing levels are an increased risk and that this increases the potential risk of an adverse incident to a client.  That is a stark warning in a HSE document on staffing levels and the impact of the moratorium.  While the document is confidential, it has thankfully seen the light of day.</p><p>  My question, which I ask on behalf of the many hundreds of people in Donegal who have turned out at community meetings to express their concern, is how the Government expects community hospitals to maintain the highest standards of patient care if it will not provide the resources required.  Local HSE management confirmed to Oireachtas Members recently that the population of over 65s in County Donegal is set to double within ten years, so it is clear there is a greater need for community hospitals and extra beds if we are to avert the crisis that is facing us.  However, that is not what we are seeing on the ground.  Carndonagh, Dungloe and St. Joseph's community hospital have all lost beds.  This all comes on the back of beds that have been lost in these hospitals in the past two years.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to take urgent steps to address the situation.  While we understand the pressures the Government is under, it is wrong to cut front-line resources and impose a moratorium so strictly where we know the need exists to open these beds, some of which were funded by the community.  Beds in our hospitals are lying empty and the reason for this is the recruitment moratorium.  I ask the Minister to consider that the necessary supports be put in place to allow our public sector workers to carry out the task they are qualified to do, which is to look after our elderly and not so elderly in the community hospitals in Donegal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900034#GG00700"><p>I thank Deputy Doherty for raising this issue, which I feel I know by heart as Senator Jimmy Harte raised it just last week and I gave virtually the same answer.</p><p>  Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate high-quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the nursing homes support scheme.  In 2012, with a budget of almost &euro;1 billion, financial support was provided to over 22,000 people in nursing homes.  As the Deputy is aware, these are challenging times for the Health Service Executive in respect of all services.  In the case of community nursing units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  In this regard, all developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and Government policy to reduce the numbers employed in the public sector.</p><p>  This policy requires that, by the end of 2013, the health service achieves a workforce of 98,955 whole-time equivalents.  Staff appointments may be made only where an inescapable service need has been identified which cannot be addressed by other means, such as the redeployment of staff or reorganisation of services.</p><p>The recently concluded Haddington Road agreement increased the working week of nurses from 37.5 to 39 hours and also provided for increased hours for all other staff who were working less than a 39 hour week.  This will have the effect of increasing the overall staff capacity available to management to deploy in service delivery. </p><p> There are 11 community hospitals in County Donegal providing 400 public beds, of which 238 are short-stay, while the remaining 162 are long-stay beds.  These are supported by a wide range of community-based services.  Six units have primary care centres attached, with access to services, including a public health nurse service, a community psychiatric nursing service, a home help service and an old age psychiatry service.  These services are available to residents of the units as need requires.</p><p> Dungloe Community Hospital has recently experienced an increased number of staff retirements, annual leave, long-term sick leave and maternity leave.  In order to maintain a safe level of care for patients, the Health Service Executive decided to reduce temporarily the number of short-stay beds by ten.  This was done to ensure there would be an adequate number of staff to meet all of the needs of the residents safely.  It is proposed to reopen five beds by mid-July.  Arising from a temporary staff shortage owing to sick leave and annual leave, it was also decided to reduce capacity at Carndonagh Community Hospital by four beds.  I understand the HSE proposes to reopen these beds on a phased basis this month.</p><p> Services at St Joseph's Community Hospital in Stranorlar include respite, rehabilitation, palliative and intermediate care and long-term residential care services.  When the hospital was last inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority in April, inspectors observed that while staff provided care in a knowledgeable, competent and respectful manner, there was a concern that the complex mix of residents could make it more difficult for staff to meet the needs of long-term residents.  In order to address this issue, one ward, with a dedicated staff, has now been designated for long-stay residents only.  The changes mean St. Joseph's Community Hospital will now have an operational capacity of 67 beds.</p><p> Residents and their families can be assured that management and staff will continue to work to provide the highest standards of care in all community hospitals in County Donegal.  The HSE has asked me to assure the House that the residents in all of these facilities are receiving a safe and high-quality service.  Bed capacity across community hospitals in County Donegal will be kept under ongoing review.  However, there are no current plans to reduce bed capacity further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900035#HH00200"><p>I am well aware of the proposal to reopen five beds at Dungloe Community Hospital and four beds at Carndonagh Community Hospital and I am pleased this will be done in the coming weeks.  It shows the importance of trade unions that SIPTU was instrumental in putting forward the proposal regarding Dungloe Community Hospital.  It can be done because the staff are non-nursing staff.  The reality remains, however, that five beds will remain closed at Dungloe Community Hospital and up to ten in St. Joseph's Community Hospital.  A difficulty will arise if a large number of patients get sick at the same time or there is an outbreak of the vomiting bug.  In such a situation staff could not return to the hospital, even if they were healthy, and the beds currently open would have to be closed for patient safety reasons.  The HSE has indicated to Oireachtas Members in County Donegal that the number of people aged over 65 years in the county will increase by 100% in the next ten years.  In other words, the need for additional beds is known.  It does not make any sense to have a situation where beds have to be closed if a member of staff goes on annual leave, retires or becomes ill.</p><p>  I do not expect the Minister of State to produce a magic wand to solve this issue.  The fundamental problem is that the system is absolutely broken.  I feel sorry for the nurses who have to call in sick knowing their absence could mean that patients will not be given the bed they need.  That is a consequence of the moratorium on recruitment.  Regardless of whether one agrees with the moratorium, it should certainly not be so restrictive that beds in community hospitals must be closed because somebody has retired or fallen sick or is on maternity leave.  It simply should not happen.</p><p>  There must be greater flexibility within the system, especially when we know we are facing into a crisis.  One of the issues of most concern to people in County Donegal is that the inevitable increase in demand comes at a time when the number of beds in the public system is decreasing and there are no plans to increase capacity in the private sector.  There is no evidence of foresight or forward planning on the issue.  People are fearful in the face of what happened in these hospitals two years ago.  We are seeing further bed closures at Dungloe Community Hospital and the same at St. Joseph's Community Hospital.  People know the recruitment moratorium is still in place and that more nurses and other staff will be sucked from the system.  They are very worried that there will be another public meeting next year at which the closure of another three or four beds, whether temporarily or permanently, will be announced.  The system is broken and it is the patients in need of long-term support and care in their own community who will suffer.</p></speech>

In fact, we have a very good health service and the people availing of the 400 beds in County Donegal are receiving a good standard of care.  There is a requirement for a different skills mix, with some people requiring more intensive care than others.  I acknowledge that older people are more vulnerable to the vomiting bug, but the reality is that in hospitals throughout the country, whether patients are young or old, the same procedure kicks in.</p><p>  As for the Deputy's claim that there is no plan, the reality is that there has never been more planning.  We are very conscious of the demographics and what is going to happen to us as we age.</p></speech>

That is not where older people want to live.  They want to live their lives in their own communities, the same as all of us.  They have the same dreams as I do or the Deputy does.  We are planning for all of this on a regular basis.  The positive ageing strategy is in place and we are developing a dementia strategy.  We have a whole range of strategies because we know the demographics better than anybody else.  The notion of standing up and striking fear into the hearts of vulnerable people and their families is reprehensible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="18:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900035#HH01200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  I am pleased to present the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 to the House.  It contains a number of diverse reforming provisions, most of which amount to important reforms of the courts system.  They include provisions that will serve to shed light on family law and child care proceedings by providing for the attendance of members of the press in certain circumstances.  Included also are long overdue provisions to bring the monetary jurisdiction limits for the Circuit Court and the District Court in civil proceedings into line with current monetary values.  The Bill contains provision to permit the appointment of two additional Supreme Court judges to tackle the delay in cases before that court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Provision is also made for the appointment of extra jurors in lengthy complex criminal trials.  The Bill makes provision, too, for legal aid and advice for coroners' inquests into the death of persons in involuntary custody of the State.</p><p>  In addition, following a post-enactment review of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 by my Department and the Insolvency Service of Ireland, I am providing for a number of amendments to that Act and the Bankruptcy Act 1988.</p><p>These amendments have been identified as necessary to enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.  The provisions will facilitate the Insolvency Service and the courts in dealing with insolvency cases as efficiently as possible.  For the benefit of the House, I will explain the purpose and detail of each of these provisions, beginning with changes to the <i>in camera</i>rule.</p><p> Part 2 of the Bill provides for changes to the long-standing <i>in camera</i>rule in family law and child care proceedings.  The rule provides that family law and child care proceedings should be held otherwise than in public.  The <i>in camera</i>rule is an exception to the fundamental principle of our law, guaranteed by the Constitution, that court proceedings should be held in public.  The exception is made for a very important reason that I accept and support.  In family law and child care proceedings often painful and sensitive family and personal matters are at issue and it has long been accepted that there cannot be a public interest in the private affairs of the parties such as would justify full public access to such proceedings.  However, the absolute nature of the <i>in camera</i>rule has led to a situation where such proceedings are perceived to be shrouded in secrecy.  There is no press reporting of these proceedings because the press access to them is prohibited.  There is, accordingly, an absence of reliable information on the operation of the law in this area which is not conducive to confidence in our system of family law and child protection.</p><p> Recent policy in the law on the hearing in the courts of family law proceedings in private is reflected in section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  Regulations made under this section allow certain classes of persons to attend family court sittings, subject to ministerial approval, in order to draw up and publish reports.  Ministerial approval is subject to certain safeguards, including a requirement that the parties to a case or any relevant child not be identifiable.  Under this scheme, several persons engaged in family law research who were nominated by bodies specified in the schedule to the regulations have been approved.  In addition, the Courts Service introduced the family law reporting service on a pilot basis in 2006.  The purpose of the pilot project was to provide information on the operation of family law in the courts.  While these initiatives have provided a useful insight into family law and its operation, they cannot alone bring the greater transparency required on the operation of the law in this area.  Accordingly, what I am providing for in the Bill is a careful balancing of the need for privacy with the need for public access to important information on the operation of family and child care proceedings in the courts.  My proposal is to retain protections for the privacy of the parties in such court proceedings, while providing that bona fide members of the press can be admitted to the proceedings.  In the Bill the right of press access to the proceedings is balanced with a strict prohibition on the publication of any information likely to identify the parties to the proceedings or any child to whom the proceedings relate.  It will be a criminal offence to publish information in breach of this prohibition.</p><p> I am also providing that the courts will retain the right to exclude or restrict the presence of members of the press from all or part of the proceedings in certain circumstances - where it is necessary to do so to preserve the anonymity of the parties or any child to whom the proceedings relate because of the circumstances of the case or in the interests of justice.  The court, in making its decision in this respect, will have to take into account a range of factors, including the best interests of a child to whom the proceedings relate.  The courts will, for the same reasons, be able to direct that certain evidence should not be published.  The type of situation envisaged could be, for example, where a child or a vulnerable adult is giving evidence.  This residual power is being included in the Bill to give the courts the power to deal with the myriad sensitivities and situations that can arise in proceedings of this nature.</p><p> A number of parties interested in promoting the rights of children made comments to me on this Bill.  Many of the concerns are catered for in it.  In particular, I have added to the Bill a requirement that the court must consider the views of any party to the proceedings and the views of any child to whom the proceedings relate before making an order on press attendance or publication of information.  This requirement was suggested by the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children.  I thank them for it because it is an important addition to the Bill.</p><p> I will now address monetary jurisdiction limits.  Part 3 of the Bill provides for the increase in the monetary jurisdiction limits for the District Court and the Circuit Court in civil matters.  The purpose of the jurisdiction limits is to ensure the level of court that hears a case is appropriate to the potential value of a case.  The legal costs incurred by the parties to a case are related to the court in which the proceedings take place.  It is estimated that, on average, the legal costs of taking a case in the Circuit Court, subject to the complexity of the case, are 30% lower than in the High Court.  An appropriate increase in the jurisdiction levels is long overdue to ensure courts are dealing with the cases at an appropriate level and that the costs being incurred by the parties are at a reasonable level.</p><p> The monetary jurisdiction limits for the Circuit Court and the District Court have remained unchanged since 1991, some 22 years ago.  The Courts Act 1991 set the current monetary jurisdiction limits for civil matters at &euro;38,092 for the Circuit Court and &euro;6,384 for the District Court.  Although the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 made statutory provision for increases in the limits to &euro;100,000 and &euro;20,000, respectively, the increased limits were never brought into operation, with the unfortunate result that the limits remain as they were 22 years ago.  The retention of the lower monetary limits has rendered the District Court and the Circuit Court redundant in some classes of civil proceedings.  The low level of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court means that very modest actions must, in the absence of agreement between the parties, be taken in the High Court.  Such cases are potentially the subject of appeal to the Supreme Court, which makes no sense at a time when the workload of the Supreme Court and the High Court has increased significantly in volume and complexity, with Supreme Court appeals currently waiting over 48 months for a hearing date.  Following consultation with the Attorney General and the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court, I am therefore proposing to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to &euro;75,000 and the District Court to &euro;15,000.  </p><p> The failure to bring the revised limits provided for in the Court and Court Officers Act 2002 into operation relates to a concern that increasing the limit for the Circuit Court to &euro;100,000, as provided for in the Court and Court Officers Act 2002, would have an inflationary effect on personal injury awards in the Circuit Court and a consequential inflationary effect on insurance claims.  I have decided to address this issue in the Bill by setting a lower jurisdiction limit in the Circuit Court for personal injury proceedings.  I am setting the level at &euro;60,000, that is, 40% lower than the equivalent level set by the 2002 Act 11 years ago.  The increased jurisdiction limits will prove to be a fairer and more cost-efficient approach to the processing of civil proceedings by the courts.  The proposed changes to the jurisdiction limits for the Circuit Court and the District Court should ultimately lead to a reduction in the burden of legal costs for individuals and companies engaged in litigation.  It is crucial that parties involved in legal conflict do not incur more legal costs than are necessary in circumstances in which they have to resort to litigation.</p><p> It is also important that our court jurisdictions keep substantially in line with inflation and that the higher courts are not unnecessarily overburdened with appeals that could and should be properly dealt with at a lower level.  The changes to jurisdiction limits proposed in the Bill should effect a reduction in the number of appeals that, ultimately, have to be dealt with by the Supreme Court.  A further amelioration of the burden imposed on the Supreme Court will result from the creation of a court of appeal should the proposed referendum which it is hoped to hold in the autumn to provide for such a court receive public support.  The Thirty-third Amendment of the Constitution (Court of Appeal) Bill 2013 was published today.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a court of appeal which will hear most appeals from the High Court and from which cases may only be appealed to the Supreme Court if they are of general public importance or if the Supreme Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that it hear and determine the case.  I expect this major reform of the courts architecture will result in a significant reduction in the caseload of the Supreme Court and will allow it to concentrate on cases that merit the consideration of the highest court in the land.</p><p> I refer to the appointment of additional judges of the Supreme Court.  Part 4 of the Bill amends section 1(2) of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 to provide for the appointment of two additional judges to the Supreme Court.  The Chief Justice has drawn attention to the current critical situation regarding delays in the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Despite the introduction in the past two years of new case management methods and new listing systems, there is a delay in excess of four years in having an ordinary case heard in the Supreme Court.  A priority case gets on the list for hearing in approximately nine to 12 months.  The Chief Justice has pointed out that a case logged today will not get on the list until mid-2017.  The Court of Criminal Appeal has a backlog that amounts to two years.  This provision will allow for the appointment of two additional judges of the Supreme Court as an interim measure to deal with the current critical situation regarding delays in the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  This will bring the total number of Supreme Court judges, including the Chief Justice, to ten.</p><p>These appointments would allow for urgent remedial measures to be put in place prior to the introduction of the reforms envisaged following a referendum on a court of appeal.  The appointments would allow for the scheduling of several sittings each week of the Court of Criminal Appeal and permit two divisions of the Supreme Court to sit routinely.  The Chief Justice believes that the appointments, together with efficiency measures already introduced, could radically reduce delays and the financial, economic and reputational risks associated with delay.</p><p> Part 5 of the Bill amends the Juries Act 1976 to provide for the appointment of up to three additional jurors to deal with lengthy trials.  The provision follows a recommendation to this effect in the Law Reform Commission's recently published report on jury service.  The issue is of significance in relation to lengthy trials involving fraud or other complex financial matters.  Under current law, a jury consists of 12 members, but a decision in a trial by ten members of a jury can be accepted.  Accordingly, where up to two members of a jury become incapacitated or otherwise unavailable, there is no risk to the sustainability of a trial.  However, during the period of a protracted trial there is a risk that more than two jurors may become unavailable.  Where that happens, the trial collapses.  I have accepted the Law Reform Commission's argument that legislative provision is required to guard against such a possibility.</p><p> The provisions of Part 5 amend the Juries Act 1976 to insert a new section 15A to provide that on application by the prosecution or the defence or on its own motion, the Circuit or Central Criminal Court can order that up to 15 people be selected to serve as jurors.  In such cases, a judge must be satisfied that a trial is likely to last more than two months.  If it transpires before the jury retires to consider its verdict that more than 12 jurors remain, a jury of 12 jurors will be selected by ballot.  Ballots will be conducted in open court by the court registrar under the supervision of the presiding judge.  In effect, what would happen in a case of this nature is that the registrar would draw from a drum containing the names of the 15 jurors or such number of jurors as remain the names of the 12 jurors who are to constitute the verdict jury.  I am also providing by way of an amendment to section 20 of the Juries Act that where a jury has additional jurors, challenges without cause shown can be made by the prosecution or the accused person to up to eight jurors, as opposed to seven, as is the case with a typical jury.</p><p> Part 6 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Coroners Act 1962 and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to provide for legal advice and legal aid in relation to certain inquests.  The Coroners Bill 2007, which is currently before the Seanad, provides for comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and for the establishment of a new coroner service.  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department.  The review is focused on the development of optimum administrative and jurisdictional structures that can deliver in the most cost-effective way the planned reform of coronial law.  The Coroners Bill, as published, addressed a matter that has been commented on in recent times by the European Court of Human Rights.  The court emphasised the importance of ensuring that the next of kin of deceased persons can effectively participate and engage in a coroner's inquest into certain categories of death, including the limited number of cases in which a person has died while being involuntarily detained by the State.  The right to effective engagement in these circumstances includes the provision of information prior to the inquest.  In certain cases, this may require families to obtain legal assistance to participate effectively in the inquest process.</p><p> Sections 86 and 92 of the Coroners Bill 2007 provide for the introduction of a legal aid scheme for proceedings before a coroner.  Section 92 provides for the required technical amendments to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  These changes will permit the Legal Aid Board to arrange for the granting of legal advice or legal aid to the family of a deceased person for legal representation at an inquest where the person has died in, or immediately after being in, involuntary State custody.  Section 86 also provides that a coroner may consider an application to request the Legal Aid Board to provide legal aid where the circumstances of a death involve matters of significant public interest and where the possible recurrence or continuation of those circumstances may be harmful to public health and safety.  The provision was included to ensure the fullest possible compliance with the approach of the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p> Given the importance of these matters, in view of the fact that making progress on the Coroners Bill 2007 may take some time, and in light of the State's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, it is important to take the opportunity represented by the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to address the issue of legal aid at inquests.  Accordingly, Part 6 includes the broad provisions contained in sections 86 and 92 of the Coroners Bill 2007, with some refinements to the text to take into account developments since the Coroners Bill was published.  An important consideration is that the amendments will be made to the Coroners Act 1962 as opposed to being contained in a new piece of legislation.  The normal eligibility criteria in regard to financial means operated by the Legal Aid Board will apply in these situations.  I am not providing for free legal aid to pursue civil actions by next of kin.  The legal assistance provided is in relation to coroners' inquests only.</p><p> Part 7 of the Bill provides for the transfer of the existing Office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy to the Insolvency Service.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of time while the Personal Insolvency Bill was being finalised for enactment last year, it was not possible to provide in that legislation for the transfer of the Office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy to the Insolvency Service as originally intended.  I am anxious that the matter should be dealt with as soon as possible.  To facilitate this, the appropriate additions to the Act are being made by way of amendments to the Bill in the Seanad.</p><p> Part 8 of the Bill contains a number of amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  Deputies will recall that during the debates in the House on the Personal Insolvency Bill, I indicated that if it was necessary to make any further changes to the legislation to facilitate the operations of the Insolvency Service, I would make them.  A post-enactment review by my Department and the Insolvency Service has identified a number of such changes.  The amendments contained in Part 8 of the Bill are technical drafting amendments required to improve the presentation of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 or to correct errors in the text.  The purpose of a number of the amendments made by the Seanad is to make clearer the documentation to be presented to the appropriate court for its consideration of the debt resolution processes.  The effect of these changes is to facilitate the Insolvency Service and the courts in dealing with the various insolvency cases as efficiently as possible.  It is my intention to introduce some further minor amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act on Committee Stage.  The amendments are also required to facilitate the Insolvency Service and the courts in dealing with insolvency cases.</p><p> The Bill contains important steps in the process of modernisation of our courts to ensure that the essential service they deliver to the community is efficient, effective, fair and accessible to all of our citizens.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to a stimulating and interesting debate on its contents.</p></speech>

Openness and transparency are important aspects of an effective judicial process which enjoys public trust.  They foster better judicial decisions in the public interest.  It is important that the Bill achieves the correct balance between privacy and transparency in reporting family law cases.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has published its own Bill on <i>in camera</i> court proceedings, which achieves the right balance between transparency and privacy in the reporting of family law and child-care cases.  Fianna F&aacute;il has concerns about the penalty in the Bill for misreporting of cases, which is prohibitive in nature.  The penalty may act as a deterrent to journalists in reporting cases which are legitimately within the public interest.  Fianna F&aacute;il will propose a number of amendments to ensure there is a greater balance between privacy and transparency that mirrors that of our own proposed legislation.  Ultimately, it is vital that the interests of children in cases are fully protected while public trust in the legal system is maintained.  The Bill opens family law cases to press coverage under certain restrictions.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il considers that it has struck an improper balance which defeats the aims of the legislation in respect of transparency.  It is vital that the judicial process is open and transparent to build public trust and improve the judicial decision-making process.  The goals of the legislation are to open a window on family law proceedings while observing the constitutional requirement to administer justice in public.</p><p>However, there are a number of weaknesses in the Bill that undermine that objective.</p><p> Section 5 has seven exemptions.  This is restrictive and, ultimately, may defeat the intent of the legislation which is that justice should be administered in public.  The series of penalties laid out in the Bill acts as a deterrent to journalists and undermines the aim of opening up the family law process to wider public scrutiny and engagement.  The justice system needs to be open and transparent in order to enjoy public trust and ensure that legal decisions are not arbitrary unjust measures by the courts.  In the absence of openness, misinformation seeps into public discourse, as has been the case on family law.  Numerous legal and public bodies have criticised the current <i>in camera</i>system for family law and called for reform.  Groups such as fathers' rights organisations have consistently complained about the unfairness of the system and the lack of public knowledge about the process, due to <i>in camera</i>proceedings, inhibiting public debate about the workings of family law.  While the privacy of sensitive cases is important and the interests of children must be fully protected, the public is entitled to know how justice is being administered in the courts.  This scrutiny ensures that it is not arbitrary and that just decisions are made in the legal system.</p><p> The Bill provides, in section 5, that the press will generally be allowed to have access to family law cases, and to report on them.  However, judges will be able to prohibit press access where they are satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so or where it is necessary to preserve the anonymity of a party to the proceedings or any child to whom the proceedings relate.  The broad array of restrictions under section 5 threatens to undermine the overall goal of the Bill.  The wide-ranging discretion given to the Judiciary to restrict coverage should be further clarified by the Minister to ensure that it does not impede greater transparency.</p><p> Section 6 outlines liability for the publication of material that identifies parties in a case.  The severe penalties associated with these measures may have a chilling effect on the coverage of family law that is contrary to the spirit of the Bill.  Journalists should not be unduly discouraged from reporting proceedings of family law cases by draconian penalties.</p><p> The Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on children, Deputy Troy, recently published a Bill, entitled In Camera Rule in Childcare and Family Law Proceedings Bill 2013, which seeks to throw open the windows on family law proceedings, which have remained hidden for too long.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill promotes greater transparency without jeopardising the need for sensitivity in the identity of the family involved.  We will use this Bill as the basis for our amendments to this proposed legislation.</p><p> Separately we will also use this legislative opportunity to press amendments to the Bill with regard to the need for confidentiality for those accessing the new personal insolvency regime.  Our amendments will ensure that the identities of those who utilise the regime are made available only to relevant creditors rather than to a wide circle.  This amendment will remove a potential hindrance to those who wish to avail of the new service.</p><p> On the increasing of the monetary limits in the District and Circuit Courts, we note the proposed changes in the monetary limits of the District Court and the Circuit Court, and also the distinction in the monetary limits between the &euro;75,000 limit for civil proceedings and the &euro;60,000 limit for personal injury proceedings in the Circuit Court.  We would merely enter a caveat in this regard.  We would question the resourcing and the capacity of the current Circuit Court structure and ask if it will have the capacity to take on the caseload that will ultimately drop into it from the higher courts; whether there will be the required number of judges; whether the court will have adequate capacity; and whether an impact analysis been carried out in this regard.</p><p> On the comments on the amending of the Juries Act 1976, we welcome the fact that the Government has taken on board the recent proposals of the Law Reform Commission in establishing a broadened panel of up to 15 members for cases which will be deemed to be lengthy cases.  We merely ask for clarification as to what would be deemed a lengthy case as opposed to a regular case.</p></speech>

That is acceptable.  The Minister has, once again, taken the opportunity to include miscellaneous provisions on a range of other issues that needed to be addressed, and that is fine.  However, on Tuesday last, the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stood up and gutted a Bill presented by my party in my name on equality budgeting in legal provisions that protect the most vulnerable in society, and it was dismissed because it did not contain enough references to other Acts.

We were shattered by this.  The approach the Minister has taken is fine.  He has identified issues that need to be addressed and this is the vehicle to do it, but he used that approach to attack a perfectly good Bill that we were inviting him to amend and allow to go to Committee Stage.  I take the opportunity to make that little complaint.  I will try not to use any more unintentional puns for the rest of the speech.</p><p>  I welcome the spirit of this Bill.  While I and my party have some concerns as regards the need for safeguards, we are broadly supportive of the Bill and will seek to submit amendments to reflect this and improve it where we feel it may be lacking.</p><p>  First, I will deal with the section with which I have most concerns, namely that which relates to reducing the application of the <i>in camera</i> rule in order to allow for reporting of the facts of child-care and family law cases by the media, provided identities are protected, of course.  This is an important change, one which can increase transparency, and, in turn, public faith in the judicial system, and I understand and agree with the intention behind it.  Child and family law are areas of the law which require and deserve great care and sensitivity.  In all cases the identity of a minor should be protected.  Failure to ensure that this protection is vindicated can lead to considerable difficulties, pressures and stresses, and adverse treatment of vulnerable young people.  We need to avoid this at all costs.  Such protections need to be preserved.  However, the application of the <i>in camera</i> rule has been problematic and has limited the level of transparency in the system to the point where the faith of ordinary citizens in the system became an issue, perhaps with some justification.</p><p>  I agree with the Minister when he stated that media access and the reporting of cases will add transparency to the conduct of family law and child-care proceedings and will provide valuable information on the operation of the law in this area.  However, I am concerned about how this will work in practice.  Should this Bill become law, it means that only bona fide representatives of the press would be allowed into court.  I am particularly concerned about the term &quot;bona fide representatives of the Press&quot;.  Who are these persons and who deems them to be &quot;bona fide&quot;?  Will there be an accreditation process in place to ensure that these persons are the appropriate ones to have access?  There is a sense among legal practitioners that the term &quot;bona fide&quot; is generally understood across the board.  Perhaps this is okay for the legal world, but will it offer much needed comfort to the young victims coming before a court?  We need to ensure that the procedures put in place inspire confidence in these persons.  My colleague in the Seanad, Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, submitted an amendment on this issue calling for an accreditation process, which was not accepted.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this.  I will be submitting an amendment along the same lines when the time comes.</p><p>Another concern is the number of journalists who will be given access to certain cases.  Is there a possibility that allowing more than one journalist into a court at a time could also be problematic?  I note the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, highlighted that this could be a problem:<blockquote>Allowing more than one journalist into any case could be problematic given that each journalist may include and exclude different details from their reports which individually might protect the identity of a child but collectively could expose them.</blockquote>She raised concerns about local media reporting of cases of this type and how this would make it all the more difficult to disguise the identity of the child in question.  I come from a rural area and I can understand this concern.  When a marriage breakdown occurs in a local area, there can be rumours.  Two parties and their families are involved.  People often fall out as a result and become estranged and there can be tensions.  Narratives are sometimes put out by one side in order to demonise the other party.  Information is often known and circulating in those communities.  It would not be too much of a stretch of the imagination that a local newspaper, even when making efforts to protect the identity of the parties, might put a spotlight on the case.  I ask the Minister to consider how to ensure that the element of local reporting does not draw attention to the individuals involved.  It is a real challenge that we need to work through on Committee Stage.</p><p> The Ombudsman for Children also raised concerns about contemporaneous reporting of cases, as a child may hear or read a report of a court case and realise the story was about his or her case.  There is a chance that this would deter a child from continuing with the case.  I ask the Minister to reassure the House that safeguards will be in place to avoid such occurrences.  He has indicated that he will address some of the concerns raised by the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children.  Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and others will table amendments on Committee Stage, as will the Minister, and the concerns can be discussed further.</p><p> The second provision in the Bill is to increase the monetary jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  It is hoped that in time this will allow for a reduction in the fees charged to clients and, hopefully, the costs of litigation in the long term.  I am confident that this may ease pressure on the higher courts.  The changes to the monetary jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts is a positive step, particularly as it is two decades since a review was carried out.  Any measure that leads to a reduction in fees, thus reducing the cost of taking a case for ordinary families and businesses, is welcome.  We hope that the knock-on effect will be to reduce the costs for the State over the longer term.</p><p> I also note the comments of the Law Society.  It is concerned that the District Court, and particularly the Circuit Court, will not have enough resources to deal with the pressure that will inevitably be placed on them by the dramatically increased workload.  There will be a need for more judges and more court staff in order to avoid delays, given that there is already too much pressure on the system.  I ask the Minister to provide the resources necessary to ensure that the full benefits of this legislation can be implemented.</p><p> Part 4 of the Bill provides for additional judges for the Supreme Court, which is very welcome, as is the proposed constitutional amendment which will be debated later this week.  The Supreme Court judges, who are very talented, will then be able to devote their time to dealing with issues of wider public concern.  The Minister is correct to take advantage of this opportunity.  Part 5 deals with juries and is a sensible proposition.  It allows for up to 15 jurors to be sworn in to ensure a minimum number of jury members for lengthy trials.  I commend the Minister on taking the opportunity in Part 6 to provide for legal advice and legal aid.  This provision is overdue.  Part 7 is a technical provision relating to the Personal Insolvency Bill.  The Minister indicated that he reserved the right to introduce further amendments on Committee Stage, which Sinn F&eacute;in will monitor carefully.  The Opposition has real concerns about some key aspects of the Personal Insolvency Bill but the Minister's amendments seem to be technical amendments relating to how the courts will deal with personal insolvency cases.</p><p> This Bill is a welcome development, albeit with our caveats and concerns.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on Committee Stage to see if the Bill and the protections it proposes can be strengthened.</p></speech>

I will deal in detail with the Personal Insolvency Bill and what I believe to be a missed opportunity to address its major shortcomings.  I will also comment briefly on the other elements of the Bill, most of which I support in principle, although a few comments on them would be worthwhile.</p><p>  On the proposed changes to the <i>in camera</i> rule, it is a sensitive balance that we have to get right between, on the one hand, the need for privacy in family matters and the protection of the identities of children, and, on the other hand, the need for public oversight of the workings of the courts system and the need to deal with any perceptions that might exist among the public or particular groups about a lack of transparency in the workings of the family courts or in the area of child care.  From my own relatively limited experience I know that these are sensitive, difficult issues.  A strong case can be made for public oversight, for the public to be able to see how the system works and to ensure there is consistency and fairness in the workings of the courts with regard to sensitive, difficult and complicated family matters or matters to do with the protection of children.  Equally, there is a need to ensure privacy, and the protection of children must be upmost.  </p><p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn made some valid points about journalists.  Because it is a difficult balance, the Minister and all of us need to keep a watching brief on how this will work in practice to ensure there are not unwanted or unintended consequences.  We cannot say in advance that it will work perfectly.  We need to be careful because we know how the press works, which may be unhelpful at times in cases dealing with sensitive matters.</p><p>  I broadly agree with these provisions on monetary limits and the extension of the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts.  The provision for additional Supreme Court judges seems like a sensible move.  Any measure to deal with delays and backlogs in that area or in the Court of Criminal Appeal is to be welcomed.  I will include the caveat that I think there is a problem with the political appointment of Supreme Court judges.  I do not quite know what is the answer to that problem.</p><p>Broadly, I would favour the election of judges to the Supreme Court.  While I acknowledge there are problems with that, I believe, given all the various options for selecting Supreme Court judges, the public are the most trustworthy in these matters.  That may be a question for another day and another discussion but we need to think about it.  The provision for extra jurors on lengthy trials seems very sensible, as does providing legal advice for people involved in coroners&rsquo; inquests.</p><p> Having examined the amendments to the insolvency legislation, I believe they are mainly technical and concern errors in the initial drafting and the transfer of the official assignee in bankruptcy cases to the insolvency service to make the insolvency legislation compatible with the workings of the courts.  If the Minister can make amendments to this most important Bill, the fact that he is not making more substantial ones will be regarded as a major missed opportunity, because this is one of the main unresolved crises facing considerable numbers of people.  There are 140,000 people in mortgage distress, and more if one counts those in restructuring arrangements.  In many cases, the restructuring arrangements are not tenable or sustainable in the longer term and people are already running into trouble with the arrangements because they are too onerous.  If they are not, they will become unsustainable for many as their incomes are further attacked owing to the impact of austerity and cuts.  It is imperative for the wider economy, and not just those directly affected, that this be addressed because of the undoubted damaging and dampening effect austerity is having on our ability to recover economically.</p><p> The Government is not facing up to this crisis.  The measures included in the insolvency legislation are not sufficient because the banks still have the whip hand.  A key problem with that legislation is that the banks have the right to say &quot;No&quot;.  In the last analysis, they can just say &quot;No, we are not doing it.&quot;  Since there is no hard legal protection for people's homes, the roofs over their heads, or the principal private residence, it is urged that people's homes be protected and that only as a last resort should they be repossessed.  The Minister defended the legislation on that basis when we discussed it.  How does he square this with letting the dogs of the banks off the leash when it comes to what is now their right to harass distressed mortgage holders at an unlimited level?  I refer also to the major problems associated with the powers of the personal insolvency practitioners, when making restructuring arrangements, to look into people's personal finances in a very invasive and humiliating way.  The Minister could have and should have specified what would constitute a reasonable proportion of income that one could contribute towards paying off one&rsquo;s debts, and nothing more.  That would prevent all the humiliation and invasiveness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900040#NN00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I welcome most or practically all of the provisions in the Bill.  Its objectives need to be realised.  However, I have some concerns about the <i>in camera</i> rule and its easing as envisaged in the legislation.</p><p>  Particularly since I became a Member, I have received many communications, as have all of us, from fathers who have gone through the family courts complaining about the difficulties experienced there.  There appears to be a bias against fathers in the operation of the family courts.  However, owing to the <i>in camera</i> rule, it is very difficult to obtain independent information to determine whether this is the case.  It may be that the bias is built into the legislation that the courts are working with in terms of family law rather than the operation of the courts themselves.  The easing of the <i>in camera</i> rule may go some way towards removing the perception of bias and some of the concerns that arise.</p><p>  When preparing to speak on the legislation and on reading the communication on the Bill by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, I noted there were some concerns.  Some should be addressed on Committee Stage to ensure the legislation becomes workable and practical.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children believes that a system for reporting should be rights-compliant, systemic, sustainable, non-deterring and independent.  I was surprised to read that the office does not believe this Bill meets any of those criteria.  It believes it will not result in the provision of systemic information, may lead to the identification of children and families in the courts, and may cause children to retract child abuse disclosures and, in doing so, deter parties from continuing in the courts.  We need to be very careful about this.  As others have said, one would need the wisdom of Solomon to get it right legislatively at this stage, but this needs to be considered.  When the legislation is passed, it needs to be kept under very careful review to ensure we will not encounter problems, such as the identification of families.</p><p>  The Minister stated in his contribution that there is an absence of reliable information on the operation of the law in this area, which is not conducive to confidence in our system of family law and child protection.  Sometimes I wonder whether the media could give one information that would be reliable in terms of the operation of any of the courts.  The nature of journalism and court reporting are such that journalists would probably not be allowed to or given the time to get into the details of the cases.  The same applies to publications.  Therefore, it might not actually lead to much useful information coming out of the courts.  We may see some sort of voyeurism or otherwise on the part of the media regarding cases taking place in the courts.  We must protect against this very carefully.  The legislation provides that the judge can restrict access by the media in family law cases but we must exercise caution on this to ensure that the restriction is operated fairly and properly.</p><p>  It is necessary to have contemporaneous reports such that people can examine the legal issues and update themselves thereon.  They should be able to see what decisions are being made that could have an influence on their circumstances.  This could lead to an understanding of what is happening in the courts.</p><p>  The family law reporting project operated on the basis that barristers and solicitors were allowed to sit in on court cases and write reports thereon.  A  problem was that the publication of the reports was delayed, which might not have contributed to people's overall understanding of how the family courts worked.  This is something we should be addressing and I hope the Minister can create a better public understanding of the issues that arise in the family courts and how they work.  He should remove the perception of bias that may exist among some members of the public.  It would aid us in our work in dealing with people who feel hard done by and who believe they have been wronged by the family courts.  We may be able to bring about greater understanding when talking to them and ease some of their difficulties.  Many who are in contact with us are extremely upset and frustrated, so a little more understanding could ease things for them. They are going through very difficult family circumstances that people do not take too well.  It may not help that much.</p><p> The other recommendations suggest amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1998 and the Personal Insolvency Act 2013, but I agree with previous speakers who raised concerns about that.  While I acknowledge the amendments are technical, I would like the Minister to amend section 105 of the Personal Insolvency Act, which permits banks to extend the period in which a person can be in an insolvency procedure.  That should have been deleted from the Act in the first place.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this to restrict the banks.  The Government has been too lenient on them and they have been given too much time.  We need to place restrictions on them to make sure they deal with people who are insolvent in a proper way, which allows them to recover and get their lives back on track.</p><p> I welcome the provision to appoint two additional Supreme Court judges.  That needs to happen.  It is an interim solution and the Minister intends to create an appeal court.  We will debate that legislation later this week.  There are concerns about the legislation.  However, it is important to increase the number of judges in order that the courts can process more cases because the massive delays in cases coming before the courts undermines the judicial system and the operation of the courts.</p></speech>

The Minister has considerable experience in family law and I am sure he has brought that to bear in presenting this legislation.  The reforms relating to the <i>in camera</i> rule in family law cases represent a better alternative to the outright ban on reporting that is currently in place.  The legislation broadly strikes the correct balance between the rights of vulnerable children and families not to have their privacy intruded upon during a difficult time for them, and the public interest in seeing the administration of justice.  The Law Reform Commission did a decent piece of work on this 15 years ago, which is only finding its way into legislation now.  In allowing greater transparency of the workings of the court in these cases, many precautions must be taken to ensure that no adverse attention is paid to children and young adults and that their anonymity is never compromised.  In her contribution in the other House, Senator Jillian van Turnhout rightly drew the Minister's attention to the negative outcomes for children if identifying information is inadvertently placed in the public domain.  In small locations, people can easily be identified from distinctive facts.  Great caution, therefore, must be taken.  This can lead to lifelong damage and a heavy burden for a child to bear.  I recall a local court case in Kildare.  It was not taken in the family court but it focused heavily on the family and they ended up having to move away.  It was an extreme response but it was the response they felt was needed.  Senator van Turnhout also suggested that the Minister proof any guidelines he issues against the Council of Europe guidelines on child-friendly justice, and I support that call.</p><p>  Like others, I would like the definition of bona fide representatives of the press to be clarified.  It is important that we hear from the Minister about how he might define that because it is not defined in the legislation.  The media are changing rapidly.  There is much more online activity and what one might define as media now could be quite different in ten years.  When the legislation was debated in the Seanad, Sinn F&eacute;in sought an accreditation process for journalists.  It would be useful to hear the Minister's comments in this regard.</p><p>  Dearbhail McDonald wrote a thoughtful paper a while ago in which she said that although the blanket ban on reporting was more or less designed to protect the privacy of families and children embroiled in family law cases,<blockquote>the unwarranted and disproportionate secrecy is an affront to the public interest and families seeking justice in the court.  No one, including the media, expects the veil of secrecy to be lifted entirely in family law cases but it should be pierced sufficiently to enhance public confidence in the family law courts.</blockquote>Previous speakers referred to the perceptions that have built up about how the family court functions.  We could have a better understanding of that by seeing how cases go through the court.  That would give people confidence in our legal system.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle referred to the perceived unequal struggle of fathers, which Dearbhail MacDonald also mentioned.  We cannot take that as a guarantee until we see the system functioning.  That would be most helpful in gaining a better understanding.</p><p>  The increases in monetary limits in both the district and criminal courts to &euro;15,000 and &euro;75,000, respectively, are based on 1991 limits.  That will allow more cases to be settled in the lower courts and, clearly, there will be a positive cost implication for the people taking those cases, but the capacity of the lower courts is an issue.  For example, one often hears about inordinate delays affecting people who take civil cases in the District Court, and this may well add to those delays.  Will the Minister outline how that will be handled?  It is important that we do not overburden the lower courts because that will defeat the purpose of this provision.</p><p>  The number of ordinary judges in the Supreme Court will increase to nine under the Bill.  The courts of appeal are swamped.  Mrs. Justice Susan Denham recently said &quot;The current situation in the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal is unsustainable, it is untenable, it cannot be defended&quot;.  She went on to say it was bad for the economy.  Where there is a long delay, witnesses may have a different recall, their memories may fade or they may pass away in the interim.  If we are to have confidence in our courts, it is important that justice happens in a timely way.  I do not doubt the Minister will accept that is what is required.  I am supportive of the general thrust of the Bill but I am interested in his response to the few issues I have highlighted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1090" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900041#OO00300"><p>I too would like to give my comments and views on the Bill.</p><p>  The changes in the Bill relating to private hearings will be commonly described as relaxing the <i>in camera</i> rule.  However, the Bill adds to the list of cases that must be heard otherwise than in public but which bona fide representatives may attend as long as nothing that might the identify the parties is published.  There is a slight technical difference between cases heard <i>in camera</i> and those heard otherwise than in public, but it is not relevant to this legislation.  The amendment will essentially allow for court reporters to publish accounts of family law proceedings, including applications for domestic violence orders, although judges will retain the power to exclude the press in certain circumstances.  Interestingly, a judge will have the power to exclude the press from hearing evidence that may contain commercially sensitive information.</p><p>Justifiably or otherwise, this provision is likely to be relied on in many family law cases, and I wonder about that.  The aim is to increase public confidence in the judicial system by partially removing the veil which often hangs over such cases.</p><p> The Bill will increase the amount the courts can award.  It increases the amount the District Court can award from the current &euro;6,348 to &euro;15,000, which I welcome.  For amounts in excess of that figure, the Circuit Court will hear cases in which awards can be made to the value of up to &euro;75,000, up from &euro;38,000.  For awards in excess of that amount cases will be dealt with in the High Court.  This will have the effect of reducing legal costs, for which we all hope.  As a rule of thumb, the higher the court, the higher the cost.  By bringing more cases into the lower courts, the cost of those cases will be reduced and the burden of the High Court lessened.  That is what we hope and expect to see.</p><p> The Circuit Court will have jurisdiction in personal injury cases only to an award maximum of &euro;60,000, for which the Minister's justification is: &quot;As a further measure to deal with concerns relating to possible inflation of awards and a consequent effect on insurance costs, I am proposing to restrict the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to &euro;60,000 in respect of personal injuries claims&quot;.  I wonder if the insurance lobby lobbied for this lower limit.  The Minister might tell us when he replies.  In 2002 the Government changed the law to increase the maximum award in cases within the jurisdiction of the District Court to &euro;20,000 and that for cases in the Circuit Court to &euro;100,000.  The relevant sections of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 2002 were never commenced or activated on the basis that the Government wanted to monitor the impact of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  I wonder why that was.  The Government is now increasing such jurisdiction by only 75% of what was proposed in 2002.     </p><p> The move towards greater transparency in the reporting of family law cases is a good one.  There has been far too much secrecy and, at times, this has unnecessarily undermined people's faith in the system.  It is good to have more reporting.  However, it is important that this be done in a responsible way, that there be adequate protection for privacy and anonymity in sensitive family law cases, and that members of the press who report such cases abide by these principles and ensure that any reporting in child protection, divorce and other sensitive family cases is appropriate, respectful and done in a responsible way.  </p><p> I have issues with regard to the Coroners' Courts.  Some regional newspapers do not report cases from these courts at all, while others go into the nitty-gritty.  There is the upsurge in suicide, an issue on which I have been campaigning with Trudi Lalor.  The Minister himself will admit this is a very sensitive issue and that it is unnecessary to have every minute detail of what may be a very sad and tragic occurrence replayed in the newspapers.  The issue should be considered sensitively and humanely.  Is the Minister aware of any progress in regard to a code of conduct for the press?  We need that.</p><p> The Minister is courting the press a great deal lately on a personal basis, selling his book.  I happened to hear him on the John Murray radio programme, talking to Miriam O'Callaghan.  I wonder if the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has any questions for him on this.  It is downright abuse of the public airwaves to have the Minister promoting his book while he refuses to answer questions about important issues in this House.  It is a degrading abuse of his position.</p></speech>

Is this to protect the banks yet again?  Is it another part of the eviction Bill the Minister had passed last week, going by the fancy name of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act?  The Minister has stated that we must do all in our power to minimise the risk of challenge - my goodness - and judicial review and operational problems, ensure public confidence in the legislation and enable the insolvency service to function and carry out its brief without risk to reputation and credibility.  I accept that, but fear it is too much in the way of protecting the banks, the State and its agencies against the person.  We have too much of that while there are toothless organisations such as the Competition Authority and others that the Minister will not staff or resource properly.  The same applies to the Central Bank (consolidation) Bill.  We have no laws for the banks.  We used to say there is one law for the banks and one law for others; now there is no law for the banks and all the laws are for the others.  There has been reckless carry-on, and that is why I take a very poor view of the repeal of section 6 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  Where was the Attorney General?  She was able to give three and a half hours to individual Deputies recently, trying to persuade them to vote for this ill-named, ill-timed and unfair Bill that we will deal with tomorrow.  In my view, that is another abuse of government.  Why could nobody proofread this legislation in 2012?  Why must we make amendments to something that is hardly on the Statute Book yet does not work?  Where are the people who are paid to draft this legislation?  They had all the legal advice they needed to base it on, as well as the aid of the Attorney General's Office.  They should do that instead of lecturing and trying to persuade backbench Deputies to vote for an immoral Bill.  It would be more in their line to earn their money by drafting proper legislation rather than coming back in mid-2013 to try to amend a section of the 2012 Personal Insolvency Act.  It is a shambles and a disgrace.  I can see the Minister's fingerprints all over it.  Anything that makes more money for the legal people is something the Minister will always support.</p></speech>

Every justice system is built on ideals.  It seeks to remedy wrongs and protect the most vulnerable in society.  Unfortunately, no system is perfect.  The failings of the system are not the creation of any one individual and do not reflect the well-intentioned individuals within the system.  Unfortunately, the very people it seeks to aid become victims to a structure that is in dire need of reform.</p><p>  Nowhere is this more evident than in the family law courts.  The introduction of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 is finally addressing that which needs reform.  The family law court should be the last resort in the breakdown of the most fundamental unit in society, the family.  Every case that comes before this court involves a unique story of heartbreak, trauma and pain.  These families are at their most vulnerable when they come before the courts.  In so coming, they seek a conclusion to a painful chapter in their lives.  Sadly, what they typically encounter is a system in complete disarray, congested with chronic delays, endless backlogs and brief hearings.  One case may come before several judges before it gets to a full hearing.  It is estimated that it takes up to two and a half years to process a typical case, a figure that does not account for persistent adjournments.  Is it fair that in this system hearing dates given for maintenance applications on behalf of women and children are repeatedly adjourned?  Why is this allowed to occur constantly?  Often there is no proper case management, which fosters a sense of chaos.</p><p>  In addition to the serious disarray in the system, those involved are often burdened with great financial costs.  The cost of taking a case to the Circuit Court is enormous.  Often, families do not go to court because of these very expenses.  The expenses an individual may have are compounded by additional legal costs, with multiple adjournments, brief hearings and multiple affidavits.  The strongest of women have been worn down because of legal red tape and monstrous legal costs.  The high cost of taking legal action has resulted in increased need for legal aid, a service that is already struggling under the weight of demand.  The courts may fight for a woman's maintenance order but may tend to ignore how she can afford or access basic necessities for herself and her children in the meantime.  Frustratingly, this ailing system can leave families devastated, emotionally and financially, by the time their cases are processed.</p><p>  The family courts, whether in the Circuit Court or the High Court, are housed in buildings that are lacking in facilities.  Dolphin House in particular struggles with the growing demand and has inadequate facilities and resources to process these cases.</p></speech>

Despite promises at the time from Ministers that decisive action was being taken to confront the problem head on, we now see the situation is actually getting worse.</p><p>  In the intervening period the numbers of arrears cases has continued to increase while the number of genuinely sustainable solutions put in place by the banks has been little short of abysmal.  Borrowers are now being hit by a triple whammy in the form of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill which will make home repossessions easier, the mortgage arrears resolution targets programme which incredibly allows the banks themselves to define what is a sustainable solution and now the revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears which unravels vital protections for homeowners.  Approximately 70,000 families are no longer protected from repossession proceedings being undertaken immediately by the banks.  There are over 54,000 family home mortgages in arrears of one year or more.  If one looks <i>pro rata</i> at those who are in arrears between six and 12 months approximately 16,000 of those can be assumed to be in arrears of eight months or more.  When one adds that to the 54,000 it comes to approximately 70,000 families completely at the mercy of the banks facing possible repossession proceedings.</p><p>  I listened to the interview with the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan, on radio at the weekend.  While he did not repeat the language that he used in February when he said that Central Bank officials were tearing their hair out in frustration at the lack of progress being made in tackling the crisis, it was clear from his comments and other media reports that the banks have not stepped up to the plate.  In that context it is inexplicable that the Central Bank would sign off on a revised code which strips borrowers of some of the remaining protections they had.  As I said previously, the banks have not held off repossessing family homes to date out of any sense of economic altruism, social solidarity, or out of recognition at the costs they have inflicted on the taxpayer but quite simply because their hands have been tied by the Dunne judgment and the terms of the previous code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p><p>  On Friday of this week the Seanad is likely to pass the Bill which will remove the loophole which limited repossession actions while the code of conduct will in effect let the banks off the leash to pursue borrowers in cases where the bank deems the mortgage to be unsustainable.  It is worth noting what the code itself says in this regard, where a bank writes to a borrower to advise them that their loan is unsustainable &quot;legal proceedings may commence three months from the date the letter is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later&quot;, and that, &quot;irrespective of how the property is repossessed and disposed of, the borrower will remain liable for the outstanding debt, including any accrued interest, charges, legal, selling and other related costs, if this is the case.&quot;  This is a significant weakening of the protection which previously existed for borrowers.</p><p>  Our motion requests that the code be revised to reincorporate the 12 month moratorium before repossession actions are allowed to commence.  In addition, it puts forward what I think is a very reasonable suggestion that before a repossession order is granted by the courts the bank be required to obtain from the Central Bank as regulator written confirmation that it has in fact exhausted all viable alternative options to repossession.</p><p>  Widespread home repossession is an almost unknown phenomenon to us in Ireland but the UK went through a disastrous period of social upheaval in the early 1990s as a consequence of thousands of families being put out of their homes.  Despite arrears of greater than six months peaking at 3.5% in 1992 - a level far below what we are experiencing in Ireland - 200,000 homes were repossessed in the period 1990 to 1992.  The social and economic effects of the failed policies that led to this situation were still being felt years later.</p><p>  We have all come across some extraordinary lending decisions where mortgages were granted that should never have seen the light of day.  I want to share one with the House.  This relates to a buy-to-let mortgage where the lending decision simply beggars belief.  This lending decision was made by a main bank in Ireland.  It relates to a married couple who, pretty much at the height of the boom, bought an investment property.  The husband was then 61 years of age and was retiring as a public servant and was due to receive a lump sum of around &euro;100,000.  His wife was a housewife and did not work outside the home.  They decided to buy a house as their pension, with a view to selling it on a short few years later.  The house cost approximately &euro;300,000.  The couple received a 14 year mortgage of &euro;196,000.  That was a 14 year mortgage when the sole income earner was retired and aged 61.  The mortgage would take the husband up to the age of 75.  The couple put the &euro;100,000 lump sum with the mortgage and bought an investment property for &euro;300,000.  The original loan agreement provided that the loan would be on interest only for seven years and for the remaining seven years, the couple would pay &euro;2,700 per month, a level of repayment that was never going to be possible.</p><p>To grant a 14 year mortgage to a 61 year old man and put it on seven years interest-only on the basis of a modest public sector pension is simply beyond belief.  When the loan got into difficulty after the interest-only period expired around 2012, the bank's solution was for the couple to pay &euro;1,000 per month for a 12 month period and for them then to clear the remaining amount of the loan, including arrears, in the six years that were left in the lifetime of the mortgage agreement.  That is the degree of lack of realism with which we are dealing.  It highlights the level of recklessness in the original lending decision and the complete detachment of the bank when trying to work out a solution to this mortgage.</p><p> Of course, I acknowledge the couple in this case made a very unwise, even foolish, investment decision and they have paid an extremely high price for that.  The bank's role in this and many thousands of other cases, however, has been truly extraordinary.  The couple in question is negotiating with the bank.  I am sure the property will be voluntarily surrendered, sold or repossessed.  The question in that case is what happens to the shortfall, which I expect to be between &euro;60,000 to &euro;70,000.  The couple now fear that their family home may well be vulnerable.</p><p> I know every Member has examples of appalling behaviour by banks in relation to original lending decisions and in relation to the efforts to put in place sustainable solutions.  It begs the question why we as a State are giving them even more power when they have not demonstrated any willingness or capacity to seek to resolve the mortgage arrears crisis.</p><p> When Bill Clinton addressed the Global Irish Network in Dublin Castle in October 2011, he identified the mortgage crisis as the number one economic challenge facing Ireland.  He was absolutely correct in his view.  Most of the attendees that day would surely not have believed, however, that almost two years on from that event, we would have seen little more than window dressing measures from the Government and banks.</p><p> The Taoiseach said this afternoon in the House that house repossessions have to be the last resort.  If he truly believes that, he will accept the proposals we are putting forward that the banks be required to obtain verification independently that they were left with no other course of action before they are facilitated by the courts.  My experience of dealing with individual cases is that repossession of the family home is no longer the option of last resort but is becoming the preferred solution of many banks.  I have dealt with cases where people have not even yet fallen into arrears, for example, but who have anticipated they would be coming into financial difficulty through loss of employment or, in one case, because the wife was going to give birth.  They went to the banks and sought to anticipate a problem down the road.  The banks' solution to them at the time, when they put all their cards on the table, was that they believed the people in question could continue to repay the mortgage fully and, if not, the banks wanted the keys back or they would initiate legal proceedings.  That is what is happening on the ground.  Repossession is no longer the last resort for the banks.</p><p> My concern is that all the powers that have been given to the banks through the legislation on the Dunne judgment, the mortgage arrears targets programme and the revised code of conduct have all firmly shifted that delicate balance of power between borrowers and lenders, giving the banks a stronger hand to deal with borrowers who are trying to live with the daily reality and the financial distress that having a mortgage in arrears brings with it.</p><p> The statistic for the number of houses that are in line for possible repossession is most striking when one considers the latest statistics from the Central Bank.  Only 144 split mortgage solutions have been put in place.  This represents 0.1% of family home mortgages in arrears and is a shocking indictment of the failure of the banks to face up to the problem.  Ministers consistently say that 80,000 mortgages have been restructured.  This is a distortion of reality.  Looking at the breakdown of that, where 26,000 mortgages were put on interest-only, 17,000 were put on reduced payment that was greater than interest-only, 7,000 were put on payments where the amount was less than interest-only, and 2,500 were moved to payment moratorium arrangements, one gets the sense very quickly that what has been done to date does not represent genuine or sustainable restructuring of mortgages in question.</p><p> As far back as the autumn of 2011, we put forward radical solutions which involved giving the power to an independent office within the personal insolvency service to make decisions that would be binding on both the borrower and lender on what would be a fair and equitable outcome in the case of individual mortgage arrears.  I have a lot more to say, but I know my colleagues have to contribute and that I will get a chance to wrap up the debate tomorrow evening, so I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>

If there is any subject that is causing more grief to more families, I certainly do not know about it.  The whole financial issue is one of the major challenges facing people in our society.  I would like to look first at an issue that seems to loom large when people look at possible solutions, namely, the issue of moral hazard.  It is the most ridiculous concept when one thinks of the significant number of the 140,000 to 150,000 people who are either in mortgage difficulties or are paying their mortgages and just hanging in there keeping repayments up to date.  Using moral hazard as an excuse for doing nothing is just that - an excuse, and nothing more.  If one were to carry moral hazard to its logical conclusion, we would have the ridiculous situation where those who contributed to their health problems would be examined before they would be allowed to go into hospital for treatment at a cost to the State.</p><p>  The majority of people in trouble with their family finances are in trouble because houses were too dear, they borrowed too much money and they had expectations about their salaries which exceeded what is reasonable.  I accept there were those who were foolish, but there are people who get assistance from the State all the time who make bad decisions.  This idea of moral hazard seems to me to be the latest new fad.  It very much reminds me of Victorian attitudes about the deserving and undeserving poor - the more things change, the more things stay the same.  I do not and never will buy into that type of thinking.</p><p>  Let us stand back from this problem and look at how a person could be in trouble today with their mortgage despite having taken very prudent decisions all along.  Take the example of two lower end public servants who borrowed money because they had a child and wanted a home.  They paid over the odds for a house because that is what one had to pay to get a house in the years from 2004 and 2006.  They did it on the expectation that their salaries would have gone up by at least 5% or 6% in the intervening years, which would have been very modest.  They did it on the basis that they would follow a career path within the public service and that they would have perhaps got promotions as the years went by.  Was it foolish of them that they did not build into that the 17% reduction in their salaries through pension levies, pay reductions and so forth, the ban on recruitment which has meant that promotional opportunities are gone, a range of new taxes such as the household tax which have been introduced, the decrease in child benefit, all of which added together have meant that instead of going up, their income has in fact been coming down in the intervening years, and variable interest rates on mortgages have been going up?</p><p>Here we have a very prudent couple who are in trouble because events have taken place which could not have been foreseen by anybody.  The reality is that they would be the lucky couple today and would still be in employment.  As we know in many cases, people have lost employment and in two income families, one of the incomes has largely disappeared.  The reality is that many people are in trouble through no fault of their own.</p><p> The Government has created a situation where it has the banks sitting in judgment above all people, having a veto over the arrangements and deciding whether the person is adhering to a proper financial plan or not.  It would be more proper if the banks were made to answer for themselves rather than sit in judgment on everybody else.  Trying to solve 148,000 cases on a case-by-case basis is ludicrous.  The amount of time it takes this State to deal with one social welfare case, which is simple compared to sorting out a person's finances, should be a warning that if we want to go through all those cases on a case-by-case basis, we will strangle this economy and we will be at it forever.  It is just not doable.  It is time we realised that we need to make decisions for a wide swathe of these people who are in difficulty because their income has dropped and we have to help them in the simplest way.</p><p> I was very interested in a proposal made by the Phoenix Project, whose representatives met the Minister for Finance recently.  They basically said there is a great number of people in mortgage difficulties who should be helped by an automatic system rather than by a person-by-person solution.  They proposed that the tax relief at source, or TRS, would be increased from 30% to 60% for those who bought during the boom years, and this group has already been defined under the law.  If a person is paying &euro;1,000 in interest per month, then currently about &euro;300 is paid by the State through the tax system straight to the bank, irrespective of the person's personal income.  By increasing it to 60%, the person would only have to pay &euro;400.  Once that is done, nobody would have to apply because the reading would be changed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Instant relief would immediately be provided to those who are just hanging in.  Those just paying interest only could start paying interest and capital.  Those paying 80% of the interest could pay the full interest.  In other words, everybody would move up a notch.  Then we could deal with the people in serious trouble on a case-by-case basis.  We would have a small enough number of people who could not be rescued for all sorts of reasons.  There were always people with social problems in the mix and we could deal with those on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> The cost of this would be about &euro;300 million per year.  There is a perfect way of financing this because the Government has claimed that its cash flow has improved by &euro;1 billion per year because of the deal it has done on the debt of Anglo Irish Bank.  I call on my colleagues in the House who are members of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party to use a portion of this money to help the hard-pressed mortgage holder.  The argument against this will be that there might be some people with mortgages who will be helped and who might not need the help.  When we give free fees to people, free access to hospital care and so on, we often help people who could pay for these out of their own pockets, so there is nothing new in this.  Neither should we forget that until about ten years ago, people got tax relief on the mortgage at the marginal rate of tax, so many people in the past were getting 48% and 60% tax relief on mortgages.  Finally, should we spoil the party for the 95% that we would help significantly because maybe 5% would benefit?  If we are really worried about that, we could put in a clawback on the high end of the income in case we might accidentally help a few people who do not need it.  If 95% would gain genuinely from this simple, effective and non-bureaucratic measure, then we should do it.  If a few people were to get a bonus from that, then what the hell.</p></speech>

I had not intended to speak on the motion put forward by Deputy McGrath, but yesterday morning a man and his daughter came into my office in a distressed state.  They only owed &euro;27,000 on their home and they have been paying interest only for the last year and they have never missed a payment, but between Friday and yesterday morning they received 15 phone calls from their bank inquiring when they were going to make the full payment on a monthly basis.  Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., it was suggested to them that they should sell the house and pay back what they owe to the bank.  That seems strange given that they owe only &euro;27,000 and they are meeting the interest only repayments.  That shows the harassment that people are suffering from the banks at the moment.  Many people like that family are being harassed daily by the banks seeking their full payments.  The man in my office yesterday is unemployed and his daughter is in college.  He is making every effort to make repayments, even though they are interest only.  He should not be subject to the harassment that he is getting from the banks.</p><p>  That brings us to the discussion we are having tonight.  The revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears, published at the end of June, takes away an important protection for borrowers.  Taken together with the mortgage arrears resolution targets programme and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013, it forms part of a consistent pattern of placing ever more power and control in the hands the banks.  The complete failure of the banks to put sustainable solutions in place to date can be seen from the fact that there are 144,000 mortgage cases in arrears and they have dealt with very few of them in the past 18 months.  The back drop for dealing with the crisis is one of cuts to disposable income, jobless economic recovery, rising variable interest rates, declining property prices, further hits to households in the form of reduced wages, reduced social welfare payments, property tax, a possible water tax which the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has spoken about introducing, and so on.  All of these problems are building up for people who have large mortgages and who are in negative equity.</p><p>  Following various initiatives by the Government and the Central Bank, the balance of power has shifted firmly in favour of the banks and against the distressed mortgage holder.  Essential safeguards have not been put in place to counteract the possibility of abuse of the increased contact which banks will be permitted to engage in with distressed borrowers.  The new code does not enshrine an entitlement to a minimum level of income for a borrower entering an arrangement with the bank, and there is no requirement that borrowers receive independent legal advice.</p><p>  Many people come into me with these problems, and I am sure they come to every other Deputy as well.</p><p>We refer many of the cases to MABS.  While MABS is doing an excellent job, it is understaffed.  I try to accompany people as often as possible when they go to discuss their arrears and loans with their banks.  Perhaps it is time that MABS or some other organisation is given an oversight role to ensure the borrower is protected at all times.  I have heard first-hand stories about how people are treated by the banks.  Usually the bank managers at local level do not have a clue about how to deal with mortgage arrears and they are inclined to harass people if they come alone.  It is important that they have legal representation or are represented by MABS or another organisation.  Bank personnel at local level are not equipped to deal with mortgage problems.  They are not properly trained or given the advice they need.  More often than not, deals reached at local level are refused by head office in Dublin.</p><p> This is an important motion and the Government should accept it.  Over the last several months Deputy Michael McGrath has been putting forward a number of useful initiatives.  The time has come for the Government to stand up to the banks and stop them from riding roughshod over people in mortgage arrears.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900046#TT00200"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for giving us the opportunity to debate the issue of mortgage arrears.  It has been approximately two years since he first raised the issue of mortgage arrears.  In the summer of 2011 he, along with Senators MacSharry, Byrne and Darragh O'Brien, pointed out the need for an independent arbitration agency to address a number of issues that had arisen.  However, two years later nothing substantial has been done to alleviate the problem for the 142,000 whose mortgages were in arrears at the end of March.  As I look around a relatively empty Chamber, it strikes me that tomorrow evening it will be full as the latest instalment of the drama that is this bubble is played out.  A drama is playing out in 142,000 homes across this State and politicians and everyone else in society need to wake up and smell the coffee because the situation is serious.  I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for his consistent advocacy on behalf of these people.</p><p>  We are seeing in the Government's response a watering down of the legal and regulatory defences for distressed mortgage holders in their dealings with financial institutions.  The Government amendment to our motion welcomes the Land and Conveyancing Reform Bill 2013 for addressing a lacuna in the law which created uncertainty about the exercise by lending institutions of their repossessing rights.  Tomorrow night Government Deputies will vote to welcome an explicit statement on the purpose of that Bill.  The Government is in danger of cheering on an avalanche repossessions through such statements.</p><p>  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears has been watered down.  The example outlined by Deputy Browne is a result of that watering down.  Over the course of a weekend a person received 15 telephone calls culminating in a threat to repossess the house by the following Monday morning.  Luckily this individual had the wit to consult somebody but what if the calls continued over the Monday and Tuesday now that the code of conduct has been watered down?  Such behaviour was not permitted previously.  We do not have an opportunity to listen to those telephone conversations.  We can listen to taped telephone conversations among Anglo Irish Bank executives but we cannot listen to the interaction between whatever bank made those calls and its client.  We do not know what sort of threats were made and, most important, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance do not know.  Our motion calls for a reversal of this watering down but if we are to accept it, the least we should demand is that the calls be recorded for use in the event of a dispute.</p><p>  The main issue arising is the lack of an independent mechanism for adjudicating between a distressed borrower and a financial institution on the content of a sustainable solution.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others referred to the issue of moral hazard.  I do not doubt that some people are exploiting this crisis to evade their responsibilities but we have no way of finding out about that other than by extrapolating figures and making judgments.  An independent agency with proper functions could decide what percentage of mortgages holders, whether investment or residential, are deliberately deceiving the system and how many are in genuine distress.  The Government appears reluctant to agree to such an approach.  When Deputy Michael McGrath and his colleagues made their proposals in 2011, we were told that the personal insolvency service would ride into town to save the day like a hero in an old Western movie.   I was my party's justice spokesperson when the heads of the Bill were being debate.  I disagree with the Minister for Justice and Equality on many issues but I acknowledge that he engaged on the heads of the Bill.  We also heard submissions from a variety of organisations.  The central recommendation of the independent organisations which deal with these issues on a daily basis, such as MABS, the Legal Aid Board and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation Association, was that an independent element is needed.  The Minister resisted that suggestion and, with the Insolvency Service of Ireland, we now have an organisation that is full of good intent but will ultimately hit a wall because the banks are still in control.  As long as the banks have a veto over settlements, I do not think people will engage with the service.</p><p>  All of us deal with MABS on a daily basis.  Given the confidence that people have placed in MABS, I would have thought we shared a desire to give it the resources it requires to manage the situation but there appears to be reluctance to do that.  Senior people who are retiring from the system should be allowed to get involved.  We are not giving MABS the resources it needs.</p><p>  This problem affects every aspect of society.  Approximately 54,000 family homes are more than 12 months in arrears and a total of 142,000 were in arrears at the end of March.  These families are paralysed by debt and the fear of what may come.  That paralysis extends to their ability to spend.  They cannot spend money in their local economy.  The Central Bank and the banks cannot even reach agreement on minimum income thresholds.  The Government refuses to set out the minimum basic income a family needs to survive.  We have given the keys to the banks to define the minimum income.  They have the right to go through borrowers for a dose of salts before deciding what they can spend.  How can we expect our domestic economy to recover to the point of creating employment or our health service to cope with an avalanche of mental and physical health issues while we have our heads in the sand on mortgage arrears?  The figures show that the problem is getting worse because the response is not robust enough to instill confidence.</p><p>  As we come to the end of another D&aacute;il session, we are putting these issues back on the table.  We will raise them again in the coming sessions.  We need to put our energies into resolving this issue if we are to restore the economy.  The Minister for Finance indicated again today that he will engage with the troika on exiting from the programme.  The troika's departure will be welcome but if this issue remains unresolved we will face a bigger challenge.  We must allow these people to live their lives.</p><p>We must allow them become full citizens of the country again and allow them spend money, money that will give the Minister the kind of revenue he needs to improve the economy and employment and bring the country back to an even keel.  Surely everybody shares that ambition.</p></speech>

The context for the mortgage arrears and high level of indebtedness is the economic downturn.  The Government is deeply committed to addressing the failures of the last Government and to generating economic recovery, growth and jobs.  We want to produce an environment where mortgage holders can pay for and stay in their homes and where those who have difficulty in meeting their financial commitments are provided with an opportunity to resolve their problems and begin again to contribute to society.  The Government is very much aware of the difficulties some homeowners face in meeting their mortgage obligations and we are committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist mortgage holders who are experiencing real difficulty.  I would like to outline to the Deputies the steps we have taken, as well as our continued efforts in assisting citizens who face difficulties with mortgage arrears.</p><p>  A Cabinet sub-committee on mortgage arrears, chaired by the Taoiseach and with a membership comprising the T&aacute;naiste, myself, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning has been established to provide strong political support for the implementation of policy measures designed to assist households struggling with debt arrears.  This Government sub-committee acts to reinforce the co-ordinated response to the mortgage arrears crisis and to drive the development of the personal insolvency legislation and the implementation of the other recommendations to tackle the mortgage arrears problem as set out in the Keane report.</p><p>  At official level, a high level steering group meets on a fortnightly basis to co-ordinate and drive the implementation of the strategy and to receive and monitor the reports from the relevant Departments and agencies on the implementation of their respective areas of the overall strategy.  This group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, consists of senior officials from the Department of Finance and from the Departments of the Taoiseach, the Environment, Community and Local Government, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  The work of the steering group is built around the following pillars: personal insolvency law reform and implementation; mortgage to rent schemes; a mortgage advisory function; and engagement with the banks to develop appropriate measures for customers in mortgage arrears.</p><p>  The establishment of the Government sub-committee and the official high-level steering group clearly signal that the implementation of effective and appropriate measures to tackle the mortgage crisis is a key policy priority for the Government.  It also indicates that a co­ordinated national strategy, premised on interdepartmental co-operation, has been adopted to address the critical problem of rising household debt distress.</p><p>  Personal insolvency reform was identified by the Keane report as a catalyst for addressing the mortgage arrears problem.  The report indicated that without an effective insolvency system, the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.  The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors to reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and other personal debt.  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 provides for three new debt settlement frameworks.  The first is a debt relief notice to allow for the writing off of debt, subject to conditions, up to &euro;20,000 for persons of &quot;no assets or no income&quot;, subject to a supervision period of three years; the second is a debt settlement arrangement for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, normally over a period of five years; and the third is a personal insolvency arrangement for the agreed settlement of both secured debt of up to &euro;3 million and unsecured debt without limit, though the upper limit can be increased with the agreement of creditors, normally over a period of 6 years.  The Act also provides for reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, which is critical to providing for automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after three years.  It also provides for the establishment of the new Insolvency Service of Ireland to operate the new insolvency frameworks.</p><p>  A number of concerns have been raised about the balance of power between banks and debtors, which has commonly been referred to as a &quot;bank veto&quot;.  The reality is that it is in the best interest of both debtors and creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable bilateral arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act, be it a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.  It should be noted that the framework set out in the Personal Insolvency Act in respect of creditor consent is essentially that as recommended in the Law Reform Commission report from 2010.  Both debtors and creditors have rights in a financial contract and these must be respected, having regard to the insolvency of the debtor.  Of course, in the event that neither a debt settlement arrangement nor a personal insolvency arrangement can be agreed between debtors and creditors, the ultimate resolution option is and remains judicial bankruptcy.</p><p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, was formally established on 1 March 2013 following the signing of the establishment order by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  An information campaign was subsequently launched last April.  The campaign included the publication of guides to the three new arrangements - debt relief notices, debt settlement arrangements, and personal insolvency arrangements; the launch of the ISI website, which contains various scenarios of how the new arrangements may work in practice; the launch of an information line for the public; and, crucially, the publication of guidelines on a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses for debtors.</p><p>  Deputies will be aware that last month the ISI published updated guidelines on a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses to reflect consumer price index information to March 2013.  This is important to ensure that personal insolvency practitioners will use the most up-to-date information available when formulating proposed arrangements.</p><p>  Regulations providing for the authorisation of approved intermediaries and personal insolvency practitioners have been signed and the ISI is now receiving and processing applications from those who wish to be authorised to act in that capacity.  Once a fully completed application is made, the ISI expects to be in a position to issue an authorisation within ten working days.  It is expected that debtors will be able to contact practitioners and begin to receive advice from them in the second half of July, and the ISI expects to begin receiving applications for debt relief notices and protective certificates shortly thereafter.  A number of professional bodies have already provided training courses to those interested in applying to become a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, and it is likely that the number of applications for and the authorisation of PIPs will increase steadily throughout the summer.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Government has nominated six special judges for appointment to the Circuit Court to deal with personal insolvency matters and these will be in place to provide the necessary judicial oversight when insolvency cases start to be processed.  As Deputies will be aware, the Courts Bill 2013, which is currently before the Oireachtas, also contains the legal and practical requirements necessary to transfer the function of official assignee in bankruptcy from the Courts Service to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  The Bill will also include a number of other necessary amendments, mostly of a technical and drafting nature, to ensure the proper functioning of the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.</p><p>  The Deputies' suggestion that senior officials in the Department of Finance and in the Central Bank are predicting a significant number of repossessions is incorrect.  Indeed, at the weekend the Governor of the Central Bank publicly indicated that he hopes that very few family homes will be repossessed.  The suggestions by Deputies of large-scale repossessions as a matter of course are not helpful and, given the role Fianna F&aacute;il played in the mortgage crisis, they should be more responsible with their statements.</p></speech>

However, in the majority of cases of mortgage difficulty, it will be possible to address the problem, in the best interest of all parties, through a mortgage restructure.  Indeed, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement to address mortgage difficulties.  In addition, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill currently before the Oireachtas provides an important power to the court to adjourn a repossession hearing to allow a personal insolvency arrangement to be proposed and considered as an alternative option.</p><p>The mortgage to rent scheme is now available as an option to low income families who wish to remain in their home.  The latest information I have is that 37 cases have now been completed and are awaiting closure, while a further 27 cases are at valuation or sale negotiation stage of the process.  The mortgage to rent scheme ensures peace of mind for the borrower and their family that they can remain living in their home without disruption to family life, despite being in a difficult financial situation, and they pay a rent they can afford.</p><p> A mortgage information and advice service has also been put in place which comprises a detailed website, a mortgage arrears information helpline and a targeted independent advice service provided by accountants to borrowers availing of long-term forbearance from their lender.  It is important that this service is kept under consideration and the Department of Social Protection is currently reviewing the one-to-one advice part of the service.</p><p> Given that this overall strategy is in place, it is now essential to ensure that banks proactively address the position of their customers in difficulty and that they propose sustainable solutions.  Therefore, on 13 March the Central Bank announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for proposing and concluding sustainable solutions for borrowers in arrears over 90 days for the main mortgage banks.  The Central Bank has indicated that, in determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the lender needs to evaluate both current and future affordability for the borrower's affordability and the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility to minimise losses.</p><p> While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, there are some fundamental principles that must be respected, as follows.  The affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings, and assumed prospective future increases in the debt servicing ability of the borrower must be credible and conservative.  Lenders need to apply a realistic valuation of the borrower's assets, in particular their property.  This also applies to any assumption of potential asset price appreciation, as well as the estimated costs related to a potential foreclosure of property.  Lenders need to use an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender's cost of funds.  Importantly, the Central Bank will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.</p><p> The Central Bank has now concluded a review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.  A revised CCMA came into effect on 1 July 2013 which provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears.  It reflects the current mortgage arrears situation and seeks to ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation; ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner; support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating.</p><p> There has been much debate about the moratorium period, which was previously 12 months.  While this has been modified, it should be noted that the revised CCMA requires a lender to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose and to make every attempt to engage actively with the borrower during that time before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.  As a result, we expect that a more realistic and sustainable set of solutions will be offered to address a mortgage problem in everyone's best interest.  This change should also be looked at in the context of the new insolvency resolution options that are going to be available to debtors.  This legislation also gives the debtor statutory time protection periods to enable him or her to formulate an insolvency proposal to submit to creditors.</p><p> Ultimately, the Government is of the view that it is the regeneration of the economy, the restoration of employment levels and income growth that will address the real social and economic problems associated with high levels of personal indebtedness.  That is why Government is focused, through its many new initiatives, on fostering and generating economic growth.  The successful achievement of renewed growth in the economy will restore consumer confidence and bring the tangible and sustainable recovery the country requires.</p></speech>

While I am sure it is the same for everybody, a significant amount of my constituency work these days concerns people in mortgage arrears, debt and negative equity, including problems moving from a property that is too small for the family size to a bigger property because the family is in negative equity.  This work is very important in that it means we are in touch with how these issues affect our constituents in practice, which is why it is so important to do constituency work and why it is such an important part of our job.</p><p>  I will not go through all of the measures that are in place but I make the point that other measures are needed.  The Department of Social Protection currently deals with mortgage arrears.  The issue is that, while the number of people in arrears has increased, the number of people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement has decreased, and I suggest this is largely to do with new rules that were introduced a year ago.  A group was set up by the Government a couple of years ago to consider the issue of mortgage arrears and it recommended that the rules for mortgage interest supplement should be changed to allow more people to qualify for it.  Currently, a person can only qualify for that social welfare payment if he or she works part-time, whereas the group recommended that it be made available to people who work full-time.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The group also suggested that the means test should be revised, as did a review from the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  It is very important that we do not let this happen again.  In my constituency, I have noticed new developments for sale where property is back to prices from some years ago, say, over &euro;300,000 for a family home, which is expensive.  The whole issue with the price of property was that it had become so far removed from people's salaries.  It is not just that we need prices to go up.  It is that we cannot allow a situation to arise again where there is a massive gap between what people earn and the price of housing.  We have to keep an eye on this issue and put in place steps to address it.  I would still be in favour of the implementation of the Kenny report.</p><p>  On an issue I raised in a parliamentary question to the Minister last week, life loans were sold by Bank of Ireland which I do not believe were appropriate to sell to older people with social welfare pensions.  I have a constituent who now has a massive loan hanging over her.  I do not believe this kind of product, which is basically an equity release product, should be offered on the market by our banks again.</p></speech>

That is a fact; the question is why.</p><p>The answer, of course, is that it is the legacy of the wait and see approach adopted by the previous Administration to this issue.  In short, it did nothing.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has raised this issue more times during this Administration than it ever did during its time in government.  The initial Cooney report was published on the day the D&aacute;il began a summer recess.  In November that year the final Cooney report was published, but the Government never facilitated a debate on the issues it raised.  In fact, the only debates that took place under the previous Administration on the issue of mortgage arrears were those held in Private Members' time by the Opposition.  The idea that there is any consistency in approach on the part of Fianna F&aacute;il to this matter simply beggars belief.</p><p> The reason for the current pent-up situation in respect of mortgage arrears is, as I have outlined, the wait and see stance taken by the previous Administration.  Fianna F&aacute;il in government essentially broke the housing market.  Deputy Michael McGrath recounted the case of a very distressed elderly person who was given a mortgage in circumstances in which it should never have been given.  On the other hand, there were many people who could not obtain a mortgage during the period in question.  I recall a weekend in April 2006 when I went knocking on doors in Donnybrook Hill, an area Deputy Michael McGrath knows well.  I spoke to a young couple there, one of whom was working in a pharmaceutical company in Cork Harbour, a company which was known for paying good wages, while the other was a public servant.  This couple were not earning enough to buy a house on the open market, but they were earning too much to be eligible for Cork County Council's affordable housing scheme, under which the average house price at the time was some &euro;250,000.  This was the same weekend that the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, made his famous comment that people should commit suicide instead of continuing to complain about the property market.  It was as plain as day to me as I left that couple's home that the property market was bust.  If first-time buyers cannot come into the market, the market is a fraud and will inevitably collapse.  All markets are the same.  If one buys a new car in the expectation of selling it in two years, there must be somebody who can buy it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="20:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900049#WW00300"><p>I wrote about it.  The Deputy and I were both writing for <i>Douglas Weekly</i> at the time, but we had different things to say.  The market was bust; there was no doubt about it.  The craziest aspect of the whole situation is that mortgages worth ten times people's incomes were being given out, with repayment periods of 30 to 35 years.  It was nothing but a Ponzi scheme, which was sustained by the Government simply because the money coming in was feeding the interests they wished to serve.</p><p>  The question we must ask ourselves in attempting to deal with the mortgage crisis is what precisely we wish to achieve.  In talking of recovery do we mean a return to housing inflation of 8% to 10%, or are we talking about a realistic inflation level of 2.5% to 3% per annum?  A sustainable market that is designed to prefer home owners over investors and which sees property as a home, not a commodity, is what can properly be described as a normalised housing market.  We did not have such a market during that time.  On the other hand, the measures the Government has taken since coming to office have begun the normalisation process.</p><p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion suggests the Dunne judgment should continue to hold and that a mortgage cannot be dealt with if it falls into default or where there is a belligerent lender.  That is nonsense.  The mortgage market cannot be normalised if banks do not have security on the loans they give out, as per normal lending practice.  If lenders cannot make a call on the security on a loan, the whole system is complete and utter nonsense.</p><p>  The motion's reference to the veto suggests Fianna F&aacute;il does not understand how it works.  The veto has an impact on unsecured lending because where there is a write-down on the property, that debt is transferred to the unsecured side of the loan.  This means that the credit union loan, holiday loan, credit card debt and so on are gazumped because the transfer accounts for a large proportion of what is coming in.  In other words, the veto is a mechanism that will help people in distressed circumstances to secure a write-down on both their secured and unsecured debt.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position on this issue in its motion is either reflective of a complete misunderstanding of how the veto works or is merely populist posturing.  Deputy Michael McGrath knows very well that for the insolvency legislation to come into law, it had to respect the property rights of loans.  The idea that a loan could be taken over without any recognition of property rights is populist nonsense and another example of the Punch and Judy politics Fianna F&aacute;il promised to abandon.</p><p>  The reinstatement of the 12 month moratorium is a worrying proposal.  What people need is a resolution at last of their situation.  There are mortgage holders who have been making interest-only payments for the past four years.  That money has been going into the banks week after week, subsidised by the State, without reducing borrowers' capital debt by a single cent.  The proposal that we return to the wait and see approach adopted by Fianna F&aacute;il in government is a very regressive one.  It is only one of the many shortcomings of the motion.  I urge the House to oppose it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-07-09a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="20:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900049#WW00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and state my support for the Government's amendment.  This Administration took office following an economic crash of unprecedented proportions, which not alone put property and share prices into free-fall but also brought crashing down the carefully constructed hopes and dreams of many ordinary families throughout the country.  The problem with the phrase "mortgage arrears" is that it goes no way towards describing the very real and deep distress householders feel when faced with the prospect of losing their family home.   For many of them, the past five years have been the perfect storm, with plunging property prices, dramatic decreases in take-home pay, significant volumes of job losses and short-time working weeks.</p><p>  Faced with great economic difficulties and the even more significant social and health problems arising as a consequence, the Government has taken action on a number of fronts.  The Personal Insolvency Act was one element of this response.  Over time, many thousands of householders will turn to its provisions to free themselves from the yoke of economic slavery.  The Act was signed into law in December 2012, the Insolvency Service of Ireland was formally established on 1 March and its first information campaign got under way in April.  Given the pent-up demand for the service, its workload is sure to be very heavy for months, if not years, to come.</p><p>  Also in March this year the Central Bank took significant steps to force mortgage lenders to offer durable solutions to mortgage holders over 90 days in arrears.  While the bank's objectives were praiseworthy, the action of many lenders to date has shown only minimal engagement.  That is most objectionable.  They have failed to engage with the notion of a durable solution and are continuing to pursue maximum settlements where the money is simply not there and never will be.  For many of these mortgage holders, the durable solution they should be seeking is insolvency.</p><p>  We have heard a great deal this week about ethics in business, particularly in banking.  While the Government is seeking a durable solution to the problem of mortgage arrears, the banks' bottom line remains just that.  It is all about the profits extracted.  We have seen and heard too much in recent weeks about bankers holding sway over public bodies, but that can no longer be tolerated in the post-bailout reality.  Every week in clinics across east Galway I encounter mortgage holders who simply cannot pay their debts.  The mountain of debt they face is crippling them and too often exacting a huge toll on family life.  Many people cannot countenance the prospect of their debt being unsustainable, but the prospect of a lifetime spent working for the banks is also unthinkable.  The people concerned need proper assistance and advice and a speedy resolution to their problems.  I note the efforts of the Insolvency Service of Ireland to make information available via the Internet, but a faceless website does not often provide all the answers.  People are often in such distress that they need assistance in negotiating the first steps out of the financial abyss in which they find themselves.  An independent advice service for borrowers is vital, given that a lack of understanding of financial jargon helped many householders into their present situation.  Faced with a David and Goliath situation of confused and distressed householder versus a mighty banking corporation, it is clear that an intermediary is needed to ensure fairness towards the individual.</p><p>  The Central Bank has sought to ensure banks have a range of options for mortgage holders in arrears, including trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and sale by agreement.  My experience in recent days, however, is that rather than offering split mortgages which is the preference of many mortgage holders or trade-down mortgages, the banks are instead focusing on sale by agreement.  Once again, this is a David versus Goliath situation where the bank requests the mortgage holder to sell his or her home by holding out as a carrot a minimal mortgage payment while the sale is being conducted.  That is a very tempting prospect for many hard-pressed families, but, at the same time, the bank is shaking the stick which says that if they fail to agree, it will move to seek repayment of the full amount.</p><p>This is not sale by agreement as envisaged by the Central Bank, it is sale by coercion.  Many of my colleagues have encountered similar situations and would welcome a mechanism whereby Oireachtas Members could raise such particularly obnoxious cases with the Central Bank with a view to having the options presented to the mortgage holder investigated.  It would also provide the Central Bank with a window into the impossible situations facing many families in all corners of Ireland and put names and faces to a problem that is often seen in solely economic terms.</p></speech>

We have heard much about mortgages and I welcome the fact that we are debating the topic, which is one of the issues most frequently debated in Private Members' time in this D&aacute;il.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a Private Members' motion on the issue earlier in the year.</p><p>  We have heard much about the figures.  I will never forget sitting in the Seanad Chamber on 10 April 2008 when the Leader of the Seanad, Donie Cassidy, who is a former distinguished Fianna F&aacute;il politician, rose to his feet and used his opportunity as Leader to say: <blockquote>Now is the right time to buy ... We have a duty to tell first-time house buyers, young couples with no previous experience, that there is unbelievable value in the marketplace today.  It will not last forever.  It is never the wrong time to do the right thing.  I offer the House the benefit of my experience and my opinion which is all any Member can do.  I will remind the House, perhaps in 12 or 18 months, when prices have again increased by 25% or 30%, that they were told this by the Leader of the House on this historic day.</blockquote>That was the Fianna F&aacute;il Leader of the Seanad in 2008, as property prices started to go down, telling inexperienced young couples to buy houses.  If one of those gullible people who listen to Donie Cassidy that day, speaking on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, bought a house, the value of the house today would have dropped by 55%.  That was the mantra at the time.  I raise it because it is important to put a debate such as this in context.  A couple of months previously, the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, came to my home county, Donegal, and told the public in comments aired on national television that those who moan and give out about the economy and the dangers in terms of house prices should go away and commit suicide.  A few months later, in 2009, when we could not ignore the fact that house prices were falling drastically, Brian Cowen went to the largest selling newspaper in the State and said that prospective buyers should not be discouraged by those who seem to portray the easing in house prices in a negative way.  People were sucked in by Fianna F&aacute;il for a simple reason - the party was up to its neck with property developers in the past decade.  We can see some of the judgments made in the courts today on people who were in these Houses and involved in the same kind of speculation as those who got us into this crisis.</p><p>  We are in this crisis and we need to deal with the consequences of what happened over the past decade.  Since the Government took office, we have seen mortgage arrears continuing to increase.  The issue continues to spiral out of control.  The figures for the first quarter in 2013 were very disappointing.  People genuinely believed there would be some easing off or scaling back of those falling into arrears.  Once more, we are rehearsing numbers that exceed 180,000 households in mortgage distress.  That means one in four mortgage holders are in mortgage distress and the number in long-term arrears, of over 180 days and over 720 days, is still increasing two and a half years into the lifetime of this Government.</p><p>  We heard tonight and we will hear more tomorrow about how the Government is acting.  I accept the Government is taking action but I disagree these actions will solve the crisis or that they are in any way in the interests of struggling homeowners.  This is a Government that justifies all actions by targets set by international capital.  It is a Government terrified by the banks in the same way as the previous Government.  These are the same banks the taxpayers saved and pumped billions of euro into them under Fianna F&aacute;il when it was in government.</p><p>  AIB is more or less  fully owned by the people of the State but recently it increased its interest rate on variable mortgages and there was not a peep out of the Government.  The Minister owns 15% of Bank of Ireland on behalf of the people but he did not raise a finger when the bank approved its CEO's take-home salary of &euro;843,000 for a year's work.  Let us not forget the Government has committed to repaying every last cent of Anglo Irish Bank debt as formal sovereign debt.  It is no wonder the banks are getting their own way when they deal with mortgages.  They asked to be let off the leash, the troika rode in behind them and the Government did what it always did, it crumbled and caved into the banks once again.</p><p>  The Central Bank targets only force the banks to offer arrangements.  The problem is that the banks can tick the boxes by offering arrangements while ramping up the tools for repossession at the same time.  The troika is back in town and in its most recent report the IMF and the EU Commission focused on the issue of mortgages.  They said they expected to see the three contact rule and the 12-month moratorium reviewed.  As usual, they got what they wanted.  There was consultation but there was always a set outcome to the big questions.  The outcomes were well worked out in advance with the banks, the troika and the Government.</p><p>  We must ask where the need to review the code of conduct came from.  Were citizens lining up to have less protection from the banks?  Who was barging down to Government buildings asking the Government to give the banks more power?  The code of conduct was changed at the request of the banks and changed to suit the needs of the banks.  It certainly was not changed because of any mandate Fine Gael or the Labour Party received in the last general election.  On the contrary, the programme for Government is explicit on this issue.  It is bad enough if I have to do tell the Government to read its programme for Government, which states &quot;Both parties believe that more protection is needed for homeowners with distressed&quot; and the Government committed to &quot;introducing a two year moratorium on repossessions of modest family homes where a family makes an honest effort to pay their mortgage&quot;.  Another commitment in the programme for Government was to convert the Money Advice and Budgeting Service into a strengthened personal debt management agency with strong legal powers.  That, again, was ignored.</p><p>  This was before the banks started dictating policy to Fine Gael and Labour.  Now those commitments are out the window, the banks rule and society must pick up the tab.  In line with the submissions made by many others, Sinn F&eacute;in said there needed to be an independent body outside of banking to rule on what is fair and what is not.  We simply do not trust the banks.  The programme for Government referred to more protection for distressed mortgage holders but today the Seanad is rushing through the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill, which will be enacted next month.</p><p>  I welcome the aspect of the motion that deals with the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill.  However, let us call a spade a spade.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill was introduced in 2009 and allowed for repossessions of family homes.  Deputies Michael McGrath, Miche&aacute;l Martin and &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and every other Fianna F&aacute;il Member at the time voted for it.  It was only because of clever lawyers and a couple of individuals taking on Start Mortgages that they found a loophole in the Fianna F&aacute;il legislation that prevented repossessions taking place.  Let us be under no illusions.  In 2009, when property prices were crashing, the Bill was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and allowed for family home repossessions.  The jury is out on whether Fianna F&aacute;il is serious and whether it would scrap the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill if in government but the words have not yet been echoed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Bill will remove the Dunne judgment which, although not an ideal means of guarding the family home for borrowers, meant that some sort of protection has existed for borrowers in distress.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled many amendments to the Bill, which could have given a level playing field.  We could have given the court the power to decide whether the banks were being reasonable or just playing the game but the Government said &quot;No&quot;.  The Government has no time for fairness for homeowners and has made up its mind.  The Government is with the banks, regardless of the social consequences.</p><p>Taken together, the new code of conduct and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill constitute a co-ordinated attack on struggling homeowners.  They are part of a plan to make it easier to repossess family homes.  In the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in to the motion, we focus on the here and now and what needs to be done to protect the one in four mortgage holders who are in distress.  The Minister can and should direct the Central Bank to suspend the revised elements of the code of conduct.  The Minister for Justice and Equality must allow cool heads to prevail and let the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill wait in the shadows for the time being.  In short, the Government must take a step back and consider once more what it is doing.  This should be done immediately to ease the pressure on those who are struggling.  Does the Government want to be remembered as the one which made evictions from the family home a fact of modern life?  It is a question all Government Members must consider.</p><p> There is much more I could say on the issue.  We need a serious solution for those in arrears.  Part of a solution must be write-downs of unsustainable mortgages on a case-by-case basis and part of it must be an economic policy which seeks to grow the economy, not to shrink it.  It is time to row back.  The Government has had two and a half years and its approach is not working.  Things are getting worse.</p></speech>

While these terms may be technically correct, I am not sure they do the issue justice and paint the fullest picture.  When we talk of mortgage arrears, we should remember the people we are discussing and the suffering and hardship they are undergoing.  My constituency office has dealt with numerous people who are at their wits' end trying to juggle bills, put petrol in their cars, provide food for their children and make mortgage payments they simply cannot afford.  Many work countless hours - any hours that are available - to keep their heads above water and stretch their money as far as they can.  Many more are searching desperately for any work to help them to keep paying bills and make repayments.  Many people are trying their best to do without some of the basics, much less the luxuries that keep one going from week to week.</p><p>  I cannot imagine the worry, concerns and fears that go through people's heads as they wonder if they can hold on to the family home they dreamed of and worked so hard to acquire on the property ladder.  Think of the mental strain of constantly looking at bills coming in and wages going out while ensuring the balance is manageable, struggling, perhaps in vain, to meet mortgage payments on homes which are often not worth the price they paid.  Many families in my constituency are struggling in Rathcormac, Midleton, Carrigtwohill, Cobh and Youghal.  These are people who could not be further from those at the heart of the crash.  They are a million miles from the David Drumms and Seanie FitzPatricks of this world.  They did not cause the economic crisis.  They are ordinary, decent people who work and struggle every day and keep the country running.  They are the people who will help to lift us out of recession if they are given half a chance.  To do that, they need help.  They need space to breathe and they need a chance to make a new start.  They deserve better than they are getting from the Government.</p><p>  The Government has now been in office for over two years and failed so far to deal with this issue.  There are 180,000 households in mortgage distress, representing one in four mortgage holders.  The numbers in long-term arrears of more than 180 days and 720 days, respectively, continue to increase.  While I recognise that they inherited a shambles from Fianna F&aacute;il, which created the boom, the Government parties were willing cheerleaders.  The Government has had adequate time to make an impact on the issue.  Instead, it has patiently and meekly waited on some act of benevolence from the banks which was never going to come.  The Government has shown it is entirely in thrall to the banks notwithstanding that it is at the considerable expense of the Irish public that the banks are still functioning.  The Government refused to object to the &euro;843,000 salary paid to Bank of Ireland's CEO and shrugs its shoulders at any increase in interest rates at State-owned banks.</p><p>  My colleague, Deputy Doherty, has illustrated that the Government has options if it is willing to adopt an approach focused on the needs of homeowners rather than banks.  There is a need for a more realistic and socially responsible stance which prioritises in law the protection of the family home.  The adequate resourcing of MABS and other non-profit groups working with people in mortgage difficulty is essential.  People need access to information and advice rather than to be at the mercy of the banks.  Crucially, as the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment highlights, there is a need to get rid of the veto provided to banks in the Personal Insolvency Act and to remove the final say that is given to banks in any arrangement as part of the mortgage arrears resolution targets.  Many families are crying out for a break and helping hand.  It is within the Government's power to provide that if it decides to stand up to the banks rather than to allow them the final call.  I urge the Government to do so.</p></speech>

The Technical Group raised the mortgage crisis on Private Members' business in April 2011.  At that stage, it was obvious to everybody on this side of the House that there was a crisis.  It has only deepened since.  Today, 142,000 family home mortgages are in arrears, of which 54,000 are in arrears of 12 months or more.  It is a sure sign of the Government's inaction over the last two years.  It has failed to ensure that banks deal with their customers in a fair and reasonable manner and to prevent the crisis getting to the stage it is at now.</p><p>  The Government has said it is demanding action from the banks, yet it has done nothing to ensure they act to protect their customers and look after the people to whom they sold mortgages.  It is clear the banks are calling all the shots.  In all its dealings with the banks, the Government has asked them what they wanted done and then gone ahead and done it.  It has introduced a Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill to remove a legal loophole which prevented the banks from repossessing homes.  It has removed the 12 month embargo on the banks taking action where someone enters a mortgage arrears resolution process.  The Government has removed the bar on more than three contacts by a bank with a customer within a month and provided a veto to banks on insolvency arrangements where such arrangements do not match a bank's wishes.  The Government has provided the banks with a power to extend the period in which a person remains in an insolvency process for a further five years.  If people are lucky enough to turn their lives around and see some light at the end of the tunnel, the banks can step in to ensure they stay in the process for a further period.</p><p>  That is all the Government has done to address the crisis.  It must begin to look at the people who are struggling, look after their interests and stop looking after the interests of the banks.</p></speech>

Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party said in the programme for Government that they would get tough with the banks.  It is another broken promise.  MABS is at the coalface in this work.  It should be provided with more powers.  We know the figures, which have been trotted out by everybody tonight.  I will not repeat them.  I will talk about the people at the coalface, who the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, must know.  He is a businessman and I have often complimented him in that regard.  He has his own troubles on which I will not dwell tonight.</p><p>  The Government did not like Ms Justice Dunne's report and had to find a way around it.  What did it do to the ordinary people who are struggling to put food on the table and clothes on their children, meet school costs and pay for vital medicines and hospital charges?  What did we get from a Government that promised to get tough on the banks?  We got the Personal Insolvency Bill, which provided a veto to banks.  It is an insult to the public.  Last week in the D&aacute;il and this week in the Seanad, we have been given the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill.  What a nice name that is.  My goodness.  Why did the Government not call it what it is - the eviction Bill?  It is nothing short of that.  It is outrageous that it is being rammed through the House.</p><p>  The Government talks about a code of practice for the banks.  I have been in meetings in the Central Bank and see what banks are doing to ordinary farm contractors and other business people nationally.  They are sending out third force militia - a power above and beyond the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Army - to act at the behest of the bankers who know the Government, like the last one, allows them to act with impunity.  We used to have an old saying that there was one law for the banks and one law for ordinary people.  Now, there is law for ordinary people and no law for the banks.  They are operating with impunity while the Government passes law after law to give them a veto and impunity from prosecution.  Why would they not treat the people with disdain when they know they can get a nod and wink?  Who is the Government hiding?  What greater power is being hidden in this country?  All it can offer is a harum-scarum Oireachtas inquiry to blame Fianna F&aacute;il or someone else when the public knows the Government is hiding and running.</p><p>There is no place that the Government can hide or run to because the people know that the Government betrayed the promises it made them.  The Government betrayed the mandate they gave it and wants to hold a six-month Oireachtas inquiry of name-calling and name-blaming to let off the bankers, some of whom, Messrs. Dukes and company, are from the Minister's party.</p><p> What about the public interest directors in the banks?  I asked the Minister, Deputy Noonan, if they would do something and he told me in plain language they were there to serve the banks, not the public.  It was a bit of a spoof the way he came back but that was the message.  The banks must be protected, and the Government has done so.  How much time have I?</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report.  I note that the last occasion of these statements was 14 May and events have deferred the matter a couple of times.</p><p>  I was Chairman of the then Joint Committee Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture and I note that two of my colleagues, Deputies Martin Ferris and Pringle, are here with me in the Chamber this evening.  The reason we set about producing the report in the first place was that there was much in the media dating back over a number of years about the way the resources were being allegedly abused and taken from the public good in the west.  It made producing such a report a timely matter for us.  We felt it was important to establish the facts, separate fact from fiction and dispel some myths.  At the time there were constant references to the estimated amount of oil and gas reserves in Irish territory, usually quantified in billions of euro, but it had not been found.  It was also stated that the Government had given it all away.</p><p>  We set about our job.  We held hearings involving several key stakeholders - those involved in oil exploration, the communities which had borne the brunt of what they felt were unfair practices and had been exploited, and other jurisdictions, in particular, Norway, the help of whose Ministry and ambassador I must acknowledge.</p><p>  First, we found that, by comparison with other countries, namely Norway and the United Kingdom, the exploration that had taken place in Ireland over the past 40 years was minuscule.  If one does not look for something, one will not find it.  We had to ask the question: what was the reason companies were not so inclined to carry out exploration in Irish waters?  If it was the case that the Government would give it all away, it would seem that was not a reason.  The main reason was that nobody had found it.  It was not seen to be viable or profitable to establish and take the risk of exploring for oil, gas and natural resources, in particular, off the Irish coast.</p><p>  We then set about identifying the key priorities and followed them with recommendations.  We based our recommendations on Article 10.1 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which states:<blockquote>All natural resources, including the air and all forms of potential energy, within the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution and all royalties and franchises within that jurisdiction belong to the State subject to all estates and interests therein for the time being lawfully vested in any person or body.</blockquote>In other words, the resources of the State are for the benefit of the people of the State.</p><p>  On the other hand, it is expensive to carry out exploration, especially in the challenging territories such as where the most potential seems to lie, off the west and north-west coasts of this country, and it would be folly for Ireland, even if it were flush with resources, to engage in exploration.  Rather, it was better to try to tap into the potential by way of a suitable tax regime on foot of any discoveries.  For those purposes, we set about looking at what was in place.</p><p>  We acknowledge that, in 2007, the previous Government brought in a different regime to the one that had caused so much of the grief.  Following on an Indecon report, a profit resource rent tax, PRRT, was established with a scale of taxation based on relative profitability of each field.  Basically, it added 5%, 10% and up to 15% on top of corporation tax for any company the profit ratios of which reached in excess of 1.5:1, 3:1 and 4.5:1, respectively.  We stated simply - we knew this would cause the most stir but maybe that was deliberate to get people thinking - that in between each offer of licensing rounds there should be a review carried out.  Basically, that review should examine what had happened with the previous round of exploration, discover whether any significant viable discoveries been made, and if so, what was the likelihood on the next round of more of them being found.  If it was the case that it was felt that more viable discoveries would be made, we could look at increasing the rate the Government would take on behalf of the people by way of increased profit resource rent tax.</p><p>  The figures for overall tax take of 40%, 60% and 80%, respectively, became the popular ones that were thrown out.  That is what it would amount to in very profitable fields.  I note the Minister, in his opening statement, stated that perhaps the committee was indicating that such is what we should aim towards in the event of us having a level of activity and discovery similar to that in some of our neighbours, and that is exactly what we meant.</p><p>  This report is a template.  It contains quite a good deal of statistical evidence assembled.  It states that in the event, after each round, on review it is felt that companies would be prepared to come in because the risk is decreased and the chances of viable discoveries are increased, then they should be prepared to pay more to the State.  That is fair and reasonable.  It works in other countries.</p><p>  I would make a couple of points.  First, whatever arrangements are made should be stuck to.  If somebody is fortunate enough to make a discovery under a tax regime which, if it had not been made quite so soon, might have been higher, then that is his or her good fortune.  The Ekofisk field in Norway was discovered on Christmas Eve 1967, one week before a three-year exploration licence was due to expire - that became known as the mother lode for the Norwegian oil and exploration sector from which the economy has benefited massively ever since.  We are not saying that we should adopt a Norwegian rate of tax without Norwegian levels of discovery.  We are simply saying that if and when this estimated potential becomes more realisable, we should look in each round of exploration licences at the levels of tax we are charging.</p><p>Under the current system profit resource rent tax does not become chargeable until the profit ratio is greater than 1.5:1.  The committee recommends that the profit resource rent tax should be charged on profits from the moment they are earned.  Corporation tax is not directly linked to discoveries in the field.  In other words, companies could have other activities in the country and their corporation tax would not necessarily be as high as it might be, for various reasons such as write-offs.  The committee recommends that when an exploration field becomes profitable there should be some level of tax from the moment it becomes profitable.  This is not unfair.  The profit resource rent tax is such that all of the accumulated costs are offset every year for as long as the activity take place.  The committee decided not to interfere with that.</p><p> I wish to thank and acknowledge the assistance and wholehearted co-operation of all members of the committee of all parties and none.  Our work has been very worthwhile.  We all welcome the opportunity to have our say.  I had a letter published in <i>The Irish Times</i>today to correct an article.  I am sure the Minister will be flattered that he was identified as having appointed our committee.  I am sure he will be even more flattered to know that some commentators think he had absolute influence over all the Opposition spokesmen-----</p></speech>

We are all in favour of developing the natural resources of Ireland to their full potential so that the Irish people will benefit.  I spent a year in the Department of which Deputy Rabbitte is the Minister.  I was lashed on many occasions because we were giving away all our money and our resources to outside companies when at that time there was very little exploration and it was very difficult to attract exploration companies to the country.  I was in the Department with Dermot Ahern when the Corrib field was opened.  We have seen the length of time it has taken to attempt to bring that oil ashore, but it still has not happened.  Hopefully, there will be a change which will be of benefit to the Irish people in the future.</p><p>  Any development of petroleum resources in Ireland must benefit the Irish people.  It is important that any policy development in this area balances the maximisation of State revenue with incentivising offshore oil and gas exploration.  I welcome this detailed report and I commend the committee on the time and effort expended on it.  The committee interviewed those involved in the oil exploration business and communicated with other countries where oil exploration has been successful.  The report's recommendations are to be welcomed, particularly the proposed new tax regime.  However, caution must be exercised in any desire to change taxation on exploration efforts, given the limited success of exploration in Ireland's jurisdiction since 1970.</p><p>  The Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture published a significant report on offshore oil and gas finds in Irish coastal waters with recommendations including a substantial increase in the tax take from any future licences.  The committee makes several proposals for the oil and gas exploration sector.  In particular, the report calls for a more transparent system of licensing and public consultation while also recommending regular reviews of fiscal and licensing terms.  </p><p>  People in the wider community were concerned that the Department and the oil exploration companies operated in secrecy.  It is very important, therefore, to have a more transparent system for the future so that all oil exploration opportunities are made public and fully explained to the people.  I hear all the rumours about large gas and oil finds off Tuskar, Hook Head, Carnsore Point and many areas along the south-east coast.  Much of this is probably fiction and some may be reality.  Documents recently released by exploration companies gave the opinion that we would have oil in Kilmore overnight and thousands of jobs in the south east.  We all know that this is not going to happen, and it will be a long drawn-out exploration to find a viable oil or gas field.</p><p>  The report recommends that a simple and transparent system should be implemented through a review of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Act 1960.  The first recommendation is that good basic law should underpin policy principles relating to Ireland's petroleum resources.  The report recommends that the Petroleum and Other Minerals Act 1960 be reviewed.  The report notes that a policy should be developed in such a way to maximise the take for the State and its citizens while at the same time being sensitive to the local needs in the host community.  This is a very important point as in the past, matters may not have been handled initially as they should have been, as in the case of the Corrib field.  More dialogue and discussion and less political play-acting would have been more appropriate.  We need to learn the lessons for the future and take into consideration the concerns of the local communities if exploration opportunities are developed in the future.</p><p>  The report referred to retrospective changes to fiscal and licensing terms which would risk long-term reputational damage.  It is very difficult to look at things retrospectively and it is preferable to plan for the future.  The committee recommendations include that tax revenue should be a minimum of 40% as opposed to the current corporation tax rate for exploration of 25%.  This change should take place across a sliding scale up to 80%.  The committee also noted that any future changes to the fiscal terms should be clarified before subsequent licensing rounds, to ensure certainty around the regime for the investing companies.</p><p>  The report is very detailed and comprehensive.  I am sure the Minister will take many of the suggestions on board.  The current oil and diesel prices on the world market have substantially decreased but that does not seem to be reflected in the price at the pumps.  The price has decreased a certain amount but not significantly compared to the world spot prices over recent months.  I worked in the oil business for 15 years before I came to this House.</p><p> When oil prices increase on the world market, Irish oil companies are very inclined to increase prices immediately but when they decrease, they are very slow in reducing them.  Not many oil companies are operating in Ireland and this affects the supply scale.  It is very difficult to take on the companies but there should certainly be a more significant decrease in the price of diesel and petrol at the pumps at present.  Obviously, that is not happening.</p><p> I welcome the report as it gives us an opportunity to debate.  It also gives us an opportunity to explain to the people that there is not a great influx of exploration companies seeking licences and claiming there is a great opportunity in this country.  Exploration companies have a very slow, tedious approach.  Unless exploration is viable, companies pull out very quickly.  Ultimately, if there is to be successful exploration in the country, the people ought to benefit substantially.  I ask the Minister to comment on the price of oil, petrol and diesel.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the considered response of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the report.  All of us wish for significant exploration and, ultimately, successful drilling.  If successful, we would wish for the maximum benefit for the people.  It is a question of the <i>modus operandi</i> to achieve that and the balance of factors that have to work together in that regard.</p><p>  The committee cites the benefits of exploration as an increase in tax revenue, job creation and strengthening the security of energy supply.  These benefits are very clear from significant finds in countries such as Norway.  However, in order to realise the benefits, we must find ways in which to appear attractive to potential investors and set ourselves apart from the competition.</p><p>  According to the report, Ireland is considered a high-cost and low-reward environment for oil and gas drilling companies seeking potential investment sites.  Our offshore territory is largely unexplored and, as such, our potential is not what it might be.  There has been an upsurge in exploration activity in recent times but we have not had adequate success, nor has there been an adequate amount of exploration.  I hope we will have success.</p><p>  The report recommends that the Government strive to achieve the maximum tax revenue from petroleum exploration and production without deterring petroleum investment.  That is our shared objective.  Offshore gas and oil exploration is risky and costly, and a high level of certainty surrounding viable offshore wells is needed before any private company or investor will take a risk.  PricewaterhouseCoopers has calculated that the likelihood of our making a substantial commercial discovery is comparably low, namely, one in 32 per round of exploration.  To put this into context, the proportion in the United Kingdom is one in six, and the proportion in Norway is one in seven.  It is worth citing these figures because they introduce a note of caution and prudence.  While we hope for success, we must examine the challenge ahead in the context of the statistics.  There is no avoiding realities.  We can be overly idealistic about this but the reality is somewhat different.</p><p>  I welcome the steps the Government has taken to increase the level of interest in Ireland.  With recent departmental approval for the conducting of a major 2D seismic survey of the Atlantic region, coupled with positive indications off the coast of Cork, the drilling taking place on in the D&uacute;n Chaoin field and our novel and appealing licensing opportunities, the focus of potential investors is increasingly on Ireland.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and his Department on that.  All of these steps will go a long way towards realising our oil and gas exploration potential.</p><p>  With regard to the level of drilling carried out off our shores, historically Ireland has had a low activity rate.  Our average is the drilling of one well per year, which is hardly enough.  As outlined in the report, this is one of the factors contributing to our lower-than-normal level of infrastructure and expertise in this area.  The Department has noted that hundreds of wells need to be drilled every year in order to have any chance of making substantive recoveries of oil or gas.  It is a chicken-and-egg situation; if there is no drilling, there is no success, and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is a complex and difficult challenge.</p><p>  As previously mentioned, drilling and exploration are costly.  A single offshore exploration can cost in the region of &euro;100 million.  We have spent &euro;5 billion on exploration and have generated only &euro;1.8 billion in revenue.  These are sobering figures but they are the kinds of facts that we need to take on board before we proceed.  There is no point in proceeding on fantasy.  In the past ten years, 17 wells were drilled and five discoveries were made.  None of the five is turning a profit as of today.  In light of this, we need to have practicality and common sense in our approach.</p><p>  One would like to believe our potential is exciting.  Let us hope it is.  However, it should be noted that oil and gas exploration is high-risk activity.  We need to be careful not to make rash decisions and that is why I welcome the fact that the Minister has said the private sector, rather than the Exchequer, should carry the financial risk associated with exploration.  He recommends that any future oil and gas development project be subject to a number of consent processes, each of which would be subject to detailed public consultation.  The fundamental point is that, because of the state of our national finances and the odds and risks involved, prudence dictates that the private sector should take the lead.  If we had a discretionary billion euro or two to spend, we would have to be cautious about investing it given the need for job creation.  The risk is too great to invest the family silver.  Having said that, we need to attract the private sector, although not allowing it to go after the jewels of our economy.  That is the balance that must be struck.</p><p>  Public consultation is referred to in the report.  There was inadequate public consultation in respect of the Corrib area.  This has been a considerable difficulty and we will learn from it.</p><p>  The main issue cited in the report is taxation.  Critically, the committee recommends an increased tax yield from the sector.  The committee recommends a tax increase up to 40% and applying revised profit resource rent taxes of 15%, 35% and 55%.  Those recommendations are understandable given the context.  The Minister has made a decision to have an expert study weighing up the feasibility and potential.</p><p>I support that and it will be important that the committee reports quickly to the Minister in order that he can give certainty in this area towards the end of the year.  This will ensure the environment is certain next year to encourage further drilling.</p><p> The element of the report that has excited the most interest is taxation.  The report states Norway is the world's second largest gas exporter and seventh largest oil exporter with the petroleum industry comprising 22% of GDP.  It is a distinct position.  The UK and Norway are not comparable to Ireland and, therefore, comparisons are not valid because of the level of drilling, the results to date and so on.  We should await the outcome of the Minister's expert committee's deliberations.  He will weigh up its report and I presume the House will have an input in the normal fashion.</p><p> I agree there should not be retrospective changes to licensing conditions, taxation and so on.  That cannot be the case because it would create an uncertain environment and damage further opportunities.  I also agree that consultation with communities is critical.  While I acknowledge the 2006 Act provides for that, there is room for a sensitive consultation process.</p><p> The Minister's approach is prudent in the context of where we are at and we should await the expert committee report before setting the taxation rates.  The objectives and recommendations of the joint committee's report should be accepted and I commend them to the Minister.  We all aspire to successful exploration, a successful tax return for our country and enriching our people as a consequence.  That should be the thrust of our activity.  This should be an ongoing debate in the Oireachtas and we should focus on the question continually.  Let us hope we have a major breakthrough shortly.</p></speech>

Since I entered the House, it has been one of the best efforts to get the best deal for the taxpayer and, by extension, the people.  Ireland's oil and gas resources has been a debate that has raged in this Chamber, the media and among the public for many years.  Propaganda from multinational oil and gas companies, abetted and assisted by sections of the media, convinced successive Governments to keep their noses out of Ireland's natural resources.  They have propagated the rumour that if Ireland's oil and gas tax take is kept artificially low, then oil and gas multinationals will come flooding to our shores.  A line that the oil and gas lobby spins is that the more oil and gas extracted from our waters, the more jobs they will create in Ireland.  This has proven to be false as we have witnessed in the Corrib field where workers were flown in from abroad to work on the project with little or no benefits for the local community.  The lobby also claims that the current system will allow for energy security.  However, Ireland is no more entitled to its own natural resources than any other country in the world.  The oil and gas companies have implied that Irish homes will have access to cheaper fossil fuels if the current system remains.  However, consumers will pay the international rate to fuel their homes.</p><p>  The Minister will recollect that this debate has been ongoing since the 1970s when his then party, Official Sinn F&eacute;in, latterly The Workers Party, campaigned for reform of our oil and gas policy.  The then Labour Party Minister, Justin Keating, responded by introducing legislation based on best international practice, which claimed a 50% stake in oil and gas extracted from Irish waters.  However, the years that followed saw the propagation of a myth that argued that this country needs low oil and gas taxation in order to promote exploration and develop our oil and gas industry.  Ray Burke and Bertie Ahern, as Ministers, changed our oil and gas policy to benefit the oil and gas multinationals.  Ireland's offshore oil and gas reserves have the long-term potential to be a significant source of revenue for the economy.  According to a 2006 report carried out by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, there are approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent off our west coast, comprising 6.5 billion barrels of oil and 20 trillion cu. ft. of gas.  At current oil prices, this equates to a value of approximately &euro;540 billion.  While the volume of oil and gas brought ashore has been small, those reserves exist.  Little gas and no oil is being extracted from Irish waters, but this does not reflect the potential the State's reserves hold.  Surely it would be of greater benefit to leave the oil and gas reserves in the ground than to extract them with no benefit to the people.</p><p>  Oil and gas technology is constantly improving.  What might not be seen as commercially viable today may become increasingly valuable as we reach peak oil consumption.  Under the 1992 and 2007 licensing terms, a 25% tax on the net profits of oil and gas is applicable.  However, oil and gas companies can write off 100% of costs against tax, including costs incurred up to 25 years before field production begins and including the cost of any unsuccessful wells the company has drilled in Irish waters during that period.  Under the 2007 licensing terms, a profit resource rent tax , PRRT, was introduced.  PRRT is payable on a profit ratio calculated by the cumulative after tax profits on the specific field divided by the cumulative level of capital investment on the specific field.  Oil and gas companies may be subject to pay PRRT on after tax profits of between 5% and 15%.  This means an oil and gas company may pay up 40% tax on its profits.  However, only the largest oil and gas explorations pay the higher tax and small and medium size fields would pay little or no PRRT.</p><p>  Compared with international standards, Ireland licensing terms are extremely generous to oil and gas companies.  A report carried out in 2007 by the US Government Accountability Office studied the licensing terms of 142 fiscal systems.  The report found that Ireland has the second lowest tax take of all countries studied.  In the US, the minimum government take is 42% while in Norway the government take amounts to 75%.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the recommendations outlined in this report.  This report received that backing of all parties represented on the committee and it provides a sensible and progressive roadmap about how we should go about managing our natural resources.</p><p>  Much is made of the low strike rate, which Deputy O'Reilly stated is one in 16.  Much of the exploration work carried out in the 1970s and 1980s was based on geology reports for future drilling exercises.  Oil drilling took place in the Porcupine Basin up to 180 miles off the coast of Ireland, but it was difficult because of the terrain, the depth of water, the exposure to the wild Atlantic and so on.  Many of the holes that were drilled were capped after carrying out the geology reports.  It is ironic that the oil companies are returning to them now.  I suspect that they are doing so because they know there is potential.  I worked on a rig between 1978 and 1981 and there was what was believed to be a significant strike because of the time it took to burn off gas.  That was in the low Porcupine and the oil companies have returned there.  They project 20 to 30 years ahead during their exploration work.  They look at how technology has advanced and continues to advance and the prospects that offers down the road.</p><p>For that reason, much of the exploration undertaken during that period was undertaken primarily by looking ahead.  Those involved looked at the terrain, the depth of water, weather conditions, the difficulties in getting something ashore and so forth.  </p><p> A number of wells are being drilled.  The Minister probably receives a regular uptake, but what I hear is that people are quite excited about the potential of a reasonable strike some time this year.  If that happens, it could change the whole ball cart in regard to future exploration.  They are drilling in places that were capped almost 30 years ago.  In our deliberations during preparations for this report we invited the Norwegian ambassador and a person from the oil ministry.  It is ironic that a hole dug by Norway some 25 years ago happened to be the site of its biggest strike last year.  I do not know to what depth they drilled, perhaps 40, 50 or 60 ft deeper, but they hit the spot.  They have very good indications from the geology reports and what shows up on satellite images.  The rock formation runs for a couple of hundred miles west of Norway down the North Sea to off the west coast of Ireland.  I am very hopeful and confident, therefore, that oil is present.  It is a matter of having a plan in place to extract the greatest benefit for the people of this country.  If that happens, given the report produced by the committee on which I had the privilege to serve, it will give a great road map showing the way ahead.  Whatever about this year, the Government should pursue the same course to get the best deal for the people.</p></speech>

That is a very important article and the report was produced in looking to that element of the Constitution.  In Ireland, while companies are awarded licences for petroleum exploration and production, the State owns the natural resources.  As such, these should be protected and developed for the benefit of all citizens.  Having deliberated on various aspects of petroleum exploration and production, the joint committee proposed many recommendations, to which I hope the Minister will be amenable.  He got a history lesson a few minutes ago from Deputy Martin Ferris about where he was, about wearing different clothes and about what happened at different times in his past.  He slagged me one night on a programme about jumping ship, but the Minister has been on many ships.  He is now in charge of the ship of State in this very important area.  It is very important that our natural resources be protected and it is up to the Minister, his advisers and people in the Department to ensure meaningful laws are laid down in regard to taxation policies.  We should certainly not hunt away any potential investor but should be reasonable, ensure fair play, full transparency and have a fully exposed policy that people can follow.  </p><p>  It was only in 2007, after the Indecon report, that the Government made any effort to seek redress on profit ratios.  That report stated a more forensic investigation should be carried out between each find and a licence being issued.  The report the committee produced went down the same road.  The committee looked at many aspects, brought in and engaged with as wide a group as possible from the industry.  Developing petroleum resources for the benefit of the people as a whole should form the basis of petroleum exploration policy in Ireland.  That was one basic and obvious point - &quot;To achieve this we must balance the need and maximise State revenue by incentivising offshore oil and gas exploration&quot;.  It must be rewarding and there must be an incentive for companies to come.  It is a very high risk job, given the elements, although perhaps less so now because of the technology available.</p><p>  We refer to what has been ongoing in County Mayo in recent years.  Although I hold no brief for any oil company, I certainly hold no brief for some of the headbangers who have gone there to protest.  They are serial objectors.  Some of my colleagues in my constituency have been there.  These serial objectors have never created one job in their lives and would not know how to because they would not know the first thing about it.  They merely object for the sake of objecting.  I was speaking recently to some members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who had been there.  They spoke about the tactics these protesters use and the efforts they make to get into places from where garda&iacute; have to remove them.  I certainly do not say garda&iacute; should work for any company from outside the State, but they must keep the peace at all times.  There are devious and sinister efforts made to inflict damage and be a nuisance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Politicians from this House and my constituency who have aided and abetted these efforts have a serious issue to examine with their consciences.  When did they ever create one job, or do anything of the kind?  We must have balance and responsibility in what we do.  </p><p>  For that reason, the committee was very open-minded and recognised the changes in the field of offshore exploration and the huge advances in technology.  These advances facilitate exploration, greatly improve the drilling success rate and result in better geological data.  There is a need to ensure transparency.  Simplicity in must be kept to the forefront in legislation, licensing and forward planning.  It is not easy to draft legislation and keep abreast of modern changes and challenges.  As I remarked in another debate, there is something seriously wrong when we bring forward a Bill in 2012 and have to introduce several amendments to it by mid-2013.  That must leave questions for those who draft legislation concerning their practical and legal knowledge and experience.  Are we getting value for money in the legal advice we receive?  This goes as far as the Attorney General in that people are finding out that advice from the Attorney General can be questioned.  It is only right that it can be questioned - the people concerned are not infallible and we do not expect them to be.  However, we do expect them to be able to proof-read documents and make them fit for purpose.</p><p>  There are a number of recommendations, but the main one is that the State explore and consider ways of controlling production volumes as part of its resource management.  That is a fundamental issue - managing our own resources for the people.  That is why I was glad recently when we did not decide to sell off our valuable resource that is Coillte, a decision in which the Minister played a part.  Norway, for example, uses production permits to have a flat production rate in order to ensure as much as possible is produced from a field.  The joint committee recommends that consideration be given to prohibiting the flaring of gas.  It also recommends that there be a clear and comprehensive approach taken to public consultation, beginning with the first substantive stage in offshore oil and gas exploration, when the plan of development is drawn up, setting out the basis for the project, the reasons behind the selection of the appropriate development option and a comprehensive and technical outline of the project and how it will operate.  Even now we see this happening in the case of wind farms and wind energy production.  Big companies come here without having much of an interest in the community.  They do not bring the community with them because they do not invite people to make submissions and are not prepared to support the community in order that it has something to gain from the development. </p><p>  The joint committee also recommended that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources draw up a strategic policy document for petroleum exploration.  This could dovetail with or feed into, where appropriate, other strategic policy documents and consultations such as a public consultation process on our ocean wealth.</p><p>As I said, I believe very strongly that Ireland's potential for petroleum must be explored and we must have a fair bang for our buck.  We must have incentives to entice people in but when we get them in we must not throw the kitchen sink and everything else at them and have every kind of silly objector in the place arriving to stop them exploring the field for the benefit of their own companies but above all for the benefit of our nation and people.  We must never lose sight of the community interests.  While it is a key question for policy-makers at the national level to consider whether the State is maximising its take without unduly deterring industry, there are also many important issues to consider at community level.  These include the vital issues of how best to ensure community consultation and consent which can be considered to be independent by all those concerned.  When a resource is found there should be a system in place to ensure agreement on how it is developed in such a way that it maximises the take for the State and its citizens at the same time as being sensitive to the local needs of its host community.  It is very important to state that point and that the Department would have it as part of its policy and never lose sight of it.  We saw what happened with the banks and how a small number of people in the banks, some politicians, regulators and others brought this country to ruin yet nobody has been called to account.  That is why people are so angry.</p><p> We must have sensible policies, ones that are sensitive to community needs.  I believe also that there must be a community gain from resources.  People do not know what kind of resources are underneath places where they live or work or out at sea but if some are found and the people have to put up with some disruption there should be some gain for the community, the taxpayer, the public and the economy.  I appeal to the Minister, now that he is in the driving seat, to consider this and remember the different parties he has come from in his political career and the outlook, views and beliefs they held, to ensure that there is balance and careful consideration of a strategy to develop our natural resources, many of which I hope are not yet discovered.  He needs also to ensure that the Government treats the taxpayer and the community fairly and gives them their just reward.</p></speech>

In particular I thank the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, Deputy Andrew Doyle.  The report has generated a healthy and robust debate on Ireland's offshore oil and gas exploration experience and potential.</p><p>  The Government has a very clear strategy in this matter.  The former Chairman of the committee, Deputy Doyle, expressed it well, that is, to seek to maximise the benefits to the people of Ireland from its indigenous natural resources.  Perspectives and prescriptions for the fiscal terms appropriate to Ireland's offshore must be grounded in the reality of our perceived prospectivity and global competition for exploration investment.  In over 40 years of exploration there have been four commercial natural gas discoveries, Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads and the Corrib gas field off north Mayo.</p><p>  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil off Ireland.  In 2011 alone the Norwegian authorities approved 11 new oil and gas production facilities.  The United Kingdom has in excess of 300 producing fields.  The employment, economic and fiscal dividend from oil and gas that is enjoyed by Norway and the UK, so often contrasted with Ireland, are the product of nearly 60 years of oil and gas production based on proven prospectivity.</p><p>  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland's offshore basins.  There has been a modest but welcome increase, as Deputy Ferris said, in the level of interest in oil and gas exploration off our coast in recent years, yet the fact remains that the Irish offshore is relatively under-explored and its petroleum potential is largely unproven, particularly when compared with other petroleum regions such as Norway and the United Kingdom.  It is comparing apples with oranges.  Deputy Ferris remarked that he detects a certain excitement around at the moment.  It certainly is true that more of the licences from the last licence round have been converted than in recent years which is likely to see more offshore activity than we have seen for many years.  We will know before the end of summer about the status of the particular reference that Deputy Ferris made to D&uacute;n Chaoin.  The point is that the drilling of that well will cost &euro;200 million.  Although some colleagues on the opposite side made the argument, I do not think that anybody seriously thinks that the State has &euro;200 million to risk on the drilling of a well.  If that well, as Deputy Doyle said, strikes gold that will be fantastic but if it does not that would highlight the risk that we expect the private sector to take.</p><p>  Ireland's focus needs to be on how to encourage an increase in the level of exploration investment and exploration drilling.  Given that the cost of a single exploration well in the Atlantic is likely to be well in excess of &euro;100 million, it is crucial that we provide the right environment to encourage industry to take the not so insignificant financial risk associated with investing in the exploration of Irish waters.  I am optimistic that we can create such an environment by deepening knowledge of our offshore petroleum potential, through supporting data acquisition and research, actively promoting the Irish offshore, in particular to companies not currently active here, offering attractive and innovative licensing opportunities and providing a fit-for-purpose, transparent and robust regulatory regime, in respect of the specific contributions made. Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v hypothesised that if we find a big enough oil or gas field that companies will happily pay a tax rate of 80% but there is a disconnect in this analysis.  In my view the key question to be posed is whether or not a company, knowing that it would pay a tax rate of up to 80%, would risk a significant amount of money in an under-explored area whose petroleum potential is largely unproven.</p><p>  Deputy Colreavy stated that companies that make discoveries in Irish waters are not obliged to land the oil or gas in Ireland, and that Irish consumers would still continue to pay international market prices.  The reality is that neither the UK nor Norway places such obligations on finds made within their jurisdictions.  Both Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Colreavy referred to the need for consultation with communities impacted by an oil or gas development.  I fully accord with the principle that early consultation is important.</p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett stated that the current regime results in minimal jobs or investment accruing to Ireland.  In response I point out that of the &euro;3 billion invested by Shell to date on the Corrib field, over &euro;1 billion has been spent on goods and services in Ireland.  The Deputy also raised his concerns regarding the ability of companies to write off costs against tax, thus reducing the tax take from the headline rates of 25% to 40%.  It is estimated that &euro;3 billion has been spent in exploring the Irish offshore to date.  A significant portion of such expenditure is no longer available for write-off against future taxes as the companies who incurred the expenditure have surrendered their licences and are no longer exploring in Ireland.</p><p>  A fundamental point made by the committee relates to the need for stability and certainty as regards licensing terms.  The nature of the oil and gas exploration business requires the taking of a long-term view.  We have to recognise that Ireland is competing with countries such as Norway and the UK and we cannot set our tax terms in isolation or we risk discouraging potential investment.  Ireland's tax terms for oil and gas production need to focus on attracting new investment.  I said at the outset of this debate - one that I anticipated would run for longer in the House given the amount of noise made - that I will bring in independent experts to review whether the fiscal regime is fit for purpose so that before the next round is announced the industry will have certainty.  I welcome the fact that all colleagues made plain that any messing around to make any changes retroactive would only generate uncertainty in the industry.  I welcome that commitment, which is also stated in the committee's formal report.</p><p>  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, Deputy Andrew Doyle in particular because Deputies and Senators invested considerable time and effort in producing, what I regard as a key contribution to the public debate on how we can manage our indigenous oil and gas resources, in order to produce the best return for the Irish people.</p></speech>
